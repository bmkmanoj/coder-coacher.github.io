initial look at layers in Photoshop now
you'll notice that when you first add
your image you get this background layer
so you'll notice that that's the very
first thing you get you also notice that
you get this little thumbnail that's
inside of it so every layer will have
some sort of thumbnail in it now I also
want you to notice that initially your
first layer is always partially locked
and if you hover over that that's what
it'll say and that's because they really
don't want you to destroy the integrity
of your first layer because after all if
you destroy that or somehow ruin it you
won't have anything to go back to so the
first thing you want to do is
right-click on this background layer and
duplicate the layer and you can call it
whatever you want in this case we'll
just call it background copy which of
course is the default so hit OK to that
and you'll notice now we have an exact
duplicate of our background layer so
that means we'll never actually touch
this layer now you'll notice when we
duplicated that layer take a look it's
not locked so you can basically do
anything you want to this layer and if
we flip back and forth between the
layers take a look at how these are
grayed out that's what happens when your
layer is locked now if we click on the
duplicated layer we have all the options
available since as I said it is not in a
locked state now let's say you made some
changes to this layer and you were
pleased with the changes you made and
you wanted to protect it well you can go
ahead and lock it so you just hit this
lock button right here and you'll notice
now it's locked now watch what happens
when we try to alter this layer you'll
see that we could not because the layer
is locked so that's what it means when
you lock a layer now if you want to
unlock it you can just hover over the
lock icon again and click it and then
everything is back to normal now there
are many ways to add layers you just saw
one where we duplicated the layer but
you can also add them in many different
ways in the previous video we added an
adjustment layer and that's one way to
add it another way to add it is to
simply use certain tools over here so
let's go ahead and put some text down
here as soon as we did that we actually
got a text layer did you notice that it
created it for us so that's one way you
can add a layer by using some of the
tools over here it'll simply add it for
you so let's go ahead and type in some
text and actually let's increase the
size of this to 60 and let's actually
make this
and over here so it stands out and let's
just type in tests there we go and let's
actually go ahead and just drag it up
here
there we go now let's go ahead and
duplicate this and we'll just call this
test copy and let's go ahead and change
the text of this to white there we go
so now we've got two texts players now
what I want to show you is this little
eye over here is a visibility option and
this is very useful let's say that you
want to see how one layer looks without
having to look at the other layer so for
instance let's say we don't want to see
this white text anymore we can simply
deselect that and look now all we see is
the red text so this is very useful
especially let's say you want to have a
couple different designs and you want to
compare them you can actually flip
between them using the visibility option
so this is very very useful in terms of
layers now one thing I want you to
notice right away is notice we only have
a text icon in here that's because this
is what you call a transparent layer in
other words the difference between this
background copy and this text layer we
added is it think of this is more of a
thin transparent sheet that's on top of
our background copy in other words when
we duplicated this first background
layer we made an exact duplicate so all
the pixels were copied but this text
layer is more of a standalone add-on
that does not in any way affect our
original image essentially think of them
as transparent sheets that are stacked
on top of each other so that's an
important thing to note and if you think
about it since this background copy is
an exact copy of the original background
we had we actually can't see this
original background even though it's
technically there because this
background copy is an exact duplicate so
all the transparent layers that we add
onto this will work against this
background copy we actually technically
can't see this original background layer
that we added so that's a really good
way to think of layers that you add on
to your image these are like transparent
sheets that are stacked on top of each
other and they go in a top-down order
now you can move these around if you
want take a look at that we can move
these layers around if you want to do
that but what you can't do is move it
below the original layer see how it
prevents us from doing that now as I
mentioned before there are many
different ways to add layers we
duplicated a layer over here
we actually dragged in a text layer over
here and as you know we can add them up
here as well so let's go ahead and add a
layer let's go down to a new adjustment
layer and as you know in a previous
lecture we added a levels layer but
let's go ahead and add a black and white
layer and watch what happens when we do
that so let's hit OK and take a look at
that
see our photo now is in black and white
let's say you wanted to see the original
image well again you can use this
visibility option we can just turn that
right on and off like that see that and
take a look at the thumbnail here it's
blank that is because this is an
adjustment layer and an adjustment layer
is a special kind of Photoshop layer
they do not actually have content of
their own again the actual content is
the original photograph that we have in
these two layers so if you think of it
this adjustment layer is not the
original image the original image are in
these two layers but that's what this
adjustment layer allows us to do it
allows us to change the color if we want
in this case we're making it black and
white but you can do many other things
you can change the contrast change the
color put in filters all kinds of things
you can do but the key here is you're
not affecting the original image that's
why this is a very very important tool
in Photoshop and this is where the real
power of layers is let's say you just
wanted to make some adjustments to this
black and white layer but you didn't
want to touch the text well that's the
power of layers you could just make
adjustments to this black and white
layer without affecting anything else in
the image and again you can add as many
different layers as you want so let's go
ahead and add a new adjustment layer and
let's do a photo filter and we'll hit OK
to this and we added a little orange
tint to that see that so again you could
flip around these different layers and
make the adjustments accordingly to that
specific layer without affecting the
rest of the photograph so that is the
power of layers it is very very powerful
and it's what really sets Photoshop
apart from its competitors ok we'll
continue on with layers in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
