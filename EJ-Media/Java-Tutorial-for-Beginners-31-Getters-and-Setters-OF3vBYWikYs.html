beginning Java today we're going to look
at getters and setters and these are
very very important in the world of Java
and not just Java but pretty much any
programming language that you want to
learn what getters and setters do is
they basically encapsulate your data
specifically you want to encapsulate
your variables from the outside world
and basically what that means is you
will determine the values that people
use to set your variables with so think
of it like an invisible shield around
this variable and basically you're
saying you will use this value and this
value only and that's all I will allow
you to use value or values or if you
want to establish a range and I will
show you that now you might be asking
yourself well wait a minute I already
know what the value I want for this is
well imagine that you have hundreds of
objects hundreds of methods all over the
place and many of them are calling this
orc object that we're going to create
well you have to assume that some
developers may not know the values that
should be used with this if they use a
bad value you could start crashing other
objects and worse yet you know crash the
entire program so that's why it's
important that you encapsulate your
variables so we encapsulate this
variable and I'll show you how that's
done and right now we've set the
visibility option right remember the
public private protected we've made this
public so this is available to anybody
anybody can come in here and change this
variable directly right they could come
in here and let's create our orc object
here and we'll just say this is orc one
and as you can see they can see the
height variable so this imagine this is
a main map it has all this code it fires
up the world and in this world we're
going to add orcs and we want the height
of this orc to be less than 10 feet it
can't be any greater and the reason is
let's assume we have some caves in this
world and the roof of this cave let's
say is you know as 10 feet tall well
that's the case and we make an orc
that's 20 feet tall well he's not going
to be able to get into that cave and
worse yet we might crash or bring down
the whole world so that's the case our
orcs have to be shorter than 10 feet so
let's go over here and of course we
could call the orc variable directly you
know and set that if we wanted to -
whatever we want to but we're just going
to use the method that we set up
so we'll do you know our famous system
dot out dot print and we will pass in
the
the value that we want to set the height
to so let's go work one dot and we'll
use our method get height and we will
say that orc is nine feet well that's
good everything's going to work out
let's go ahead and run this and we got
nine feet and everything's great and of
course the value was passed in here and
if you remember from the previous
tutorials we go ahead and we switch the
scope here so it's not the local
variable we're using this class level
variable and we set it to nine here and
we returned it right here and it was
printed out over here and everything's
hunky-dory because we have all these
orcs running around and they're at nine
feet tall and run around the world's
just great well later on a new
programmer comes along and decides to
you know add an expansion pack expansion
Java so you know he creates an expansion
object to handle all that and he's going
to decide to add orcs too so he's going
to go ahead and create his new expansion
pack and so he comes along and creates
his new orc
for the expansion pack and everything's
defined and everything's fine and then
he decides to go ahead and add a height
of 15 and let's just assume that that
orc tried to go into one of the caves
and lo and behold everything came down
because he passed a bad value now keep
in mind we didn't stop it over here
right it went through nothing stopped us
from running but let's just assume
through our fictitious code that his
expansion map was crashed ours was okay
because you know what our orcs were fine
they were running around at nine feet
tall but his orcs were 15 feet tall and
that crashed everything so we come along
and say hey you know Evers this
developer's name is larry you have to
keep your orcs at nine and then you say
you know what I've got to walk some
stuff down now so let's let's do that
and you might come along and say okay
let's set this visibility option here to
private and that's good now because you
know he can't come along here now and
set the variable directly he'll have to
go through the method notice we can't
see the variable anymore that's good so
that's gone it's only available in the
class that's fine
but the problem is you'll notice he can
still go through the method right and
that is the main problem here he could
still go ahead and set this so this is
where getters and setters come into play
so we could force him to go through some
methods that will basically enforce the
fact that he has to have his orcs height
lower than ten feet and so we have to
actually set up two methods to
accomplish that we need a set and then
it get we've already got to get but
we're going to actually pull some stuff
out here because all this is going to do
now is return the height so first thing
we'll do is actually set up another
method here and we'll say public void
now we're going to use the void keyword
here because we're not going to return
anything all this is going to do this
method we're setting up here is set the
height it's not going to return it we're
going to actually keep this get height
method and this one will actually return
the value that we set in here so we're
going to call this set height and then
what we're going to do is actually just
pull this now and put it up here in our
set because we want to we're going to
use this one to actually set the value
and we're going to go ahead and make
this height and we're going to set up a
placeholder in here remember this is
just a placeholder so that when the
value comes in here it'll get passed to
here so we're going to call this height
and again we're using the this keyword
because we want to work against the
class level variable not the local
variable we want the class level
variable that's the variable that we're
going to set the value to the height to
and so this is pretty good right or do
we're moving along here and since our
get method is just returning something
we no longer need to pass that in right
from the calling method the method that
we're going to call over here we're not
calling this one remember we are now
going to issue our call from over here
to the set method and then he will set
the value here and then the get one will
just return it so we're going to go
ahead and get rid of this parameter and
we're moving along right we've got our
two methods remember getting set always
two methods two methods and that's what
we need and then what we're going to do
is actually kick out a nice little
message here to say hey you met the
criteria so let's go back over here and
actually this should have been an orc -
we were working against this object but
it doesn't really matter you get the
this was using the wrong value here and
so let's go ahead and get rid of these
methods now and we're just going to go
ahead and call our set method now right
we can't even see the variable again so
we're going to call our set method and
this developer again is doing it right
again he's going to go ahead and set it
to nine feet and let's just go ahead and
copy and paste this over here to save
time but this other developer doesn't
learn his lesson and goes ahead and sets
his orc again to fifteen feet well we're
going to stop and write with our set
method and we have to switch this to two
and actually let's go ahead and do a
return of the height as well so we'll do
a system dot out dot print and we'll say
ork
one dot and we'll call our get height
method to print out the actual height
and we'll do the same down here and
we're going to go ahead and run this and
this guy right here is going to get
stopped let's hope and we run it and he
did not get stopped Wow it met the
criteria and he was allowed to go ahead
and create his 15-foot or well let's go
back and see what happened here and what
happened is yes we went ahead and did
our set height method but what do we
really do here we let the value come in
here and we just went ahead and assigned
the value to up here we didn't stop him
right this is where we need a if-else
conditional statement where we put a
condition in there that gives the range
of feet that you can assign to this
value to the height of the orc so let's
go ahead and do that we need to say if
and you'll recognize this from the
previous tutorials when we did our if
conditional statements and we're going
to say height less than ten pretty
simple right you have to be less than
ten feet and then let's go ahead and put
in our else down here and we'll put in a
bracket actually we need a bracket up
here too and then this is what we're
going to break to if somebody puts in
the wrong height and we're just going to
do a system out here and say please
enter
a height under 10 feet there we go and
we a closing bracket here and a nother
closing bracket right here I believe and
we're good to go
so let's go over to our main map and
let's go ahead and run this again and
you'll notice that this orc met the
criteria and he was allowed to be
assigned 9 feet and you'll notice here
we got our else it broke to the else and
said hey please enter a height under 10
feet and nothing gets assigned that
actually is a null and let's go take a
look at this so what happened is on the
first one the value was passed in here
and then it hit this conditional the
height was under 10 feet right and this
is hey assign the value of 9 to here and
we're going to kick out a message that
says your orc met the criteria and thus
we got the output right here and so what
happened to this one is if we go back
over here it came into here and it did
not match this so and basically it just
stops right here breaks to this else and
it printed out this it says please enter
a height under 10 feet and then of
course it returned zero now why did it
return zero because think about it this
is where we're doing the assignment
right here but since this condition was
not matched there is no value assigned
and if you remember in previous
tutorials I said when a variable gets
initialized and there's no value to it
it'll be initialized to null or zero so
nothing got assigned to it and therefore
that's why this system dot out print
shows zero so if we go back here and
actually let's go back here and correct
this and let's make him eight feet tall
now and we will run this and everything
is fine so the main point I want to make
here is that now everything has to
funnel through this set height method he
is kind of like the gate keeper
everything has to come through here and
it has to match and if it doesn't then
you will be forced to correct it and if
you don't correct it you're not going to
have any orcs and the nice thing about
this is if people go ahead and start
creating all these different maps all
these different worlds whatever and they
decide to go ahead and create orcs you
never really have to worry about them
passing bad values into here again right
because you don't have to
change anything from this point on it
all funnels through here and so that's
what getters and setters do they
encapsulate your variables and prevent
people from assigning bad values to them
and I might also point out it might
protect you from you yes you you may
have this huge program and you know you
might be adding some code years later
perhaps maybe you're adding some new
functionality many years later and you
forget what the values that needed to be
assigned to this work and so this will
help you also kind of remember that hey
you know I can't make it work that's
over ten feet so it also helps you too
as well so that's why it's always
important to encapsulate your data now
if this doesn't really affect anything
the value if it's really a value that
you determine it's not really going to
affect the runtime of your program and
people can set it to whatever they want
to then you don't have to encapsulate it
so just keep that in mind too you don't
have to encapsulate everything just
values that might cause problems down
the line so that's the way you want to
think about getters and setters okay I
will see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
