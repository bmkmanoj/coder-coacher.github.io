break from coding and we're going to
talk about source control and actually
this topic came up from a subscriber
that emailed me and asked me how exactly
I keep track of all of the versions or
ongoing versions of my website so I will
show you exactly how I do it in this
video now the first thing I do is create
a folder that has the name of my website
so in this case it is called history
then that's the one we've been working
on and then what I do is I create two
folders inside of that one folder I call
archive and then the other folder is
called current and that is the current
website that I have let's just rename
this to current and that is the current
code that we have so two folders one
archive and one that is called website
current and then what I do is I will
take a copy of my current website and
put it in the archive and usually I will
call this initial because this is the
initial cut so then I will we will name
it that and so then you have a backup of
your initial code now what I do is let's
say I come in here and I'm not going to
do this but let's say I came in here and
let's open up our web page and let's say
I created a new content section I added
a third content section here so what I
would do is I would take another copy of
this I would come in here and then I
would paste it in here
I would rename this and then here I will
actually put in what I did so I will say
added a third content paint and actually
I'll keep this let's keep this sorted by
date and so what this does is if let's
say you find out like three weeks later
that you had some bad code in here you
can go back to your initial web code
look at it and do a comparison to see
where you went wrong so anytime you make
a major change you want to make a copy
of that code and copy it in here so you
have a running list of exactly what
you've done so then let's say we came
back at our current
and we added another sidebar a third
sidebar then I would take yet another
copy of this after of course the changes
were made in here and I would go in here
I would paste this back in and then
we'll say something like added a third
side panel and so again this is very
useful if you want a running history of
all of your source code and again by
just copy and pasting the folder you'll
have all of your files in that folder so
that'll be all of your images all of
your CSS stylesheets
of course your webpages and any other
code perhaps JavaScript code a whole
litany of other items so again that is
how I do it and I recommend that you do
that as well to any websites that you
develop so that you can go back and look
at your code and see how you did it in a
different version of your website you
may also want to number these some
people do that so you may want to call
this one like 1.0 this 2.0 3.0 some
people do it that way but I actually
like to put in the subject of the folder
exactly what I did so that way I can
browse around these pretty fast okay
that's going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
