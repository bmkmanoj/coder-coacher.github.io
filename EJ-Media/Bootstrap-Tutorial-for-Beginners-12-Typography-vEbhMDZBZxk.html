grid for a little bit and we're gonna
take a look at topography in bootstrap
now one of the things that bootstrap
does very nicely it will automatically
select fonts and font sizes for you
depending on the device type that is
being used to browse your web page so
that is very nice so this is the default
format that bootstrap uses and in this
case this is for the Chrome browser and
you can see here it looks like we've got
helvetica fonts and it does a very nice
job now I have the same exact page
without bootstrap and I want you to take
a look at the difference take a look at
that that doesn't look nearly as nice
does it it's using the old New Times
Roman and so as you can see bootstrap
automatically does a lot of the work for
you in terms of the fonts and the sizes
of the fonts and you can see here the h1
heading is automatically in bold and
bootstrap uses the font size of 36
pixels for the h1 heading for the h2 the
default is 30 pixels and for the h3 the
default is 24 pixels now even though
bootstrap handles a lot of the
typography for you there are some things
you'll want to know so let's go ahead
and close this out and let's take a look
at some of the things you can do with
typography in bootstrap now one of the
nice things that bootstrap allows you to
do is to create a sub heading off your
main heading and you use that with the
small text so let's go ahead and do that
and I'll just copy and paste it right
here because I already have it in my
clipboard so there you can see we use
the small tag and we close it out with
the small tag and this will create a
nice little subheading so let's go ahead
and save this and let's open this up in
chrome and see what we get and there you
can see look we have this nice little
subheading now that you can use and you
can see the text is a little bit lighter
and it's a little bit smaller now you
can also hide headings if you need to so
let's go ahead and hide it heading so
let's go here and we'll just copy and
paste this and let's just call this h3
hide heading so what we do is we go here
and we're gonna call another bootstrap
class and as you've seen throughout this
series a lot of this is just calling the
correct bootstrap class that you want to
use and in this case we want to use the
text hide class
all right so now hopefully this will be
hidden so let's go ahead and save this
let's go ahead and run this and there
you can see it's now hid now you'll
notice that the space is still there but
the heading itself has disappeared so
that's how the text hide class works now
what if you wanted your text to really
stand out you can do that with the lead
class so let's go ahead and we'll create
a class here and again you call the lead
class so let's go ahead and save this
and let's see what we get and there you
can see this is all in bold now and the
size of the font is also increased now
you can also use this span element with
the lead class so let's say we wanted to
make these first three words here stand
out we can use the span element again
with the lead class so let's go ahead
and do that so as you probably know by
now we use these fan tech and then we
can just go up here and copy and paste
the lead class and we'll just copy and
paste it right down here and then we'll
go ahead and close this out and we said
we would span these first three words
here so let's go ahead and close out the
span and let's save this and let's see
what we get there you can see now the
first three words in the second
paragraph stand out so that's quite
useful as well now by default of course
the text and paragraphs aligns to the
left but you can switch that up using
bootstrap so let's say we want all the
text in this to align to the center you
can use that with the text center class
so let's go ahead and do that and we
just use the text Center
class again so let's go ahead and see
what happens here and there you can see
all the text now is aligned to the
center so just a little bit different
way you can do things now you also can
turn off word wrapping using bootstrap
as well so let's say you didn't want the
sentence here to wrap you just wanted to
continue on going its merry way you can
use a bootstrap class for that as well
and the class we use is text - no rap so
let's go ahead and see what this looks
like there you can see the sentence is
no longer rap so this will just continue
going as far as it needs to so that's
what the text no rap class does now in
this paragraph of course we centered the
text but you can also align it to the
right so let's go ahead and do that and
we can just take this class right here
and we'll just copy and paste this right
down here and instead of text - Center
we're gonna use text - right and let's
see what we get there you can see the
text is now aligned to the right now I
have some other classes to show you but
you know what let's just work against
this final paragraph now you can also
capitalize all of the text in your
paragraph if you want to and for that we
use the text capitalized class so let's
see what we get here there you can see
all the text is now capitalized in terms
of the first letter of each word now you
can also make all of the characters
uppercase and let's go ahead and see
what we get and now you can see all the
characters are in uppercase and you can
make everything lowercase as well so
let's go ahead and do that and now
everything is in lowercase
now I have one more thing to show you
you can actually quickly decrease the
size of the text if you want using the
small class so let me show you that
really quickly and there you can see the
text is now smaller okay I know I packed
a lot of information in there but I hope
you found this useful
thanks as always for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
