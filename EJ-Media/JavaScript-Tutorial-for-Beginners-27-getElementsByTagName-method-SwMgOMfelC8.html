to go over the get elements by tag
method and of course in the last video
we are looking at the get element by ID
method and what did we do well we just
grab this paraone ID and then we started
manipulating the text but in this
tutorial as I said we're actually going
to grab the tag instead of the ID we are
grabbing the tag the elements tag which
in this case is the paragraph tag and
you'll notice that the method name get
elements by tag is in the plural the
elements is in the plural so we're
grabbing all of these tags so this is a
very powerful method because it allows
us to grab all the tags at once and
manipulate the text we can't do that
with the ID attribute because it is too
specific but with the get elements by
tag method we can grab all of these
paragraph element tags and for that
matter we can grab any tag we want in
our webpage so if it was a development
we could grab the body tag you can grab
any tag that you want on your web page
and manipulate it with this method now
you might ask the question well if we're
not using this unique ID anymore
how do I know which paragraph tag is
which in other words let's say you just
wanted to manipulate this second
paragraph tag right here how do we know
that well the get elements by tag method
builds a node list this is similar to a
raise you'll remember we had those
indexes 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on same
concept here this node list so the first
paragraph element has a node list index
of 0 the second one would be 1 the third
would have an index of 2 and so on and
so that's how you can specify an
individual tag and we'll actually do
that when we write some JavaScript code
which we're going to do in a few seconds
now you'll notice that this is pretty
similar to the last video in terms of
our HTML we've got a button and when we
click it we're going to change some of
this text and we're going to use the
same function which was this change
style function so let's go over to our
JavaScript code and it's empty right now
I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste
the first section in here and explain it
so of course remember always the
first thing we need to do is to grab the
element in our webpage in this case
we're going to be grabbing the paragraph
tag like I said again this means we're
grabbing all of the paragraph tags in
our webpage and keep in mind you always
put the tag you specify the tag that you
want and you surround it by quotes so
you can see right there surrounded by
quotes and again you could put a div you
could use any tag that you want so when
we grab all of those paragraph tags and
that node list is built it's all stored
in our paragraph variable now let's
switch back to our web page for a minute
let's go ahead and we're going to write
some code that will work against this
second paragraph element tag and I'll
copy and paste the code in here now and
so we're creating a new variable and
it's appropriately named change paratext
notice we are using the one that's the
index that's where this index comes into
place so we specified our variable up
here and then we just put in the index
of the tag that we want to update so if
we flip back to our web page this is
going to be 1 this would be 0 if we
wanted to update the first paragraph tag
we would put 0 there but we want to
change the second so we're going to put
in a 1 that's where that one comes into
play and then the rest of this you'll
recognize this is very similar to the
last video we're going to use the style
object and we're just going to change
the fonts to italic and so again very
similar to what we did in the last video
and you can go ahead and use some of
those other properties from the last
video that we were changing if you want
to you don't have to use italic that's
what we're just using for this video so
let's go ahead and run this now and so
we'll go ahead and run this in chrome
and if we hit submit you'll notice it
did exactly what we wanted it changed
the second paragraph elements text to
italic now let's actually change
everything to italic so let's go ahead
and do some copy and pasting here we'll
update all four paragraph element tags
and what we're going to do is we're
going to switch this to 0 we're going to
switch this to 2 and we're going to
switch this to 3 and so this will cover
all the paragraph tags in our node list
from beginning to end and so if we save
everything up and we'll go ahead and run
this and we hit our submit button all
the text in our four paragraphs are now
changed to italics and so you can see
this is a very very powerful method you
can pull all of the tags in your web
page and do mass changes now you might
ask the question well if we're changing
all four of these paragraphs to italic
why do I have to reproduce this line
four times and the answer is you don't
actually have to do it this way you can
create a loop where we only have to
write one or two lines of code and it
will loop through all of our nodes and
do a mass change so we have to create a
loop to do that and we're actually going
to do that in the next video
and so we'll create a loop in the next
video to loop through all of our
paragraph tags and make a mass change
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
