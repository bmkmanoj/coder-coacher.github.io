to style the tabs widget in the jQuery
UI now the first thing we want to do is
go ahead and open up our website folder
and let's go ahead and open up the
jQuery UI folder and then we want to
open up all of those jQuery UI CSS files
so let's open up this first one the
jQuery - you I will edit that in notepad
plus plus and then let's go ahead and
we'll open up this jQuery - UI dot
structure and then we'll go ahead and
open up the UI dot theme
CSS file there we go so we've got all
three of these files open and we need to
update each one of these but first let's
go ahead and pull up our website and the
first section of this tab widget that we
want to go ahead and work against is the
panel itself so we're gonna give this a
black background and we'll change the
color of the text as well so let's go
ahead and do that first and we want to
go to the structure dot CSS first
and actually it's go all the way to the
top here and actually we wanted to be at
the bottom sorry let's go all the way to
the bottom and you're going to find
let's see here I'm looking for it we're
looking for this class called UI - tabs
but we want the panel version of this
there it is so this is what we need
right here this one that has UI - tabs -
panel you can search for this as well up
here under this search option you can
just do a find on that if you can't find
it within the style sheet itself so this
is exactly what we want to work against
terms of the panel so let's go ahead and
we'll add a background property actually
background - color of course and we're
gonna make that black and then let's go
ahead and make the color of the text
light gray so that's what we'll make for
that alright good so let's go ahead and
save this and let's go back over to our
index.html let's launch our page and see
what we get we don't need this anymore
and there you can see what it works
let's click on some of the other
different tabs here and the panels are
all black and now the text of course is
light gray so that worked very well so
let's go ahead and close this out and
actually I was a little quick on that
let's go
and open that back up now what we want
to do is go ahead and change these
buttons the tab buttons themselves and
the first one we're going to change is
the inactive one so of course this is
the active one and these are the
inactive ones so we'll go ahead and
change the inactive ones first maybe
we'll make this green or something dark
green so let's go ahead and close this
out and we're going to go back to the
structure dot CSS file and what we need
to do is actually it's go all the way to
the top and I want you to do a search
and we're gonna search on the word
anchor I think that won't get what we
need and here we go that's what we
needed and actually that wasn't far away
from the panel we actually didn't have
to go search for that but I never seem
to remember where these things are these
files are very large but this is the
class we want right here this UI - tabs
- anchor so this will affect that button
that I just showed you so first let's go
ahead and we're going to go ahead and
change the background color and we're
going to change that to actually let's
make it white so we'll make that white
and then we're gonna change the color of
the text to dark green so we'll go ahead
and save this and let's go back and
launch our page and let's see what we
get and there you can see that looks
pretty nice right and actually I was
wrong about that it changes all of the
buttons you can see here they are all
changed now but what we want to do is go
ahead and change the tab that is
actively opened in this case ancient
Greece we want that to be a little bit
different so the user knows that they're
on the active tab so let's go ahead and
do that and we go back to the structure
dot CSS and I believe it's very close
here and it's these three classes right
here now you can see they have no rules
here that's why all of the buttons when
we just looked at the web page were
updated so we have no rules here so we
actually have to create some rules so
let's go ahead and we'll just copy and
paste this right here of course we need
those squiggly brackets and we'll just
go ahead and copy and paste those right
here and what we're gonna do here is do
the opposite of what we did with the
inactive tabs so we're gonna go ahead
and just copy and paste these two
properties right here we don't obviously
need a margin bottom or padding bottom
and we're just gonna flip them now so
the color will become dark green for the
background color and the color of the
text will be white I always like that by
the way when you have those nice little
contrast so let's go ahead and save this
now and let's go back to our index dot
HTML let's go ahead and launch this and
take a look at that now we have this
nice contrast and the user will
definitely know that they're on this
first tab and let's just make sure the
rest of these tabs work and they do so
this is working very nicely okay so the
final thing we want to do is go ahead
and work against this this background
behind the taps we want to go ahead and
work against that and let's actually
mimic this color over here so we'll put
this light green color into this panel
here sort of keep a centralized theme
and we're gonna actually work against
this main jQuery CSS file right here and
we're going to go ahead and do a search
on you I - widget - header so let's go
ahead and do that
and we come right down here and this is
exactly what we need to update now let's
go ahead and we'll change the border
color and we're going to just change
that to orange so we'll change that to
orange get rid of the 8 and then what
we're going to do is we're gonna replace
this entire property this background
property and we're gonna replace that
with the background - color property and
this is the hex value that we're going
to use and of course this is the same
background color that we used in the
sidebar so let's go ahead and save this
and let's see if it works and we'll
reload our page and it didn't work so
evidently I was in the wrong place now I
thought I knew this pretty well let's go
ahead and inspect this and that's
strange let's see this here jQuery UI
theme
actually let's close this out again I
thought I was inspecting that's not the
color and it looks like oh is it in the
widget header inside the theme dot CSS
let's let's go back to that and let's go
back to that file and let's go over here
to the theme dot CSS we'll do a search
and it looks like it's right here so
let's try this you can see how that
inspect option off Google really works
nicely so let's change this to orange
and let's just change this to red just
to see if it works
so we'll switch this to red and we'll
switch this to background - color let's
go ahead and save this now reload our
page and it worked there you go so
that's where you needed to go and again
you can see how well that inspect option
works I was in the wrong place but I
figured it out by using the inspect
option in Google Chrome now if you want
to go ahead and sync this up with this
color go ahead we'll just leave this red
for now but you can put whatever color
you want
so again that's gonna do it for this
video thanks again for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
