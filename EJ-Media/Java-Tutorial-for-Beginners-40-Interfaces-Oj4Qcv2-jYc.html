in this tutorial we're going to go over
the concept of interfaces now we're
going to tie this in with the last video
in which we talked about abstract
classes and abstract methods now you
will remember I set up a mammal
superclass and then I have these three
subclasses under it wael human and doc
and I've set up an additional superclass
called
reptile and you will remember when you
mark a method as abstract you also have
to make the class as abstract so reptile
is a superclass and the lizard class is
the subclass now this is its own little
hierarchy over here separate from the
mammal class and so the mammal and the
reptile are separate super classes with
their own hierarchies now what are
interfaces ok first let's assume that we
want to make this dog class have some
zombie characteristics so we want a
zombie dog and how are we going to do
that though because mammals really
aren't zombies so we really don't want
to put our methods in here and put
zombie characteristics in our mammal
superclass that wouldn't be right
so we have to create another superclass
of zombie but wait a minute Java doesn't
have multiple inheritance in other words
I can't extend to super classes here I
couldn't go mammal and zombie that's not
going to work you only get to inherit
off one superclass that's just the way
it works so how do we do that then ah
interfaces to the rescue ok so if we go
over here to default package and let's
make a new Java interface and we're
going to call this zombie and we'll hit
finish and we get all this we can get
rid of all this stuff actually now
you'll notice here that it's interface
is marked as interface instead of class
so you know we've seen these public
classes here before now it's a interface
so that's how you have to mark it as
such and then we will create our method
so let's go ahead and do that and we're
going to say public void and we're going
to give this and what something zombies
do they moan so let's let's give them
that and similar to abstract methods
they are just blank so it's the same
deal they're basically blank
same same
backed away we were doing our abstract
methods in our abstract class the only
difference is we don't use the abstract
keyword here now the reason is because
interfaces are by default abstract so
you don't need to put that in your
interface they are always they always
have to be implemented and I will show
you that in a minute
and then let's come up with another
things Abbie's do they work how about
that okay so we got our two methods for
our zombie interface now we want to go
over to our dog subclass now and inherit
those methods off the interface so and
so we want to go over here and type
implements zombie there we go and now
it'll tell us the dog class is not
abstract so we must implement the
methods all the methods that are in here
now I will point out one thing they did
in the last video and this also applies
to abstract classes as well if this was
marked as abstract you do not actually
have to specify the methods in here it
is only the first non-abstract class
that must implement the methods so
that's the point I'm trying to make
there and we want to go ahead and put
these in here and so let's go ahead and
do that and we will type in public void
and what was one of them work and then
we need the other and you'll still see
we need to get the other method in here
that's why we're getting the
intellisense so let's go ahead and do
that and we'll put in the moon method as
well and there the intellisense goes
away and now we've got the methods from
our zombie interface so we have our
zombie doc now we could have created
another class here called zombie dog but
I'm not going to do that to save time
and then let's go ahead and put let's
make a zombie reptile as well and then
we of course have to go ahead and get
those we'll just copy and paste these
methods out of here and we'll put these
down here and then of course the
intellisense goes away now the first
question you might have is what is the
difference between an interface then and
an abstract class well there is a
difference first we have to mark the
methods in the abstract class as
tract but you also notice that we can
put in non abstract methods you cannot
do that in a interface all of the
methods in an interface are by default
abstract so they must be blank you can't
put in regular methods and I'll show you
what happens when we try to do that you
get intellisense so can't do that that's
one of the rules so that's the
difference right there and of course
this is a hierarchy this is a super
class which has subclasses attached to
it this is not a super class it is not
really in a hierarchy it's on its own
and I'm going to show you a diagram of
this in a minute so that's the big
difference right there
now you're probably still wondering why
would we use interfaces and not just use
everything in our you know our abstract
class and there is a reason and I want
to show you that right now in this
diagram and this should really hit home
hopefully and so as you can see we have
our superclass mammal over here with its
subclasses dog human whale and here's
the superclass reptile and we have the
subclass lizard and here's the interface
and the methods that we implemented in
the dog and the lizard now take a look
at this the interface is by itself out
here we can now put this in any subclass
we want and that is the power of
interfaces they're not attached to
anything
I like to think of them almost as free
agents and so now we can implement these
in any subclass we want and of course we
can go against any inheritance hierarchy
we choose and that's really really
powerful when you start to think of that
and you know if we wanted to create
another interface with you know we could
do a space interface you can do as many
interfaces you want and you can
implement multiple interfaces in your
subclass and then you might ask well
what's the power of that well there's
also another benefit out of interfaces
let's say that I was working on this
subclass mammal over here and Tanya was
working on the superclass reptile well
she comes to me and goes by the way I
need to know how to build a zombie can
you tell me how to do that I say well
there's an interface out here go take a
look at the methods and then she will
copy those same methods and put them in
her lizard subclass and she'll be using
the same naming convention
that I will in the dog subclass so
that's important because when anybody
wants to call those objects they will
know the name of the method because
they're published in this interface and
it's also similar to a protocol if we
put 50 methods in there you are telling
that person how to build a zombie all
the attributes that go with a zombie and
then again we could add another
interface here we could do a space
interface and then make this a you know
space dog zombie and a space lizard
zombie and that is the tie-in to
polymorphism we are now building flavors
of whatever we want right we can make as
many different flavors of dog as we want
and we can make as many different
flavors as the lizard is we want with
interfaces and multiple interfaces and
that is polymorphism at its greatest in
Java and of course as I said before we
are not affecting the superclass mammal
because we don't want to put zombie
characteristics in our superclass
reptile or superclass mammal because
that would wreck the superclass that's
not what that superclass is about it has
its own mission to have characteristics
of a mammal so that is the power of
interfaces now this videos just explain
the concept of interfaces we're not
going to actually do any working code
here I just wanted you guys to get
familiar with the concept and in the
upcoming videos we'll actually be doing
coded examples of interfaces oh and one
more thing I almost forgot interfaces
are usually always associated with
methods you can however put variables in
there and those are considered final
variables but I will do another video on
that because interfaces are really used
with methods that's really the preferred
way to use interface but you can
actually use final variables and there
are some scenarios where you want to use
that and I will get to that in a future
video so I hope this helped and please
let me know if it did guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
