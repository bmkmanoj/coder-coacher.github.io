to put an image inside your text so
let's go up to file import and then
select your image and we'll move it over
here the size of this doesn't matter so
you can keep it at its original size you
can also click and drag this into
Inkscape if you want to do it that way
rather than use the import button okay
so let's go ahead and create some text
now we select the text and make it the
appropriate size that you wish to have
it at now we will risa lect the image
you want to go to object hit pattern and
then objects the pattern then you're
going to go three select the text and go
up to object hit fill and stroke and
under the fill tab you're going to hit
pattern and there you see we've got our
image inside our text now now at this
point you could be done or you could go
ahead and move the image around beneath
this text and the way you do that is
close out fill and Stroke and then go
ahead and hit the edit pass by nose
button and you'll see three nodes here
there's an X there's a node to the right
and a node to the bottom and this
corresponds to this image so if we drag
the X you'll see that you can move it
wherever you want you can resize it if
you hit this note on the right you can
skew the image up and down if you want
and if you hit this note on the bottom
this will create more images and it will
duplicate it into perhaps hundreds if
you want so that's how this works I hope
you found this useful if you did please
