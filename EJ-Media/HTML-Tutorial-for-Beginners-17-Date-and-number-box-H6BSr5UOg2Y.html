at the input element and we've looked at
the different types we've created
checkboxes submit buttons radio buttons
text boxes and there are other types and
that's what we're going to cover in this
video now there is also a date type and
a number type and we'll cover both of
these in this video now as you can see
here I've entered some text and what
we're going to do is create a page where
a user can enter the date that they want
to travel to Cancun and so what the date
type allows us to do is basically pick a
date it'll give us a box in our browser
that will allow the user to do that and
so here's the first input element and
all we do for the type is put in date
and that will give us the box that will
allow the user to pick a date and then
we can put whatever we want in here
let's just put in day now remember this
is a value we'll deal with later on in
PHP or ASP so we're not worried about
this for now we're just concerned about
this type which is date now I also put
in some text here that will specify the
number of days that they want to stay in
Cancun and you guessed it the input type
is number so we just put the number in
here and that will give us an input
field for numbers and again this
involves the PHP and ASP scripts but
let's just put in num days for a number
of days and then we're very concerned
with these two next values this will
give us a minimum number and a max
number that the user can enter into the
number box so we'll just start out with
a minimum number of one and we'll set a
maximum of ten so our travel agency will
only allow them to stay there for 10
days if they want to say they're longer
they're going to have to seek other
arrangements so again these are two
values that that you can use for the
number type so let's go ahead and save
this and let's refresh our page and
there you can see we have our date box
and we have our number box so and you
can go ahead and here and now and enter
some day so let's just use this down and
up arrow to do that and we'll first set
the month let's set it to January we'll
set the day to the third and then you
can set whatever year it is you want to
set now let's check the number box and
you'll notice that we start out with 1
when we hit the up arrow and then we go
all the way up to 10 we can't go any
farther than that now this won't prevent
us from entering in a number that we
want to even though that's not a number
that we
aloud in our HTML we would have to stop
this with JavaScript and we'll talk
about that in the JavaScript series so
the minimum and maximum values that we
set in the HTML only have to do with the
up and down arrow keys in the browser if
you click into the box itself you can
enter whatever number you want and again
we have to use JavaScript to prevent
that if we want to okay that's going to
do it for this video I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
