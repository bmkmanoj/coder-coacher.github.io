for some time I recently reached 10,000
subscribers so a big thanks goes out to
everyone for subscribing and actually I
plan to make this video just a short
time ago and already I have 700
subscribers more so now it's up to
around ten thousand seven hundred
subscribers so this channel has
experienced massive growth and so
obviously I'm doing something correct
I'm very proud of this channel I put a
lot of work into it and a lot of the
feedback I've gotten is overwhelmingly
positive and I think these are some of
the best videos out there on YouTube now
a lot of people have asked what I do
what is my occupation so I'll give you a
little tidbit about me a little bit of a
bio here I have been in the computer
industry for 20 years now since 1995 I
am at the same technology company which
is unusual a lot of people jump around
but I have remained at the same
technology company for the last 20 years
now i can't give you the name of the
company but i can tell you some tidbits
about my different career paths within
that company i first started out in
mainframe now if you're not familiar
with mainframe those are the large
computers that some of the very large
companies utilize so you'll see large
entities such as the government and
insurance companies still using
mainframes and they're not going to go
away anytime soon in fact they've had a
little bit of a resurgence because they
can handle literally millions even
billions of transactions and they do it
very very efficiently so mainframes
won't be going away anytime soon so I
was in that industry for about seven
years and then around 2000 to around 13
years ago I switched over into client
server and web-based technologies and
that was a big career move for me if I
hadn't done that I would not have a
channel here today doing videos on
client server technologies now the other
thing is I'm always interested in what
you're interested in so if you have some
topics that I haven't covered yet you
can certainly go ahead and leave a
comment in this video and I will take it
under consideration okay thank you again
