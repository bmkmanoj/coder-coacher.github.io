initial look at the each method and the
this keyword and we'll be using these
throughout the series so I just wanted
you to get an initial feel for these so
just sort of soak this in now that each
method is a jQuery method that allows
you to loop through a bunch of elements
so as you can see here I've specified
the li element which is in our second
section so we will be able to loop
through each one of these elements
that's what it does it basically
retrieves all of the elements in your
selector and in this case it's the Li
element so that's what that does and you
can see it comes with a function which
we can put some code in and that is to
do whatever it is we want to do against
those Li elements all the elements that
are retrieved by our each method which
again loops through all of the Li
elements on our page and in this case
we're going to change the li element to
Tigers and we're going to use the HTML
method to do that now you may be
wondering what is this this this keyword
you want to think of the this keyword as
the placeholder for each current element
for each loop so the first loop refers
to the first element in the jQuery
selection which of course is our li
element and then the second time through
it will refer to the second li element
which is wild cats and then the third
time through it will use the third li
element which of course is sharks and
then it will change all of them to
Tigers so think of it like a placeholder
that's all it is and again it represents
this li element but for each different
loop so the first time through again
it'll hit this Li the second time
through it'll hit this Li and then the
third time through it'll hit this Li so
all it is is a placeholder for our li
element for each time our each loop
loops through now each time you use the
each loop you almost always use the this
keyword they go hand in hand like two
peas in a pod and again since we have to
loop through repetitive times it makes
sense to use this as a placeholder for
our li element so we don't have to write
that Li element out a million times now
in reality we would likely be doing
different things
to each one of these li elements but I
wanted to keep this example simple
because I just want you to understand
the concept of what the each method does
and what the this keyword does so in
this lecture we are just going to
perform the same task so we will use the
HTML method to change all the li
elements to Tigers but later on we will
use the each method to perform a series
of different actions against each of the
elements with that said let's go ahead
and hit this now when we hit this it'll
happen really quick of course we will
get three loops and it will change this
to Tiger so let's do it and it worked so
that's how that works I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
