fixed layout and we talked about the
container in the last video and how we
set that at nine hundred and sixty eight
pixels in terms of the width now with a
fixed layout you have to be rather
precise in terms of the widths that you
set for your different sections they
have to all add up to equal 968 pixels
if you're too short or you're too long
you'll get some strange results and I'll
show you that in a few minutes so it's
pretty easy for the header if we take a
look at the header here it's 964 pixels
right in here and then we have four
pixels total of the left and right
border and that gets us nine hundred and
sixty-eight pixels so it equals the
width of the container which it should
do but it gets a little trickier when
you have sections that are side by side
so the main section right here and the
sidebar right here all have to add up to
960 pixels so let's take a look at that
so if we go down to the sidebar here
we've got 176 pixels here and so let's
put that in a calculator and again 176
pixels now the border is 2 pixels now
you'll notice I didn't put a border
right I only put a border left and that
is I wanted the borders all around the
webpage to be 2 pixels well if we added
two pixels here we would get 4 pixels
because keep in mind the main section
also has a border so I only wanted to
put a border on the bottom top and left
side and then just use the border from
the main section and so we just add two
pixels for this border on the left so
that gets us 178 now let's go down to
the main section and there you can see
the border left that I have for two
pixels and the border right also has two
pixels so two pixels for the border left
and two pixels for the border right
gives us four more pixels so let's add
that in here and now we've got 182 and
then the width of this section is 786
pixels so let's add that in and that
gets us 968 pixels so everything is very
precise and fits our container perfectly
and now let's go ahead and alter the
width of this and let's make it 790 and
you'll see what happens here
so let's make that 790 pixels will save
this get rid of the calculator if we hit
refresh ah you can see it would happen
here
the main section was thrown down here
below the sidebar and that's because
this could no longer fit in the
container both of these sections side by
side now so that's what happens if
you're not precise in your calculations
in terms of determining the width of
your sections in a fixed layout so let's
go ahead and fix that and we'll set this
back to 786 will save this will refresh
and everything's back to normal now if
we go under let's put this at 776 pixels
and we'll save this we'll hit refresh
and now you can see the main section
moves it in so this is not very pleasing
to the eye is it so that's what happens
if your wisk come in under the width of
the container so you'll get strange
results but not quite as strange is
actually going over but it still looks a
little weird so again the main point is
you just want to be precise so if we set
this back to 786 pixels we save this and
everything is back to normal okay that's
going to do it for this video in the
next video we're going to add a few
styles here they're going to be like
squares because we're going to get to
the master and content page concept and
so before we do that I actually want to
add some tiles to this section and that
will tie in nicely to the master and
content page concept I'm going to talk
about in a few videos so we'll do that
in the next video see you guys on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
