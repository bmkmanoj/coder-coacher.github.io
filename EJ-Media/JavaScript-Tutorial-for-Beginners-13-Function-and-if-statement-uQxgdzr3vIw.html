about functions if statements and loops
and in this video we're going to combine
some of those concepts so we are going
to create a function that creates an if
statement and so I've created a function
called batting and we're going to pass
in two types of parameters we're going
to pass in a player which will be the
actual name of the player so that will
be a string and we're going to pass in
an integer and that will be the distance
that the person hit the ball and then
we're going to create an if statement
that will test the distance and remember
it has to be true or false so if it's
less than or equal to 350 feet we will
print out the line that the player hit
the ball if it's longer than 350 feet
nothing will happen according to this
code so let's go ahead and call our
function and we're going to pass in the
string Steve to our player parameter and
we're going to pass in the number 349 to
our distance parameter and accordingly
this condition will test out true
because 349 of course is less than 350
and we will write this line out to the
browser so let's go ahead and save this
and let's go to our web page and run
this and we get the expected result
now what if he hits it longer than 350
feet well we want to be able to handle a
home run and so let's create an else
statement to handle that scenario and so
we'll just copy and paste that right in
here and so now if Steve hits the ball
greater than 350 feet it'll be a home
run so let's put in 351 feet he just
barely cleared the fences and let's save
this we'll run it and we get the
expected home run now you might be
asking well what if Steve hit the ball 0
feet that would mean he struck out we
need to have a condition for that and
you will remember that if we want
multiple conditions past our if
statement we need to use the else if
statement so let me copy and paste that
in here and now we can handle a
strikeout scenario and so if it's less
than or equal to 0 Steve will have
struck out and let's change this to 0
and let's save this and we'll go over
here and run this and we did not get the
expected results so let's go see what
happened well what happened here was
that the zero that was passed in hit
this first condition and of course zero
is less than 350 that's a true statement
so of course this first line would be
executed so how do we handle zero in
this first condition and the answer to
that is we need to use an and logical
operator and so we'll put that in our
first if statement and here it is this
is the end logical operator and now
we've got two conditions in here and
we're going to be able to handle this
zero now because the distance has to be
greater than zero for this entire
condition to be true and what this end
means is that both the first condition
and the second condition have to be true
in order for this statement to be
executed if one of these is false then
all bets are off and it will skip to the
else if statement and that's exactly
what's going to happen here this first
one will test out true but when it hits
the second condition this will be false
and therefore it'll exit out of this if
statement and go to the else if
statement so let's save this let's go
ahead and run this and now we get the
expected result Steve struck out so
that's going to do it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
