left off in the last video with the
innerhtml property now in the last video
of course we were writing out new text
new content in this video we want to use
inner HTML to read our content in and
then we want to add these two sentences
so I've altered our web page a little
bit here I put hit submit to combine
these words so what we want to do is
take the text from our first paragraph
at our second paragraph and then add
them up and put them in this third
paragraph that I've created for this
video and so again we're going to use
inner HTML to read the content of both
of these paragraphs and then add them up
so let's go over to our JavaScript and
I'm just going to copy and paste the
code in here and I'll explain it all so
what I've done here is I've created a
variable called first paragraph text and
that's named appropriately of course and
again same thing we're doing the last
video right we're going to go against
the node of the first paragraph and
we're using the inner HTML property now
notice what's different here we're not
assigning a value we just ended it with
a semicolon
and so we're reading the contents of the
first paragraph which is in this case is
the text and we're just assigning it to
this variable same thing for the second
node we're just reading the contents
with the inner HTML property and
assigning it to this second pair of text
and then we've created a third variable
to add these two together and of course
we're going against the third paragraph
which is identified by node number two
and so again we're adding these two up
right here and then hopefully we'll get
a complete sentence that'll say hello
there from the moon once we click on our
button so let's go ahead and run this
and let's see what happens here
and if we hit the submit button there
you see we get our new text in our third
paragraph and it added these two lines
now what if you wanted to just get rid
of these lines well we have to use any
HTML again to write out a blank
statement and we can actually do that so
let's go back to our JavaScript code and
I'll just copy and paste some new lines
in here and we're going to use inner
HTML again right but this time we're
just going to write out a blank string
so we are writing out here we're not
reading this time but we're writing out
a blank string with no text and so the
these two lines now should disappear if
this works correctly and again we just
re specify the nodes that we want to
update so let's go ahead and run this
and hopefully now we'll just have one
line which will be paragraph three so if
we hit this submit button there you see
now we have is the third paragraph which
is all we wanted it combined the first
two lines from the first two paragraphs
and gave us our third paragraph and got
rid of the first and second paragraph so
this looks a little bit more normal okay
that is going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
