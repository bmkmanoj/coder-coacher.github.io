of the attribute methods that you can
use in jQuery and the first one is just
attr which of course stands for
attribute now I've added to the code
here and IMG tag where we can put an
image but we're gonna leave it empty
because we're first gonna add the image
using our jQuery method now this is the
folder with all of our files now if
you're gonna follow along I want you to
copy two different images into this
folder because we're gonna use them in
this lesson so again we're gonna keep
this IMG tag here empty and we're gonna
add it down here so first thing we want
to do is select the IMG so we'll put
that here and then the first value in
this method is whatever attribute you
want so it could be an href attribute it
could be a language attribute whatever
attribute you want to use in this case
its SRC for the source attribute and by
the way this is not case-sensitive so
you can put whatever case you want in
here so again the first value is the
HTML attribute the second one is the
value and in this case we want to
specify the image that we want to
display on our web page and in this case
it's going to be Caesar dot PNG make
sure you get that file extension correct
whichever one you're using and we don't
need to specify a directory because it's
in the root of our folder so let's go
ahead and save this let's go ahead and
open this up in chrome and if we hit our
button hey there's our image of Julius
Caesar himself now let's do something a
little bit different let's actually load
this when the page loads so we'll
actually just load the image and not use
jQuery then what we're going to do is
we're going to swap images so when the
user clicks this button will display the
other Caesar to image so we'll just put
two here so this one will be loaded
initially and then we'll use jQuery to
go ahead and swap images so let's close
this out let's go ahead and load our
page again and if we hit our button
we've got our new julius caesar image
that says new here just to make sure it
actually is the caesar to image great
now you could also remove HTML
attributes from your web page and that
is the remove attribute you do have to
actually use a capital A here so that's
the method remove attribute and in this
case we're just going to remove our
source attribute so we don't need this
second value
here so we'll just get rid of this and
again you can remove any type of HTML
attribute you want an href a language
attribute whatever attribute but in this
case again we're removing the SRC
attribute so this page will initially
load our Caesar image and then we'll
remove it with the remove attribute
method so let's go ahead and refresh our
paint whoops we need to save first
now we'll refresh our page again and if
we hit this button it's gone bye-bye so
that's how those two methods work I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
