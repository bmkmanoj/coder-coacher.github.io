look at some of the changes in terms of
syntax in html5 now one of the big
features html5 offers is the chance to
minimize some of the complexity of your
HTML document it basically reduces the
size of it and basically that does two
things it makes it easier to read and
makes it more maintainable now prior to
html5 we had to put all these long
versions of the release that we were
using for either HTML or XHTML and the
problem with this is if a new version of
HTML came out you would have to go
update all of your web pages if you
wanted to use the new version of HTML
now html5 greatly simplifies this and we
don't have to use all of this nonsense
we can just get this out of here and
this is all we need now this doctype
HTML that's all you need and by default
it will use the latest version of HTML
but it is also backwards compatible with
all other versions of HTML so if you
have HTML 4.01 code it will work and
that's the nice thing so you basically
just can put this in now and forget
about it and the other nice thing about
this is when another version of HTML
comes out you don't have to come here
and update this on all of your web pages
it'll just pick up the new version of
HTML but will also be backward
compatible at that point with html5 so
that's the changes to the doctype
declaration and again maintainability
just much easier to maintain the other
thing is they drop this requirement for
the xml namespace so you can just get
rid of that all you need now is a
bare-bones
HTML element tag and just look how much
easier that is to read much easier so
again readability and maintainability
now character encoding also has been
simplified and basically they've dropped
a requirement to have these two
attributes so we can get rid of all this
and look how much easier that is to use
and all you're doing here is ensuring
that all browsers read the character
encoding correctly for your web page and
it's sort of just the default utf-8 you
don't and you can keep that there and
you don't even have to think about it
going forward the entire character
encoding declaration
must be included somewhere within the
first 512 characters of your document
but mainly it should appear before any
content-based
elements like title so we should put
this first in our head section now also
in html5 they have dropped this type
attribute that we included with our
stylesheet here originally the intent
here was that there might be different
style sheets out there not just CSS but
CSS is so standardized now you don't
even need this so we can get rid of that
and for JavaScript the same thing we
don't need this type attribute anymore
we can just get rid of that there's no
reason for it and now you can see just
how simplified this looks again much
easier to read and much easier to
maintain so let's go ahead and save this
and we'll just make sure this loads and
of course it does so we will continue on
in the next video with syntax changes in
html5 see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
