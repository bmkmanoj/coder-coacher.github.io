sliding effects in jQuery and basically
you can slide any element up or down
that you want in jQuery and jQuery
provides two methods to do this the
slide down method and the slide up
method so we're gonna take a look at
that syntax in this video now you can
see here I've created an extra button to
our code that we've been working on
throughout the series and I've given
that an ID of test B so we got two
buttons down here now not just one and
one we'll slide the section up and one
we'll slide the section down and we're
gonna work against our very favorite
section this right section right here so
again you can see I've created some
jQuery code for our first button we've
been using that all along and I've
created some other jQuery code for our
second button and we're gonna select
that with our ID and of course that is
pound test B so let's go ahead and first
we want to set up our slide up button
this one right here which will slide
this section up so let's go ahead and
get the ID for that section of course it
is right so we'll go ahead and just put
in pound right here something we've been
doing a lot throughout the series and of
course we're gonna use this for our
other button as well so we might as well
go ahead and copy and paste it in there
as well now the first function that we
want to do of course is slide this
section up so all we do is type in slide
up and that should slide this section up
and we'll see it work in a minute and
then for our second button down here
we're just going to slide the section
down so let's go ahead and save this
let's refresh our page and let's see if
this works and it did look at that now
if we want to slide the section down we
hit this button and it works now again
you can use these methods for any type
of element that you want you could slide
just the individual paragraphs up and
down if you wanted to it's really very
simple to use now similar to the fade
effects in jQuery there is also a toggle
method that we can use and what that
does it sort of combines both of these
methods and puts it into one method
where you can toggle it up and down so
again that's similar to the fade toggle
method so let's go ahead and we'll just
type in here slide toggle
it's that simple now of course we don't
need this button anymore right because
this handles both the up and down in one
method but we'll go ahead and keep this
button and function here just so you
have it as an example but again we don't
even need to worry about this button
anymore
we can handle everything now with this
slide toggle method so let's go ahead
and save this let's go ahead and refresh
our page and now let's go ahead and
slide the section up and let's slide it
down see how that works we get the best
of both worlds in the slide toggle
method so if you didn't want to have two
buttons you just wanted to have it in
one button you can accomplish that as
well okay that's going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
