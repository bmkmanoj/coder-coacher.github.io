very first PHP script and to start out
with the basics the very first thing you
will need is a closing and opening tag
so all of your PHP code will go between
the opening tag which is right here and
the closing tag so the opening tag
starts out with an angle bracket then a
question mark and then PHP and then it's
closed out with a question mark and a
angle bracket so if you mess this up
somehow your PHP code will not get
executed so you need to have exactly
this format so once again everything
that goes on between these two tags will
be PHP code and then once you go past
this closing tag you're back to HTML but
it once again everything between these
two tags is PHP so let's go ahead and
save this first before we actually put
some code in there so we'll do a save as
and you want to select PHP in all these
different file formats and it's down
here so that's what we want now we're
going to browse to our htdocs folder
wherever you installed it and I
installed it on my C Drive and again
we're going to put it in HT Docs and you
can name this whatever you want I'm just
going to call this lesson now you'll
notice after I hit the Save button this
color up here will change it kind of
indicates hey you're really good to go
now with PHP see how that changed okay
so we're going to use the echo function
it's actually not truly a function
because you don't actually have to use
parentheses but it acts like one so we
write in echo and all echo does for us
is it will just output one or more
strings to the browser so it's really
easy to use when you first get going in
PHP so then we want to create a string
and many of you probably know that we
use quotes for that so we're just going
to say this is my first script there we
go and we close this out with a
semicolon
now every line that we create is called
a statement this is referred to
collectively as a statement and this is
very similar to other languages like
JavaScript and like JavaScript we have
to close our statement out with a
semicolon and then we can start another
statement and in turn it has to
be closed out with a semicolon so this
is about as basic as we can get so let's
go ahead and save this and then what I
want you to do is open up your browser
and what we're going to do is go to
localhost and I've already got it up
here as you can see and then you're just
going to type in the name of whatever
your document is in my case it's lesson
dot PHP hit enter and there you can see
our PHP script ran and we got the output
to our browser so this is a good start
in the next video we will really get
going when we will look at variables see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
