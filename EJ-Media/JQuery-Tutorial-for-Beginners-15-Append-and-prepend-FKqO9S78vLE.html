at four methods the append method the
prepend method and the after and before
methods now the append method is very
similar to the HTML method that we
talked about a few videos ago it submits
an HTML tag with whatever we want to put
inside there in this case text but the
difference is the append method will
append this element after the last
element in the div that we select in
this case we selected our last section
this div with an ID of right so it will
always be the last child element so what
does that mean well this paragraph
element is the first element so this h2
element that we're submitting should be
the last element inside of the div that
we selected so we'll end up after the
paragraph so let's go ahead and see if
that works and it did it submitted the
h2 element after the first paragraph
element the prepend method essentially
does the same thing only the opposite so
it'll put this h2 element before the
first element so this h2 now will become
the first child element so let's go
ahead and hit save we'll hit refresh and
if we hit our button there you can see
the h2 element now is the first child
element in our div section now the after
method functions similar to the append
method the only difference is it doesn't
put it inside of our element that we
selected so we selected this div element
with an ID of write it we'll put it
after the closing tag of the element
which in this case is this div tag right
here so it will actually be just outside
of the element that we select so let's
go ahead and do that we'll put after
here and let's go ahead and maximize
this screen so we get a better look at
this and let's reduce the zoom down here
a little bit so we can see this a little
bit better let's just move this we'll
move this over here for a little bit and
let's go ahead and refresh our page and
if we hit our button there you can see
it occurs right after and of course it
is not inside the element that we
selected it's just right outside of it
now the before well you probably guessed
it it puts it right before the opening
tag
of the element that we selected so let's
go ahead and save this will minimize
this let's refresh our page and if we
hit this there you can see now it occurs
before the element this looks a little
funky but this actually is before this
right section that we selected okay so
that's how those four methods work I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
