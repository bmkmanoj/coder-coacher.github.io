beginning Java in this video we are
going to talk about the differences
between constructors and methods now a
constructor is a method yes that is true
but I might also ask you if a whale is a
mammal
well yeah it is but when I think of a
mammal I think of a bear a human or a
monkey something like that not a whale
its swimming around the ocean or we
might also ask is Pluto a planet yes but
and then fill in all the blanks why it's
not a planet so those same analogies can
be applied to the differences between a
constructor method and what I like to
call a normal method so let's examine
those right now so I type this all up
today before the tutorials because I
didn't want to bore you guys typing this
all out so if we come down here we are
going to kick everything off with the
new keyword and so the constructor here
will get invoked it'll come up here and
create a new copy of this or instantiate
this class and we're going to call that
test obj now what the constructor does
is takes this and as I said creates a
copy of it it gets loaded into something
called the JVM the java virtual machine
and there's a thing in that java virtual
machine called a class loader the class
loader is what actually takes this copy
and loads it out into memory so we can
now use it as an object now there's some
things called a heap and a stack and
that's for much later tutorials we won't
get into that right now and a lot of
things that happen in the java virtual
machine fortunately are done in the
background so think of a constructor as
the setup guy he's kind of setting
everything up so that this test obj
could begin to do whatever work we want
it to do and of course this all happens
in the beginning and after the
constructor is done with his work then
the methods come into play so kind of
think of the methods is after the fact
the constructor sets everything up and
then the real fun starts with the
methods they are going to do a
geordie of the work now you may want to
do some things at startup time when this
constructor is creating and
instantiating this class and so you can
put some code inside the constructor and
give it some things to do and so that is
somewhat similar to a method so let's go
ahead and run this and you'll notice
down here we got local variable a
printed from the constructor method we
declared and assigned a value here and
we printed it out inside this
constructor method now I want to point
something out very interesting here did
you notice that nothing else happened
here
these methods were not invoked and the
reason is if you look down here we
haven't used this object yet that's why
we're getting this intellisense to say
it's not used that's because the
constructor creates the object and does
some things that you want to do at
startup time but basically when this is
done it goes away and then you'll call
your methods and your variables from
this object so that's a really good way
to think of this the constructor always
comes first to create and instantiate
the class and the methods come later to
go ahead and do the real work now you
might ask the question well why do I
actually want to put anything in here
why don't I just use some methods to do
this later on and the answer to that is
it's all up to you you don't have to put
anything in here we could certainly
create another method to do all this
work but there might be reasons why you
want to do some initial work when you
instantiate the class and create your
object and let's think of something more
real-world here let's say you're making
a game here and you want to load up the
first initial screen maybe like the
login screen to your game well you're
going to go ahead and do that right here
and then your methods could go ahead and
work on that screen after it's been
loaded and that brings me to another
point I'd like to make this screen that
we just talked about in our video game
that just got loaded we can't return
anything to that screen so that's a key
difference between constructors and
methods methods can return values
constructors cannot and the best way to
think of that is the fact that
constructors again are only involved at
startup your methods will handle return
values later on and so if I try to go
ahead and put a return value in here and
let's just try to do return a we're
going to get some intellisense that says
nope can't do that
so that's just that's just the way it is
so that's a huge difference between
constructors and methods
so let's actually put that in our
comment no void and no return and by the
way you cannot use void and constructors
as well now this is a little bit
complicated I'm not going to explain
today why void cannot be used just know
that it cannot be used in constructors I
will get to that in a later tutorial so
you can't return a value and you can't
use void in a constructor now just to
prove the point let's go ahead and type
in void here and you remember when we
ran this before we got this printed out
right the constructor did its work and
we printed out this variable now let's
go ahead and run this ah look we got 0
nothing because guess what this is no
longer a constructor so when I ran this
Java just created the constructor for us
since this is no longer even a
constructor so let's go ahead and get
rid of that and if we run this again
boom we got local variable a printed
from the constructor method so we're
back in business now in terms of the
signature and this part right here and
right here is always called the
signature by the way you will notice
that you can use the public key word and
those access modifiers like public
protected those all can be used by both
constructors and methods so that's okay
we can go ahead and use those access
modifiers but what we can't do is use
the second part of that signature void
and a return value in the signature of
the constructor so let's just do another
comment here and we'll type in public
and access modifiers okay to all
and let's just go ahead and copy this
over here over here
good okay so and I will also point out
we don't have a static method but static
also cannot be used in a constructor so
no static as well and actually you know
what let's call this our void method
okay so once again no void no return and
no static with our constructor no static
okay so let's go ahead and use some of
these methods that we created so let's
just do a test obj dot and then let's go
ahead and use this method so let's just
do an S out tab and we will go ahead and
do a test Oh BJ
dot and let's go ahead and get that
return value method here and we'll do a
plus and we will say printed
and you'll notice the intellisense went
away from our object because now we're
using it so let's go ahead and run this
puppy and everything came out the way we
wanted to
except for this lack of a space right
here so let's go ahead and put a space
in there I've been known to have some
OCD at times so let's go ahead and run
that and look how nice and neat that is
well that's pretty much it for this
tutorial I will see you guys in the next
