beginning CSS in the last video we
created an external stylesheet and so
we're going to go ahead and use that
right now so let's open up our website
folder that we created and we'll go
ahead and open up our stylesheet now in
this video we're going to be talking
about the text decoration property and
we dealt with that in previous videos
but we're going to expand upon that in
this video so I want to go ahead and
eliminate this class that we created but
before we do that I want you to copy and
paste this into the h1 and h2 selector
and actually we're just going to copy
and paste this over the border bottom
rule that we set we're not going to use
that anymore and then we'll go ahead and
eliminate this class that we created in
earlier videos and we'll go ahead and
save our stylesheet now and you can see
that we have an underline on our h1 and
h2 headers so that is the first value
that we can use now let's go ahead and
close that out now another value that we
can use is the line through parameter so
let's go ahead and put that in and we'll
save this and let's go ahead and open up
our HTML page and you can see we've got
a line through our text now another
parameter that we can use is over line
so let's type that in here and we'll go
ahead and save our style sheet again
let's open up our page and there you can
see we get a line above the text now you
can also combine some of the parameters
so let's put in here underline and let's
go ahead and save this and you can see
now we've got an underline and an over
line and then the final parameter we'll
talk about is none and that's pretty
self explained because that's what we'll
use going forward and let's go ahead and
save this and we'll take one more look
at our webpage and it's back to normal
ok I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
