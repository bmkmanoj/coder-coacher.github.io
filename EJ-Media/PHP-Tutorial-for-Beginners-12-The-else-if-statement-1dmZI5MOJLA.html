the else if statement and basically you
want to use that if you want more than
just a simple true and false outcome
what if you need multiple outcomes maybe
20 outcomes maybe thirty outcomes and
again that's where the else if statement
comes into play now the else if always
goes between the else and the if it
can't go after the else and it can't
come before the if you always have to
put it in between the if and the else no
matter how many you add so let's go
ahead and copy and paste our if
statement again here because the else if
is very similar to the if and what we
want to do is add else before the if and
that gives us our else if and what we're
going to do is we'll add this equal sign
back here and now this should be true
now you'll notice right away that the
else if like the if has a conditional so
again it does everything the if does it
just allows us to add multiple outcomes
instead of just a simple true and false
now the reason we don't add a
conditional to our else is because the
else always comes last no matter what it
is always the last stop the last Harrah
that's why you don't add a condition
here there's nothing really to test it
is the absolute false condition so now
if we look at this code our if statement
should turn out to be false and it will
come down and hit this else if and this
should be true and our block of code
will be executed and let's put something
in here a little bit different let's
just say the else if was executed so
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page and it worked which is
what we expected so again the two key
points here are you can add now as many
different outcomes as you want with the
else if but again it can never come
after the else and it can never come
before the if those are the two main
rules that you have to remember and also
remember that it's exactly similar to
the if we have a condition here we are
testing that condition and it can be
true or false
like all conditionals are now let's go
ahead and put in seven here and we'll
just see if this is working correctly
and it should skip down to our else
let's go ahead and save this refresh our
page and it did so that is how the
else/if works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
