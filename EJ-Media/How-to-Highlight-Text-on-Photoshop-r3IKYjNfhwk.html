highlight text now if you look at this
text is quite boring why don't we put an
outer glow around this and make it look
really snazzy so in order to do that we
have to actually go to blending options
but before we do that if you haven't
created a new text layer you should do
that you can do that by selecting this
icon in the bottom right and then
selecting text over here and then typing
in some text so once you've got that
let's right click and go to blending
options and then we're going to go to
outer glow you guessed it we're going to
click on that now if your blend mode is
not set to normal set it to normal we're
going to pick a solid color there's also
this other option over here we can
create some of these mixed colors but
we're going to do an actual solid color
and let's go with a nice pink a nice
little pink outer glow there we go now
the two main parameters are spread and
size and you'll have to play around with
these depending on the size of your text
but it's going to basically control the
thickness and how far the highlight
leaves the actual text so in this case
you can see here how this is really
altering how this looks on the left I
usually leave the size at about 25 to 30
pixels but you can play around it again
this all depends on the size of the text
and the font that you're using now let's
go back up here to blend mode now this
is where you can really play around you
can select some of these different
options here it'll change the way this
looks like one one that I really like is
called exclusion you see how that
reversed everything but you can play
around with these and you'll get
different effects so we'll go back to
normal now you can go ahead and give the
highlight a little bit of an opaque
nough stew it and then noise adds grain
a little bit more grain to it so if you
want a little bit more of a grain feel
you can bump that up so you can play
around with those options it's pretty
easy as you can see please check out my
other Photoshop tutorials on my youtube
channel see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
