with global objects and we're going to
look at the date object and I think you
get an idea what that does but before we
do that I want to introduce a new
concept and that is another way to
create objects and that involves using
the new keyword and basically what that
does is it allows us to copy an existing
object and use it and in this case we're
going to copy the date object that's the
object that we're going to copy and then
we get to go ahead and use its methods
and properties like we've been doing in
previous videos so again it all starts
with the new keyword then you have to
put the object that you want to copy
it's actually called the reference
object and all you're basically doing is
telling JavaScript hey I want to copy
this object give me a copy of this the
actual lingo they like to use it's
called a instance we're creating an
instance of this date object but it's
really just a copy that's the simple way
to think of it and then you have to put
in these open parentheses this is called
the constructor and basically it does
what a constructor does in real life it
builds something so it's going to build
a copy of the date global object for us
and of course we're assigning the name
to day date and then we get to go ahead
and use our own copy of the date object
and there's some more nuances to this
and we'll talk about this in future
videos so now that we've got our date
object and we're calling it to day date
but you could call out anything you want
we're just going to go ahead and write
it out and you're going to see we
already get some output without even
having to use any method so let's go
ahead and run this and you can see we
get all of this output Saturday March
28th we get the year we get the time and
even the timezone now what I want to
point out is this will be specific to
your system so if you're living in
another country or another time zone it
will pull it from the system clock on
your computer and so like I said this
may be different for you you may be on a
different time zone other than the
Eastern Standard time zone so again the
date object pulls the current date and
time from whatever your system clock is
set at okay
and you know what I didn't want to close
that out let's go ahead and run that
again now let's say you don't like this
long format here you want this to look a
little bit more readable because this is
not in a string format so let's say we
want to convert this to a string format
there's actually a method that the date
object provides to do that and then
we'll compare the two so let's go ahead
and just minimize this for now and we'll
go back to our code and I'll just copy
and paste in here so we're going to
create a new variable called used string
and I think you get an idea what that
means we're going to specify our object
and like I said we can go ahead and
since this is a date object like I said
this is our copy of the date object we
can go ahead and use all the methods and
one method that is provided is called to
date string and all this is going to do
is convert that output that we just saw
to a more readable string and of course
here we need to write out this variable
so let's just go ahead and copy and
paste that in there and we'll go ahead
and run this now and you can see this is
a little bit more readable this is now
provided in a string format and take a
look at the difference you can see this
is actually a string as opposed to the
raw output that we get so let's go ahead
and close this out and let's go back to
our code and we're going to go ahead and
get rid of this line now and I'm going
to go ahead and copy and paste a new
line in here so we're going to use this
get year method and there's actually an
opposite to this called the set method
and we'll talk about the set method in a
second and the get just gets something
that's already out there we are just
receiving what is already out there with
the set method we actually define the
values that we want and I'll show you
that in a second but first let's go
ahead and run this and obviously we need
to go ahead and put the two day date
object in here that we're going to go
ahead and write out and we're just going
to get the year so let's go ahead and
run this and you'll notice that the
output is going to look very similar to
when we wrote it out earlier and so it
basically goes ahead and writes out
everything including the year so again
that looks pretty similar to what we did
earlier but what we want to try to do is
pass in a different year
so let's put in 17 in here and we'll see
what happens and we'll go ahead and run
this again and nothing happened and
that's what I expected
because remember get methods only
receive what's out there so it'll only
take what's currently available in our
system clock so that's why it did not
alter the year that's where we have to
use the set method so all we have to do
here is switch this to set year and now
if we run this you'll see that the year
actually does change and there you see
we get 1917 now if you wanted 2017 we
actually have to type whole thing out
and let's go ahead and run this and
there you can see we get 2017 okay
that's going to do it for this video now
in the next video we're really going to
start getting into JavaScript we are
going to take our first look at the Dom
otherwise known as the document object
model probably the most important thing
to understanding JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
