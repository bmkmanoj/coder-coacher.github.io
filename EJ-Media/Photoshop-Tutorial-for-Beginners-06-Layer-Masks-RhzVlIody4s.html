to take a beginning look at masks and
masks are very important technique to
learn in order to start doing some
interesting effects with your photos at
a basic level you use masks to either
hide or show something and we'll get to
that in a minute
masks are also non-destructive and we'll
talk about that also later on okay so
let's get going and I'm just going to
open up an image here just so that we
have something to work with and I'm
going to open up this downtown big city
image now the first thing we want to do
is go ahead and create an empty layer
now you will remember in the last video
I talked about the different ways that
you can create layers and here's yet
another way that you can create a layer
and you can do that right down here by
selecting this icon or you can go up to
the menu and select layer hit new and
select layer and we're just going to
call this layer one and there you can
see now we have our empty layer now over
here I want you to go ahead and select
the rectangular marquee tool so go ahead
and select that and we're just going to
create a very simple rectangle here good
and what I want you to do is go up to
edit and we're going to go ahead and
fill that rectangle and then in the drop
down we're going to go ahead and select
color and let's just select a bright
yellow color here very simple and we'll
hit OK and there you can see now we've
got our rectangular shape and go ahead
and hit control D and that will deselect
the marquee tool and then we're just
going to go ahead and use the Select
tool to move this right down here good
okay now what I want you to do is go
over to the layers panel and we're going
to go ahead and duplicate this layer and
we're just going to call this layer two
very simple and then let's go ahead and
drag the layer two over to the right a
little bit and then we're going to go
ahead and duplicate this one more time
and we're just going to call this layer
three and we'll move layer three over a
little bit to the right good now we've
got our three layers now the first layer
we're not going to touch we're just
going to leave that as is for now but
we're going to add our mask to the
second layer that's the first mask that
we're going to go ahead and add so what
we're going to do is go up to layer and
we're going to go down to layer mask now
don't worry about vector masks and
create clipping mask we'll talk about
those in later videos in this video
we're going to just talk about the two
basic type of layer mess and those are
these two options right here review all
and hide all those are the basic two
masks that you will use in Photoshop so
we're going to select the reveal all
mask first so I'll go ahead and select
that and there you can see we've got
this new thumbnail that is our mask
thumbnails
basically to the right of our layer
thumbnail which is right here so this is
the mask thumbnail and this is the layer
thumbnail and as I said now we have this
mask thumbnail and it is white and so
basically the way Photoshop works is
white will reveal everything and so if
you take a look at our second layer here
everything is revealed from our original
shape this rectangular shape so just let
that soak in for now now let's go to
this layer 3 and let's go ahead and add
another mask and we're going to go down
to layer mask of course and now instead
of revealing all we're going to hide off
and take a look at that now we have a
black thumbnail mask and you'll also
notice that our rectangular object
disappeared and that's because black
hides off so think of it like this
basically in real life if you're out at
night you can't really see anything
right so that's probably their thinking
behind this that black will hide
everything and if you're out in the
middle of the day it's light and you can
see everything and so that's why white
reveals up so these are the two
different types of masks that you will
use black hides everything and white
reveals everything and again we can see
that right here because the layer 2 is
revealed and now the layer 3 is hidden
because we use the hide all masks here
now let's go back to our layer 2 mask
and by the way make sure that you select
the actual mask I've done this many
times before where I've actually
selected the content layer thumbnail by
mistake so just always keep an eye what
you have selected over in the layers
panel is really easy to select something
other than what you intended so let's go
ahead and select our layer mask again
and now what I want you to do is select
the paintbrush tool and you can do that
by just pressing B on your keyboard and
now you can see we have it selected
right click on that and make sure that
the first option here is selected the
brush tool then make sure that white
is selected and it is indeed selected so
we're going to do is go ahead and just
start painting out here and you're going
to see that nothing happens now the
reason for this is remember white
reveals all so obviously everything's
already revealed in our shape now what
we really want to do is switch the color
to black so let's go ahead and start
painting out and now take a look at that
we're now hiding this yellow color
because this is black so that's why we
have black selected here we're going to
start hiding portions of this rectangle
and as we know black accomplishes that
now what I want to show you really
quickly let's go ahead and select the
layer thumbnail and let's actually
select black again and watch what
happens here it's actually just going to
put black there and the reason is we
have the original layer selected our
rectangular object and so we're just
putting black pixels here like you
normally would but black as we know in
masks is very different it basically
hides things and so if we start doing
this again we are once again hiding the
yellow pixels in our rectangle and as
you notice we are basically revealing
whatever layers are below and in this
case it's this image this city image
here will be revealed because of course
this is at a lower level so we're going
to reveal whatever content is in the
layer below and in this case of course
it is this background image now let's go
ahead and flip up to our layer 3 mask
and of course here we're hiding the
entire rectangle and so we need to go
ahead and flip our colors back here and
as we know white reveals content so
let's go ahead and start painting in
here and look now we're actually
revealing some of this rectangle now
we're using the paintbrush tool but
there are many different ways to reveal
and hide masks you can use many
different tools and we'll talk about
that in future videos now you might ask
well why didn't I just use the eraser
tool and I'll explain that so let's go
down to layer 1 and what I want you to
do is go ahead and select the eraser
tool and just go ahead and start erasing
things and as you can see it's very
similar to what we were doing in layer 2
here is the difference though and it's a
big difference
this is considered destructive so we are
destroying our original content here
whereas in this case we have a mask that
we
working with and so we could just simply
go ahead and delete the mask and add a
new one and start over again
whereas in layer one this would be more
difficult to do now you could of course
go up to edit and undo the eraser but
that might not be so easy to do later on
it could be this is a very complicated
logo you have done hundreds of edits and
it might not just be a simple thing of
undoing these changes so that is the
huge benefit of masks they are
considered non-destructive because we
can always just simply delete them and
re-add them with just a few clicks okay
so that is the beginning look at masks
we will continue on with this subject in
the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
