off with the audio element tag in HTML
now I want to point out one thing you no
longer I have to create a value for the
controlls attribute or for some of the
other attributes that go along with the
audio element tag in html5 so this is
actually no longer necessary if you have
a reason to use it you can certainly go
ahead but let's go ahead and actually
get rid of this and I'll show you that
everything still remains normal so let's
go ahead and save this will refresh our
page and there you can see the control
remains now what if you want the track
to automatically play when the webpage
is loaded for that we can use the
autoplay attribute so let's go ahead and
type that in here and let's save this
let's actually go ahead and close the
page out we'll reload it just to make
sure it's working properly we'll reopen
this this is an audio test for our test
one dot mp3 and there you can see the
autoplay worked now what if you want
this to keep looping over and over and
over again you can use the loop
attribute for that so let's go ahead and
save this let's refresh our page and
this should loop over and over this is
an audio test for our test one dot mp3
this is an audio test for our test one
dot mp3 this is an awed and it did and I
doubt you want to hear my voice over and
over and over again so I took mercy on
you guys and hit the pause button now
there's one other attribute I want to
show you guys now this applies to any
HTML element it really has nothing to do
specifically with the audio element I
just wanted to show you guys this
attribute that's new in html5 and it
allows you to drag any element that you
want so again as I said you can put this
in any element that you want and you
guessed it it's the draggable attribute
now this one we do actually have to give
a value to and we just set this to true
so let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page and I'm going to have
to hit the pause button so this doesn't
play over and over again this is an
audio tap and there you can see we can
actually drag this now anywhere within
our web browser now you might be asking
well how do we set up receiver how do we
set up another element that will receive
what we drag and we have to do that in
either JavaScript or jQuery so that's
for a future lecture ok that's going to
do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
