selectors now jQuery also provides a
selector to select all the even-numbered
elements so let's say we wanted to
select all the even-numbered div
elements we would simply come here and
we would put in div and of course that
is the CSS type selector and then of
course like I said in the last video we
need a colon and that kicks off the
jQuery selector and then we just put in
even and this will select all the
even-numbered div elements and of course
it will hide them so which developments
are those well let's scroll up here and
this first section the left section
would actually start out with the number
0 remember computers like to always
start out with 0 so this will be
selected because it's a 0 the center
will be number 1 and of course that's an
odd element so that won't be selected
the right section will be 2 of course
that's an even element so that will be
selected and our button will be 3 and
that of course is odd so that won't be
selected so if this works correctly the
center section and our button will not
be hidden because they were not selected
the left section and the right section
because they are even will be selected
and they will be hidden so let's go
ahead and run this and if we hit our
button there you can see the center
section and our button are not hidden
because they are odd-numbered elements
so let's close this out now you're
probably guessing hey we can also select
the odd number elements and you guessed
it we just put in odd right there and
now it'll be the reverse our button and
our center section should now be hidden
so let's go ahead and run this
and if we hit our button here that's
exactly what happened the button now is
hidden and the center section is also
hidden as well and let's go ahead and
refresh our page here now jQuery also
provides a neat little selector that
allows us to key off a particular set of
texts so we can actually select text in
these elements to hide the text so I'm
just going to go ahead and copy and
paste the line here because I've already
typed it out and then I'll explain it so
what we want to do is select the
paragraph element
that contains the word Center you can
see our center section has a paragraph
that contains the word Center so this
paragraph element will be selected
because we put the word Center here and
that's what this contains jQuery
selector does you can basically put any
type of text in there that you want to
find and then that will select the
element that contains that particular
text and in this case it will hide
everything that's in this paragraph
element which of course is right here so
let's close this out let's go ahead and
save this and we'll watch our page again
and now this works correctly this
paragraph element and all of its content
should be hidden so let's go ahead and
hit that and it is you can see all the
text now is hidden okay that's gonna do
it for this video in the next video we
will continue on with jQuery selectors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
