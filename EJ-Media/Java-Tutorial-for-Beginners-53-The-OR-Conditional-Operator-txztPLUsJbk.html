going to cover conditional operators in
Java
now conditional operators in every
language are very very important
ultimately what this is about is making
decisions and so you can add quite a bit
of functionality to your program and
ultimately when you make decisions you
can have different outcomes and that is
the very basis for using conditional
operators now in this video we're going
to cover the or conditional operator and
in the next video we'll cover the and
conditional operator so you can see I've
created a class called conditional now
we're going to be using an if and an
else in this program now always with the
conditional operators you have two
conditions that you are testing out this
is the first condition and this is the
second condition and in each condition
we're using the Equality operator which
is this equals equals now you will
remember this does not mean that a
equals five what we're asking here is
does it equal five so we're really
judging this variable to see if it
really equals five so we're not setting
the variable we're just asking a simple
question does this equal five and so
we're doing it twice now I've made these
variable names very simple an A and a B
and of course the a will be our first
condition and the B will be our second
condition and then here is what we use
for the or conditional operator so again
it always has two conditions
now if the overall or condition is true
then we will print out this line right
here which says the condition is true if
it is false this code will be skipped
and the else will be triggered and that
will print out a line that says the
condition is false now it's always
useful to sort of plot out the outcomes
and all the types of conditions that you
do because then you'll have a good idea
of how it works and so that's what I've
done here
you can see I put the a condition here
in the B condition here now you'll
notice that one equals true and zero
equals false now you'll notice right
away that three out of these four
outcomes are true only one is false and
that is the way that or works you only
need one of these conditions to be true
in order for the overall condition to be
true so you can see here a true true
gives us a
you are true and a false still gives us
the truth a false and a true still gives
us a true only when we have two falses
is the or conditional operator false
that's the only outcome so that's how
this works
so let's go ahead and run this now you
can see I've already set the first
variable to five in the first variable
to six so we're gonna be doing this
first outcome both a and B are true and
so the or conditional operator is going
to be true so this line should be
executed so let's go ahead and run this
and there you can see we got the
expected output now let's do this second
outcome so what we're gonna do is the
first one is going to stay true but the
second condition will be false so let's
slip this number 266 and then we'll go
ahead and run this and we still should
get the true condition and we did the
condition is true because again only one
of these has to be true and in this case
the first one was true now let's do this
third one so we'll make the first one
false now so we'll make this 54 and
we'll make the second condition true so
let's go ahead and run this again and we
got the expected output the condition is
true now let's go ahead and we'll do the
fourth outcome and so now we'll make
both conditions false so we'll set this
to 67 let's go ahead and save this again
let's run it again and there you can see
we hit the else because both of these
conditions were false and therefore this
code does not get executed the else gets
triggered and it printed out the
statement the condition is false so
that's the way the or conditional
operator works remember you always want
to think about these different outcomes
now the next video we will cover the end
conditional operator see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
