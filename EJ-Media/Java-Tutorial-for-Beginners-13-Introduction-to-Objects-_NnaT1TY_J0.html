Java today we will be dealing with
objects in Java we will be discussing
objects in the broadest sense to give
you a working understanding of how they
function in Java so in the previous
videos we have been coding a bunch of
lines and creating all these programs
but what does that mean in the larger
sense wouldn't it make sense to make
programs with lines of code that we can
use again and again if we need them well
I'll try to answer that in this video
the critical element to understanding
and utilizing Java to its fullest extent
is oo p that is object orientated
programming now when beginning
programmers hear the term object or oo P
they naturally ask the question what on
earth does that relate to and what does
that mean well it's a good question and
first you have reason to fear that type
of weird jargon but it is objects that
will make your life in Java so much
easier so if there was one video in this
series you would want to understand and
comprehend to its fullest extent it
would be this one this video will
fundamentally change the way you think
of your program you will think of it
less as a series of lines of code and
more a collection of objects objects
that you can use to accomplish tasks
that you want your program to perform so
if I had to describe Hopi in one word it
would be reusability so keep that in
mind as we go forward reusability
reusing lines of code for specific tasks
that you can use over and over again so
before we get started on coding an
object let's talk about a real world
object because you know it's always good
to compare things in real life let's say
you can create planets and wow what a
power that would be now let's also
assume that you are creating your first
planet so then you go ahead and design
your planet and you're ready to create
your first planet but you also decide
hey I want to make more planets based
off the template of the first planet so
the first planet becomes the template
for the rest of the planets you produce
it's a blueprint that you can create
other planets or objects from and as I
said it acts as a template or object
template you can think of classes in the
same way you use classes to provide a
blueprint for an object so basically an
object is created from a class and of
course we've been dealing with classes
so that's a new way to think of the
class that we defined earlier so after
you create that initial object the
blueprint of the initial planet you can
use it again and again and again it's
reusable that is you can create new
objects from that original template but
the new objects are considered copies or
instances of the original blueprint but
we will get more into instances later
now every object needs some
characteristics right so every object
has an attribute and a behavior that's
the planet example we might say our
planet has an attribute of size behavior
is the other characteristic and that
involves doing something but we will
talk about that later okay so let's go
ahead and create an object
remember we create objects by using the
class as of the template so let's go
ahead and create our first object so
we're going to type in public class and
the name of our object is going to be
planet squiggly brackets there we go
now you might say wait a minute Ernie
haven't we been doing this already and
the answer to that is yes that is in all
the previous tutorials we have been
doing we've been doing ope all along I
just had not explained it yet because I
didn't want to confuse you earlier on
now remember in the previous videos I
said the public keyword makes this
available to other programs so that is
how this class is available to any
program that wants to use the planet
object that we're defining here so we
created this object called planet but we
can't really do anything with it yet
because it doesn't have any attributes
and it's attributes that will give it
life so we add those to make the class
useful and to do
something because after all a program
has to do something right so let's go
ahead and do that right now let's define
a string and again you're going to
notice how similar this is to the other
programs that we've been doing it's the
same thing so we're going to define a
string variable called size and this
will be the size of the planet and then
we're going to go ahead and and remember
we always define the variable it's the
same as the other programs we've been
working on we always do that before the
method so now we're going to give this a
method and we're going to say display
size squiggly brackets and and now we're
going to do is system dot out dot print
so you guys will certainly so you guys
will certainly recognize this and we're
going to go ahead and print out this
string called size of the planet is and
we're going to add that to the size
parameter we just defined up here so
we're going to print out this size the
size of the planet so again this looks
like just a regular program that we've
been using in the other tutorial so we
defined our object name as planet the
attribute is going to be size and
remember we use variables to give an
object its attributes so this is going
to be the size of the planet and of
course every class needs a method so
we're going to use the method display
size and that's going to call system dot
out dot print and it will print out what
we define here so think of this object
as having two parts we define the
attribute with the string variable of
size and the second part of the class is
the method and the method is part of the
objects behavior it reveals the planets
size so that is where the behavior comes
in which I talked about earlier so again
size is the attribute and the behavior
is the display size method so this is
the two parts to this object planet that
we have created here now I should point
out that in terms of using objects you
rarely change the class or methods
it's the
tributes you change through variables
that's what makes each object unique in
other words if we create other planets
based off this template so they will
have their own attributes so let's say
we want to now reuse this object planet
that we've created in another program
okay so let's do just that let's create
a new program so we can go ahead and
start creating some objects so we're
going to go new file and as always
select empty Java file we're going to
call this all planets and go ahead and
finish and we're going to define a new
program here we're going to call this
all planets to match the name of the
Java file now I want to point out
something very quickly here so that you
don't get confused you'll notice here
you'll notice back here in our template
we don't have a main method the reason
is is remember this is just a blueprint
a template to create objects from so
we're not actually running this in fact
let's go ahead and run this you'll see
it's not going to work right it doesn't
have a main method because it doesn't
need a main method this isn't the
program this is the program this is
where we need to have the main method
and then we can go ahead and start
creating objects now from our template
and here we finally get to create our
first object in our new program so we're
going to go ahead and reference our
object which is planet of course over
here and we're going to define a new
name for this object and it's going to
be the planet Earth there we go
and here's the keyword that creates the
new object new and this will create our
new object and there you go so we're
referencing this template over here
which is planet and we're giving it a
new name of Earth so this is a new
version of this template a new object so
now that we've created an object we can
go ahead and set the variables and call
its methods so here's how we do that we
go ahead and use the object that we've
created
earth dot you'll notice here we're
getting some intellisense here and we're
going to use the attribute that we
defined over here sighs we don't have to
redefine this we already have so we're
just going to say our object dot size
equals and I think it's twenty-five
thousand miles and there we go now we're
getting some intelligence here oh well
guess what guys you probably already
know what the problem here is over here
we defined this as a string but this is
numeric so we just simply need to change
this really quickly to an int and you'll
notice that everything is fine now so
now we have our attribute defined now we
need to do something and we want to
print this out we want to use this
method that we defined over here in
order to do that we type in our new
object again now look guys NetBeans was
smart enough to realize we've already
defined this in our template over here
so we can just go ahead and select that
and there you go we didn't have to
create this method over here again we
could just reference it we don't have to
type in this system dot out print which
is what this method is doing now I want
to point out one thing really quickly
remember I told you the methods and the
class always stays the same you'll
notice we didn't alter the class we
didn't change this method the only thing
that's different is the attribute so
keep that in mind again the attribute is
what changes for each object so let's go
ahead and run this and we should get
this printed out and you should tell us
that earth is 25,000 miles go ahead and
run that and there we go size of the
planet is 25,000 now what we can do is
start to finding other objects we could
go down here and say ok now we're going
to go ahead and define Jupiter though
we're not going to do that here but you
get the idea now how we can keep reusing
this we could create a new program and
start referencing this again so that's
the whole concept of how objects work
now there are many other ways to use
objects and the big one is called
inheritance we're not going to get to
that in this video we will discuss that
in the upcoming video so we're not done
with objects yet this is just the first
way to use them but there are many other
ways okay so that's going to go ahead
and do it for this video please be sure
to check out my other Java tutorials and
I
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
