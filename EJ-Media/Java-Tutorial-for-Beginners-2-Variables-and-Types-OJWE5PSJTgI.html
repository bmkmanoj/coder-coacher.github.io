beginning Java today we're going to talk
about variables and a variable is
basically a think of it as a way the
computer remember something as it runs
your program now there are two ways to
define a variable base are two ways that
are they're created and basically you
have to use the name you have to name
the variable and you also have to give
the type of information at that variable
store so those are the two main things
but just think of it as a way that you
store information that's that's the most
important concept to understand about
variables so we're going to create
actually this program with our the first
program we did in the first tutorial but
we're going to create a new one now okay
so let's create a new program here to
show you variables empty Java file we
will call this testing variables and
I'll cut and paste this so and of course
again the class name should match what
you call the program which is testing
variables Java again once again a
variable is a simple way to store data
for your program it's a way for your
program think of it as a way for your
program to remember it almost gives it a
memory bank a way to remember values so
there's two two things you have to do
with a variable first you have to
declare it and you have to tell it what
type it is in this case we're going to
use int we're going to declare this as
an int variable that's a whole number so
like six seven eight nine there's also
several different ways you can do
doubles which are decimal points and
I'll show you that in a little bit but
we're just going to call this an int
then you have to give it a variable name
you have to tell Java what the name is
and then you can refer to this variable
later on as just touchdown so in this
case we're going to call this touchdown
we're going to use semicolon and now you
have to assign it a value and so we're
going to refer to the variable name that
we just defined we're going to use an
operator here called equals equals is an
operator or we actually tell it
touchdown is equal to and in this case
in college football in the NFL it's
equal to six points so we hit semicolon
again so to review really quickly here
we declare this as an INT we gave it the
name of touchdown and then we in the
second on line four here we assigned it
a value with the equals operator we gave
that six okay okay so let's print this
variable out this is going to be very
similar to what we did in the first
tutorial we're just going to do a system
dot out dot print so we can just go
ahead and copy and paste this into
testing variables are testing variables
program this time we're going to just
print out the variable and all you have
to do between these open paren
parentheses is just put in the variable
name and then we're going to go ahead
and run the file and we should get some
output here and we got six right there
that's the output now like I said we can
also we can also use decimal points here
and to do that we would call this double
so this is how we would we would refer
to this as a double that's the parameter
we'd use and now we can add numbers to
the right and left of the decimal point
so we'll just say it's six point five
now we know that's not true in the NFL
and college football but for testing
purposes it will be and so now we can
use a decimal point we'll go ahead and
run this again you see here we get six
point five this time now the other type
of variable type that stores decimals is
the float variable type so if we put
that in here and there's the the main
difference here is that the float
variable type holds thirty eight figures
and the double type holds up to three
hundred figures so moving along you'll
deal with several different types of
variables so far we have just been
dealing with numeric variables but there
are many other different types of
variables the other big variable types
are characters and string you can define
a
character just like a single letter or
you can do a string which has like a
group of characters to define a
character we need to use the keyword CHR
and that needs no explanation for having
students for a character we're going to
give this a variable name of a letter
and then we're going to use the equals
operand and we're going to assign this
the letter L that's what we're that's
what will be the value the letter L
actually we have to use single quotes
the reason we use single quotes is so
that Java does not think that this we're
actually defining a variable name here
this tells it that it's not a variable
name it's the character L and so now we
already obviously we can get rid of this
line for as well and InTouch for the
touchdown variable name we'll replace
that with the variable name that we just
defined on line three now we can go
ahead and run the file and you see we
get the letter L now in addition you can
also do we're not going to do this here
but you can also define single numbers
punctuation marks and symbols now let's
move on to string variables so we will
define a or use the keyword string you
guessed it string actually should be in
caps the first letter string and we will
define the variable name as sentence and
we will say this is a sentence and we'll
change the letter variable name to what
we defined above to sentence oh and one
more thing we do not first string we do
not use a single quote we use the double
quote so that's why we're getting the
intellisense warning
so let's run this program we get the
sentence this is a sentence so that's it
for character and string variables the
other variable type that is used quite
often is the boolean variable that only
has two values true or false so I'll
show you that quickly here again you're
going to use the boolean whoops we're
spelling that wrong boolean keyword
we're going to just call this
home run equals false and then you could
also put the other value in there true
you will notice that if we try to put
something other than true or false like
1 2 3 you get intellisense warning
saying you that cannot be converted to
boolean but if you put true or false in
there it's fine so that's it for boolean
that's pretty simple I want to spend a
moment talking about how to name your
variables appropriately first
consideration is you want to give your
variable name a relevant name that
describes its purpose you don't want it
for instance if this is about home runs
you don't want to call this base hits
that may be useful to you but later on
somebody else is working on the same
project you will confuse them so if it's
about home runs you should use home runs
the other point I'd like to make is that
variable names are case sensitive in
Java so if I call this home runs and I
capitalize the R and then I go down here
to where we're printing this out and use
the variable name home runs you can see
you get an intellisense they don't match
up so they are case sensitive so if I
capitalize the are there it is they
match up and Java will run this while
we're on the subject of capitalization
if your variable name has multiple words
the first letter of each new word should
have a capital letter but not the first
word in a variable so if I say all time
leaders I should leave the a on
capitalized but capitalize the tea and
then capitalize the L and leaders whoops
all time leaders that's the naming
convention that you should use for
variables one final point I'd like to
make is you cannot use spaces in your
variable so I can't go or - so I can't
go space - that's not going to work you
have to get rid of that there can there
can be no spaces now if you want to if
you need a space you can use underscore
that will that's fine but you cannot put
in spaces so that is it for variables we
will move on to the next tutorial and
have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
