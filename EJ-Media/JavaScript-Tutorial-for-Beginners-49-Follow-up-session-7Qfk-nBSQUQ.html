episode 31 and that's because I've been
getting several questions about that
video and a bug and I'll show you what
happened
so you remember in that episode we
combined these two paragraphs right here
to form one paragraph in one sentence
that says hello there from the moon so
let's go ahead and hit this and of
course it worked like it did in episode
31 but if you hit the button again it
disappears forever if you keep hitting
it nothing ever comes back so what we'll
do in this videos will do bug the code
to find out what happened first because
that's always important to know exactly
where it went wrong and then we'll try
to prevent that from happening
so let's flip over to the JavaScript
code and again this is all the same code
from that video and let's refresh our
page to get back to square one and then
we'll step through the code now the
first thing let's do is let's just see
what we were doing here now you will
remember that we use the get elements by
class name to get of the paragraph
elements and then we took this paragraph
which had an index value of zero and
then we took this paragraph which had an
index value of 1 which is right here of
course and then we combine these two
paragraphs into this third paragraph
which has an index value of 2 and then
what we decided to do is hide these
initial two paragraphs so we did that
right here so let's go ahead and see if
this all works and of course we know it
does now where are we at well this code
really wasn't designed to hit the button
again but if we do in fact do that which
we will let's see what happens well the
codes going to come down here and
there's really nothing to do right it's
not gonna be able to combine paragraphs
there's only one paragraph now so it'll
skip all this code and then come down
here now here's where things go wrong
we're asking to hide this first
paragraph or actually we're not really
hiding it we're just making the text
blank but in any event this paragraph
that we combined during the first run no
longer has this index value of 2 it has
an index value of 0 so this code will
work it'll hide this paragraph which now
has this index value of 0 so let's hit
this button and that's exactly what
happened and now if we hit this button
over and over again nothing will get
executed in this function so that's the
bug and let's refresh our page back
normal so how to fix this well there are
a number of strategies that we can do
the
thing we can do is simply hide the
button so they can't hit it again so
that's we're going to do in this video
we're actually just going to hide this
button to prevent them from doing that
but first we need to give our button
here an ID I don't think we did that a
previous video so let's flip back here
and yes this will need an ID remember we
need to grab this in JavaScript and it's
easier to do that with an ID so let's
give this an ID and we'll just give this
a name of test that should do just fine
so we've got our ID set so let's flip
back to our JavaScript code and we'll go
down here and let's actually create some
code to hide this button so what we're
going to do is use one of our very
favorite methods the get element by ID
method and of course the ID that we're
getting is test now the object we want
to use is the style object remember that
object that allows us to do CSS type
things in JavaScript so we're going to
go ahead and do that now the property
we're going to use is the visibility
property so that's the property that
we're going to be accessing and then the
value that we want to set this to is
hidden and so that should hide the
button after we click the button this
button should be hidden so that the user
can no longer hit it again so let's save
everything up here let's go ahead and
save this and you know what let's
actually flip back to our JavaScript
code so we can watch this when we hit
the button and well you know what I
didn't need a dot there that was a
mistake okay so you can see there's
another bug and now we'll hit our button
and there you can see it worked it got
rid of the button and the user can no
longer click on it which would cause
that nasty little bug where the text
basically disappears forever into the
void but really we should have warned
the user when they hit that button that
they couldn't go back that that button
would disappear and that these changes
were essentially irreversible so what we
need to do now is actually create a
confirmation button to at least give the
user a chance to back out of this
potential change we'll cover that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
