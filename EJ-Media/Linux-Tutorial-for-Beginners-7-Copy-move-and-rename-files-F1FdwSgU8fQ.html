how to create a file in this video we're
going to talk about how to copy files
move files and rename files so let's go
ahead and list out the contents of our
directory and let's go ahead and switch
to our test directory and let's do
another list and there you can see the
note 1 txt we created in the last video
now to copy a file you use the CP
command just like that and then you type
the name of the file that you want to
copy in this case it is note 1 dot txt
and then you just simply name the new
file that you want to copy to and in
this case we're just gonna call it note
2 dot txt and let's go ahead and hit
enter and then let's list out our
directory again and there you can see
we've got our note 2 dot txt which is an
exact duplicate of note 1 dot txt now
what we're gonna do is go ahead and
create some directories and we're gonna
create three directories now in previous
videos we learned how to do that we use
them make derp command but we did not
create multiple directories on the fly
so that's what we're gonna do right now
we're actually gonna create three
directories on the fly and we're gonna
call them door one door two and door 3
and let's go ahead and make sure they
were in fact created and as you can see
they work now what we're gonna do is
actually copy a file to a directory so
what we're gonna do is copy our note 1
dot txt to our dyrone directory and we
use the CP command yet again to do that
so we just type in CP then we type in
note 1 dot txt and then we specify the
directory where we want to copy it to in
this case it is der 1 and let's go ahead
and hit enter and now let's go ahead and
actually switch to our directory 1 and
list it out and make sure our note 1 dot
txt is there and it is in fact there so
that is how you copy a file to a
directory now let's actually move back
to our test directory now you remember
to do that we just type in dot dot and
then a forward slash and that should
take us back one directory to the test
directory we talked about that in the
last video and it in fact did let's go
ahead and do another list and there you
can see we've got our note 1 txt and our
note 2 dot txt now of course we just
copied one file to the dyrone directory
but you can also copy multiple files so
again we use the CP command and
copy both our note 1 and our note 2 dot
txt to our der 2 directory so you just
specify both of those files and then
we're going to type our der 2 and then
let's go ahead and switch to our der two
to make sure they made it and if we do a
list and there you can see they're both
there now let's go ahead and use the
clear command remember that we'll just
clear everything that we've just typed
out so we can get back to the top of the
screen and there we go okay so we talked
about how to copy a file we talked about
how to copy a file to a directory and we
talked about how to copy multiple files
to a directory now you can also copy
directories themselves so let's go ahead
and actually switch back to our test
directory and let's list it out again so
we use the CP command again but this
time we're actually gonna pass an
argument which is minus R and then you
just specify the directory that you want
to copy from which in this case is der 2
and then we copy the destination
directory which in this case is there 3
let's go ahead and hit enter and then
let's go ahead and switch to our der 3
and make sure this worked let's list it
out and there you can see we have the
der 2 directory so that will copy an
entire directory and as you can see it
worked now let's go ahead and actually
switch back to our test again and let's
list this out now what if you want to
rename a file well for that you use the
MV command so what we're gonna do is
actually rename our note 1 dot txt 2
Note 3 dot txt and it's pretty simple as
you'll see here so we just type in note
1 dot txt and then we just type in the
new name that we want in this case no.3
let's go ahead and hit enter and let's
list it out again and you can see it
worked
so that is how you rename a file now you
can also move a file to a directory so
what we're going to do is move note 3
txt to our dirt 2 directory so we use
the MV command again and we'll just
specify note 3 txt and then we'll
specify dirt 2 and let's go ahead and
list out our current contents to make
sure note 3 is no longer there and it's
not and then let's go ahead and switch
to dirt 2 and we'll list it out again
and you can see the note 3 dot txt is
there now how to remove a file well if
you use the RM
command so let's type in RM and let's go
ahead and remove the note 1 dot txt
let's hit enter let's list it out and
you can see it is in fact gone ok we
will continue on in the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
