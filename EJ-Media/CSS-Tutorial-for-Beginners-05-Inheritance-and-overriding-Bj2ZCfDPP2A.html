beginning CSS today we're going to look
at inheritance and overriding and those
are two important concepts to understand
in beginning CSS now in order to discuss
CSS inheritance we have to talk about
the HTML hierarchy that we talked about
in the beginning tutorial set on HTML
now you will remember if you watch that
series that HTML is based off a
hierarchy that is hTML is the root
element and then we have elements that
are nested with inside HTML so there's
the body element and there's the head
element and then there's elements that
are nested within the body element and
the head element so it acts as a
hierarchy and what do you get with a
hierarchy you get inheritance now we
don't care about the head element
because we don't style anything in there
remember we put our CSS in there but
everything that we are styling goes
against elements that are within the
body element so that's all we care about
now we will use the code we used from
the last video and you will remember
that we embedded four elements inside
our body element we had two paragraph
elements and an h1 and h2 element and so
those are nested within the body element
so that's the hierarchy it goes from the
HTML root element to the body element
and to any elements that we put inside
the body furthermore we can nest
elements inside the P and h1 and h2
elements but we will get to that later
on
now it's also useful to build something
out like this for your website so you
can get an idea of how your element tags
are arranged so this is always helpful
to build something like this so this
represents the code we'll be looking at
right now now the way inheritance works
is that if we go ahead and style against
the body element all the child elements
under the parent element the parent
element in this case is the body element
and the child elements are all the
elements below it so the way this works
is let's say we want to universally
change the color of the font for all of
our elements embedded within the body
element and in order to do that we would
create a rule that affected the font
color and that would go against the body
element and then all the child elements
would inherit that and I will show you
guys that right now okay so we're going
to go ahead and open up the source from
the HTML document we
is from the last video and here we have
of course the HTML root element here is
the head element that is nested with
inside of it and here is our body
element and of course we have our h1 and
h2 elements as well as our paragraph
elements right here so those four
elements you just saw now if we go back
up to our CSS here we created a rule to
change the color of the paragraph
elements to red so we're going to go
ahead and actually let's copy and paste
this because now we're going to go ahead
and create a rule against the body what
I just talked about and we're going to
go ahead and remove everything except
for the color and we're going to change
the color of the text to green and we're
going to get rid of this rule right here
we'll come back to this in a minute
we're going to get rid of that and we
will change this to body and now we've
got a rule that goes against the body so
we're going to be at the top of the
hierarchy here we're hitting right here
the body element tag and now all the
text in here now should be changed to
green so let's go ahead and save that
and we'll open it up and there you can
see all of our tags within that body Elm
inherited that green font color and the
key here is we did not have to specify
let's go back to the code I'll show you
this and the key to understand this is
we did not have to specify any green
color in any of these CSS rules they
simply inherited from the body rule
because that is again at the top of the
hierarchy now you might be asking
yourself well how do I individually
change the color for each one of these
now since everything will be green but
what if I wanted the paragraph elements
to have that color red again I still
wanted to retain that yet I wanted
everything else to be green well that's
where overwriting comes into play so if
we just copy and paste this here and
change this to red this rule now will
override this rule so inheritance only
works is if you don't have an identical
rule in the child elements but if you
override it this will be red now and I
will show that to you so let's go ahead
and save this and you can see here now
that the paragraph elements are red we
override it the rule that we had against
the body but the h1 and h2 elements
remain green because we didn't have any
specific rule there to override our CSS
body rule and so that's how that works
I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
