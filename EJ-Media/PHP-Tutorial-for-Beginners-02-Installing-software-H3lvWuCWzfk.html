the software that you need to follow
along in this series now the first thing
you'll need is notepad plus plus and
this is the main webpage for notepad
plus plus I will provide this link in
the description of this video and all
you have to do is hit this download link
right here and then it will take you to
another page and then you just download
the current version it's a very simple
install it should only take you a few
seconds there's really not a lot to
installing notepad plus plus but then we
need to install a server and what we're
going to use as I mentioned in the last
video is zamp and this is the main page
for zamp
I will provide a link for this as well
so you'll click on that link in the
description of this video and you'll
come here and you'll want to select this
download link right here zamp for
windows now in this series we'll be
using
zamp on windows now you can use it for
Linux or Apple if you choose to but
it'll be up to you to configure the
server we're going to do this in Windows
so you'll download zamp for Windows and
once you're done it will download an
executable you just double-click that
and all you really have to do is hit the
next button a few times it's very simple
install then once you do that you'll
want to open up the zamp control panel
this may be in your Start programs I
actually just put this shortcut on my
desktop and you'll want to open that up
and here is where we can fire everything
up that we need now we only need Apache
at this point so you're just going to
hit start here and it will fire it up
and you can see it's accessing ports 80
and 443 now if you do have a port
conflict then you'll have to resolve
that so for instance if you have another
program out there that's using a port
that Apache needs you'll have to stop
that service but you'll see down here
you'll get a message and it will tell
you that it's running and it will be
green highlighted in green to tell you
that it's running if it has a problem it
will give you all these nice little
error messages you can actually click on
this logs button right here and it may
give you some diagnostic messages now
next what you want to do is hit this
Explorer button right here and this will
take you to the default directory where
zamp was installed and the folder that
we're going to be operating out of is
htdocs' so we're going to put all of our
documents in here our PHP file actually
will go in here we'll do that in the
next lecture I just wanted to show
this so that's where we're going to save
it and so this will actually be served
out and we'll actually be able to access
it through a browser and execute our PHP
code and we'll actually get to that in
the next video so that's it go ahead and
get those two applications installed and
ready to go and I'll see you in the next
video where we will code up our very
first PHP script</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
