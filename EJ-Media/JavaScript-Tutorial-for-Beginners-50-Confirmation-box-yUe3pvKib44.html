left off in the last video and of course
we hit this button here and we fixed
sort of a bug and what we did was we hid
this button so that the user couldn't
keep hitting it and the text would
disappear forever and of course it works
but that's sort of bad form not to warn
the user that the changes are permanent
so what we want to do in this video is
add a confirmation box that's what we
want to do we want to basically add a
confirmation box so that we can let them
know that these changes are in fact
final so that's what we're going to do
in this video so first let's go ahead
and add the confirmation box so we're
going to put this right here and the
confirmation box by the way is similar
to the alert box the only difference is
you get a cancel button whereas with the
alert box you only get a ok' button so
there's no other option you have to hit
OK and then your code will do whatever
you want your code to do so all we do is
type in confirm instead of alert and
then we're going to put some stuff here
in the parenthesis and we're simply
going to say these changes are final we
could write something like hit OK to
proceed but if you want to do that you
can I'm not going to okay and then let's
just go ahead and put a semicolon here
and that should give us our confirm box
so let's go ahead and refresh our page
and if we hit the submit button we get
our confirmation box if we hit OK yeah
that's great it did it that's what we
said we wanted to do we said go ahead
and make the change let's refresh back
let's go ahead and cancel out ah it
still did it anyways now that's not what
we want if we hit the cancel button we
want that to keep the original state now
why didn't that work well take a look at
the code there's nothing to stop it from
executing this code right no matter what
we do at the confirm box all these lines
are going to be executed no matter what
we do so we need to use an if statement
and if statement to the rescue remember
we can deal with multiple outcomes using
an if statement so that's what we need
to do but before we do that we need to
put this confirm box in a variable so
let's do that and you know we just write
in var and let's just call this
confirmation so we'll say that equals
and of course our confirm box right here
good now what we want to do is
wrap all of this code now in an if
statement so let's go right up here and
of course you know we use the keyword if
actually let's give this a space and
then in parentheses we're going to put
our argument of course and here is where
we're going to use our variable and
that's why we needed this variable so we
could use it down in our if statement
and we're going to use an equality
operator now which of course is equals
equals and we're going to set this to
true now we're going to need an extra
set of squiggly brackets so let's just
copy and paste this here and then we'll
need to close it out down here that's
all good and so now all this code is now
wrapped inside of our if statement so
what we're doing here is we're testing
to see if it's true remember this
doesn't set it to true we're just
testing to see if it is true if they hit
the OK button
if that is true then all of this code
will be executed if it's false then as
you know all this code will be skipped
and it will exit out of the if statement
and nothing will happen now we could put
an else right down here you could put an
else down here remember we dealt with
that earlier in the series you could put
it else down here and put some code for
when they hit the cancel button but
we're not going to do that we want it
back at the original state so let's go
ahead and see if this works
so we'll refresh let's go ahead and hit
the submit button we cancel and look at
that it worked right the code was not
executed now let's go ahead and hit this
again and let's make sure the ok button
still works and it does look at that so
that's how you do a confirmation button
and you always want to use an if
statement if you have multiple buttons
in your dialog box and in this case we
did and you can keep this set of code
for the future when you have multiple
buttons you can use this if statement in
other words it doesn't have to be this
confirm box you could use any type of
box or dialog box that you pop up and
you could use this same if statement to
do something when they hit a particular
button okay that's going to do it for
this video I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
