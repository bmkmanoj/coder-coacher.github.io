options that you can use with the dialog
box now the first thing we can do is add
a title and we use that with the title
property now I should say that if you
put a title up here in the div element
that would also be placed in the dialog
box but you can also do that from here
as well so let's go ahead and load up
the page and there you can see we have
our title so let's go ahead and close
this out now you can also disable the
dialog box as well and I've got the code
already typed out so I'll just go ahead
and copy and paste this right in here
and you just set that to false now you
may ask well why would you do that well
perhaps you have to just disable it
temporarily or you're going to add a
function down here that will reopen the
box so maybe you don't want the dialog
box to automatically come up when the
page first loads and whoops we don't
need that extra bracket let's get rid of
that all right let's go ahead and save
this we'll reload our page and there you
can see we didn't get the dialog box now
let's go ahead and set this to true and
we got our dialog box back now you'll
notice that we can drag this around
anywhere we want you can also disable
that and you do that by using the
draggable property and you just simply
set that to false so let's go ahead and
see if that works and it did I can't
drag this anywhere around the screen so
that's how that works and actually let's
go ahead and reload the page real quick
here
you might have noticed before that you
can actually resize the dialog box and
you can also disable that as well so
let's go ahead and do that and you do
that by using the resizable property and
you just set that to false so let's go
ahead and save everything up and let's
make sure that we cannot resize the
window and I can't it's now disabled so
I can't move the dialog box and I can't
resize the window so you can lock all of
that down if you wish to now you can
also change the default height in the
width of the dialog box and we use that
width the height and width property so
let's go ahead and put in height here
and we'll go ahead and put within right
here and let's give the height 500
pixels so we'll set that and we'll set
the width to 600 pixels so let's go
ahead and save this up and let's see
what we get and there you can see we get
a much larger box now we can also use
the show in the hide properties remember
we've used those in previous videos we
can do that right here and this
basically will allow us to control how
long it takes to first show the dialog
box so let's set that to 150
milliseconds and then we can also
control how long it takes to close the
dialog box so let's go ahead and we'll
set that to 1,500 milliseconds so it
should appear very quickly but it will
take a little bit longer for it to
disappear so let's go ahead and see what
we get and there you can see it came up
relatively fast now let's see what
happens when we close it see how it took
a little bit longer so again you can
play around with those values now we can
also go ahead and put effects in here so
let's go ahead and do that and we'll use
that bounce effect and we've used that
of course many times before and for when
we close it let's actually do an explode
effect so let's go ahead and save this
and we'll see what we get so there you
can see the dialog box was initially
loaded with a bounce effect and let's
see what happens when we close it we get
that nice explode effect okay that's
going to do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
