various options that you can use with a
tooltip widget now you will remember
that we need these little squiggly
brackets to place the particular
property that we want to use now the
first property that we're going to cover
is the content property now for the
content we just used
Julius himself that's what we put in the
title attribute but with the content
property you can override that and put
something else in there so you just use
the content keyword and then you will
remember we need a colon and then we can
put the text that we want to display and
we'll just put something in different
here let's just put in Hail Caesar so
let's go ahead and save this will
refresh our page and there you can see
it worked our new content is displayed
now we can also use the track property
and basically the tooltip will track
wherever you place the mouse over the
particular element that you're
associating the tooltip with and in this
case of course it will be our Julius
Caesar image so let's go ahead and put
in the track property and for this all
we do is set this to true pretty simple
so let's go ahead and save this and
we'll refresh our page and there you can
see look at this the tooltip is now
tracking our mouse over the image that's
pretty cool now one thing really cool
about the jQuery UI is that they provide
all of these cool effects now I want to
point out that the effects that we're
going to use for the tooltip UI is
applicable to many of the other
different widgets but they really work
well with the tooltip widget so that's
why I'm showing you some of these
effects with the tooltip widget but just
keep in mind that you can use these with
the different types of widgets so the
first thing we're going to do is specify
the effect property and we put that
right here and then you can pass in the
different types of effects that you want
to do and we use quotes for that and
first we're going to specify pulsate
that's a really cool one that's actually
one of my favorites and we'll put a
comma here and then you can specify a
duration and that's another property so
you can basically specify how long do
you want the effect to last and in this
case we're going to specify 800
milliseconds so we just go ahead and put
in 800 right here now we're not done we
actually
need to use a third property which is
the show property and we actually need a
different set of squiggly brackets with
that show property so we actually put
that outside of this so we specify that
right here and we use a colon and
actually let's rearrange this a little
bit so we have a little bit more room
here and like I said we need a different
set of squiggly brackets so let's go
ahead and do that we'll put that right
here and actually it automatically put
that second one in but we want to put
that other squiggly bracket right here
so there you can see we've got the show
property and then with inside the show
property we're specifying the effect
that we want to use along with the
duration this is the exact format that
you can use going forward if you want to
use effects so let's go ahead and save
this and let's go ahead and refresh our
page and there you can see we got that
cool little pulsate now there are many
different types of effects you will
remember we use the fade in before and
we can use that right here so let's go
ahead and do that and we'll refresh our
page and now we get a nice fade in
another one I like is the bounce effect
so let's take a look at that and we'll
refresh our page and there you can see
that cool little bounce there's also the
explode effect this is actually a really
popular one so let's refresh our page
and there you can see we get that cool
explode you can also highlight the
tooltip and what that will do basically
is when we hover over our image it will
give you a quick highlight it's kind of
a nice little effect that you can use
with your tooltip and there you can see
the highlight now that will disappear
now if you wanted that to stay up a
little bit longer you could of course
increase the duration final one that I'm
going to show you is the blind effect
this is another very popular effect and
let's take a look and see what we get
here and there you can see you got that
cool little blind effect okay that's
gonna do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
