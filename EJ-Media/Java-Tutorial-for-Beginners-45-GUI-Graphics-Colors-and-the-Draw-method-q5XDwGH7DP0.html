tutorial we're continuing on with
graphics so we're going to use the same
exact code that we used in the last
video but I want you to do a couple
things I want you to clear out the paint
component method so clear out all the
code we had in there because we're going
to add some new code now in this
tutorial we're going to do two things
first we're going to add some custom
colors and secondly we're going to use
the draw method so we're actually going
to draw a string but first let's do some
custom color so I'm going to go ahead
and I've already got this type down so
I'm going to go ahead and paste this in
here and then you can if you're
following along you can go ahead and
type this in and so what I did here was
I created a couple variables one called
bright yellow and obviously that's going
to be a bright yellow color and I
created another variable to hold a dark
green color and so this will be right
before the fire up screen method so
we've we've got these two here now the
way this works is these are RGB values
and I'll show you how you can use these
with Microsoft Paint or any paint
application that you have because any
paint application that you're using
should display RGB values so open up
paint and let's see if we can rearrange
this window a little bit here so you can
see this and hit edit colors and then go
ahead and move the pointer up to let's
move this up to purple we'll switch this
up here and you can see these are the
RGB values so this first value red
corresponds to this value over in our
method that's what we're passing in
there and obviously the second one is
green that corresponds to the second
argument that we're passing in and the
third is blue and those three colors
actually make up every color in the
spectrum that combination of colors so
that's how you get a custom color so in
this tutorial you can use whatever color
you want now I would make your variable
name somewhat relevant if it's a bright
yellow name it bright yellow not black
or something so that when we use this
later on which we will in our paint
component method it will make sense to
us okay so now we've got our custom
color variables defined up here and now
we can go ahead and use them in our
paint component method but first things
first I want to
something out we are going to actually
use the 2d graphics class and it's
hidden it's actually a sub class within
graphics and I will show you that right
now
I actually alright had this typed out so
I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste
this in here now what is going on here
is this graphics 2d class here is a
subclass of graphics and if we right
click on that and navigate you'll see
that right here we go to the source you
can see that this is extending the
graphics 2d classes extending off of
graphics so that's how we get to it
that's how we can use it now if we
switch back to our source so what we're
doing here is we're actually doing a
cast to create our object we're not
actually going to use the new keyword
and if you remember that tutorial that I
did way back on casting we're actually
going to use that here so we're doing a
cast into our object which we can name
whatever we want we're going to call it
G 2d for graphics 2d and so that's what
we're doing we're just casting this
class into our object and now we can go
ahead and use the graphics 2d methods
and so let's do that now and the first
thing we're going to do is actually
create another rectangle we did that in
the last video but we're going to create
a rectangle and and then we're going to
draw a string onto that rectangle using
the draw method so let's go ahead and
first create our rectangle so let's go
ahead and use our object and we're going
to look for set color and there it is
and look it plugged in dark green so
we're using this variable up here dark
green and so that will be the color of
our rectangle and now of course we need
to make our rectangle which we did in
the last video it'll be the same thing
and we're just going to do g2d dot we
need to find the fill rectangle method
which is right here and we need to go
ahead and add our dimensions and it'll
be pretty much the same thing we did in
the last video we'll make these 200 by
100 there so now we've got our rectangle
and we can actually run this now and we
should have a green rectangle and there
you can see we've got our dark green
rectangle but now we want to draw
something on to it so
let's go ahead and use our next color
and we will set that again we'll
actually use the set color method and in
this case we're going to use our bright
yellow there we go
and now we will go ahead and use the
drawstring method to draw a string you
see here you can draw a bunch of
different things and you guys can
actually play around with these
different methods you can draw an image
you can draw a polygon you can draw all
sorts of different things ovals so we're
going to use the draw string method in
this example but you guys can go ahead
and use these other methods and play
around with them so let's pick the draw
string this will second option right
here and what we're going to do in this
first argument we're going to go ahead
and create some text and this is the
string that we're going to draw so we're
just going to say this is a test
something very sweet and simple and then
let's pass in here five and ten or
something you guys can play around with
these different attributes and let's
stop this actually okay why was that
running oh that was running from the
last run I didn't stop it okay so let's
go ahead and run this and there you can
see we've drawn a string so that is it
for this video I will see you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
