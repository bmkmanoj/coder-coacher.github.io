default.aspx page which is of course our
first content page and we created our
master page now what we want to do is
get rid of this index.html because we no
longer want to serve this out we want
everything to be in our default.aspx and
everything in our master page dot master
and so we're going to extract all of the
HTML out of here and put them into the
master page in default dot aspx and then
at the end of this lecture we will
delete the index.html out of the root
because we don't want that being served
out and then the default dot aspx will
be served out pulling the template from
the master page so first thing we're
going to do actually is work against our
master page and then we'll work against
our default.aspx so first again we're
going to look at the master page master
and I've got them both open right here
I've got the index.html and the master
page master now what we want to do is
get all the ASP code out of here and can
put it into our index.html that's really
the easy way to do this and then what we
can do is just copy and paste everything
back into our master page master so
that's what we're going to do well we
need this code up here remember this
identifies it as a master page so let's
go ahead and copy all that let's go back
to our index.html and we will put this
above our doctype declaration so I'll
just copy and paste that right there
that's good
now we don't need this ASP code right
here for now because this is pretty good
we're just going to point to the same
stylesheet this is complaining about a
title so let's just put in a title so
we'll put in a title tag here and this
just appears at the top of our web page
and since this is sort of a history
thing we're developing here we'll just
say history website
and there you can see we got rid of the
intellisense so that's all good actually
like I said we don't need to use any of
this ASP code right now in our head
section we'll come back to this later we
don't need this as well what we really
need it are these ASP tags right here
these are the two Biggie's so we're
going to copy these so what I want you
to do first is we're going to copy this
first one and we're going to place this
right in our main our main div because
that is where our content is going to be
like I said in the last lecture so the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to put actually you know what
let's go back to the master page dot
master and let's copy all this I made a
mistake there and then what we're going
to do is just paste that right below our
div main so put that right there
and don't worry about this intellisense
right now so that's actually good we've
actually got everything we need right
now I also want to change this right now
to main content and we're going to call
this one and I'll talk about that in a
few minutes as well so that we're going
to change the ID now this is our content
but remember what I said in the last
video the content will not go in our
master page it'll go in our default.aspx
which again is the first content page it
gets loaded so we need to go ahead and
copy this content and we'll just copy
this we can go ahead and get rid of it
and then we'll go over to our default
aspx and right between this second level
of code here all the this code right
here these two ASP tags we're going to
go ahead and copy and paste our content
see how easy that is by the way to add
content from now on we can just put
content right between these two ASP tags
and it's just that easy now we're not
going to use this first set of code here
so just go ahead and get rid of that and
we're going to switch this to content
one I'll explain all this later and
we're going to switch this to main
content one to match up what we did in
our master page main content one good
okay and that intellisense will go out
away in a second and we'll deal with
this intellisense as well by the way
before you ever load a page you'll want
to get rid of this until
that the compiler is complaining about
so you have just have to look at these
and as I said we'll be able to deal with
these in a few minutes okay so now we've
got all this code that looks ready to go
so what we're going to do is copy and
paste all of this so you can just do a
select all if you want and we're going
to copy this over all this default code
that we had in our master page and there
you go now we've converted our
index.html into a template that is our
master page dot master so we can just go
ahead and close this out now we don't
need to save it who cares and we're
going to delete it remember we made a
backup of it already so we're just gonna
go ahead and delete that that is gone
now and now let's go ahead and fix some
of this intellisense so let's look at
this and see cannot find main content
one in the current master page dot
master that's weird because we have it
right here main content one let's look
at this and there you see it went away
sometimes by the way and this is strange
with Visual Studio if you just you click
around a little bit it's like it loses
focus the fact that we made a change
over here this main content 1 so if you
just switch to the next tab and tab over
you can see that it went away because
that really was erroneous if you look
here are these match up here's our main
content 1 and here's our main content 1
they match up just fine so let's go
ahead and do a save all and let's just
check a couple more things here and I'm
talking to myself so right now sorry
just checking to make sure everything
looks good ok so let's go ahead and fire
this up and we're going to view in the
browser and there you can see our page
loads now it looks of course very
similar to the web page we had with the
index.html but things are very different
now because now we are serving out an
asp website and now if you get some
strange funky errors sometimes that
occurs when you first try to load your
website from an ASP web page so
sometimes you got close out of Visual
Studio restarted up and then fire it
back up sometimes I do so I just you
have to close out of Visual Studio
anyways but this code is good because
you can see I just was able to fire it
up by the way I will create pasted links
for both of these web pages in the
description
this video okay so now let's examine a
few things what did we do well we're
going to kind of regurgitate what we
talked a little bit in the last video
but now we can really start to point
things out and hopefully it'll be a
little bit clearer now as I said this
master page is just a template we never
put any content in here that's why when
we put these ASP tags down here we
didn't put any content in here it
doesn't go here because remember our
content pages are just pulling the
master page as a template all the
content has to go in our content page in
this case the very first page the
default aspx that's why I put the
content in here that's why this tag
looks a little bit different you'll see
here it says ASP content that identifies
this as content that's why we put the
content between the ASP opening content
tag and the ASP closing content tag I
don't want you to worry about this right
now this ID we'll talk about this later
but what I do want you to worry about is
this content placeholder ID main content
1 now if we go back to the master page
we have to identify this section in our
template where we want to put content so
that's what we did first here we use
this ASP content placeholder tag and
then we establish an ID for it which we
call main content 1 it gets linked up
over here in our content page because we
specified it right here we said hey use
this content placeholder ID main content
1 that's where I want my content to go
so this placeholder and that's what you
go on to think of this as is just a
placeholder this right here ties us to
this particular content on our content
page main content 1 so they have to sync
up that's the main point I want you to
realize now this runat server don't
worry about this too much but basically
all this says is hey I want you to run
our ASP code on the web server and
that's the default and that's the way it
should be so that's all that is pretty
simple so again when we load this page
over here the first thing that happens
is the default dot aspx gets loaded and
it realizes oh I've got a template I
need to pull from it comes here pulls
the template and then if we go back to
our default aspx page and then the
content gets merged with this template
so it's really a two-step
process the default.aspx and the master
page that master get merged to former
and product that's how it works now to
really point this out now you don't have
to file this you can just watch what I
do so I'm going to go ahead and copy
this and then I'm going to delete it and
then I'm going to go ahead and save it
and let's go ahead and view our website
now and there you can see our contents
gone we just have the template that's
all it's getting loaded because we don't
have any content anymore now let's go
back and I'm going to put the content
actually in here and I want you to see
this so we're going to our master page
now and we're going to put in the
content right in here which we're not
supposed to do remember this is just a
placeholder no content should go in here
let's do a save all and let's go ahead
and load our website again and look at
that no content that's because the only
thing that's going to get loaded is our
template so even though we put that here
does not work so we need to put this
back onto our content page we go back
here and again you always stick it
between the opening content in the
closing content ASP tag and let's go
ahead now and save all and if we load
this now we should get our content back
and there you can see we get it back and
actually basically this gets easier now
right all we have to do for our next
content page is put all of our content
between these two ASP tags that's all we
have to do so we don't have to add all
this extra HTML now see how much easier
it is to use master and content pages we
don't have to create all this extra HTML
for every page we do we can just create
a Content template and all we do now is
just dump in the content that we want so
it's much easier to manage your website
using the master content page
relationship and so like I said in the
next video we're going to create a drill
down to our Rome content and so of
course this will change in the next
video till the dot aspx web page and so
I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
