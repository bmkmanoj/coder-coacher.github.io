the accordion widget in jQuery now this
is one of the most popular widgets in
the jQuery UI universe it packs a lot of
power and basically what it'll allow us
to do is create panels that we can
collapse for each one of our sections
now you can see here I've updated this
main section the left section if we
scroll up here you can see I've created
three main sections in our left section
I've created a section on ancient Rome a
section on ancient Greece and a section
on ancient Egypt so you can see those
three sections here so what we want to
do is apply the accordion widget to all
of these sections and get those nice
collapsible panels now the first thing
we need to do of course is decide how we
want to accomplish that we could create
an ID for each one of these divs but
that's a lot of unnecessary work we
could also use this ID but I prefer to
keep this clean so let's go ahead and
create a separate div container so that
we can wrap all of our sections in that
container so let's just go ahead and
we'll copy and paste this right below
and we'll give this a different ID here
we'll give this an ID of panels nice and
original right for collapsible panels
and then we need to just come down here
and close it out and so let's just go
ahead and copy impes this and we can
just put this right here so now we've
closed it out so basically we've got all
of our sections now wrapped inside this
div element tag that we gave an idea of
panels and this is the ID that we're
going to use for our jQuery code we're
going to reference in it down here so
let's go ahead and you know let's keep
our tooltip for Julius let's not get rid
of that might as well keep it so we'll
just copy and paste this line and we'll
put it right down here and then we need
to of course reference our ID which of
course is panels and now we need to
specify the accordion method and there
we go so let's go ahead and save this
let's refresh our page and take a look
at that all of our sections now are in
these nice collapsible panels now let me
go ahead and scroll up here so that I
can talk a little bit more about this
and how this works so you can see by
default our first section our
section on ancient Rome is open that's
the first one but you can see how much
space we're saving up take a look at
that this is the ultimate space saver
see how much space we have down here if
you remember this Julius Caesar image
was crunched all the way at the bottom
here but now we have all this space so
it really allows you to pack a lot of
content within a confined area and also
these panels just look really awesome in
my opinion so let's go ahead and we'll
open up the second section on Greece and
notice now the first section is
collapsed and the section that we wanted
open reveals the content on ancient
Greece and let's open up the third
section and you can see now the top two
sections are collapsed so that's how it
works
now the way this works is the head line
for each one of these sections will be
pulled from the h2 header whatever we
have in here so you can see the first
section corresponds to what we have in
this h2 element and the same for the
ancient Greece header and the same for
the ancient Egypt header now what
happens is the jQuery UI will find this
h2 header and will display whatever
content we have and of course it reads
section on ancient Rome and then it will
look for the next block level element
which in this case is this div tag and
that will be the content within the
section so basically the div must come
right after the h2 element in order for
this to work properly
so again you just have to remember that
after h2 element you immediately want
your div and it'll be the same for every
section that you want so basically just
an h2 element or an h3 or an h1 whatever
you want and then the block level
element which is likely going to be a
div that's how it works and you know let
me show you an example of what happens
if you get rid of one of the h2 elements
so let's go ahead and we'll just you
don't have to do this but I'll do it
let's go ahead and just get rid of this
for a second so I'll go ahead and save
this and you're going to see what
happens here see what happened it took
the text from her div and it just made
that the header so that's why you need
that h2 element and you can't even
really collapse it anymore there's
nothing to collapse it basically made
that the header and your content is
essentially gone so that's why you need
the h2 element so let's go ahead and
just copy and paste that back in here
and we'll save this will refresh our
page and now it's back to normal okay
that's going to do it for this video and
the
next video we will review the options
and there are many options for the
accordion widget see you guys on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
