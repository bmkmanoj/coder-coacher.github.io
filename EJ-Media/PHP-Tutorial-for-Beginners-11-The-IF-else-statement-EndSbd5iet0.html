left off in the last video with
conditionals and we of course looked at
the if statement and we had a set of
code that was executed if the
conditional was true but now we want to
create a block of code to be executed
when the condition is false and that is
where the else statement comes into play
so the else works with the if statement
it's the block of code that gets
executed if the condition turns out to
be false so all we do is write the
keyword else here and then we need a
curly brace and let's just go ahead and
echo out the condition was false and
we'll just put that in right here so if
our statement turns out to be false we
will just put out a string that says the
condition is false now we know from the
last video this condition will turn out
to be true because 6 does equal the
value that's in our variable which is 6
so let's go ahead and get rid of the
equal sign now and we know that this is
now not true because this value here 6
is not greater than 6 at least on this
planet so let's go ahead and save this
and if this works PHP will not execute
these statements because this block of
code again only gets executed if it's
true it should skip down to our else and
execute that statement so let's go ahead
and hit our lesson dot PHP over here and
that's exactly what we got the condition
is false now just to make sure things
are working here let's go ahead and add
our equal sign back and now our
condition should test out to be true
so our first block of code should be
executed and again it's always the first
block of code that gets executed if the
condition turns out to be true so let's
go ahead and refresh our page here and
it worked so you can see this is pretty
simple and again we're just handling two
different outcomes a true outcome and a
false outcome now we can actually add
other outcomes and we'll talk about that
in the next video see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
