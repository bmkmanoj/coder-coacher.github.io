look at events in jQuery now if you
haven't taken my JavaScript series and I
hope you have you should go take the
events part of that series because I
talk about events and they're very
similar in jQuery they're just handled a
little bit differently
now of course events are what allow us
to respond to users so when the user
does something we can perform a
particular action and of course we've
been using events we've been using the
click method which gives us the click
event but we're going to look at
different events in the next several
videos now it's a three-step process in
jQuery very similar to JavaScript by the
way we need to select the element that
we want to attach the event to and then
we need to add our event so if you look
at this code that we used in the last
video the button of course is the
element that we're selecting we attach
the click method which gives us the
click event of course and then we need
to perform an action in this case we
removed the attribute that's the action
that we did so let's take a look at a
new jQuery method and that of course is
the mouse-over method and it is
identical of course to the JavaScript
mouse-over event it gives us that event
and let's actually work against the IMG
element so this first part we need to
select our element and then let's
actually add the code for the action
that we want to do and what we're gonna
do is select all the paragraphs on our
web page and we're going to use the text
method remember that let's start using
some of the different methods that we've
learned about and we'll create the text
all hail julius caesar so when we mouse
over julius caesar all the rest of the
paragraphs will have that text all hail
julius caesar so let's go ahead and save
this and actually let's go ahead and
just reload our page so I close that
window out and keep an eye when I hover
over the image all this text should
change to all hail Julius Caesar and it
did take a look at that now we'll talk
about how to remove this or when we
mouse off of it in the next video well
there's actually a different method we
have to use but for now this will just
always stay up here now let's do
something a little bit different let's
actually select the button
and let's reselect the button and what
we're going to do is change the color of
the text in our button so we'll use the
CSS method of course for that and I'm
just going to copy and paste what I have
here and in this case what we're gonna
do you'll remember that this is the
property that's the color property and
we're gonna change it to red so we have
two values that we need to set here and
we'll save this let's go ahead and
reload our page and there you can see
when we hovered over the button the
color changes to red now let's actually
go ahead and put our image back here so
when we mouse over our image we want
something to happen and what we're gonna
do is we're gonna select our last
section here so that is of course you
should know this by now hopefully pound
right so we'll select our last section
and what we're gonna do is use the
append method remember that I'm just
gonna copy and paste this in here so
when we mouse over this image now we
will append a new paragraph remember a
pen just creates a new paragraph for us
with text remember it makes it the last
element so it should be the last element
so this will be like a message that will
give back to the user when they hover
over this image so let's go ahead and
close this out let's save this let's go
ahead and run this in chrome and when we
hover over the image look we got our
message and if we keep overing over it
will get more and more messages and
again I will show you how to remove
those in the next video and let's go
ahead and close this out and let's
actually use the after method now
remember that and that will actually
place it outside of our last section so
let's go ahead and save this let's run
this in chrome and there you can see
when I hovered over it
it placed the message outside of our
section which is what we wanted so you
can see how these different methods all
work together with the different events
and you can really start to play around
now with all the methods that you've
learned start putting different methods
in here and doing different things
that's what it's all about in jQuery Ads
very very easy to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
