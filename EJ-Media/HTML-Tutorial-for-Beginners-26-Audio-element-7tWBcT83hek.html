audio element tag that is new to html5
now in this era of digital media HTML
has caught up with the times and they
provided easy ways to put audio and
video files onto your web page and in
this video we're going to discuss the
audio element tag now you will need an
mp3 file to follow along with this
lecture or a WAV file or a dot OGG file
and you'll want to copy that to the same
folder where your index.html is located
now you'll see here I've placed a
comment in the HTML source and I've just
said the three standard formats are mp3
wav and dot ODG but probably you'll want
to use mp3 that is pretty much the
standard format these days and you can
see here here is the audio element tag
and is just like any other tag you need
to have an opening tag and a closing tag
now there are several attributes but the
main attribute that you absolutely have
to use is the controls attribute and you
can see I've placed that right here and
that will basically place a nice control
on our webpage where we can play
whatever mp3 we want to play and you can
pretty much put any name you want in
here I just made this audio controls
inside the audio element tag is the
source element tag and this is where you
can specify your audio file and here's
the source attribute and you can see
here I've just pointed to the test1 dot
mp3 now you can actually take this
source attribute and just put it right
up here if you want you could do that
and if you feel pretty confident that
your file will be supported for all the
browser's you can do that but if you
want to have multiple versions of your
audio file in other words if you want an
mp3 a dot wave and a dot o GG version
you need to use the source element tag
and so let's go ahead and do that even
though we don't have a dot wave and
we'll just copy and paste this in here
and we'll just make this wav e Boop's
dot wav sorry about that now the way
this works is if for some reason the
browser can't load the dot mp3 version
it will try and go ahead and load the
dot wav version that's the way this
works and even though we don't have a
dot wav version in here you probably
should do that and that's just a good
standard operating procedure even though
most of the browser's today support all
the different flavors that are out there
it's always a good idea just in case and
there
several audio conversion tools out there
where you can convert your audio files
so that being said let's go ahead and
save this let's open up our browser I'm
going to use Google Chrome and there you
can see we have this nice control and
once again if we didn't have this
attribute here this would not appear so
let's go ahead and hit play this is an
audio test for our test one dot mp3 oh
my isn't that just an awesome voice who
is that
I wonder okay I have a horrible sense of
humor I know in any event that is the
audio element tag now there are other
different types of attributes that we
can use with the audio element tag and
we will discuss that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
