couple of different items we're going to
review the hidden class as well as using
multiple classes to size your elements
for the particular devices so first
let's talk about the hidden class and if
we take a look at our grid here let's
say we have some work to do on this
column seven something's wrong with it
we need to fix it and so temporarily we
just want to go ahead and hide it well
we can do that with the hidden class in
bootstrap this is very similar to when
you hide elements in CSS bootstrap just
makes it a little bit easier to do so
again we want to just go ahead and hide
our column seven so let's flip to our
code and all we do is come down here and
we're just gonna go ahead and tag on a
hidden keyword here which will invoke
the hidden class so let's go ahead and
save this and let's just make sure that
column is no longer there and it isn't
take a look at that now let's say that
column seven looks okay in our grid in
medium-sized and large sized devices but
it has a problem when we minimize it
when we go down here and we minimize it
it doesn't look so good so we only want
to minimize it for extra small devices
well we can do that as well so we just
come here we put in a hyphen and then
put in XS for extra small devices now
this should only be hidden on small
devices or when we are on a small
resolution so let's go ahead and save
this let's reload this and hopefully
this will now load on the medium sized
resolution and it does now let's go
ahead and minimize it and let's make
sure it's gone and it is so that's how
that works it's pretty simple
so let's go ahead and get rid of this
and we're back to normal we'll just go
ahead and save to keep everything clean
now what we've been doing so far is
we've had all of our column size in this
medium sized resolution but let's go
ahead and load our webpage again so what
we've done is everything we've used has
been the MD device type for the size of
our columns and even when we minimize
these these are still in the MD size
type now maybe we want these columns
let's actually maximize out here maybe
maybe we want these bottom columns here
to size differently when we go to a
smaller device type or a smaller
resolution well we can do that using
multiple
so let's go ahead and do that so let's
go ahead and close out of our browser
and what we're gonna do is tag on
another class here and let's just go
ahead and copy and paste this so pasted
right here and we're gonna make this
extra small and let's set this to six
size six and you know what let's go
ahead and we'll just go ahead and copy
and paste this into all of our columns
here and there we go so let's go ahead
and do a save now what should happen now
is when we're in a larger resolution
we'll still get this MD size but when we
go to a small device or an extra small
resolution
we'll get this new column size so let's
go ahead and load our page and let's see
what we get so there you can see we've
got our medium sized column still in
this larger resolution that let's go
ahead and minimize this and we'll see
what we get
take a look at that see how that's
different now the extra small class that
we created is kicking in and these
probably size a little bit better for a
smaller device type as you can see
probably a little bit nicer than these
larger columns maybe you want this size
alright so that's gonna do it for this
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
