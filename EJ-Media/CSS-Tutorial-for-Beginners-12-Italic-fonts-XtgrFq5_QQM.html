CSS in this video we're going to take a
look at italicize in your text but first
let's do some housecleaning so I want
you to go into our HTML source and we're
going to remove the block quote element
we don't need that anymore and then I
want you to rename this class to
paragraph 1 or we're just going to do
para 1 for short and then we're going to
rename this second paragraph to para 2
and then we're going to create a new
paragraph so let's go ahead and just
copy and paste this and we're going to
call that para 3 that'll be the name of
the class and we're just going to say
this is slanted text good and let's go
ahead and save that and now we'll open
up our external stylesheet and we're
going to name this one P para 1 and
we're going to call this para 2 and then
we're going to create some rules for our
third paragraph and we'll rename this of
course to para 3 and we're going to keep
the color and the font size the same but
we will add our italicized
rule right here but let's go ahead and
save this first and let's open up our
HTML document again and everything looks
good so let's go ahead and close that
out and let's go ahead and add some
italicized text so we use the font -
style property and we just use the
italic parameter you guessed it so let's
go ahead and save this and if we go back
here and open this up you can see now
we've got slanted text so let's close
that out and the other type of parameter
is oblique so let's type that in here
and we'll go ahead and save this and you
will ask the question well that looks
exactly the same as the italic parameter
and that is because they do the same
thing they slant the text but there are
some very minor differences in terms of
browser font combinations and what I
mean by that is they operate a little
bit differently with very specific font
and brow
or combinations but for the most part
they will do the same thing for 99% of
your fonts so you really only have to
pick one and just use one but if you had
a very specific font you may want to do
some testing with these two different
parameters but pretty much you can just
stick with one as I said so let's close
this out and I'm going to go ahead and
use italic I like to use that one and
we'll go ahead and save this now you may
ask the question how do I italicize one
word and in that case it's actually
better to use HTML so let's go ahead and
close out our external stylesheet and
let's go back into our HTML source and
in our second paragraph let's add
another sentence and we'll say the word
for fish in Latin is Pisces I think I
think that's it
in any event a lot of times you'll see
the Latin word italicized so let's go
ahead and use the HTML element tag
indent I for indent and we'll go ahead
and close that and we'll save this now
and let's go ahead and open up our web
page and there you can see we've got our
Latin word now italicized okay that is
going to do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
