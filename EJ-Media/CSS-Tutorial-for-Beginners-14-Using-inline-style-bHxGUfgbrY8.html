beginning CSS today we're going to look
at how to use inline styles now as I
mentioned before in previous videos
there are three ways to insert CSS into
your HTML the first is using an internal
stylesheet right here and we did that
before you remember we placed all of our
CSS within the head element the head
HTML element within our HTML code the
second is to use an external stylesheet
and that's what we're doing right now
we're referencing it right here and the
third and what we're going to cover in
this video is inline style now when you
use inline style for your CSS you are
embedding the CSS directly into the HTML
elements and so that's what we're going
to do we're going to embed it directly
into our HTML element so let's do that
now so let's go ahead and copy and paste
this paragraph element so we're going to
make a new paragraph and what we're
going to do is we're going to type in
here
this is inline style we're going to go
ahead and get rid of this entire class
because this isn't going to be a class
or directly embedding our CSS into this
HTML element this paragraph HTML element
so now what you do is you type in style
and then equals and then quote and now
you can use any rules you want and
you'll recognize the CSS rule so we're
going to select color and we're going to
make this black and of course this will
make our text black and it's just like
CSS like I said so we have to use a
semicolon and then we can put another
rule in here and let's make the font
size we're using the font size property
let's make that 25 pixels which of
course we're using in our CSS style
sheet and then we'll go ahead and use a
semicolon to end the rule and we'll
close it all off with a quote and let's
go ahead and save this and let's open
this up now and there you can see we've
got our new paragraph and our CSS has
been applied and we're doing it right
inside the HTML as I said so that is the
third and final
now I want to point something out in
terms of using inline style you
generally want to avoid using this
unless and this is the key point unless
this is going to be rock solid this will
never change you'll never change these
rules it will always be the same
now most websites eventually will change
you'll eventually make tweaks to it and
that is why an external stylesheet is
preferred because you can do it globally
but if it's never going to change or you
have a very small website you can use
the inline style okay so that's going to
do it for this video I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
