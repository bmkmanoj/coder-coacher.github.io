form element tag which is right here and
this again just acts as a container to
put in whatever input fields we want and
the input field we made in the last
video of course was this one line text
box which is formed by the input element
tag and also declaring the type as text
and that gives us again this one line
text box but now we want to actually add
some labels to these text boxes because
people need to know what information
they're entering and so let's say we
needed a first name and a last name so
that's what we're going to do we're
going to create our first label for this
first text box and we're going to ask
for the first name so I'm just going to
go ahead and copy and paste what I
already typed out and I'll explain it so
here's the label element that's how we
declare a label and notice we have to
close this one out so we close that out
with a closing label tag before I'll
explain this in a second and here is
where we put in our text first name and
this is what will be displayed on the
page now we have to tie this label to
this input element and we do that with
this four attribute and you can give
this any name you want we called it
first name and then we have to create
another attribute in our input element
and that is again ID so we type in ID
and then equals and then first name and
so again this name right here has to
match this four attributes the four
attribute has to match the ID attribute
and that's what ties these two together
so let's go ahead and refresh our
webpage and there you can see we've got
our first name label right here what's
really neat about this too is when you
use this label element and you click on
the text let's do that we click on the
text you can see the control is
automatically highlighted if we click on
the text now if this was just normal
text it wouldn't highlight this one line
text box so that's what's kind of cool
about using this label element and so
let's just go ahead and copy and paste
this code for our second box here and
we'll just rename this to second name or
actually you know what more
appropriately we'll call it last name
because that's what it's going to be and
then let's take this ID here and we'll
just copy and paste this right here and
it
this ties our label to our input element
and we'll call this last name and so
let's go ahead and refresh everything up
here and well we forgot to actually make
the text last name so let's do that
really quick and we'll refresh this
again
and there you see we've got two text
boxes now with labels in which we can
collect information from our user this
will be submitted to a server where we
will process that data and again if we
click on the text it highlights the text
box that's really kind of a nice
attribute about this label element okay
so that's going to do it for this video
in the next video we'll actually do a
multi-line text box see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
