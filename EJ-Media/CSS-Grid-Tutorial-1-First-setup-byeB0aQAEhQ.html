CSS grid which has become very very
popular in the last year now I want to
point out early on this is not a
beginners series so if you do not know
what an HTML tag is if you don't know
what a CSS property is if you don't know
how to create a style sheet you should
go take my HTML and CSS for beginners
series and I will put the links to those
playlists in the description of this
video that being said we are going to
dive right into this subject now as
always I want you to create a website
folder and I want you to create an
index.html and a style sheet and as
always I will put the code that I create
in this video in the description of this
video I will create a paste link to that
ok so let's go ahead and get started
let's actually go ahead and edit our
index.html and notepad plus plus and
then let's go ahead and grab our style
sheet as well and there you can see
we've got a blank style sheet and we've
got a blank HTML document so we are
going to go ahead and build this from
scratch that's actually the best way to
learn the CSS grid is literally to start
from scratch so that's what we're doing
so the first thing you need to do is
create a div inside your body section
and this div is actually going to hold
our CSS grid container so we need to
create a class for that so let's go
ahead and do that and we'll give this a
class name of container
- grid so this is going to be our main
class where we define all of the main
attributes to our grid so everything
that we put inside of this container now
everything that we stick inside of this
div will work against whatever we
defined in our main container class so
this is actually the most important part
when you're getting started with your
CSS grid you want to get this right sort
of the overall layout correct before you
start adding sections so that's what
we're gonna do actually in this video
we're gonna set up our container grid so
now that we have our class defined let's
flip over to our style sheet now
normally I don't do this but I'm going
to actually show you the basic grid that
we're gonna create over the next several
videos the finished product and again
normally I don't do that but it's sort
of necessary because I want to explain
why we're adding particular properties
and why we're assigning
values to them so again in this series
we're first going to start out with a
very basic layout so you understand the
concepts of the CSS grid then we will
move on to more complex layouts so as I
said I'm actually going to show you the
end result that we're going to be
designing over the next several videos
so let's go ahead and actually minimize
this what we want to keep some of this
up so that we can code away and then
here is the layout that we're going to
create and you'll notice this is a very
standard basic grid we have three
columns column one is right here column
two is right here column three is right
here and we have three row so row ones
right here row twos right here and Row
three is right here and as you can see
we have nine different sections that
each have different colors associated
with them so this is going to be a very
basic grid that we're gonna begin with
and let's just go ahead back to our
index.html and grab this right here as
you know if you followed my other
lectures I love the copy and paste so
let's go ahead and create a period and
that of course signifies a class in CSS
so let's go ahead and copy and paste our
class name right here and there we go
and actually let's resize this and make
this a little bit bigger I think we're
gonna need a little bit more room here
and let's just resize this and maybe
give this a little bit more room there
we go and actually just a little bit
more room sorry about this I want to
make sure we have enough room and we're
typing okay good so the first thing we
need to do absolute first thing we need
to do is use the display property so we
type in display and here is the new
addition grid that is the new addition
to CSS so this kicks everything off this
is the absolute first thing we need to
define when we create our style sheet
for our CSS grid this will actually
create our grid and then all the rest of
the properties that we use will work
against this value right here so this
kicks it all off this tells CSS we are
going to be using the CSS grid very
important okay so let's go ahead and use
another property and this is going to be
a new property that's associated with
the CSS grid so we're gonna go ahead and
define our columns that's actually the
second step so let's go ahead and type
in grid and it's actually going to be
right here
if you have this intellisense 2 grid -
template - columns so this
create our columns now what is going on
here well as I said our basic layout is
gonna have three columns one column our
second column and our third column so we
need to create three columns now I want
to point out early on there are many
different ways to create columns using
the CSS grid this is one way we're gonna
do it but in future videos we're
actually going to examine some of the
different ways you can create columns
but we want to just create a very basic
layout to begin with and you know what I
want to resize this one more time I
think we're gonna need a little bit more
space here to type okay
sorry about that so what we're gonna do
again is add our three columns so first
I want you to do is type in Auto and
then Auto again and then Auto again and
then let's close out the property okay
here's how this works each one of these
is a placeholder for the particular
column that we want to add so this Auto
right here this first placeholder will
define this first column this relates to
this first column this second Auto here
relates to this second column that will
create our second column and this third
one creates the third column now if we
wanted a fourth column you could put
another Auto here so that's how that
works now why are we using Auto here why
don't I just put in you know a
particular pixel count well you can do
that but the auto is a nice way to start
out with CSS grids because this will
auto size perfectly to the size of the
browser window you can see that here
look these are sized perfectly and
that's what this Auto does it basically
will take all three of these and
redistribute this space evenly amongst
all three columns and you can see how
that's working here take a look at that
it's perfect perfectly centered
perfectly aligned and that is the great
thing about the CSS grid this is why
people are falling in love with this
because look how simple that was these
are all properly aligned we didn't have
to put any margins in here we didn't
have to put any padding it just aligned
it perfectly for us so that is why we
want to start out with Auto CSS we'll
take this and automatically size all
three of these and redistribute the
sizing perfectly between them and as you
can see no one section is bigger than
the other section and that's what we
want for our beginning basic grid now
there are other ways we can reach
and we'll talk about that in future
lectures but for now we're not going to
do that okay so now that we have our
columns defined we need to define our
gutters right here these are the gutters
and you notice we have gutters
separating the columns as well as the
rows so that's what we're gonna define
right here and actually they are
referred to in the CSS grid as gaps but
I still need to call them gutters that's
sort of the old style lingo so the
property that we use is grid gap that's
the property that we want to use another
new property that's associated with the
CSS grid and let's go ahead and give
this ten pixels that's what we're gonna
give this now what this will do is
create ten pixels for all of our gutters
that surround our different sections now
there are ways to actually tailor base
this you can actually work against the
column gutters if you want or the row
gutters but we're not gonna do that in
this video and actually I don't even
like to do that I actually just like
this broad-based grid gap property so
we're gonna go ahead and use that so now
we've got our gutters defined now we
need to actually create our rows and for
this basic template that we start out
with we're only gonna go ahead and
create three rows that's it that's all
we're gonna create in the first basic
grid that we design so here's the first
row here's a second row
here's the third row so we go ahead and
we call another property and it is
called grid template rows that is
exactly what we need and this works kind
of similar to our columns we're gonna go
ahead and actually create the
placeholders now you could use auto here
but we're not gonna do that we're gonna
actually go ahead and give this a
specific pixel count and we're gonna say
100 pixels for the first one and for the
second one as well and you guessed it
for the third one so this will define a
rows and then we go ahead and close this
out now I want to point out one thing
this 100 pixels is for the height of the
row not the width the width we didn't
specify here because that is
automatically set by our column size and
remember our column size sizes
appropriately to the size of the browser
window however large it is and that is
very very nice take a look at this let's
actually go ahead and expand this out
see how these got larger now it's sized
this perfectly and that's really the
nice thing about the CSS grid so very
very nice indeed
so once it
again these relate to the height of our
row okay now that we have the container
set we're ready to go ahead and add our
very first section and we're going to do
that in the next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
