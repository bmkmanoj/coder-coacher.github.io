additional CSS videos so I have finished
the main series on CSS and that totaled
79 videos but I'm still getting quite a
few requests to do other subjects on CSS
so I've decided to go ahead and create a
new series and that will be called more
on CSS very simple right but in any
event I could probably do 300 videos on
CSS it's simply a massive subject but I
felt that playlist had to end at some
point so again this will be an add-on to
that series now if you're coming here
for the first time and you have no
experience in CSS you should definitely
go ahead and take my main series on CSS
so I'll put the link to that in the
description of this video and then once
you've completed that series you can
come back here and take all the extra
content that I'm going to provide in
this series and there are quite a few
subjects and other properties that I
still need to cover so again that will
be handled in this series one other item
I would like to discuss is notepad plus
plus
I've had several subscribers email me
and have asked me to use notepad plus
plus in my CSS tutorial now I didn't
want to do that halfway through my main
CSS series and then have people switch
over to notepad plus plus but in this
series I am going to use notepad plus
plus now if you have never heard of
notepad plus plus it's very easy to
download and install and I will provide
the link to download notepad plus plus
in the description of this video as well
and then you can also use this video as
a request video so if you have a
particular CSS subject that you want me
to cover I will put it on the list and
hopefully I can eventually get to it
okay as always thanks for watching and
look forward to more CSS tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
