image gallery using the same image over
and over again this image of the arch in
this video we're going to talk about a
very important subject when it comes to
image galleries and that is aspect ratio
now the reason these all line up really
nicely is because of course the image
has the same aspect ratio but what
happens if you introduce an image that
has a different aspect ratio well that's
what we're going to talk about in this
video and the ways you can handle aspect
ratios and there really is only one way
that I ever suggest and we'll talk about
that in a few minutes so let's go ahead
and close this out and I'm gonna go
ahead and minimize our code here for a
second and here is the image the new
image that we're going to introduce into
our image gallery and it is this image
of the Waldorf let's go ahead and hit
the properties of this and by the way of
course I will add the link to this image
if you want to use this in this lecture
so let's go ahead and look at the
properties and we're going to go ahead
and hit details and you can see here the
dimensions of this are nine fifty by
fourteen eighty eight now let's go ahead
and look at the arch that we've been
using and we'll take a look at that
right here and this is 590 by 768 now if
we introduce this photo which we're
going to do here in a minute it's
probably gonna throw off our image
gallery and that's not a problem with
bootstrap that's just what happens if
you introduce images that have different
aspect ratios so let's go ahead and pull
our image of the Waldorf and we'll stick
this in our folder and then let's go
back to the code and we're gonna go
ahead and specify that right here in the
second slot so we'll specify Waldorf
right here and let's go ahead and save
this and then we're gonna go ahead and
load this up and take a look what
happened here our second row now is
thrown off bootstrap actually had to
move everything to the right these
images rather than starting it over here
because this image now is taking up too
much space so what we have to do is
change the aspect ratio of this image to
match our arch image now as I mentioned
there's a couple different ways to do
this the first way is simply to resize
the image using Photoshop or some
website we're actually going to use a
website and I'll show you how to use
that in a second the second option in
the least preferred option is actually
to use CSS code now you might ask well
why wouldn't we just use CSS code the
reason is is that will slow down the
load times
your webpage and especially when you're
dealing with images you always want to
really resize them beforehand rather
than have CSS do that because again that
will slow down your page load so what
we're going to do is go ahead and resize
this now again as I mentioned there's
several different websites where you can
do that the one I used for this video is
resize image net and I've actually used
this site before and it's pretty good it
does a really good job in terms of
resizing images so the first thing you
want to do if you're gonna follow along
is use this option number one here
you're going to go ahead and upload the
image you don't need to worry about
these other options two or three but you
do need to worry about option number
four so what you're gonna do here for
this Waldorf image is put in five ninety
eight by 768 right here and you're going
to go ahead and deselect the keep aspect
ratio then you're going to go down here
and resize the image and once you have
your newly resized image we can go ahead
and copy it into our website folder in
this case I just named it Waldorf one
and let's go ahead and just make sure
that the property details are correct
and they are take a look now it's 598 by
768 so let's go ahead and copy this into
our website folder we'll close that out
we'll go back to our code and of course
we need to put a 1 here for our newly
resized image let's go ahead and save
that let's reload this and now
everything should work really nicely and
take a look at that everything is
perfect see how that works so again the
preferred method is always to resize
your image using Photoshop or some
editor rather than having your CSS code
do that okay I will see you in the next
video thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
