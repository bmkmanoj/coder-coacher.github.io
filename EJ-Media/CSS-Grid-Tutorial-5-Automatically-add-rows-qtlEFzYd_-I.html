section 10 right here in this video
we're going to learn how to
automatically add rows and to do that
we're actually going to create a section
11 to test everything out so let's go
ahead and add our section and first as
you know we start out in our HTML and
again we're gonna call this section 11
now let's flip over to our CSS now in
our container is where we have been
adding our rows and you'll remember in
the last lecture when we wanted to
create that last section we had to come
up here and create two new rows right
here but what if you have a very dynamic
site and you're adding content every day
do you really want to come here and keep
adding rows what if you had 60 rows do
you really want to put 60 entries in
here I don't think so so there's a way
to go ahead and automatically do that so
again that's what we're gonna do in this
lecture so first let's go ahead and keep
this line will comment it out but we'll
keep it so you have it as an example so
we'll put a comment in here and there we
go
so now what we're gonna do is actually
add a new property and that is grid Auto
rows that is the property that we're
going to use and we'll go ahead and keep
the height at 100 pixels so that
everything looks the same so now every
time we create a new row it will
automatically be done for us we don't
even have to come back to this container
anymore to update it we can simply just
add it down here rather than having to
come up here every time and add a new
entry okay so now let's go down here and
add our section 12 or 11 sorry and we'll
just copy and paste this right here and
we're gonna call this section 11 and
let's keep the grid column the same so
will span all three columns and to do
that again we start from one and end at
grid line four but here is where we're
going to create some new rows and we can
see we left off at 6 so let's make our
starting point 6 this time and then
let's end it at row line 8 and that will
add our two new rows and you will notice
once again we didn't have to come up
here and add them in this property we
are now going to automatically add these
rows so let's save everything up and
then we just need to save our HTML
document and let's go ahead and load
this up and see what we get and take a
look at that it worked just fine it
added these extra rows so that is how
you automatically add rows okay I will
see you guys in the next lecture thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
