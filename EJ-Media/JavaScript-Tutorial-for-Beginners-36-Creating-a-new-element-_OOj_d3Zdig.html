going to continue along with events but
we're going to take a break from events
we'll come back to that subject later on
but I want to talk about a really really
big subject in JavaScript and something
we haven't covered yet and that is how
to create new elements from scratch now
previous to this video we've sort of
been updating existing elements we've
changed the style or done various things
to the element in this video we're
actually going to create an entire new
element from scratch so what I've done
here is I've created an HTML page you
will recognize this from my CSS layout
series we use this code and we're going
to reuse it again and so as you probably
guessed I am also using a CSS file as
usual I will put all of the code in the
information section of this video so
I'll put in the CSS code the HTML code
and of course the JavaScript code and as
I said creating new elements is a really
big subject in JavaScript it's something
a lot of JavaScript developers do and it
makes your pages incredibly interactive
and what we're going to do here is let's
say that we have this web page with
these two articles here on the Battle of
cannae and we don't want to flood our
page with another battle but maybe our
user wants to read about another battle
so we'll give them the option we don't
want to clutter our page too much with
battles maybe we want another section
down here that they may want to move on
to but let's say they want to read about
another battle we'll give them the
option to do that and so they'll click
on this button and a new battle will
enter here a new paragraph that they can
read about so we're going to use the on
click event and as you know by now when
they click on this button this
javascript function new paragraph will
get executed and it will create a new
paragraph so what we're going to do is
put in the JavaScript code now so let's
go ahead and exit out of our browser and
let's go ahead and start filling this in
and now this is where we're going to
introduce a new method and that is the
create element method so the first thing
we need to do of course is create a
variable we're just going to call this
element and this of course will be the
new element that we're going to create
and we're going to use the document
object of course and here is where we
are going to specify our
method and it is create element and
actually you know what let's resize this
a little bit here just give us a little
bit more space to work with there we go
so we've got our create element method
and now we need to pass in one parameter
and that will be the element tag that we
want to create in this case it's a
paragraph so all we need here is P we
don't need to put a closing tag or an
opening tag the create element method
will do that for us so all we need to do
is specify the type of element that we
want created in this case again it's a
paragraph so we put our P tag there and
that's all we need so this will create
our paragraph element and it will be
stored in our element variable now what
we need to do is create a variable to
hold our div and over here in this HTML
code the div is main and I'll show you
that right here if we go up here here is
our div that has an ID of main so we've
done this before we want to go ahead and
grab this so that we can actually attach
our element to this div that's what we
want to do so we're going to create
another variable and we can call this
main and then we're going to use our get
element by ID method we've done that
many times now so we'll just put that in
here and the ID we're going to grab of
course is main for our div so there we
go we've got that now what we need to do
is append the paragraph element that we
created here to our div right here so we
need to use another method so first of
course we want to specify the main
object that we just created so we're
going to do main dot and then we're
going to use the append child method and
in there we're going to pass in element
our element object that we created that
holds our new paragraph element whoops I
put a star there we don't want that
obviously and we close it out so what's
going on here it's really a two-step
process if you noticed first we need to
create the element again in this case
it's the paragraph element then we need
to go ahead and use the get element by
ID method to get our div and then we
need to use that object that we created
that is our div and attach our child
element to it which in this case is the
paragraph
element so remember in the hierarchy of
HTML everything's about a child element
and parent elements so this div here
would be the parent of all these
elements inside of the div and we've got
an h2 that would be a child element the
paragraph here this is a child element
so all we're doing is adding another
paragraph down here we don't have to
specify the position actually because it
will automatically add it after the last
element which in this case is this
paragraph element right here so our new
paragraph element will actually be added
past this paragraph element and it is a
child of this div and so that's why we
use this append child right here we have
to pend this as a child to the parent
element which is right here so this is
the child element this is the parent we
use the append child to append it to the
main hope that makes sense so let's go
ahead and save everything up here and
let's load up our web page and see what
we get
and we're going to hit this and nothing
and you're probably wondering wait a
minute how come something didn't show up
here and that's because we didn't add
any text right
we've just got an empty element and
that's fine maybe later on you want to
put some text in there but we didn't put
any text in here and that's actually
another process so it's actually a three
step process now we need to actually
create the content and we do that
through something called a text node now
let's bring up this HTML diagram right
here this isn't representative of what
I've got in this HTML document but
imagine there's a div here I didn't put
that in here and these are all the child
elements everything within this HTML
diagram is considered a node everything
so the elements are considered nodes the
attributes that might be inside those
HTML elements that would be a node an
attribute node and there's actually a
third type of node which is a text node
you don't see it under here but it would
be also in this hierarchy so the text
that's contained in each one of these
paragraph and h1 and h2 elements
actually has a note so we would have
that right here if I had it listed it
would be a text node under here a text
node under here a text node under here
and a text node under here so those are
the three main nodes that you need to
worry about
element node and we know what elements
are the body the head the paragraph and
then attribute nodes we know what
attributes are those go inside the HTML
element we're not going to deal with the
attribute node but that's a second type
of node and then the text node which we
are going to deal with the text is a
node and again if I had that listed here
it would go right below each one of
these HTML elements so that's a node so
just remember the key to this everything
is a node and then further nodes have a
parent-child relationship just like the
HTML hierarchy so this element node
right here this paragraph element node
right here is actually a child node well
at least in this diagram it's a child
node of the body node but if we had our
div here it would be a child node of the
div and so the text node is actually a
child of the paragraph node and you
actually can't go any lower than that a
text node actually can't have a child so
that's about as low as it goes so I hope
that makes sense okay so what we're
going to do then is we're going to add a
text node to this element now this
paragraph element that we created so
let's go ahead and do that so the first
thing we need to do is create our text
node so we need to create a variable
we'll just call that text and we'll use
our document object again and the method
we're going to use is create text node
and then here is where we get to put all
of our nice text and I'm just going to
go ahead and copy and paste this in here
and there you can see we've got all this
nice stuff the battle of salamis was
fought between an alliance of Greek
cities and the Persian Empire something
like that okay so we've got our text
node created and we put in the text that
we want to be held in this node now
we're not done yet
remember I said this is a node and we
need to attach this node to this
paragraph node right this is going to be
a child of this paragraph element node
so let's go ahead and do that so we're
going to use our element up here that's
holding our paragraph element and we'll
just say element and we're going to use
our append child method again and now
we're going to specify our text node
which
right here and we'll just specify text
and there you go this should all work
now and you know what we didn't need
equal signs here I apologize that was
not necessary and so let's go ahead and
launch this up and Chrome and now if we
hit this button we should get a new
paragraph here and we didn't so I made a
mistake sorry let's take a look here boy
hate when this happens and so this is by
the way this is a good debugging session
let's just see what we've got here and
I'm missing a semicolon that will get
you every single time now let's see if
this works okay let's go ahead and
launch this and so we should get a new
paragraph here if this works correctly
and it still doesn't alright so what is
the problem here oh boy and let's see
here oh I see the problem this needs to
actually be green you know what when you
hit enter here when I when I hit enter
here to fit this in the screen but it
actually won't recognize these return
keys so we need to actually get rid of
those let's actually just maximize this
whole thing and we'll get this back to
green so it's why it's good to have
intellisense and we'll go over here and
there you can see it's green now and now
this should finally work so let's go
ahead and save this and these are little
nuances of JavaScript by the way so
let's go ahead and save that and let's
go ahead now and run this in Chrome and
now finally I think this will work there
we go we got our new paragraph now of
course we probably want a header right
because this after all is a new
paragraph so that's what we're going to
do in the next video we'll create a new
element so we'll actually be creating
two new elements now when we hit this
button see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
