the concept of pass by value and that's
something we've been doing in previous
videos I just wanted to explain exactly
what's going on before we move on to
arrays in the next video now here of
course is where we are calling the
batting function and we are passing in
two values here one is a string and one
is an integer now these are called
arguments and so it is arguments that
get passed into the parameters of the
function so here is the player parameter
and here is the distance parameter and
of course the function will go ahead and
use these values that are in these
parameters for our variable more and all
of this gets added up and we will write
it out at the end of this video now the
key point of this video that we haven't
really talked about is these aren't the
actual values that are passed in what
happens is a copy is made of these
values and then that is actually what
gets passed into the parameters of the
function so these values here are
unaffected is the copy of these values
that gets passed into the function so
that's really all it is it's pretty
simple and it's called pass by value or
we might even want to think of it as
passing the copy of these values okay so
let's go ahead and run this and we
should get a nice long sentence here and
we get Steve hit the ball 351 feet okay
that's going to do it for this video is
a nice short and sweet video but a very
important point that I wanted to make
about pass by value in the next video we
will move on to arrays see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
