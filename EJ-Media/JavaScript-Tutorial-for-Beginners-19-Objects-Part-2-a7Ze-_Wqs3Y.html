off in the last video with JavaScript
objects and you will remember we talked
about properties and how we can use
those to describe our particular object
which in this case is our orc
so we came up with a color green we came
up with the orcs height which is at 5
feet and we came up with its weight
which is 180 pounds and of course these
are variables but you will remember we
call them properties once we put these
inside our object so that is part one of
the equation the other part involves
actions giving our object actions
because in real life a lot of objects
perform actions so our orc could run he
could eat he could sleep he could swim
he could yell and so we use functions to
create actions for our object and in
this case you can see right here I
created a function for yelling and it's
sort of similar to properties you'll see
here that we specify the name we use a
colon then we use the function keyword
and then it's just like a normal
function we use the parentheses and then
we use the squiggly brackets and in
between the squiggly brackets we put in
some statements to execute and in this
case we're going to do a document that
write and the orc will yell out works
are the best now similar to variables
and properties functions are a little
bit different inside the object as well
as you can see over here in this
standalone function we specify the
function keyword first well over here
its second and you can see here we have
the name well we specify that first in
the object so you can see it's a little
bit different in the way variables and
properties are so again we almost flip
these once we get into the object now
similar to the way variables are renamed
once they get inside the object
functions also have a different name we
call them methods so it's actually not
called a function even though it is a
function now I don't know why they
decided to do that but anyways they are
called methods once you place a function
inside the object now if you want to
continue calling them functions that's
fine I kind of think of them as
functions anyways but the real technical
lingo is to call them methods now you
will remember in the last video when we
want to access something in our object
we have to specify the object name then
dot and then the property in this case
color we use the same exact
syntax to access functions so once again
we need to have the object name first
then we use dot and then we just specify
the method which in this case is our
yelp method and then this will get
executed and the orc would yell out orcs
are the best now we'll be able to tie
something together right now now this
document that write will make more sense
the document is an object yes we are
accessing the document and there's the
dot we've talked about and we are
accessing the right method so this
should now all make sense what this
document dot write is and we'll be doing
a lot more with the document object but
this too is an object and we can access
its properties and methods just like any
other object so that should make more
sense now okay that is going to do it
for this video now in the next video
we'll code our first object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
