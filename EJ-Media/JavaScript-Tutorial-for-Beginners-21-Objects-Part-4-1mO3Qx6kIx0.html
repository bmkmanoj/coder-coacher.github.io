along with the orc object that we've
been taking a look at in the previous
three videos now I mentioned that we
would take a look at some of the global
objects that Java Script provides but I
still had a few more points that I
wanted to make about objects and our orc
object will serve that purpose just fine
so we talked about in the last video how
you can change the value of the
properties inside your object so we can
switch the hair from green to purple and
if we run this we get purple but not
only can we change the value of a
property in an object we can actually
change the data type now you will
remember there are three primary data
types in JavaScript there are strings
there are numbers and there are boo
means the true or false so as I said we
can actually change the data type in a
property so let's switch this from a
string to a number so we'll go ahead and
set the value now to a number of course
and of course it is going to be one so
let's go ahead and run this and now we
get a one now what if you wanted to add
a new property well all you have to do
again is specify the object and then the
new property name which in this case is
going to be hair two and we can do that
as long as the property doesn't already
exist inside of our object and of course
we don't have a hair to property so we
can go ahead and just add that down here
so let's go ahead and write out hair two
and we get red hair which of course is
what we set the value to now you can
also delete a property by using the
delete keyword so again we just specify
delete and then our object and then the
property we want to delete so in this
case we're just going to delete our hair
to property which we just added right
here and so if we write this out you'll
see what happens now and we get
undefined now you will get undefined if
you try to write out a property that
doesn't exist that's actually what will
be returned because of course now we
don't have this property and so we can't
possibly write out a value so it comes
back as undefined when javascript is
unable to determine the value now we can
also add a
property without actually setting the
value so in this case we're just adding
hair to so it will be added to our orc
but we didn't actually add a value to it
we could add the value at a later time
so let's go ahead and run this and we
get undefined once again because once
again we didn't assign a value to this
we just added the property here too to
our orc object now of course once we add
a value we will be able to write out a
value okay that's going to do it for
this video now in the next video we will
get to global objects that Java Script
provides and the first global object
we'll look at is the string object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
