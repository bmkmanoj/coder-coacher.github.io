beginning HTML today we're going to look
at creating a table using HTML now when
you're dealing with large amounts of
tabular data tables are definitely the
way to go to display this information
and it's a quick and easy way for your
users to understand the data you are
displaying now again we will create
these in HTML and later I will teach you
how to stylize these using CSS to give
them an awesome look now tables are like
normal tables they are made up with data
that contain rows and columns and of
course rows go side to side and columns
go downwards now there are four central
elements to use when creating a table
first is the table element which
everything is embedded inside of then
there is the TR element which identifies
it as a table row and then there is the
TD element which contains the actual
data and furthermore the th element
identifies it as a column so let's go
through all of these right now okay so
first we will create the table element
and we identify this as a table with a
closing and ending table tag and let's
set up the column first so we will use a
TR element tag and then like I said we
will actually create the columns using
the th tag and we are going to call this
the planets and let's make two more
columns we will have another one called
the oceans and we will create another
column called the deserts now let's
create some data to put in those columns
so again we're going to use the table
row tag to create a table row now you
might be wondering why we used a table
row tag for the column and the reason is
it is still a table row if you think
about it it still goes sideways this
just identifies it as a column okay so
we're going to create again the table
row to hold our data and we're going to
use the TD tag now to hold our data and
the first piece of data we will store is
called
earth that is obviously a planet and we
will close that and so this table data
space will correspond with this first
column it goes in a top-down order so
again this data will correspond with
this column it is the first position
within these TR elements that's how it
lines up so just keep that in mind
so the next cell will contain an ocean
and we're going to call this the Pacific
and then the next cell will contain data
that will have a desert and we will call
that the Sahara and again we need to
close this and actually you know what I
forgot to close these so let's go ahead
and close these and now let's go ahead
and save this and we will open this up
and there you can see here are our
columns you'll notice that the columns
are put in bold by HTML and the tables
are not in bold so just keep that in
mind now let's say we wanted to add
another desert another ocean another
planet we can do that relatively simply
we just go back into our source code and
we will copy and paste this and create a
completely new row and here we will put
in Pluto who knows a Pluto is still
planet but we're going to say it is we
will put in the Atlantic for the ocean
and for the desert we will put in the
gobi desert and you can see how these
align again so it's always this first
position so the planets are here the
oceans are in the second position and
the deserts in the third position ok
let's go ahead and save this now and we
will render this again and there you can
see we've got our new row with our new
data now when we get to CSS as I said
before we will stylize these and we can
create menus off of this we can create
shopping carts to do totals all kinds of
things with tables ok that's going to do
it for this tutorial I will see you guys
in the next PML tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
