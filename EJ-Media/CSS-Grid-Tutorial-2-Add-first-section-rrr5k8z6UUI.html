left off in the last video and of course
we set up our container and our main
template for our grid and of course this
is the finished product right here
and here are the CSS grid lines now
we're going to talk all about this in a
few minutes so don't worry about these
quite yet
but this really is the critical concept
to understanding the CSS great once you
understand how these lines work this
whole process becomes very easy to
understand so in this video we're gonna
go ahead and add our very first section
right here so let's flip over to our
index.html and let's go ahead and add
that and we're just gonna add a div
we're gonna add a class and we're gonna
go ahead and call this section one and
then we'll do a similar thing with the
text we'll call this section one and
then let's go ahead and close out our
div and there we go we've got our
section one right here so let's flip
over to our stylesheet and we'll start
adding the code for this and let's just
go ahead and take this and copy and
paste this you know I always like to
copy and paste and of course we'll call
this section 1 which was the name of our
class let's go ahead and get rid of
these properties we don't need them
anymore and the first property that
we're gonna add here is grid - column
that's what we need and then let's go
ahead and actually we're not gonna add a
value to this yet let's go ahead and add
our second property and that is going to
be for our rows so that is grid - row
and so now what I'm going to do is go
ahead and explain how both of these work
and so that means we're gonna go ahead
and talk about these column lines and
these row lines now the way this works
is you have two sets again you have the
column lines you have the row lines you
can see I've made the column lines in
red and here's column line one here's
column line two here's column line three
and here is column line four and you can
see the row lines are in black so row
line one goes this way here's the second
row line here's the third line and
here's the fourth and this equates to
our finished product over here think
about this here's column line one here's
column line two here's column line three
and here's column line four in the same
thing with the rows here would be row
line one going this way here would be
row line two and so on and so on so you
get an idea of how these work this is
all you
really need to know when you want to lay
out your sections you need to know what
column lines are gonna specify and what
row lines you're gonna specify and once
you get that down once you understand
that this becomes very easy now if you
think about it take a look at column
line one and column line two that
creates our section one right here right
section one is between column line 1 and
column line 2 it is also between row
line 1 and row line 2 you see how that
works this equates to this right up here
it's very simple no section - that's
between column line 2 and column line 3
and section 3
that's between column line 3 and column
line 4 section 2 and 3 are also between
row line 1 and row wine - so you see how
this works so if you want to take a
guess here what row lines do you think
constitutes section 4 well row line 2
and row line 3 now if you think about
this for a second let's say we added
another column here a fourth column and
we put it right over here we would need
a fifth column line right we would need
yet another line so for every column
that you add you need an extra column
line that's how it works and same thing
with the rows if we added another row
down here we would need a fifth row line
so now for section one we need to say
hey we're going to start from column
line one right here so we're gonna put
in a value of one okay and then we're
gonna go ahead and close this out now
what are we saying here we're saying hey
I want you to start from column line one
and end at column line two now you might
say wait a minute we didn't put in a
stop point we only put in a start point
and that's because we're gonna do that
in later videos for now we're just gonna
enter in the starting position which is
column line one right here now if you do
not put in a stop position CSS will
assume that you want to stop at the next
line which is column line two and it
works the same way with the grid rows
we are gonna say we want to start out a
grid Row one right here and since we're
not going to specify a stop point it
will automatically assume that we want
to stop at row line two so we're going
to go ahead and put in a 1 here and then
I'm gonna go ahead and copy and paste
the rest of the CSS code because we've
gone through this in many other videos
so basically what we're gonna do is give
this a background color a blue right
we're gonna make the color of the text
itself white we're gonna align it right
here and the font size is gonna be 20
pixels this isn't really anything we
need to go through we've done this many
times in other lectures but these are
the two new ones that we wanted to focus
on so let's go ahead and save this and
then let's fire up our sheet and make
sure all of this works so let's actually
go ahead and close this out and then
we'll go ahead and fire this up in
chrome and let's see what we get and
take a look at that it worked perfectly
look how its sizing it appropriately see
that and you can see here you can kind
of see if we added a section to who kind
of fill up here and this section 3 would
fill up here so you can see how it all
works so that is a perfect start and you
can see how these column lines work now
it's actually very simple to use once
you understand the concept of how the
grid lines work okay in the next video
we're going to fill out the rest of the
sections see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
