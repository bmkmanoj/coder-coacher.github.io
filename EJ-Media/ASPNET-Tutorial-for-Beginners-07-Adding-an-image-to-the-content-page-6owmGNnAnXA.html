image to our Rome content page and it's
going to be an image of the Roman Senate
so it's appropriate to put it right
between these two paragraphs and once
again we're going to use Visual Studio
to manage the image just like we're
using it to manage our content pages and
we already have an images folder now you
can handle this one of two ways you can
actually copy the image and keep your
image and your content pages all in the
same folder or you can separate your
images from your web pages I actually
like to keep the images separate but I
create an identical structure so
actually this Rome dot PNG remember we
were using that for our default content
page I don't usually put those in any
folder if the image is on the default
page I just leave those in the root of
the images folder so let's go ahead and
create a new folder and we'll call this
Rome so we're keeping the same structure
that we are for the web pages down here
so same structure and now what we need
to do is put the image that we want to
put in our content page inside this
folder so let's go ahead and do that so
let's just minimize this and you can see
I've downloaded this image of the roman
senate so this is what we want to put on
our web page now I will provide a link
in the description of this video if you
want to download this exact image if
you're following along so let's close
that out and let's open up our website
folder and if we go to our images folder
you can see the folders there for us
that we just created and we'll just drag
our image into here and let's reopen
visual studio and as I said you still
have to drag the image into our visual
studio web project because visual studio
still doesn't know about it yet so let's
just do that now and we'll just drag
that into here and now it's part of our
website project so now we're good to go
now one thing you can do with these
images instead of having to type out the
IMG tag you're really going to like this
all you have to do now is drag this
where you want to put this on your web
page and like I said we want to put it
between these two paragraphs and look
visual studio created all the code for
us if they created the IMG tag the
source attribute and even the location
of our image so we don't even have to do
this all there for us
so let's take a look and see what this
looks like on our webpage and we'll load
it up here and if we drill down into our
link you can see we get this big image
here now obviously this isn't fitting
our web page very well but we're just
going to use some CSS to go ahead and
auto size this so that it fits our
content page because it's sort of
bleeding off the edge to the right here
so let's go ahead and fix that so we'll
close this out so what we're going to do
actually is we could create a CSS class
for this but this is only going to be a
few rules and if it's only a few rules I
usually use inline CSS and you'll
remember if you followed my CSS series
we use the style attribute to create
inline CSS so that's what we're going to
do we're going to specify style here and
then we want to set the margin to zero
so we want so we want to set the margin
to zero and then the next value we're
going to use is Auto and Auto will
actually Center our image on our content
page and then we need one more role and
that is going to be the width property
and we're going to set that at 100 not
one thousand one hundred percent and
then let's close it out with a semicolon
and what this does is it just expands it
no matter what the browser is sized at
it will expand this image to the edges
of our main content panel so it'll look
really nice so let's go ahead and you
know what we'll probably need a few
breaks here a line break so let's go
ahead and copy and paste those down
right here and then let's go ahead and
see what this looks like and hopefully
this looks a little bit better and we'll
drill down into our web page and there
look how nice that looks now it's even
hitting the same margin that we set for
the entire content page for the text
remember because remember it will
actually inherit that margin of 10
pixels because we put that in a div so
it's hitting that and everything's nice
and lined up on here looking pretty good
isn't it
okay in the next video we're going to
actually add a horizontal menu bar here
and we're going to create some more
content pages we're going to create a
home link and a Contact Us link so that
people can click on those but especially
we want a little home button here
because when people are drilling all
over the place into these different
content links we want them to have a
quick way to get back to the homepage
so that's we'll do the next video see
you guys on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
