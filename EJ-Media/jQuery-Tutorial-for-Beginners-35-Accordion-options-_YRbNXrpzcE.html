of the options that you can use with the
accordion now you'll notice that you
can't collapse all of the panels all the
only ones that are collapsed are the
ones that you're not using
but the currently opened panel cannot be
closed I'm trying to close it right now
it won't close so if you want to let
your user close all the panels including
the actively opened panel you need to
use the collapsible property and all we
do is set that to true and then we
should be able to close all of the
panels so let's go ahead and refresh our
page and you can see now we can close
the active panel so I can close all the
panels now now by default you use the
click event to open the panels that is
we just have to click to open these but
what if you want the user to be able to
open these by just mousing over the
panels you can do that as well
and for that we just use the event
property and for this we actually need
quotes and we just specify mouse over
here and let's go ahead and save this
let's refresh our page and now you can
see I'm just mousing over each one of
these panels and that will automatically
open the panel now when you open up a
panel this is actually an animation what
you just saw right there that's an
animation and you can control the
duration of that animation by using
animation property so let's go ahead and
change this to animate and let's give it
a duration of 900 milliseconds so let's
go ahead and save this and we'll refresh
our page and there you can see it opens
up quite a bit slower now if you wanted
that to be instantaneous you could just
set this to 0 milliseconds and so let's
see what we get now there you can see
it's instantaneous so that's how you use
the animate property and you can play
around with different timings now let's
go ahead and refresh our page and as you
know by default the first panel is
always open so by default the first
panel will be open but what if you
wanted by default one of these other
panels to be open first
well for that we use the active property
so let's go ahead and set this to active
and we'll set this to 1 now as you know
computers like to start with zero so
this first panel equals zero the second
panel would be one and the third panel
would be two so when we refresh this
page the second panel now should be open
so let's see if that is in fact the case
and it is by default it opens the second
panel okay that's going to do it for
this video I will see you guys in the
next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
