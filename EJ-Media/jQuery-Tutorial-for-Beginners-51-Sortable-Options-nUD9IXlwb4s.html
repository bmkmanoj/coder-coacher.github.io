at some of the options that you can use
with these sortable widget and some of
these are similar to the options that
you can use with the draggable widget so
some of these will be familiar to you
the first thing we're going to check out
is opacity yes you can actually change
the opacity when the user begins to sort
on the element in question so let's go
ahead and save this and let's refresh
our page and you can see now the opacity
is kicking in for whatever element that
we currently are sorting on so that's
kind of a nice useful option now there
is also a distance option that you can
set and let's set that to 150 pixels and
basically what this means is is that
sorting will not start until you have
dragged a particular item for the
distance that you specify right here so
in this case you will not be able to
actually drag this image until you've
moved the mouse 150 pixels so let's go
ahead and save this let's refresh our
page and we'll see if this works and yes
it did I was actually unable to move
this image until I had moved the mouse
150 pixels so that's how that option
works now we can also set a delay in
terms of when the user is allowed to
sort a particular element so let's go
ahead and set that and we'll set this to
350 milliseconds so let's see if it
works and it did I was not able to drag
that until 350 milliseconds had passed
now you can also disable the sortable
widget and maybe you're making some
changes to your website and you want to
disable that functionality on a
temporary basis so you can go ahead and
do that very quickly so let's make sure
it works and it didn't and the reason is
I didn't type out the property all the
way I think it's disabled let's try that
again
and now it works I can't sort on any of
the images now so that's how the
disabled option works now you can also
specify a different cursor that you want
to use when the user begins to sort on a
particular element so let's go ahead and
use the move cursor that's kind of a
cool one to use and in this instance we
have to use quotes so you just put move
here so let's make sure this works and
it does take a look I now get a move
cursor over the image that I am trying
to sort on now you can also use the
containment property and
what that does is it prevents the user
from moving a particular element out of
the parent element that's usually the
value that I use here parent I think
there's a couple others that I always
use the parent so basically when I save
this we should not be able to sort these
images or even move the image outside of
our parent div which in this case is
this little div class we have right here
that's actually the parents not the main
and actually I spelled containment wrong
sorry about that I got to get rid of the
T there we go alright so let's save this
again and let's go back here and I'll
just move this over a little bit let's
refresh our page and there you can see I
cannot move this outside of that div so
the image is now restricted to its
parent div element so let's move on now
you can also restrict the element to a
particular axis and in this case we're
going to do the x-axis so let's see if
this works and it does I can only move
the images now horizontally I can't
actually move these images up and down
vertically now the final one and I
already have this typed out so I'll just
go ahead and copy and paste this right
in here is the grid property and we use
this with the draggable widget and it's
the same concept here you'll actually
get an invisible grid which will sort of
snap the images into place so let's go
ahead and make sure that works and it
does see how I have that little
invisible grid now and these can just
snap right into place so that's how the
grid property works okay that's gonna do
it for this video I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
