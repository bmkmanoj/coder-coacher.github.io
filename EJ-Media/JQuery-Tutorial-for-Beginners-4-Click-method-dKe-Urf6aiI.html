hide method and we wrote some of our
very first jQuery code in this video
we're going to create a click event
using jQuery now right down here this is
the way we of course created it in our
JavaScript series inside our button HTML
element we put the onclick event here
and then of course we called our
javascript function but it's handled
differently in jQuery and you can see
right here I've added a button so
basically you'll want to go out and
download the HTML file as well as the
CSS code in the description of this
video I've created paste links for it
because I've altered the CSS code a
little bit and obviously I've altered
the HTML code and added this button
which of course is right here and now as
I said it's done a little bit
differently we do not actually put the
on click event in our HTML everything
will be controlled from jQuery so that's
why I just wanted to keep this up here
so you could see how we did it in
JavaScript but basically as I said is
going to be a little bit different in
jQuery and what jQuery gives us is a
click method to use so that's what we're
going to use we're going to use another
method so it's really all about these
jQuery methods and as I said in the last
video once you learn those jQuery gets
very easy so let's go ahead and we got
to call our jQuery library so you'll
remember in order to do that we type in
a dollar sign so there we go now
remember the first thing we want to do
is select our button so this is very
different of course from JavaScript
remember it's all about those selectors
inside this parenthesis so let's go
ahead and just copy and paste this and
we'll put this right here and we'll
select the button element this is just a
standard CSS type selector and so now we
have our button selected now we can go
ahead and call the click method now
inside our click method is the function
that will get submitted when we click on
our button it's very similar to our
JavaScript remember when we hit this
button this function gets submitted only
now the function is inside our click
method it's right here now you remember
functions and methods are very similar
they're both performing an action
they're very very close relatives if
they
do pretty much the same thing the only
difference is a method is called from
our object with this dot accessor so
that's the difference a function usually
is not but a method is and again you'll
remember that from the JavaScript series
so here's our function
now our hide method will go inside of
our function that's what's going to get
called that's the code that we're going
to execute once our function gets
activated from our click method and this
is the code that will be executed so
actually what we're doing now is we're
just putting the hide method inside our
function so we need to close this
function out we've already closed this
function out right here we simply need
to close this function out right now so
let's do that and we'll just copy and
paste it there and that's good now
everything is correct everything's
closed out correctly our hide method
will now get executed once our function
is called from our click method and
again we're just selecting our button
now the nice thing about this is think
about this you can put as many different
buttons now as you want in here using
the CSS selector so if you had a
different button here with different IDs
you could load them all up in here and
call them from one area how nice is that
you have to put anything in this HTML
like we did down here and apparently I
close the browser out at some point okay
well we need to resubmit it anyway so
let's go ahead and what we're going to
do is we're going to hide the right
section so let's put in the selector for
that which of course is pound right and
let's go ahead and save everything up
let's resubmit the browser so let's go
ahead and hit it and there you can see
it worked so that's how the click method
works in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
