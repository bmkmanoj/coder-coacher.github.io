we're going to talk about the bezzie a
tool which is right here now this allows
you basically to draw random patterns
that you wish to make so it's different
than starting out with a pre-canned
pattern like the square or the circle
you can draw whatever you want with a
Bezier tool so we'll go ahead and select
that and you left-click the mouse and
then take it wherever you want in your
drawing left click again and again we'll
left-click again and you get the idea
here
now to set the pattern you can either
double click or you can hit the enter
key and there you can see we have the
pattern set now if you go up to the Edit
path by nodes tool you can go ahead and
begin to shape this and you can see how
we're shaping this segment you can go
over here and drag this segment and then
you notice you get these handlebars here
and you can get more precision using
these now to add another node you just
double click between the nodes on the
segment and you get another node you can
use again now let's start another shape
here and if you hold down the control
key it will move up in 15 degree angles
if you want that type of precision so
you can see this is going by 15 degree
angles all the way around so that's
useful in certain scenarios now you can
also see the angle of the path down here
and that's also helpful too if you want
a very precise angle that you want to
set so you can see that right keep down
here now you may want to connect up to
separate shapes that you've made so I'll
show you how to do that now so let's go
over to the Edit path by nose tool and
select this shape and then we're going
to go back and hit the Bezier tool now
hold down the shift key and go ahead and
start to make your new shape and then
hook it up to this node and there you
can see we've got these two shapes
hooked up now now let's go ahead and
draw another path and let's say you draw
a path that you don't want you can just
hit the backspace key and you can see
it'll get rid of the pass all the way
the back if you want so that's pretty
useful if you again I mean I've done
that several times you make a bad path
and how do I get rid of it now just keep
hitting the backspace and it'll get rid
of them so let's go ahead and clear
everything and let's go back to the
Bezier tool and let's draw another
pattern here now one useful little tip
here is instead of having to go over to
the select tool and select this to move
it you can just hit the spacebar
and you see it automatically switches it
to the Select tool for you and then we
can go ahead and drag this where you
want and if you hit the spacebar again
it takes you back to the Bezier tool so
you don't even have to go over here and
select it so that's very useful if
you're drawing several patterns very
quickly
okay well clear everything again and
we'll draw another shape once you've
connected all the segments you can go
ahead and quickly fill it down here by
just selecting a color and you'll notice
we got the fill bar available now now
you see how we can't really see the
border down here the stroke as they like
to call it if you go down here and right
click this number you can increase that
to 32 and there you see how it's more
visible now now if you hold down the
shift key you can go ahead and switch
the color on that and you'll see we
switched it to green now you can also
right-click down here and remove the
stroke and there you can see we've got
no border you can also do that for fill
as well okay that's going to do it for
