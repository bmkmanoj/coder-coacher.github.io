when you work with your images in
Photoshop
fortunately Photoshop provides a lot of
functionality that will allow you to
inspect an alter color in your photos
and Photoshop provides several tools to
accomplish this and one of the main
tools is the histogram so that will be
the subject of this lecture now all
color is composed of light waves all
colors give off specific light waves
that can be analyzed astronomers have
known this for a long time they can tell
whether a galaxy is moving towards us or
moving away from us by examining the
signature of the wavelength the human
eye is not capable seeing these
wavelengths outside the visible spectrum
but in Photoshop we can analyze these
wavelengths using the histogram now to
use the histogram we just simply go up
to window and we select histogram now by
default it will not be docked into the
dashboard over here now what that means
is next time you open up Photoshop
you'll have to reopen this now if you
don't want to reopen this you can simply
drag this over into the dashboard like
so but we're not going to dock it for
this lecture ok so let's go ahead and
open up an image and I have an image
already that I want to show you and that
is this nice beautiful Cardinal by the
way as usual I'll provide a link to all
the images used in this video now you
can see here we get this nice big
histogram now by default this is not
what is selected actually it would be if
you open it up and you click on this
down arrow the compact view will be
selected so this is what you should see
first when you select this little down
arrow now you always want to go ahead
and select expanded view and this makes
everything a little bit larger then what
you want to do is go ahead and select
all channels now if you notice we got a
graph here with red green and blue and
this is for RGB red green blue and of
course you probably have dealt with RGB
many times before it is those three
colors that compose every other color
that you see no matter what color you
are using it will at least have a little
bit of red a little bit of green and a
little bit of blue now what I want you
to do is go up here and select RGB and
this is probably the default that you're
going to use the most so basically this
constitutes what's down here in these
three graphs of these three graphs equal
what's up here so you get this sort of
combined view and then you can see them
individually now the key concept to
understanding the histogram is farther
you move to the right you'll get lighter
tones the farther you move to the left
you'll get darker tones so if these
wavelengths and that's what these are
we're all the way to the left you'd have
a very dark image but as you can see
most of the colors are right in this
mid-range and this is usually how you
want your photograph to look you want
the majority of these Peaks right here
in the middle usually that's what you
want for a nice-looking well balanced
photo and actually they always refer to
these as Peaks by the way so here's a
peak now you can see this is the blue
peak right here and these two peaks
right here form the red and the green
now remember as I said the farther you
go to the right that composes lighter
tones the farther you go to the left you
get darker tones and everything in the
middle is kind of mid-range now if you
take a look at this let's actually flip
back to this color so we can get a
better idea of this if you take a look
at this green composes most of this
image right so that's why it makes sense
that this composes most of the lighter
tones in this video the red right here
as you can see that's right in the
middle right where it should be now we
don't even see blue here but remember
what I said blue is in here to some
extent even though we can't see it and
that's why it's the far left the darker
tones we really don't see it that well
but it is present here and that's why
it's all the left now let's go ahead
really quick and let me Flip to another
image here and let's go to this blue sky
let's see what happens here take a look
at that now the blue composes all the
lighter tones in this image see how that
is farther to the right than the red and
the green which you can't even really
see anymore right even though it's
consists of some of the colors in here
it's barely visible and that's why it's
farther to the left so see how that
works
okay so let's flip back to RGB and
actually let's go back to the image of
that Cardinal really quickly so you can
see these Peaks are pretty nice now what
you don't want at least on this combined
view it's normal by the way in the
single views of the color for them to go
off this top edge but what you usually
do not want in the combined view of the
RGB is for these Peaks to go off this
top edge right up here this top edge
when that happens you start to lose
information and usually you do not want
that but there might be specific
instances where you want that and we'll
talk about that in future videos but
these are pretty good Peaks to have
nothing's really bleeding
the top of the edge here and these are
nice solid Peaks that we have so this is
a very well balanced photo now what
happens when things are not balanced
well the main thing you get is what's
called an overexposed picture or an
underexposed picture so let's go ahead
and open that up and I want you to watch
these Peaks what happens so first let's
go ahead and we'll open up an
overexposed image and take a look at
that everything now is to the right you
see that there is nothing on the left
there are no dark tones in this image
everything is to the right and take a
look at here even this right side is
going right off the edge see the top
edge here see that and this is why we're
losing information this is this
overexposed portion of this photograph
right here you would immediately
recognize that because everything is to
the right and then a lot of it bleeds
off this top edge so there's too much
light in this photo
but you can see how the histogram sort
of reveals that see how we have no dark
tones here to the left that is a classic
example of an overexposed image and
actually Photoshop will allow us to fix
that which we're going to talk about in
the next video by the way now let's go
ahead and take a look at an underexposed
image so let's select this one you're
going to notice a complete shift and
everything will be on the left take a
look at that everything is on the Left
so in this photo we have too many dark
tones and again this is something we can
fix and again you can see this how
everything's trending to the left here
and again this is something we're going
to take a look at in the next video is
how to use the histogram to fix light
issues in your photo so let's go ahead
and we're going to open up one more
photo I want to show you something here
I have it somewhere this photo right
here so let's open this up now remember
I said generally speaking you do not
want these wavelengths to go off the top
edge there are however certain
conditions where this might be okay now
if we take a look at this photo this
looks pretty cool right this photo looks
just fine in fact it looks like they
wanted this high contrast effect where
the flower would draw most of the
attention so in this case they didn't
really want a lot in the background so
that's why this is fine in this case
they wanted this big contrast that's
okay to have this huge peak on the left
where it's coming off the top edge in
this case this is probably okay so it's
not always a problem to have the
wavelength going off the top edge like I
said usually you want everything in
these mid-tones and it becomes a problem
when there
nothing on the right or nothing on the
left then you probably have a photo that
is overexposed or underexposed but you
can see here we have a high contrast
photo so this wavelength in this case is
okay and let's go ahead and actually
open up one more photo and let's take a
look at this Klamath Basin let's open
that up this tends to be a little bit
darker photo so that's why you can see
up here everything's sort of trending to
the left so a little bit darker photo
this was a little bit lighter we'd have
higher Peaks over here but generally
everything's kind of nice in the middle
here and this is a nicely exposed image
so I think you're getting an idea how
the histogram works see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
