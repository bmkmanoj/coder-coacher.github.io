left off in the last video we're going
to talk about the child selector now the
child selector is a close relative of
the descendant selector they kind of do
the same thing so once again we select
an element inside another element we're
doing the same thing with the child
selector the only difference is that the
child selector selects a direct child of
the element and we'll talk about that in
a few minutes
now the other difference is we use a
right angle bracket or a greater than
sign for the child selector here in the
descendant selector we just use the
space but you can see here we have a
greater than sign and what we're saying
is that blockquote which is the parent
element so we specify that first here of
course we have a class we're saying
select the bold element which is a child
element of course it's right here it's a
child element of the blockquote element
and you're probably wondering well wait
a minute what's the difference between
the descendant selector and the child
selector and it'll come together in a
few minutes but let's go ahead and
change the color to purple and we'll
just go ahead and save this
let's hit refresh and there you can see
it changed to purple down here now let's
pull up a diagram here you can see that
bold element is a child in this scenario
it's a direct child of blockquote here
it is not a child because there is a
paragraph element in between and that's
the difference think about this for a
second if we insert a paragraph element
here which we'll do in a few seconds the
bold element now is a child of the
paragraph element it is no longer a
direct child of the blockquote so that's
why we would not be able to use this
selector because B now becomes a
descendant now in both these scenarios
the bold element and the paragraph
elements are descendants of the black
quote element but the difference is is
it a direct child that's what you want
to ask and in this scenario the bold
element is a descendant but not a direct
child only one level down can you be a
direct child so that's the difference so
once again just to review really quickly
these two elements at this level in the
hierarchy are considered a direct child
of the blockquote
element they are also descendants oh
they are
considered a direct child and a
descendant so you could use the child
selector and the descendant selector
here it's only when we come down to this
bold element in this scenario where we
now can only use the descendant selector
because it is not a direct child of the
black quote element okay and so I'll
just minimize this for a second so let's
go ahead and we'll insert a paragraph
element in here so let's do that and
actually let me bring this diagram back
so now this is what we have we have this
scenario and so now if i refresh this
page the purple text should go away so
let's do that let's go ahead and save
this first we'll hit refresh and there
you can see it just takes the browser's
default color because again the bold
selector is no longer a direct child it
is a descendant and I'll show you that
so what if we get rid of this angle
bracket now this will work because this
is a descendant selector and we'll go
ahead and save this and refresh and
there you can see it will work because
yes bold is indeed a descendant and so
that's the main difference and it's just
a subtle difference but some people get
confused by it as usual I hope you found
this lecture useful by the way let's
switch this back so you have the child
selector as an example so we'll switch
this back and we'll also get rid of the
P here so that the bold element is again
a direct child of the blockquote element
okay that's going to do it for this
lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
