conditionals in this video so in the
last video we added an if statement
where we tested one condition whether to
see the food variable was equal to Apple
but what if we wanted to add multiple
conditions specifically adding a
condition for meat and that is where the
else if statement comes into play it is
the else if statement that allows you to
add multiple conditions and so we'll put
it right below our if statement so and
so I'll just copy and paste it right
into here now there's a particular rule
about the else if you can only use the
else if if you have a if statement first
so you need to have an if statement and
then after the if statement comes the
else if so the else if is always the
second condition so think of the else if
almost as a add-on to the if statement
and so once again this is our first
condition and this is our second
condition and the else if allows us to
add multiple conditions so let's go
ahead and run this and of course we get
the alert we ate some meat which we
expected because our value of course is
meat for our food variable and so let's
go ahead and add another condition for
another food type here and we'll just
copy and paste this and let's add
something for fast-food so we were
really hungry and we'll say we ate some
fast-food and then of course we'll
change our value up here to fast-food
and let's save this and we'll run this
and we get the alert we hate some
fast-food and so what happens here is
JavaScript will test the first condition
first so this was false so it'll move on
to the second condition which is meat it
saw that this was false and so it moved
on to the third condition and saw that
this was true this match and so it
executed this block of code and now if
we had another food type in here such as
chocolate all of these conditions would
have been false and therefore the else
statement would have been triggered and
the block of code in here would be
executed and of course the else does not
have a
addition it is always the final
statement that gets triggered if all of
the conditions are false okay that is
going to do it for this video in the
next video we will continue on with
conditionals and then in the video after
that we will start to look at loops so
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
