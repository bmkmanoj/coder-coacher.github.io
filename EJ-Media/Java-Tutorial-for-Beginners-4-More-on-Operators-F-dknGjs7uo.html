beginning Java in the last tutorial
tutorial 3 we dealt with math operators
in this tutorial we're going to deal
with some more operators that I did not
discuss in that video specifically we're
going to be talking today about
incrementing and decrementing a variable
now this is a very common thing that
goes on in Java programs you're going to
have to change the value and the way we
do that is we will use operators to
accomplish those types of tasks ok so
let's get into this let's do a plus plus
operator that will increment our value
by one so we'll start out with that so
let's declare a variable here it's going
to be an integer we're going to call
that the variable score and we're going
to give that a value of 10 and then
we're going to use the plus plus
operator here and we're going to put our
variable after that and then we have to
do a system.out.print so what we did
here is we declared the variable score
we assigned it a value of 10 and we're
going to increment that by 1 which with
the plus plus increment operator so if
we run this we will get a value of 11
now we can also put the plus plus
incremental operator down in the system
out and we can do that right here in the
parentheses and we'll run this again and
we'll get the same result 11 so putting
the plus plus operator before the
variable is called prefixing you can
also move that to behind the variable
and that is called when you put it
behind the variable name that is called
post fixing now there is a difference
how this works and I'll show you so
again you'll notice that when it was
before it returned a number of 11 so it
did increment increment it by 1 now
let's move those the plus plus behind
the variable of score and we'll run this
again and you'll
notice that we'll get a different result
here we got ten it did not increment it
by 1 and the reason is is that a post
fixed operator is used on a variable and
the value will not change until after
the expression has been evaluated and so
in this case it's been evaluated and it
will not take place so that's the reason
that if you put it before the variable
it gets evaluated and it's part of the
final equation so in order to get this
operator to compute we actually have to
do another system.out.print and we
remove the plus plus operator run this
again now we get 11 because you can see
here it evaluated it and you can see
here it printed out the 10 but then it
also printed out 11 because this was
evaluated after the expression
expression was complete I want to point
out one more thing too when you down in
this output line if we did an Ln here
and we run this again or actually we
have to do 2 l ends you'll see here that
these are all outputted on their own
lines-- so that's how that works
and if we remove the l ends you will see
that it's all on the same line so
there's that's that's how that works ok
so moving along let's get rid of
actually just get rid of line 8 here and
now I will show you the decrement
operators and that's that's just
obviously going to be minus score whoops
spelled that wrong and let's run this
file and you'll see we get 9 so it just
took off 1 and once again we'll add the
incremental operator even though we did
that before we'll just run this again
and we get 11
now one thing I'd also like to point out
here is you do not have to use the plus
+ incremental operator to add one to
your value you can also achieve that by
just using
the plus operator and I'll show you that
I mean it's pretty simple so we could
just say score equals score plus one and
you would get and we run this you will
get the same result 11 so that's another
way you can just do that as well that's
not normally how people code they will
use the plus plus
incremental operator but you could also
I mean this is obviously a little bit
easier to read so some people actually
prefer to code their Java that way a
final point I would like to make is the
idea of operator rest you know this
we'll get into this in the more advanced
tutorial but I just want to touch upon
that subject right now before ending
this tutorial so let's just put in we'll
just we're not going to actually run
anything with operator precedents but
I'll put in some comments so the first
order of precedence is always given to
the decremental and incremental operator
so they always get first precedence the
second order of precedence is given to
multiplication just just spell that out
and division and then there's a third
order of precedence and that is always
given to addition and subtraction the
adding and subtracting operators fourth
order of precedence is given to
comparisons and there is yet a fifth
order of precedence whoops and that is
given to the equal sign which as you
know is used to set the variables value
so that is the order of precedence you
should just be aware of that because if
you start using multiple operators
you'll need to know what operators take
precedence over the other operators so
again just you know this is a lot of
information but just float this in the
back your mind again we'll get more into
this at a later point so that ends this
tutorial and I will see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
