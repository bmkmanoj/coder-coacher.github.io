form to our login page now what we're
going to do is we have to add a database
that will store all the data when users
come to this form and enter in their
data so we can do that of course in
Visual Studio and the first thing I want
you to do is go ahead and right-click on
our website project and we're going to
add new item and then I want you to
scroll down and we're going to add a
sequel database which is right here and
you're just going to go ahead and hit
add now you may or may not get this
prompt it will ask you to add an app
underscore data folder and you want to
select yes to this but if you don't get
this dialog box just go ahead and
manually add the folder to your project
and then you want to add the database to
that folder because this is sort of the
standard format that Microsoft uses so
let's go ahead and hit yes to that and
there you can see we've now got our app
data folder here is our database and it
opens up server Explorer which allows us
to view our database now every database
needs a table and let's go ahead and
flip back to the website for a moment
before we add the table now generally
the way I do this and you can do this
whatever way you want to but I like to
add a table for each individual page
where I'm storing data so for instance
this form here we're just going to add a
table that will handle this entire form
but let's say we had another link here
and we had another form or something I
usually would create another table for
that a different table so we only need
one table and we'll add a column in that
table for each one of these fields so
we'll add a name column we'll add an
address column we'll add a phone column
and we'll add an email column okay so
let's go back to visual studio and what
we're going to do is right-click on
tables and we're going to add new table
okay so we're going to get this design
view that first comes up the first thing
we're going to do is rename our table
the default name is table but we want to
rename that we can do that right down
here and we're just going to call this
login table so that's the name we're
going to give it now this is what we
call the primary key every table has a
primary key we're not going to worry
about that right now so we can just go
ahead and leave that alone but we're
going to create our very first column
and again we're going to call that name
now the data type that we're going to
select is this n var car with
50 characters so we're go ahead and
select that we don't need to worry about
that right now but that basically allows
us to add Unicode characters so we're
going to go ahead and use that and for
now we're going to go ahead and allow
nulls we may change that later on now
let's go ahead and add the rest we're
going to add address and we'll do the
same thing for each one of these and we
needed a phone and we needed a column
for email so go ahead and add that as
well there we go so we've got all four
of our columns now that we need now you
may be inclined to go ahead and hit save
but actually first you want to hit
update this will actually update the
database itself with all these columns
we've added so go ahead and hit that now
and then you're just going to go ahead
and select this update database option
right here and then you'll see down in
our little message box we got the update
completed successfully so we're good to
go now go ahead and save the project
itself we'll do a save all and then what
I want you to do is actually close out
and we're going to reopen this because
I've seen some instances where the table
actually wasn't saved so what we want to
do is close out of this and then come
back in and make sure our table is
actually there so go ahead and exit out
of visual studio so again go ahead and
open up your visual studio project and
once you have your project back open
let's go ahead and select our database
and what we want to do now is expand
this tables node here and there you can
see we've got our login table and
hopefully you do as well now what I want
you to do is right click on our table
and you're going to select show table
data so go ahead and hit that and here
you can see we've got all of our four
columns this is exactly the way it looks
in any professional database that you
will see out there on the market they
will have all their columns and
sometimes many more added to their table
now the reasons these show no is we
haven't entered any data into here yet
but when we do when we start adding
records our rows will be created and
we'll see the data populated so if Larry
logs in and creates an account we'll see
a row here at it and we'll get to that
in a few videos okay I will see you guys
in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
