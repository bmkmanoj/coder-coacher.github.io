off in the last video now in the last
video we set up our grid and you can see
we added all of our columns we added six
columns now what we've been doing so far
is using bootstraps classes we use the
container class and then inside that we
put the row class and we use the column
class to create our columns but you also
will have to use your own stylesheet
that's why we created this style sheets
CSS as well
because you're going to need to
customize your own columns so that's
what we're gonna do in this video we're
gonna actually add our own customized
classes so that we can format these
columns the way we want to so we've got
the basic framework in place so what
we're gonna do is create an individual
class for each one of these columns now
you can use IDs if you want if you don't
plan on reusing these at all you can go
ahead and just create an ID we're gonna
create a class but again you can do what
you want so what we're gonna do is go
ahead and hit enter here and we're gonna
go ahead and add a new div and this will
hold our new class and we're gonna call
this call one for column one that will
be our first class for this first column
good and that's all we really need of
course we need to close out the div
again because we add in another div so
let's go down here and we'll just go
ahead and copy and paste that right here
and let's go ahead and just move this
back a little bit so it's nice and neat
okay so there we go so now we've got our
first column class and this is again is
going to be a class that we're gonna
specify in our own stylesheet not
bootstraps and that's the way you use
bootstrap you'll use some bootstrap
classes and then you'll create some of
your own classes to add some of your
code so almost all bootstraps are hybrid
websites they have their own customized
CSS code and then they will use
bootstraps code okay so now that we've
got our first column set let's go ahead
and we're gonna copy and paste this into
the rest of our column so we don't have
to retype everything remember
copy and paste is our best friend we
don't want to have to type everything
out do we know so let's go ahead and
we'll just highlight this portion hit
copy and paste and there we go we've got
that all set we just need to make a
unique class here so we're gonna update
this and make this two there we go and
let's just follow that same procedure
for the rest of these columns
oops and I need to update the text as
well okay we're done so let's make sure
this all looks good 6 &amp;amp; 6 5 &amp;amp; 5 4 &amp;amp; 4 3
&amp;amp; 3 2 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 okay so we're good to
go
so now we've got six different classes
for each one of our columns and again
this will allow us to go ahead and
customize each one of these columns in
whatever manner we want to so now what
we need to do is flip over to our style
sheet and let's go ahead and add some
CSS for these columns okay so let's go
ahead and we'll add some CSS for column
1 and let's go ahead and give a margin
of 3 pixels and what this will do is of
course add a little space around to each
one of our columns it'll give us a nice
gutter so we're gonna go ahead and do
that and again we'll make that 3 pixels
but again you can make it whatever you
want and then let's go ahead and give it
a minimum height of 300 pixels so we
want it to be 300 pixels in height so
that will expand out our columns quite a
bit then what we're going to do is go
ahead and align the text in the center
and then let's go ahead and give a color
background color to this column and
we're gonna go ahead and give this a
color of silver let's start with that
and there we go now let's go ahead and
copy and paste this you know what we
need a dot in front of this this of
course is a class you can see how I
always make mistakes and so that's why
you should never feel too bad about
making mistakes I make them all the time
the trick is finding the mistakes when
you make them okay so let's go ahead and
just copy and paste this and we'll go
down here we're gonna keep this the same
but let's add a different color to
column 2 you don't have to use these
colors obviously you can use whatever
color you want but I'm just gonna go
ahead and make this green and we need to
make this column too and let's go ahead
and create some CSS for column 3 and
we'll make this blue
so this stands out a little differently
and we just have three more columns to
go here so let's go ahead and create
some code for column four and let's make
this red and we'll go ahead and create
the code for five and let's make this
dark green and last but not least column
six well let's go ahead and we'll make
this one orange how about that that
column will be orange okay there we go I
think we've got this all set and it
looks correct so let's go ahead and hit
save let's go back to our index.html and
hit save there let's load up our page
and we'll see what this looks like
hopefully it works and it did take a
look at that that looks really good see
we've got this nice margin now between
our columns and we've customized them
the text is centered we have all these
different background colors and now we
can really see how bootstrap works very
nicely so I'm gonna go ahead and
minimize this and it should yep see look
there look how nice bootstrap handles
that it now created a tablet view or a
more mobile centric view for our
elements you can see how nicely it
handles that any look it keeps the
appropriate size take a look at that
everything is nice and size look how it
automatically adjusts the width of the
columns perfectly I mean it's just
perfect take a look at that and if we
expand it back out then we get our nice
desktop view as well all right so this
is a good start I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
