Dom one more time in this video now in
the previous videos we've talked about
going from parent to child and then in
the last video we went from child to
parent in this video we're going to go
sibling to sibling to sibling and you
can actually go to the right and you can
go to the left so this doesn't involve
the parent-child relationship we're at
the sibling level and we stay there so
again we're just going to go from
sibling to sibling to sibling okay so
let's take a look at the code here first
let's take a look at the web page and
I've just made a minor tweak here I
moved the ID to the second paragraph
element because we want to go backwards
and forwards and so let's flip back to
the JavaScript code and start filling
this in all right so I'll go ahead and
copy and paste the first line here and
you can see we're just using get element
by ID to get the second paragraphs ID
and we're just going to store that again
in the para two variable and so I'll
copy and paste the next line here and
we're going to create a variable called
sibling and of course we're going to use
the para to object and what we're going
to do is specify next elements sibling
and so we're going to go to the right so
this should pick up the third paragraph
which of course is the sibling of the
second paragraph and then we're going to
do what we've been doing the last couple
videos we're just going to change the
text to blue but again that's not the
point of this lecture we're interested
in this new property okay so let's go
ahead and save everything up and let's
see if this works and we'll go launch
this in chrome and there you can see the
third paragraph text is changed to blue
alright so let's go back to the
JavaScript code and let's make a comment
here so you can have this as an example
and we'll just copy and paste this
entire line here and so the next
property we can put here is previous
element sibling and I think you know
what that means
so we'll just save everything up here
and let's go ahead and run this and if
we click our button there you can see
the previous sibling of the second
paragraph which is the first paragraph
of course is now altered okay so one
thing I want to point out here before we
go is that you can actually get rid of
this element yes
you could just use the previous sibling
property and the same thing for here you
could just say next sibling but remember
you'll run into those whitespace nodes
if you do that remember once you pull
the element out of here you will start
hitting those whitespace nodes so I do
not recommend that you do that I
recommend that you use these properties
that have element in them because it's
really kind of difficult to deal with
those whitespace nodes okay that's going
to do it for this video in the next
video we are going to start looking at
form validation a huge subject in
JavaScript
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
