beginning HTML HTML is the bedrock of
the world wide web and if you're going
to do anything even in other languages
involving the web it is highly important
you know HTML so let's take a look at
some of these bullet points and again
this is an introductory video in the
next video we'll actually start doing
some code now as you can see in that
first bullet point HTML stands for
hypertext markup language and you might
say wow what is that but it's actually
very easy to use HTML hTML is a document
that contains text that's it it's very
easy to read so it's not like Java which
kind of reads like hieroglyphics hTML is
just a document that contains text so
it's similar to like Microsoft Word or
even notepad or WordPad so again it's
very easy to read now once you've
created your HTML document web browsers
can read and display documents that
contain HTML so Firefox Google Internet
Explorer they all do the same thing
they're going to take that document and
display it to the user ok so let's move
along to the next slide so it's all
about tags in HTML and as you can see in
that first bullet point all tags have
angle brackets so in that next bullet
point this is a body tag right here with
its two angle brackets and so that by
itself is a tag now every tag has a
closing tag which is right here and then
we put something inside those tags so
it's like the yin and the yang of the
universe if you have an opening tag you
got to have a closing one and the
closing one right here is identified by
this slash so it's that simple
there's a start and an end so one's a
start tag and the one with the slash is
the end tag now together with all the
tags and whatever we put inside those
tags they are called in markup element
and so basically a markup element is a
set of tags that has something that goes
inside of it that's all it is now I also
want to point out here is we're just
using the body tag
as an example we'll be going over many
other tags in the other videos now most
of the HTML code that you'll be doing
always has an opening tag and an end tag
but there are a few tags where you don't
need to have an end tag and those are
called empty elements and we can see
this in the next bullet point and so if
you look at this particular type of tag
it has BR there and that stands for a
line break so that means you're
basically putting spaces between your
lines that's all that does but we don't
need to put anything inside that it's
just creating a line break so it doesn't
need an end tag so that's why it's
called an empty element so that's
basically it it's those two type of
elements that we're going to be dealing
with now you might be asking what am i
what do I need to download for this
series and the answer is nothing all you
have to use is no pet remember an HTML
document is simply a text file so all we
really are going to need for this series
is no pad now if you want to use another
type of text editor that's certainly
fine you can use notepad plus plus if
you want to follow along now if you want
to go ahead and use other solutions such
as visual studio or Dreamweaver to
follow along in the entire series you
can certainly do that as well but I'm
just going to be using notepad okay
that's it for this introductory video I
will see you guys in the next video
where we will do our first web page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
