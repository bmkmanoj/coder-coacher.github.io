little select menu here and we formatted
it with the Select menu widget in jQuery
now what we're gonna do is go ahead and
add some groupings to our options here
and you can group those using the opt
group element so again that's what we're
gonna do so let's go ahead and specify
that right here and we just type in OTT
group now what we want to do is go ahead
and give it a label and this is what
will appear as the grouping in our
select menu and you'll see that in a
moment
and since these are States let's just go
ahead and appropriately call these
states and then we need to go ahead and
close it out down here okay so let's go
ahead and refresh our page and let's see
what we get and there you can see we've
got our label now States and this
indicates to the user that these are all
related options now you're really only
gonna use this if you add another group
so let's say we also wanted to give the
user the ability to select countries
well we just add another opted group so
let's go ahead and do that we'll just
copy all this let's go right down here
let's paste this and we're gonna call
this countries that's what we're gonna
call this and we'll make the first
country the United States and we'll put
that in right here as well this will be
what's displayed in our menu and for the
second country let's go ahead and pick
India and for the third country let's
pick France how about that
okay so let's save everything up let's
refresh our page and there you can see
look how nice that looks we've got two
groupings now of options that the user
can select from so that is working very
nicely now most of the time I use this
select menu as it is but sometimes you
may want to format this part right here
you may want to make the group label
bolder or you may want to change the
color so let's go ahead and do that
so open up your jQuery folder and we're
gonna go down to the jQuery - UI dot
structure that's where we're going and
you're gonna go ahead and edit
that with no pad of course and then what
I want you to do is a find on ups group
and there you can see it found it right
here and you can see they created a
class for the app group so that's
exactly what we want to alter and you
could actually add a number here if you
wanted to like 900 that would increase
the font weight but in this case let's
just go ahead and change the color and
let's change it just to red so let's go
ahead and save this will refresh our
page and there you can see take a look
at that the headings now are in red so
that's exactly where you need to go to
change the color of the heading now
remember if you want to change other
areas in this we're not going to go
through this because we've done this in
other videos but just remember all you
have to do is right click and inspect on
the element and that will tell you the
class and the CSS file that you need to
update in the jQuery UI folder so just
remember that all right so let's go
ahead and just close this out and
actually we don't even need this style
sheet anymore now in the last video I
showed you how to use the width property
and there's another one that I like to
use as well and we've done this before
with other widgets and that is we change
the icon here so we'll go ahead and do
that really quickly now remember if we
use multiple properties in jQuery we
need to put a comma here and then we can
add another property and the property
that we're gonna add is the icons
property and I've already got this all
typed out so I'm just gonna go ahead and
copy and paste that and there you can
see we use the icons property and then
we go ahead and use the button property
and we put in the particular icon that
we want in this case I'm using the Aero
thick oops and I screwed up my pace
there let me repay that okay there we go
so let's try this again
and there you can see we've got the nice
icon the new icon but in any event there
you go and as always I will put this
code in the description of this video
okay so that's gonna do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
