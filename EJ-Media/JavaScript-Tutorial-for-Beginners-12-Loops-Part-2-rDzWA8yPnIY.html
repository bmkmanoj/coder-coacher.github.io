along with JavaScript syntax and
specifically we're going to look at the
for loop now the for loop is a lot like
the while loop and that's why I'm going
to leave the code up that we used from
the last video which of course was a
while loop and I will just keep that
commented out because I want to show you
how similar the while loop in the for
loop are now you'll remember that we
wanted to write out the statement a
statement has run four times and so we
set up this condition to do just that on
the fifth time it was false and then the
program was finished but we got our four
lines of a statement has run written out
and that's what we wanted and what does
that do for us well we don't have to
type out this statement four times we
can just have the loop do it four times
for us now in terms of a four loop like
I said it's very similar to a while loop
here is the key difference we are taking
all the statements and remember there's
three parts to this there's a counter
which of course is our variable I which
stood for index there's the condition
which is the second statement and there
is the incrementer so what we do is we
take all three of these and put those
inside these parentheses and they go in
a top-down order so this will be the
first ones and so let's go ahead and
copy and paste that in the parenthesis
so we'll put that here then we'll take
our condition which is always in the
second spot right in the middle so we
put that after our counter and then we
need a semicolon so a semicolon
separates the statements and then we
need our incrementer we do not need a
semicolon for the last statement and so
again that's just the big difference
we're just taking all three of these and
putting these inside the parenthesis and
let's go ahead and save this and let's
go to our web page and run this now and
we should get four lines of code and we
did and so as I said it did the same
thing that our while loop in the last
video did you might ask well why would I
use a for loop and here is the answer
many developers find this easier to read
and understand because all the
statements are right here in the
parenthesis we can just simply see here
we've got our counter we've got our
conditional and here's where we're
incrementing
counter it's alright there we don't have
to go all over the place like we do in
the while loop to see what's going on so
this is much easier to understand for
many developers and that is the reason
the for loop is one of the most popular
loops in coding now you may say well
wait a minute this is pretty easy to
read here but what if we had 50 lines
here of code and now you have to go find
where the incrementer is so I think you
guys get my point so that is it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
