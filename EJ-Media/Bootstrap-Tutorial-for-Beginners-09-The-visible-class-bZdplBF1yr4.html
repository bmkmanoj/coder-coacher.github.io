to our main column and so we learned how
to nest columns in this video we're
going to learn how to use some of the
responsive utility classes that
bootstrap provides and what that allows
you to do is only to display certain
elements with particular devices and
sizes so it's sort of like a media
queries on steroids
so basically we added these three
columns now look what happens when we
minimize this these kind of get all
crunched into the main column so what we
want to do is actually remove these on
smaller devices we only want to display
our main column we don't want all these
inside columns here because this doesn't
look quite as good so what we want to
only do is display these in larger
resolutions so that's what we're going
to do is let's go ahead and close this
out and so here is where of course we
put our inside columns so again
bootstrap provides classes that we can
use to go ahead and make these visible
with particular device types so let's go
to this first one which we have right
here and what we do is we go right past
our column class and we type in the
keyword visible and so this is the
visible class that we can use and then
you put in - MD and remember that stands
for medium-sized
device so what this means is we are only
going to display this column on a medium
sized device it will not display on any
other type of resolution and we can also
put in visible for the larger devices as
well which of course is LG it's the same
thing you just put in - LG and now this
column will not display on smaller
devices it should only display on the
medium-sized and larger devices so let's
go ahead and copy this and let's go down
and put this in our other columns as
well our other inside comps we're just
going to paste this right here and then
we're gonna go down to this final inside
column the third one that we created and
we're gonna copy and paste that right
there so now let's go ahead and save
this let's go ahead and load our web
page again and there you can see the
columns are displayed which is what we
want it will be displayed on medium and
larger resolutions now if we minimize
this these should now disappear let's
see
it works and look at that it did now we
only have our main column which is what
we wanted on smaller devices so that
works really really nicely so you can
see how useful this visibility class is
in boots Jeff it's very very useful so
that your website will look perfect on
particular device types so let's go
ahead and maximize this again and there
you can see we've got our inside columns
back now it works both ways we can
actually only display elements on small
devices let's say this column 7 right
here we only want to display this on
small devices let's go ahead and do that
we can do that too I just want to show
you this as an example so let's close
this out and let's go down to where that
column 7 is it's right here and so of
course what do we do we type in visible
again and this time we're gonna put - X
s and of course that is for extra small
devices so the very very small
resolution so let's save this and let's
reload our page and now if this works we
should not see the column 7 in the
larger resolution and it is not there so
now let's go ahead and minimize this
let's scroll down and there you can see
it now appears on the smaller resolution
so once again you can see how nicely
this visibility class works it's very
very powerful and it allows you to
tailor base your website to the
particular device types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
