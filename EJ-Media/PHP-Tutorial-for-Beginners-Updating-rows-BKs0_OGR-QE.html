this email column and we learned how to
remove it as well in this video we're
going to learn how to update an existing
row now let's say we want to add an
email to Mark's record and as we know
it's blank right now that is where we
need to use a few different SQL commands
now the first thing we needed to do is
specify that we're going to update the
table and in this case we use the update
command and then we have to specify the
table that we're updating in this case
it's user data and here is where we use
the set command and this is what allows
us to update the email field in this row
now first we have to specify the column
that we want to update and of course it
is the email column and then we put in
the value which of course is mark at
test com
now this is where it gets a little bit
tricky there's a second part to this you
have to use the where keyword and
basically that allows us to narrow down
which row we in fact want to update
obviously sequel doesn't know that so we
need to specify it so think of this
almost as if you're matching something
so what we do is we put in the name
column and then we put in marks name
here so it will come down here and it'll
match mark and then it seek will say oh
you want to update this row once you get
the match then the data is updated so
that's why you use the where so it just
returns only the rows where it matches
the particular string and in this case
it's mark so let's go ahead and run this
and we'll hit enter and we got our query
okay message now let's go ahead and make
sure it happened or it really happened
and there you can see the column in our
row was updated and we now have Marc's
email address in there now I would like
to point out that if there was a
previous email in here we would have
overwritten what was already there now
what if we want to append another email
to this but we don't want to overwrite
the existing email address while we have
to do things a little bit differently we
use the same syntax as before we use the
update command we use the set command we
have to specify the column which is
email but here's where it's a little bit
different we put the original value
right here which was market test comm
and then in parentheses we put the new
value that we want to append and we're
using the where keyword again to match
on all the rows that have marking it so
it's somewhat similar the only
difference here is that we're using
these parentheses to append this value
to the existing value that's already
there so let's go ahead and copy and
paste this and make sure it works let's
hit enter and let's make sure in fact
did work and it did you can see now we
have the mark one at test.com and we've
appended that to the original value okay
I will see you guys in the next lecture
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
