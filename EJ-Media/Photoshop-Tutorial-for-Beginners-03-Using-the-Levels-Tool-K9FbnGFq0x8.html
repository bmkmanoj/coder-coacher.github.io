the levels tool that you can use in
Photoshop and this basically allows you
to adjust the brightness levels of an
image histogram of course the histogram
that we talked about in the last video
so again it mainly allows you to adjust
the brightness and contrast so really
what you're going to use this tool for
is to fix images that were either
underexposed or overexposed and so what
we're going to do is go ahead and
actually fix an image that was grossly
under exposed and we're going to use
that image we talked about in the last
video so what I want you to do is go
ahead and open up that underexposed
image and I don't know if you downloaded
that or not if you didn't I will provide
a link to this photo in the description
of this video so go ahead and open that
up and as you can see that is just
grossly under exposed so what we want to
do is go up to image and I want you to
do exactly what I do I want you to go up
to adjustments and then I want you to
open up the levels tool and so as you
see we get our histogram here and then
just go ahead and drag this over the
right now you can also open up the
levels tool down here but I don't want
you to open it up from here because we
want to get this options box right here
and you do not get that if you open it
up from down here so as you can see we
get our nice histogram and this tool as
well and as we know everything to the
left represents darker tones everything
in the middle our mid-tones and
everything to the right are lighter
tones and as we can see everything is on
the left so again this is an
underexposed image and you can kind of
see these values down here zero the one
in the 255 basically as I talked about
the last video we want everything spread
across nicely across those values so the
fact that there's nothing in the 255
range
indicates a serious problem with this
photo we don't even have anything really
in the 1.0 range mostly everything's
trending to the zero range and again the
zero would represent darker tones the
1.0 value represents mid-tones and the
255 range represents lighter tones so
how to fix this image the first thing we
can do is hit auto and you notice not a
lot happened there
it didn't really fix it and that's what
you're going to notice when you use the
auto option a lot of times it just
simply doesn't work so that's why we
actually need this options button right
here so we can actually select a
different option to get a better result
now another thing
to show you to is hit the Alt button and
you notice this button flipped to reset
and what this allows you to do is
basically reset the changes you just
made without actually having to cancel
out of this menu so go ahead and hit
that and then everything is back to
where it was so that's a nice little tip
that you can use for all the rest of
menus actually Photoshop works in that
way if you just hit the alt button it'll
give you a chance to cancel the changes
rather than having to cancel out of this
menu and then you would of course have
to go and reopen it and that's kind of a
pain so let's go ahead now and hit the
options button and what you're going to
see here are four different options and
the one that works best with
underexposed and overexposed images is
find dark and light colors so let's hit
that and take a look at that notice how
we have this nice range now between 0
and 255 so if we hit OK to this our
photo looks a lot better so that's why
having this options button is really key
if you change the option to find dark
and light colors it works a lot better
than the default which was enhanced
brightness and contrast so again you'll
want to play around with these but for
the most part for underexposed and
overexposed images you're generally
going to use this option this is usually
the best one okay that's going to do it
for this video in the next video we're
going to talk about this eyedropper as
well as some other options that you can
use in the levels menu see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
