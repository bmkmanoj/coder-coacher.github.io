beginning JavaScript and this is part of
our ongoing web development series now
in terms of prerequisites if you have no
previous experience with HTML or CSS you
should go to my youtube channel page and
take the beginning tutorials on both
HTML and CSS because they kind of go
hand-in-hand with JavaScript now in
terms of what you'll need any text
editor will do but I will be using
notepad in this series but again you can
use any text editor now HTML CSS and
JavaScript I like to call those the big
three they work hand-in-hand to produce
an interactive website HTML of course
add structure to our webpages so items
such as layout sections and paragraph
that makes up our website and really
gives it an overall structure we use CSS
to style our HTML tags and so that adds
style to our webpages so items such as
color borders all those types of things
at all the pizzazz to our website and
then Java Script adds programing to our
webpages and that really makes our
webpages interactive it allows our
webpages to be dynamic and to respond to
user input and so we'll go over all that
in this entire series
now how is JavaScript different from
other programming languages well the big
difference is we don't have to compile
our code and we also don't need an IDE
so we can just place the JavaScript code
right in our web page and then the
browser executes it now where do we
place our JavaScript code we place the
JavaScript code in the script element
tag within our HTML web page and of
course the script element tag is placed
within the head element tag and we'll be
going over that in the next video so
we're not actually going to do any
coding in this introductory video we'll
get to that in the next video oh and one
more thing I will be dividing this
series into two parts in the first part
we'll be exploring the concepts of
JavaScript and in the second part we'll
apply those concepts to an actual
website probably the website that we
developed in the CSS layout tutorials ok
see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
