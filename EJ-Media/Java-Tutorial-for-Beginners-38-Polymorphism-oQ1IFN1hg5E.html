beginning Java today we're going to look
at polymorphism now a lot of people make
polymorphism more complicated than it
really should be it's actually a very
very simple concept to understand and
it's a concept that is used in almost
all languages that use object orientated
programming so in order to understand
polymorphism we have to look at the way
we've been creating objects now we
created objects using a superclass and a
subclass and from that subclass we
created our objects so if you look at
this we have our superclass of insect
which of course is the broad-based
template and then we created a more
specific sub class and beetle and then
we create our beetle objects from that
so if you take a look at the code down
there the reference type was beetle and
the object that we created was beetle
the reference type is beetle and the
object type is beetle there are one in
the same so it's a one-to-one
relationship so again we create objects
from this subclass but we can also
create objects from the superclass and
go directly from there so instead of
specifying beetle we actually specify
insect for the reference type and that
is polymorphism we're going directly the
superclass and creating objects from
there if we can create all the different
types of insects we want directly from
the superclass so again before it's
important to note that the reference
type and the object type were the same a
beetle was a beetle
but with polymorphism the reference and
the object can be different and so again
they are not the same type the reference
variable type is declared as insect but
the object that we create is a new
beetle and so again the reference type
can be the superclass of the actual
object type so again we're just going to
the superclass now polymorphism is
actually a biological term and what it
means in biology is let's say you have a
virus and we call that virus XYZ well
you know a virus mutates and a virus
constantly mutate so there are new
versions of it and so that is what
polymorphism means it's just flavors or
versions of a specific type so in this
case we could create all these different
types of insects from our superclass so
we could have beetles we could have
spiders we could have mosquitoes
we want to create and that is
polymorphism now you really see how this
works in polymorphic arrays so I'm going
to give you an example of a polymorphic
array okay so let's take a look at the
code now I've set up a main class that
has our main method which is just called
app dot Java and here's our array that
I've set up and again take a look at
this we're actually specifying the
superclass here now before we probably
would have put in a roach or a beetle up
here and then we would just put in a
bunch of beetles actually we want to
make this spider and so you can see we
have all the different flavors of an
insect and that's pretty cool so again
we want to put the superclass here we
don't want to put our subclass before
we'd actually put the subclass and so
and then we can store all the different
types of insects we want inside this
array now it's important to note that
you still have to have an inheritance
setup for this to work so we still have
to extend all these little subclasses
off of our superclass in order for this
to work but we're going to use the
superclass again to create our objects
and we're also going to use the super
classes methods
that's probably morphism we're going
directly here to use the super classes
method and then I created a for loop you
guys remember that from previous videos
so we're going to loop through each one
of these objects so again we're going to
declare an array type of insect which is
our superclass type right here and then
we can put any type of subclass of
insect inside the insect array so we can
have roaches beetles spiders whatever we
want and then what's really cool we can
loop through the array and call any of
the superclass methods we want down here
so it'll hit each one of these methods
so that's pretty cool
so let's go ahead and run this and you
can see we got three insects that were
eating the roach the beetle and the
spider and you know we could add another
spider if we wanted here and that's
pretty cool if we wanted to have two
spiders doing that we could do that we
just need to add this three here and if
we run it actually we had to increase
the amount of objects we have which are
for now so let's rerun this and there
you see we've got four insects that are
eating now we could override one of
these methods if we want to
let's let's take this method the eat
method and let's put that in Roch and
we're going to say a brooch as eaten now
remember when we do an override we're
taking this method with the same name
and overriding the superclass method so
this one will take precedence but you
have to use the same name and then we
can put whatever we want here so if we
go back and run this you can see we got
a roach as eaten so that is how
polymorphism works I will see you guys
