at the new structure tags that you can
use in html5 now in previous series
we've been using of course the div
element tag that's the major structural
tag that you can use in HTML and you can
continue to use the div element tag if
you want to in fact many web developers
like to use diz and divs only you could
also combine them so you can use some
divs and you can use some of these new
html5 structure tags it's really how you
want to do it now the thought here is
that basically what these new tags do is
that they are more specific so for
instance let's take a look at this first
section here this section right here
this of course is our header now of
course we had to use a div element tag
for this and then we needed to create a
class called header well now in html5
they've got an actual header tag that we
can use so that's what we're going to do
we're just going to put it in right here
so we just type in header and we'll go
down here and close it and so now we
have our html5 header tag here and since
we no longer need to use the class let's
go over to our style sheet and get rid
of the class so we just need to use a
type selector now and there we go
and I forgot to mention you will
probably recognize this web page from
before we designed this in the CSS
layout series so that's what we're using
so we're basically converting an
existing web page that had the
developments and we're going to use
html5 structure tags and I think it's
easier to understand these tags if you
actually migrate an old page to the new
structure tags so I think that's a
useful exercise so that's why we're
doing this now the next section of
course is the nav bar and that of course
is used to hold links and so html5 has
created a tag just for the nav bar and
that's right here so let's go ahead and
replace that and we just type in nav
here and we just close it so you get the
idea here we don't even have to use
classes anymore or development tags we
can actually just use the name of the
tag in html5
and of course we need to go over the
style sheet and again we need to get rid
of our ID selector here we're just going
to use the type selector now
now let's go down to the sidebar and of
course it's right here and here is a
sidebar on the web page and what we want
to use for that is the aside element tag
in html5 is called a site and basically
it's just content that is usually to the
side of the main content our main
contents right here and our sidebar is
right here so that's how that works so
let's go ahead and put in the side tag
right here and then we'll just close it
and let's go over to the CSS and update
that good now there's one more section
of course that is our main div section
right here and you can actually use a
couple different types of html5
structure tags but the main one we're
going to use is section I think that's
the good one to use here because this is
used for a general purpose container
basically the main content and that's
what this section is so let's go ahead
and place that right here and let's flip
over to our stylesheet and update that
good so let's save everything up now and
actually we'll keep the existing page up
here so we'll load a new page and then
we can compare them so let's go ahead
and load this in Chrome and we'll expand
this out and there you can see they look
exactly the same that's what you want to
make sure actually after you do the
conversion make sure they look exactly
the same things haven't changed okay
that's gonna do it for this video thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
