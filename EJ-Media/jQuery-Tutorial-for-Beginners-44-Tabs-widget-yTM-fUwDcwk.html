tabs widget in jQuery now the tabs
widget is very similar to the accordion
widget that we talked about a few videos
ago the only difference is we use the
panels to go horizontally with the
accordion widget it's vertical panels
but again we can use the tabs widget to
go horizontally so what we're gonna do
is stick it right inside of our main div
which of course is this big content pane
right here so I've already created the
code here and here you can see here's
our main div right here and inside of
this this is all the code for the tab
widget now it's really a three step
process to setting up the tab widget you
need a container which I made right here
and this is actually what we will use in
our jQuery code this is what we
reference so this is just like a
gigantic wrapper so I've created that
then the next thing you need is an
unordered list and this is basically all
of our links now each one of these lis
right here represents a tab
so our first tab will be on ancient
Greece our second tab will be on ancient
Rome we have a third tab here for
ancient Egypt now what happens here is
we need an anchor link and then we need
to use a hash tag to point to the div
section that corresponds with this tab
so this first tab right here in ancient
Greece this corresponds to this div
right here and you can see I've and you
can see I've created an ID called Greece
so we need to reference that up here in
this first li element and you can see
I've done that I've used the hashtag and
then Greece so that points to this div
so when the user clicks on this tab this
content will be displayed and so on so
when they click on the second tab we
have an href to our Rome section which
of course is this div section right here
with an ID of Rome and so on same thing
for Egypt which is right down here so
those are the three parts the first part
we need the container the second part we
need our li elements and in the third
part we need our div sections and again
our li elements each point to a
different div section where you want to
display content so that's the three
parts by the way that's what the code
inside the jQuery function that we're
about to call it needs these three
sections that's how it works it needs
all three of these sections in this
format so you can see there's actually
quite a bit of setup in
HTML that's what we're really doing with
this particular widget so now that we've
got this set let's actually go down and
create our jQuery code and as usual it
will only be really one line so what
we'll do is we'll use the ID for our
main container which of course is well
main container let's just go ahead and
copy this and we'll just paste this in
down here and of course we need a
hashtag and there we go and then we
simply call the tabs function and this
of course will create our tab widget so
let's save this and let's see if this
works we'll go ahead and load this and
there you can see we got all three of
our tabs take a look at that and the
default of course is the first tab which
is ancient Greece if we click on ancient
Rome now the content for ancient Rome
displays if we click on ancient Egypt
now the content for ancient Egypt
displays and let's actually go ahead and
minimize this for a second and we'll
just pull this over here so let's
actually minimize this as well so here's
our link and our main tab for ancient
Greece which is right here and you can
see here's where we put the name ancient
Greece that's what will be displayed on
our main tab the second tab of course is
for ancient Rome you can see that
displays right here and again these all
point to a different div section that
contains our content so let's go ahead
and we'll add a fourth section just to
make sure everything is working properly
so let's go ahead and do that and once
you get this set up
it's pretty easy to add sections so
let's go ahead and we're just going to
add a second section on ancient Egypt
we'll just say ancient Egypt - and we'll
come down here and we'll give this a
different ID we'll call this Egypt - and
then let's just go ahead and copy and
paste this and we'll go ahead and add
our fourth content panel so let's go
ahead and save this let's run it and
let's make sure everything's working and
it is there we go we've got our fourth
content panel so this is very useful if
you want to display a lot of content on
your main content page you can put a lot
of different content and just allow the
user to click around on the different
tabs okay that's gonna do it I will see
you guys in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
