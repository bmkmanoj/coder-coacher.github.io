beginning Java in the last video we
wrote out - a binary file in this video
we're going to write out - a text file
and so let's go ahead and open up
NetBeans and you can see here I've typed
everything out now we're going to use a
different class than we did in the last
video I still actually have the code up
here we used two classes file output
stream and object output stream but to
write out a text file is actually a lot
easier and so we're going to use this
file writer class and that's all we need
we don't need any other classes and so
we're going to do the same thing we're
going to use a try/catch which is a way
to handle an exception if it occurs and
if it occurs of course we'll get a
system data out print to say the program
failed but actually in this video we're
actually going to put some data inside
our text file and so we're going to
create a string variable here called
text and that's going to hold the text
and I just typed in text inside the a
file and that's not a good sentence how
about text inside the file okay much
better and then of course we're going to
create an object off of our file writer
class that's provided by Java and again
we're getting that out of the Java dot
IO library and of course here is where
we are going to create our file or text
file now once we have our object of
course we can start using the methods
from file writer and so we use the write
method and we just put in our variable
here that we created up here which holds
this string text and so that'll write it
out and then we just close it so as you
can see it's a little bit easier to
write out a text file and we'll run this
and it ran fine the try ran fine because
we didn't get a catch there was no
system dot out print on the command line
here and so let's go ahead and check the
C Drive and there you can see we've got
our test text now if I open this up
there we've got our data text inside the
file now let's go back to NetBeans and
let's go ahead and close this out now I
want to point out one thing here you
don't actually have to use a variable
here to get text inside the file we
could actually comment that out and you
could put in the text right in here so
you would put you know we would put
quotes
and if we go ahead and run this and we
go back to our file now you can see
we've just got text so again that's just
a different way you can do that but
let's go ahead and keep it the way we
had it and we'll uncomment this out in
the next tutorial we'll actually look at
how to write out to an XML file which is
another way that you can write out data
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
