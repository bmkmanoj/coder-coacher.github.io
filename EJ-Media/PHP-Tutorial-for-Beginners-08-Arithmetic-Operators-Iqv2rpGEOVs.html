arithmetic operators in PHP and for
those of you who have taken other
programming tutorials this will look
somewhat familiar now there are seven
basic arithmetic operators in PHP and
there are the big four I like to call
them addition subtraction division and
multiplication then there is the modulus
operator and there is the increment and
decrement operators and we will talk
about all of these in this video so
first things first let's go ahead and
create a variable here and as you know
by now we need to use the dollar sign
and so we'll just do a very simple
variable and we'll give this an
assignment of 10 that's the value we'll
assign to it and then let's go ahead and
create another variable and we'll just
call that B and we'll give this a value
of 5 and then we're gonna create a third
variable which will give us the result
and then what we're gonna do is we'll
first use the addition operator and this
is extremely simple so we'll just say a
plus B pretty simple stuff again and
then of course we need to echo out the
results of our variable and if we've
done everything correctly this should
total 15 let's hope it does so let's go
ahead and save this let's go ahead and
refresh our page and it does and we'll
just walk through these very quickly so
if we subtract 10 from 5 we of course
should get 5 hopefully refresh our page
and we do and then let's go ahead and
divide these and hopefully we get 2 we
refresh our page and we do and let's go
ahead and do the final one the
multiplication will refresh our page
over here again and we get 50 which is
what we wanted now let's talk about the
modulus operator and what that is all
about now this basically gives us the
remainder of a division so if you divide
something and there's no remainder
you'll get zero but if there is a
remainder then we'll get essentially the
leftovers so I'll show you how this
works right now now you use the percent
sign for the modulus so we'll go ahead
and use this so what will happen here is
10 will be divided by 5 now we should
get 0 right because there's nothing left
over that divides evenly so let's go
ahead and refresh this and we do get 0
what if we switched this to four let's
switch our variable B to four let's save
this now what should happen here is this
won't divide evenly right there will be
a remainder here and it should be a
remainder of two right so let's go ahead
and refresh this and that's exactly what
happened now let's switch this to 15 and
seven so guess what the remainder should
be it should be one right because the
closest that we can divide this is 14 so
there should be one left over so let's
save this let's refresh it and we get
one now if we put 14 here well that
divides evenly we should have no
remainder now and there you can see
we've got 0 so that's how the modulus
works now let's go ahead and talk about
the increment and decrement operators so
let's go ahead and get rid of this
variable and then all we're gonna do is
Reese Pesa fie the variable here and
we're just going to put a increment
operator right next to it that's all you
have to do and then of course we need to
close this out with a semicolon and then
we're just gonna echo out this variable
now now this should give us 15 so let's
go ahead and hit this and we do we get
15 which is what we expected now this is
just a short way to increment the value
of our a variable you could actually
write this out if you want to do so you
could say dollar sign a equals and then
you could put dollar sign a plus one and
then that would give you the same result
we're not gonna do that here but it's
the same thing
decrement operator does exactly the
opposite it should decrement it by one
so now we should get 13 if we refresh
our page yep we get 13 so that's it as
you can see these are pretty simple I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
