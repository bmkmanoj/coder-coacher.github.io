off in the last video and in this video
we're going to learn how to combine
effect you can actually add multiple
effects to your widgets and we're gonna
do this with the tooltip widget now one
thing I forgot to mention in the last
video was what this show property does
it literally means when you hover over
the element that shows the tooltip
that's what it means now you might be
asking well it does that anyways without
the show property but jQuery doesn't
know that we need to tell jQuery what we
want to do when we show the tooltip and
in this case we wanted a blind effect
and we wanted the duration at 800
milliseconds so that's why you have to
specify this show property
it literally means when we show the
tooltip now you might ask well how can i
combine effects and a neat way to do
that is to do something when we hover
off of the element and that is the hide
property and that means the tooltip just
goes away now if we want to combine
effects and do multiple effects remember
we have to do everything within these
parentheses right here so what we want
to do is put a comma right there and
let's just hit enter here a couple times
and what we're gonna do now is copy and
paste all of this on our second line
right down here and let's go ahead and
line these up really nicely I like to do
it that way and here is where we're
going to specify the height and again
this will control what we want to do
when we hover off of the element and
again it already does that but once
again jQuery doesn't know that we need
to tell jQuery what we want to do when
we hover off of the element and in this
case we're going to do another effect
now you can go ahead and continue to use
the blind effect but I'm going to go
ahead and put the fade in right here I
think this is always pretty neat and
let's go ahead and put the fade out
right here so this will be pretty cool
when we hover over the element it'll
fade in and when we hover off of the
element the tooltip will fade out so
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page and there you can see
we got the nice fade in when we hovered
over the picture now let's over off and
you can see we get the nice fade out and
you can go ahead and
put in other effects that you want to
use here you don't have to necessarily
use the fade in and fade out so that is
how you combine effects using the jQuery
UI I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
