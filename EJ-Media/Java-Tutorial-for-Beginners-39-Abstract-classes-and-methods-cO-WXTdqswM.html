beginning Java in this video we're going
to look at abstract classes and abstract
methods and what I've done here is I've
set up a super class in mammal and then
some subclasses in human and whale and
they are of course flavors of a mammal
so first thing I'm going to do is talk
about some of the rules that are
associated with abstract classes and
abstract methods and then I'm going to
talk about why we use abstract methods
and classes and then in the next video
I'm going to tie it all together with
interfaces okay so let's go ahead and
make a abstract method first okay and so
what is common to mammals well they all
have hair so let's make a hair method
now you're going to notice something
different here right off the top of the
bat this is going to be a blank method
that is the way an abstract method is
done it is blank we fill in the details
later and I'll talk about that in a
little bit but it's always a blank
method that is followed by a semicolon
notice we're not using brackets here so
again we're just setting up the method
name almost in a way and we're giving
the keyword here of abstract now you'll
notice I got an intelligence take a look
at that and that says mammal is not
abstract and does not override abstract
method air blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
okay well that's a fancy way of saying
guess what if we have a abstract method
you must have a abstract class so this
class now has to be abstract so that's
the first rule if we're going to make an
abstract method we must make the class
abstract as well so we put that in here
and you notice the intellisense goes
away so that's rule number one
well actually rule number two because we
talked about this method having to be
empty and let's go ahead and let's
another common characteristic for
mammals let's talk about mammals have to
breathe air so we'll just put in here
breathe and so there's another abstract
method and let's just go ahead and open
up app dot Java I actually use that from
the previous video but we can get rid of
all this now when
are talking about polymorphism so we'll
just use that and we gotta get rid of
some of these brackets and I think we're
good to go so let's go ahead and now try
to create an object based off of our
mammal superclass and we'll do that in
our app dot Java which of course
contains our main method so let's just
do so let's just do mammal new OB J
equals new mo and semicolon and that is
the third role you cannot instantiate or
create an object off an abstract class
this prevents it and so the compiler
will complain about this he will not
allow you to do that and that is the
basic concept when you tag a classes
abstract you cannot instantiate from it
so you might ask the question how do we
get to these methods that if we can't
create an object off of it how do we get
to these well we have to extend off of
the superclass from our subclasses and
so let's go ahead and do that now and
we'll get rid of this because we know we
can't do that and so now we have to
actually extend off of there so we're
going to say extends metal and actually
put a V in there by mistake there we go
and we'll also do the same thing off of
human and you see we get some
intellisense and here's the other role
whale is not abstract and does not
override abstract method breathe in
mammal what on earth does that mean well
what this means is is if you put
abstract methods in your superclass you
must you must use them in your subclass
it is not a choice the compiler will
throw an error that is what this whole
deal means you are basically saying you
must implement these in all the
subclasses that extends off the
superclass mammal and so that is why
this is throwing an error because we
have not created those methods yet so
let's go ahead and do that
and let's go ahead and create the
breathe method and we'll just copy and
paste here and you notice the error went
away take a look at that it's gone
and basically the compiler doesn't even
care that we don't have any code in here
you notice that it just wants a method
with this method named this method ain't
breathe to match what is in here these
two abstract methods once that's done
the compiler is now happy and let's just
go ahead and copy and paste these over
into our human class and there we see
the error is gone over here so that is
the deal we must implement these into
our subclasses no matter what think of
it like a contract it's a contract the
contract is if you mark these abstract
the methods
you must according to the contract put
these in all the sub classes that
inherit off of mammal now the next
question you're going to ask is why on
earth do we do this well that's a very
good question and it all starts with why
we tagged this mammal classes abstract
now I want you to think for a second
have you guys ever seen a mammal walking
down the street well probably not is a
mammal an object is that something you
can actually see not really right it has
some characteristics that are common to
all that subclasses like whale and
whales have hair and they breathe and
humans have hair and they brie - but
mammal is just an abstract term it's not
an actual object that we can interact
with and that's why I mark this abstract
I don't want any objects created off of
this because it doesn't exist in reality
we just want to take some of the methods
some of the behaviors and attributes
that exist in it and we can use it for
the more specific subclasses because
these are common to whales and humans
but we don't actually want to create an
object from this and so I'm going to
prevent that but I do want whales and
humans to go ahead and inherit these
methods now take a look at this if you
think about this for a second so again
these are always blank and then we fill
in all the details in here and it's
almost like I said it's a contract it's
a protocol you are basically telling
everybody that's going to inherit off of
mammal will build their
from these subclasses and they will
always have these methods because these
methods will always have these
characteristics hair and breathe in
every single type of subclass that we
create off of mammal and so again it's
like a protocol and you will force that
now here's where it gets interesting we
can actually go ahead and create non
abstract methods so I can go ahead and
create a non abstract method in here and
call this swim and what's neat about
this is what does that mean well it
means I don't have to implement this
this one is not marked as abstract so I
can put these in either whale or human
or whatever subclass that I desire to in
this case we're going to go ahead and
put this in the whale subclass because
whales swim now some humans swim but not
all so I'm not going to put that in the
human subclass and so let's go ahead and
create something that's unique to humans
and what humans do they all walk well at
least most of them do so let's go ahead
and put that there and now we will put
this over into the human subclass and we
are not obligated to go ahead and put
this in the whale subclass now the one
thing also I want to point out is that
you will notice that in these abstract
methods that we created here we are
actually overriding these rights kind of
the same thing as overriding the only
difference is we're being forced to
override these so this hair method is
actually overriding what's in the mammal
or just forced to do it and again it
doesn't matter you only have to put
anything in here but Java just needs to
find that hair method ok so I hope that
explained how abstract methods and
abstract classes work now I'm going to
stop right here because I need to tie
this in with interfaces and we're going
to do that in the next video so actually
save all this stuff that you've created
here because we're going to use this in
the next video and we're going to tie it
all together with interfaces and then
you guys will be experts in how to use
interfaces and abstract classes and by
the way that is how most large programs
are used a lot of them will use
interfaces and abstract classes so I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
