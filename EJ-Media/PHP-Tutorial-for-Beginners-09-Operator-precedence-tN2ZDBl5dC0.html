operator precedence in PHP and operator
precedence is important in every
language and PHP is no exception to that
rule
now operator precedence can get very
very complicated so in this video we're
just going to talk about the basics so
you get the basic concept of it and in
later videos we'll talk about more
complicated expressions with operator
precedence now you can see here in the
comments section I've put the default
movement is always left to right that's
the default movement of operators that's
how they evaluate initially but and
that's the key word there but some
operators have greater precedence over
other operators and that can sort of
mess up this movement from left to right
and we'll talk about that in a minute
now you can see here also in the
comments section I've put addition and
subtraction are equal in precedence and
so let's start out with that so we have
a very basic expression here we're just
gonna add ten plus five and then we'll
move further to the right and then
subtract four so if this works correctly
ten plus five of course is 15 and minus
four is 11 so let's go ahead and load up
our lesson dot PHP and you can see we
got 11 which is what we expected now
this is where it can get a little tricky
let's go ahead and change this to
multiplication now if we were to move
normally from left to right this would
be 10 plus 5 of course is 15 and 15
times 4 would give us 60 but that is not
how it works because as I wrote right
here multiplication has greater
precedence over addition and subtraction
so this part of the expression will
evaluate first so it'll actually be 5
times 4 is 20 and then it will be added
to 10 and that will actually give us
something very different it will give us
30 so let's go ahead and save this let's
go ahead and refresh our page and you
can see we got 30 and it would be the
same if we had a minus here again
multiplication and division will always
take precedence over addition and
subtraction now what if you wanted 10
plus 5 here to evaluate first what if
you wanted this result to be 60 well
what you do is you use parentheses and
that will actually cause this part of
the expression
to be evaluated first let's go ahead
just copy and paste that in here and
we'll go ahead and resave this let's
refresh our page and there you can see
we got 60 so again you can always
override precedents
so at a basic level that's how
precedents works now it gets much much
more complicated than this and we'll get
into this in future videos but for now
go ahead and play around with this maybe
go ahead and put subtraction and
division together and just see how some
of these work out and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
