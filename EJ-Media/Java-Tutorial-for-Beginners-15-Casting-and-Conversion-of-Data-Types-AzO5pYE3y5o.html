tutorial on beginning Java today we're
going to take a look at casting and what
is casting well it's just converting so
that's the way you need to think of that
it's just converting and what are we
converting we're converting variables
and objects and more specifically we're
converting the data types associated
with those and remember those data types
like int float long string double member
all those data types we talked about
back in I think it was a second tutorial
well in that tutorial we just defined a
data types value and that was it we
didn't convert anything so that's what
we're going to be doing here and what
are the four main types of conversions
well you can convert an object into
another object you can convert a simple
variable into another type of variable
you can also use an object to create a
simple variable and vice versa so
there's four ways to do this conversion
so again converting information to a new
form is called casting and casting
produces a new value that is a different
type of variable object than its source
so that's the key you're doing a
conversion you're not actually changing
the value you're just converting it into
a new data type or format that you need
so let's start out with the easiest
example of casting and that is casting
simple variables two simple variables so
let's do that now
so let's convert a decimal to a whole
number so double if you remember is a
decimal point so we'll call this our
source will give this value of 150 point
zero five nice decimal number okay now
as I said we're going to do a cast to a
whole number you remember an INT is a
whole number so the destination and
we're going to say equals now here is
where we do the cast and it goes in
between these parentheses now we specify
the data type that we want to convert to
right here and we want to convert this
into a int and then we specify the
object up here so let's review this we
defined a variable source we made it a
decimal point with the double keyword
and then we're going to take that
decimal point and convert it into a
whole number because we said to do that
right here so this is where it all takes
place we're seeing convert this into a
int and specifically we're saying take
the variable sources value and convert
that into an int for destination okay so
let's go ahead and print out first
source so we're not doing a cast here
we're just going to go ahead and print
this out first and we should get 150
point zero five and that was what we
expected now let's go ahead and do the
cast so we'll go ahead and specify
estimation now and look we got a nice
whole number here of 150 what it did was
it lapped off this point zero five and
converted it into a nice whole number
for us now I want to point out a little
caveat here Java always has these little
nuances and caveats you need to be aware
of let's go ahead and make this 0.9999
now you would expect that to be rounded
up to 151 right wrong it actually will
round it down to 150 so keep that in
mind it always gets rounded down not up
and if you had close to 151 million
dollars you might be a little bit angry
right now if that got rounded down that
way but that's the way Java does it and
we should get 150 so that's the way that
works okay so let's put a little comment
here so we said this was a variable two
variable cast there we go let's do
another variable two variable cast
because I want to make another point
here so we'll take an int we will call
that I equals and we'll give this a
value of 125 and we're going to convert
this into a byte this time and we're
going to call that by B and remember
here is where we do the cast and this is
where we specify the object that we're
casting from so we're taking eyes value
of 125 its int value of 125 and
converting that into a byte and let's
also go ahead and
put our comments in here variable two
variable cast and let's go ahead and
print out B and let's run this okay and
you see we get 125 now you might be
asking well what did I do here well this
was this was an INT and it came out now
as a bike even though it's the same
number remember we don't change the
number this is just now a byte that
comes out of this now here's why I'm
actually doing this example I want to
point out to you that these datatypes
here have ranges of values so in in
strange and let's put that actually
let's go ahead and make another comment
here and in strange numeric range is
from I think it's like two negative two
billion I don't know if this is exactly
add but negative two billion to two
billion you get the idea here and a
flight range is much smaller so I think
it's minus 127 2 plus 127 something like
that so the point I'm trying to make
here is when you're doing a cast from
one data type to another you have to be
aware of these range of values and what
I mean by that is it's a lot harder to
take a larger range value and cast that
into a data type that has a much smaller
range it to be very careful so this
works because this 125 here is within
both of these ranges but what if we move
this to 1255 you'll notice we got a
really funky number here negative 25 now
what happened there was Java assumed
well you must know what you're doing so
I'm going to go ahead and try to
refactor this and work this thing out
and that's why you get that funky result
so that's why you have to be very
careful when you're going ahead and down
casting the preferred way to cast is
have the int below and the byte above
here now if we flip those it would have
worked out just fine but that's what you
so that's what you have to be aware of
when you're taking a larger range
datatype and casting that into a smaller
datatype you have to make sure they fit
or you're going to get them on
expected results and that is certainly
not the way you want to code okay so
let's go ahead and move along here now
we're going to work with objects and how
to move values from one object to a
variable and vice versa so we'll take an
object's value and put that into a
variable first so we're going to say
let's do our things this is an object
and let's go over here so we're going to
declare a new object here new integer
and let's give this a value of 400 now
let's define the variable that we're
going to dump this number into so let's
do a int we're just going to call this
destination now what I want to point out
here is we can't use this traditional
way that we used up here when we went
variable a variable we can't use this
parenthesis and specify the type objects
do not work that way you can't do that
one-to-one you actually have to use the
class's methods in order to do the
convert so we're going to take this
whole number that we defined up here
this object and we should get some
intellisense here now I have to find
this it's int value this is what we want
and so this is a method that we're
pulling from this guy to go ahead and do
this convert so you have to remember we
have to use methods we can't do this in
the traditional way and then we go ahead
and hit I've done something wrong here
Oh for the love of God we already used
destination up here okay so let's go
ahead and just call this des T there we
go that'll clear that up so let's go
ahead and run this and I expect to get a
value of 400 here and it'll be placed
into this variable so let's run this and
of course we forgot to change this down
here sorry all kinds of errors here all
right so let's go ahead and rerun this
and there we get 400 so that's how that
works now and let's put in some comments
here this is the variable now we're
going to flip this we're going to go
from a variable into an object so let's
go ahead and
this now I do want to point out one
thing here really quickly this method is
coming from the integer class here
remember this is a pre-canned class from
java so we're using this method from
this class to do this okay just to point
that out now as I said let's reverse
this let's do a string this time so
let's actually take the value from a
string and let's turn that into a
integer so we're going to go ahead and
call this string variable Val we're
going to say this is equal to and let's
give it a number and we'll do our
comment this is a variable because we're
doing the opposite thing here so let's
declare our int object and we'll just
say int object now again we have to use
a method to do this and we're going to
have to use the integers method to go
ahead and accomplish this conversion so
we're going to specify integer dot and I
need to look for this now I believe it
is parse int that's what we want you'll
notice how it was smart enough to take
the variable that we defined here and
plug it in here so let's go ahead and
run this
but first let's not make the same
mistake we did last time let's print out
int object and let's run this and we got
47 now I want to point out what happened
here this was a string it comes out on
this side as now a whole number an INT
of 47 now the other thing i want to
point out to you is this will only work
if this string has numerix in it this is
a numeric string look what happens if we
put in some characters in here and we
rerun this look we're going to do is
exceptions because obviously AC cannot
be converting a number so this type of
scenario again will only work if you
have numeric numbers in here okay I want
to make one final point here but okay I
want to make one final point here
between the difference between implicit
casting and
explicit casting now up to now we've
been doing explicit casting and I'll
show you what I mean by that right here
we said convert this to a byte and what
I mean by explicit is we can see that is
doing that we are explicitly saying I
want you to convert this to a byte and
it's obvious does this right there it's
right in front of us so think of it like
that it's just something you can see
that we're doing implicit casting is
where you remove the parentheses we'll
put some comments here this is explicit
cast and remember it's visual we can see
that we're doing it we actually typed
byte out and we know exactly what's
going on so just think of it like that
okay so let's go move down here and
we'll do a implicit cast and I'll show
you how that works so actually you know
what works let's fix this up here so
that works if you want to run that as an
example again so let's define an int
let's just say x equals 47 and let's do
a double now we'll do it actually some
arithmetic here so let's do y equals 3.5
and we'll do another double of X y
equals x plus y good there we go and we
go you have to get our system dot out
dot print and put XY here so let me
explain what's going on here you'll
notice I added an arithmetic operator
here so at the time these get added this
X here has to be converted to a decimal
so that is the implicit cast at the time
this gets executed this X will need to
be a decimal we didn't actually tell to
do that Java is just going ahead and
making that assumption for us so you
have to be very careful when you do
implicit casting and like I said another
easy way to think of this is we just
don't see it we didn't actually type out
where as an explicit cast as I mentioned
before we go ahead and type out exactly
what we're doing so let's go ahead and
run this and we got fifty point five
which I expected all righty then
I want to point out one thing before we
close this video you see this integer up
here when we were converting this object
into a variable the value all the basic
data types of Java have a corresponding
object so int the data type int has a
corresponding object in Java that you
can reference and that's what I was
doing here when I did this and it's the
same for character that has a
corresponding object as well and it's
the same for byte so you can just go
ahead and reference these as objects
because they're pre-canned objects that
Java supplies so again the each data
type has a corresponding object in Java
as well that you can use so that's what
I was doing here when I was using this
integer okay that's going to wrap it up
