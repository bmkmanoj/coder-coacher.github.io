layouts in this video we're going to add
some effects to the image sidebar that
we did in the last video so let's go
ahead and open up our web page now a lot
of websites are doing these little
tricks when you mouse over a particular
element and they'll add an effect to let
you know that something's changed since
you've moused over this and also it adds
a lot of pizzazz to your webpages so
let's go ahead and set that up so we'll
close out of our web page now we don't
have to touch our HTML in this video
we've already set up our element so we
don't need to touch the HTML in this
video we're simply dealing with our
style sheet so and so first let's add a
property here to the image sidebar rule
set and we'll add this right at the end
and I'll just copy and paste in here and
it is the opacity property and we're
going to set that to 1.0 the values are
between 0 and 1.0 now let's go ahead and
save this and we'll open up our web page
again and you're not going to see any
change here because 1.0 just represents
what the image looks like and so the
values are between 0 and 1 now if you
made it 0 the image would go completely
white and obviously we don't want that
so this is the first state if you'll
remember in the last CSS series we
talked about States so this is the first
state now we need to add a rule set for
the mouse over and we use of course over
and so let's go ahead and do that and we
can just put this right below our image
sidebar roll set and I just copy and
paste this in here
now what we're doing here is of course
we need our class and then we need to
add over to it and this is the mouse
over rule now make sure there's no space
between this semicolon and this H
otherwise it will not work so may just
make sure you don't put a space there
now what we're doing here is we're going
to set this value for the property to
0.4 and this will add whiteness to our
image and so the state will change so
we're going to go from this state right
here to this state when we mouse over
when we mouse over our image sidebar so
let's go ahead and save this let's
reopen our web page and there you can
see we've got that
cool effect now so now the user will
know when his mouse is over this element
now that's a little bit fast now some
people like that they like that fast
transition other web designers want to
slow that down and I will show you how
to slow that down right now so let's go
back to our stylesheet and we're going
to add another property and rule and
we're going to put that right below the
opacity property and it is the
transition property okay
and what we're saying here with this
transition property is that the
transition from 1 to 0.4 should take one
second and so it won't be an instant
flip so let's go ahead and save this and
let's go ahead and open this up and
there you can see we've got this nice
transition is not as abrupt now you may
want to speed that up a little bit so we
could put a half a second in here and
actually I prefer half a second so let's
go ahead and open up our web page and
you can see it's a little bit quicker
now so that's it for this video I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
