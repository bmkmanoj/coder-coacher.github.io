in taking our code that we had from our
CSS layout series and importing it into
visual studio so that was what we
accomplished in this video we're going
to start adding some of our very first
asp.net web pages because basically we
need to convert this now to an asp.net
website so we're going to add a master
page and a content page but I want to
say right away this is going to take
several videos to explain this concept
it's not a complex concept once you
understand it but I remember when I was
first trying to understand this and
learn this I wish I would have had these
videos actually because I probably would
have figured it out a little quicker but
basically it takes some time so we're
going to be exploring these concepts
over five to six videos so I don't want
you to feel that you have to understand
everything right away but once you
understand it you'll be like oh this
this really is pretty easy to understand
but like I said in the beginning it's a
little bit intimidating because we're
going to be adding these ASP files and
you're gonna be like what is all this
and how do all these parts work together
but it actually makes a lot of sense
Microsoft designed this very very well
and like I said I don't want you to feel
in this video that you have to
understand it all because we're just
going to add a few files here I'm going
to talk about a few concepts here and so
I just want you to sort of soak things
in that being said like I said in the
last video we just have an index.html
here but we eventually want this file to
be dot aspx because after all this is
going to be a asp.net website now the
first thing I want to do is actually
create a new folder so we'll right-click
on website and we'll add a folder
and this and we're just going to call
this archive and what I like to do with
this is sort of keep backups of our
critical files actually I didn't want to
open that so what we're going to do is
copy and paste the index.html into here
as well as the CSS file and like I said
this is just to keep backups in case we
need to retrieve old code and we can
just minimize this and if you take a
look out at our folder you'll see that a
new folder was created since we did that
in Visual Studio and we've got backups
of our files so we don't even need to
come to our folder visual studio does it
automatically for us pretty nice now the
first thing we're going to do is add our
master page and so we go to add we're
going to hit add new item we're going to
go down to where we find master page
wherever that is edits right here we're
just going to use the default name which
is master page master keep this place
code in separate file we'll talk about
that that's basically for the c-sharp
code but we'll talk about that in a
later video right now we don't need to
worry about that so just hit add and now
you can see we've got our master page
and like I said you're going to be very
confused and go what is all this we'll
talk about all this in the next several
videos so now we've got our master page
and now we need to add the default.aspx
page so let's go ahead and do that and
we're going to do the same thing we're
going to go to add add new item we're
going to hit webform now you'll see down
here it automatically creates this
default.aspx that's what we want now
this is the critical thing here we want
to select master page hit that you're
going to hit add and now we're going to
select the master page that we just
created and like I said don't worry this
will all start coming together it's very
confusing in the beginning but I will
explain everything as I always like to
do so we're going to hit OK and now
we've got our default.aspx page and our
master page master and that's all we're
really going to do in this video but I
do want to explain a few things just so
we can start talking about some of these
concepts now the master page you'll
notice has all the HTML you'll notice
that the default page just has some of
these ASP content tags that's because
this is the content page and the master
page is actually
all the HTML now the default dot aspx
page this is where this gets confusing
but just understand this for now this
will eventually be our front-end page
this is actually the page that gets
loaded now you might be going what what
is that what are you talking about this
has all the HTML
well the default dot aspx page pulls in
the master the master is just a template
it's not the actual page that gets
loaded and I'll show you why we flip
back to the default aspx you'll see
right at the top of the page this master
page file parameter and it has a path to
our master file our master page dot
master by the way this squiggly little
squiggly line here that just means root
so what that means is that this is just
in the root the all these files are in
the root and another point I'd like to
make is that when you go upload all
these files to a web server this is
exactly the layout you'll have you'll
have your entire folder structures as
well as all of these pages in the root
if that's where you choose to put them
so again the default dot aspx is the
page that actually gets loaded so
eventually when we fire up our website
in a few videos you're going to see
default.aspx and what happens is like I
said it's actually pulling its HTML
source from our master page template so
what we're going to do in the next video
actually is take all the code out of
this index.html and put it into our
master page that's one thing we're going
to do in the next video but for right
now I just wanted to point out that the
default aspx is the page that gets
loaded and he's pulling it from his
template which is right here and so
that's how that works now the default
dot aspx is the first content page and
again we're going to talk a lot more
about these tags but for now just know
that you can this is an actual HTML tag
and this identifies it as content this
is the first content page that gets
loaded now let's go take a look at the
website that we have currently
everything in this panel now will be our
content page these areas our navigation
bar our header and our sidebar are going
to be static so these are actually part
of the master page template and what's
nice about this and I'll talk about this
in later videos I hope I'm not saying
that too much but we don't have to
actually change this code this won't be
dynamic it's static
that's why all this code in the next
video will be placed in our master page
it's our main template the content pages
will all be in here so when we drill
down into here all the information for
this series that we're doing on Rome
will be contained within this content
panel now eventually this will say
default aspx and so this code that we
did for this little panel will actually
be placed within our content tags right
here because that's the first content
page that gets loaded now when we drill
down to that content panel we're
actually going to load another content
page it'll probably be called Rome dot
aspx or something different and we'll
put all the code within our content
because this is our entire content page
now our master page will contain all
those other areas we'll have the header
will have the nav and we'll have the
cyber those will actually contain all
the code for our static sections because
we don't want these areas to change it's
everything in this content panel that
will change now if you think about this
for a second what really happens here is
the master page and everything in our
content page get merged they come
together to form the overall page that
our user sees so it's really two pages
that end up as one our master page that
again has all of our static areas that
we don't want to change and our content
page which has all the content that is
dynamic so this section right here all
three of these sections get merged as
part of the master file along with our
content they get merged to form the
final page and we know that through this
right here here's our master page it
gets loaded it's so when our
default.aspx gets loaded it pulls it
from this master page that master and
then any Content that we have in here
that's been identified as content in our
main content panel gets merged into that
as well so that's what we're actually
going to do in the next video we're
going to take our index here and
actually split it apart we're going to
put those three static sections in here
and then our content that we want in
here as I said the next video we're
going to get rid of our index.html and
we're going to pull the HTML out of here
and put it into our master page master
as well as some content that we want to
initially load it and of course what do
we want
she loaded all the mini content panels
we want loaded first and actually later
on we'll put another one here these will
be all the many content panels that we
want to drill down into so this is a
good start just soak it in like I said
it will all start to come together oh by
the way when you go to save the project
you might get prompted to save this dot
SLN file just hit yes to this and we can
just save this in our website folder
that we're working on you don't need to
really worry about this for now just hit
save and that is that okay so again I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
