operators in JavaScript now I want to
point out that if you have experience in
programming some of these early videos
that I'm doing on the syntax of
JavaScript will look very very familiar
to you but I do want to point out there
are some subtle differences and I
pointed that out in the videos that I
did on variables there are slight
differences in terms of how you declare
JavaScript variables but overall some of
this will look very similar so just be
patient and I do recommend that you
still take these videos but again when
we start getting to the DOM and events
things will start looking very different
if you have no experience in JavaScript
but the syntax of the language is very
similar to C based languages so in terms
of operators we're going to start out
first with arithmetic and assignment
operators but first let's take a look at
the most basic of all operators the
assignment operator and we've seen this
many times in our previous videos we've
actually been using some of these
already
so first let's declare a variable like
we've done and I've just simply declared
a variable here called number one and it
will hold the value of seven now here's
the assignment operator the equal sign
and that is one of the most basic
operators that you'll see in JavaScript
in most programming languages and all
we're doing here is telling JavaScript
to assign everything on the right to
everything on the Left which happens to
be our variable in other words we are
saying assign the value of 7 to our
variable on the left and then that will
hold the value this variable number one
now let's create another variable here
and what we're doing here is we're not
manipulating this value we're just
assigning a straight value so we're not
doing any arithmetic or not doing any
subtraction or multiplication we're just
assigning a straight value so there's no
altering of the value so this is the
most basic way that you can assign a
value to a variable so now let's go
ahead and use an arithmetic operator and
you'll notice that we're going to use
the number one variable again and you'll
notice that there's no rule against
using that also in your value so what
we're saying here is add number one and
add number two
and that will give us of course 11 and
so let's go ahead and actually run this
so we'll just do a document that right
and we'll just print it out number one
and let's go ahead and save this and
then we'll run this from our web page
and we'll just run this in Chrome and
there you can see we got 11 so again we
are manipulating the value here on the
right by using the addition operator so
the addition gets done first on the
right and then the value is finally
assigned on the left when all the
calculations are done on the right now
there are three other basic arithmetic
operators and you will recognize these
there is subtraction there is
multiplication
and of course there is the division
operator so those are the three other
main arithmetic operators now there is
actually a shorter way to write this out
in JavaScript so let's actually comment
this out and we're going to use now
what's called a compound operator and
that is where you combine the equal sign
in the plus sign and I'll show you that
so here is the compound operator and
you'll notice they are right next to
each other and all we're saying here is
add number two to number one and then
that will be assigned to number one so
this is just a shorthand way to do that
to use a compound operator but it does
the same thing as this statement up here
the only difference is you have to write
out more in this statement this is a
shorter way to assign the value by using
the compound operator so let's save this
and then we'll run this and we should
get the same result and there you can
see we get 11 so again we are just
simply saying here first add number two
to number one and then assign that value
to number one so again it's just a
shorter way to write out this statement
and with the compound operator you can
also do compound operators with
subtraction multiplication and division
so that is compound operators now there
is another operator called the
incremental operator and that is where
you can increment the value up by one so
let's do that so all we do is type in
number one and then we type out plus
plus and that is the incremental
operator so what this will do is it
should increment the value of number one
by one after this statement has been run
so we should get twelve so let's go
ahead and save this and we will run this
and we get twelve now you can also
decrement this by one as well so if we
put a minus minus here and we'll save
this and let's go ahead and run this now
we should get I believe ten and we did
so that is the incremental and
decremental operators now there is one
more concept that I would like to talk
about before we end this video and that
is the concept of operator precedence
and it's important to understand that so
let's actually go ahead and copy and
paste over all of this and we're going
to create a variable another variable
called number one and what we're going
to do is we're going to add two
operators here the arithmetic and the
multiplication operator now when you
have multiple operators that is when you
want to understand how operator
precedence works and the deal here is
the multiplication and division
operators take precedence over the
addition and subtraction operators so if
you take a look at this you might be
inclined to and you actually be correct
in the real world
you've been climbed to add four plus
three and that gives you seven times
five would give you 35 that is what you
would expect to get but let's go ahead
and save this and then let's run this in
Chrome and you'll see we'll get a very
entirely different result here we get 19
and I'll show you why because the
multiplication operator takes precedence
so 3 times 5 equals 15 plus 4 gives you
what we just saw which was 19 that's how
operator precedence works now let's say
you want the 4 plus 3 to be executed
first there is actually a way to do that
and the way you do that is to put this
in parentheses so now the 4 plus 3 will
be executed first and then it will be
multiplied times 5 so let's save this
and we
35 and if we run this in Chrome you can
see now we get the expected result so
whatever you put in these parentheses
will now get executed first no matter
what type of operator you have in there
now there are other operators and we
will talk about those in future videos
but this is a good start and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
