going to look at methods again and
specifically we're going to do something
we haven't done before we're actually
going to go ahead and declare an object
inside a method that is not our main
method right up to now we've been kind
of declaring our objects all the way
down here and declaring them in the main
method right but you don't actually have
to do that you can declare them anywhere
you want and we're going to declare them
inside a method inside this class which
is not part of the main method and so
that brings me to another point in terms
of how you want your program to operate
one way to do it is the way we've kind
of been doing it all along we declare a
bunch of objects and it's kind of a
running list going down this way it's
everything's in our main the other way
is to actually declare your objects
outside of your main method and kind of
have your objects talking to your
objects in all your other classes and
then you just have one object in your
main method kick everything off or you
could have like a hybrid some objects
here and then you know objects outside
in other different classes so it's
really how you want to do it now I will
tell you that a lot of times let's say
you know you develop this class and you
want to test it really quick you can go
ahead and just drop a main in and test
and see if it works now that may not be
where your main ends up this may be part
of an overall hierarchy but you just
want to test it kind of on the fly so
you drop a main in and then you can go
ahead and test the class so I just want
to make those points so let's go ahead
and see what we've done here we're going
to go ahead and declare a new object
here and we're going to have the
constructor go ahead and build that and
so the first method we're going to call
is this no return method called call it
and here's what we're actually going to
do we're going to declare a new object
here called new obj and keep in mind now
we have this object it exists only with
inside this method right that's its life
it doesn't do anything outside of it so
within these brackets that's where this
object exists so we're going to go ahead
and declare that and the whole purpose
of this object is to call this do-it
method down here and pass these two
values to the do-it method so this value
13 here will land in this spot right
here this local variable
and this 114 will land in this spot
right here at this local variable and so
of course that's the ordering sequence
right this one matches this one and this
one matches this one and so on depending
on how many different values we want to
put in here and so then it'll come down
here and these local variables here will
be multiplied times each other and then
we will print this out so let's go ahead
and call that over here and we've
already got our object created so we
will just go ahead and VOC that method
call it and let's go ahead and run this
and we got the number 182 and that is
what we expected now again this was the
literal value that we passed here now as
I've talked about in previous videos you
can pass these by reference and so
basically what I did was I took these
two methods and copy and pasted them
down here and if you take a look at this
we're actually let's close out this here
we're actually going to be passing the
same value here the only difference I
did in that and this one right here was
I created the variables but we assigned
the same values you see that 13 and 14
and 13 and 14 and the point I'm trying
to make here is that when you pass by
reference so we're actually taking this
variable and putting it here the
variable name we're putting here instead
of the actual value but that doesn't
matter these actual values here are what
get passed not the name so that's what
we call reference by value even though
we put it in the variable name here it's
actually the value that gets passed so
theoretically right we should get the
same result for both of these methods
and let's go ahead and invoke this
method from over here and we will see
what happens so we'll do test tree call
it again and let's go ahead and run this
and there you can see we got the same
result so the same exact thing happened
the name was not passed these values
were passed and this method do it again
does the exact same thing that this
method up here does and remember we can
go ahead and use this variable multiply
which we defined in here and we can also
call the same name up here because they
are local to this method so they don't
see each other right they are not out
inside the class and that's why we go
ahead
use the same name again in these methods
now if we put them outside in the class
and we'd have a conflict okay that's
going to do it for this tutorial I hope
you found this helpful and I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
