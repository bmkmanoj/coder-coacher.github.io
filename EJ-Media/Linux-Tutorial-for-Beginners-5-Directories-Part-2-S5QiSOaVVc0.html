hierarchy structure in Linux and of
course we talked about the root
directory which is right here which is
identified by this forward slash and
then we talked about all the directories
underneath it that hang off of it which
is represented right here and of course
we are in the home directory so let's go
ahead and actually list out the root
directory so remember the list command
is always LS and then we type in a
forward slash for root now this is a
common mistake a lot of people starting
out in Linux make they want to actually
type out root but remember you don't
have to root is identified simply by the
forward slash that is the first
directory and Linux so if we go ahead
and hit enter you can see we've got all
the directories that hang right off of
the root directory and you can see that
in this diagram right here now as I
talked about we are always by default in
the home directory and so let's go ahead
and list out the home directory and
since we're already in the home
directory we don't need to specify
anything here we don't need any
additional arguments we just type in LS
and there you can see we've got all the
directories and files inside of our home
directory and here is the test directory
that we created in the last video and we
did that with the make dir command now
what if you wanted to remove a directory
well you type in RM dir and that is the
remove directory command and then you
type in test and look at that it didn't
work the reason is is because the
directory is not empty now in Linux you
cannot delete a directory that has
content in it so let's go ahead and
change directory to test and then let's
list everything out and you'll remember
we created this test again directory so
that has to be deleted first so all we
have to do is type in RM dir and then
test again and now the test again
directory is removed and if we type in
LS now so now we can go ahead and remove
the test directory now one thing I want
to tell you is if you put in the CD
command with no arguments and you hit
enter that will actually send you back
to your home directory so no matter
where you are that will always send you
back to your home directory and now
let's go ahead and remove the test
directory and now it lets us remove the
test directory because it is empty now
let's go ahead and create some
directories so we're gonna go ahead and
actually recreate our
test directors so let's go ahead and use
the make der command and then let's
switch to that directory and we're
actually gonna create four directories
here so let's go ahead and make another
directory called test to good and then
let's go ahead and switch to that and
then let's go ahead and make another
directory called test three and let's go
ahead and switch to that now there is a
faster way to do this and we'll talk
about this in later lectures but for now
we're just going to create these test
directories and now we're in our test3
directory and let's go ahead and create
a fourth directory and let's go ahead
and switch to that there now we're done
sorry about all that work so what did we
do here well let's take a look at this
diagram right here now here is how this
works basically this test for directory
is at the lowest level so basically
let's say we went all the way back up to
the root directory that means we're
going up in the hierarchy so let's say
we switched from the test for to the
test3 directory the test3 directory is
considered an upper level directory it's
up one level in comparison to the test
for and if we went to the test two
directory that's one level higher than
the test3
so again if we're moving up in the
hierarchy we're going this way if we're
moving down in the hierarchy we're going
this way that's all that means
okay so let's go ahead and type in CD
now remember this takes us all the way
back to our home directory that's a
quick way to get back and that's
actually what we're gonna focus on in
this lecture is how to navigate around
very quickly so that would take us back
to the home now let's go ahead and type
in PWD now remember that will give us
our absolute path so we're in slash home
slash Ernie so let's say we wanted to
get to the test for so we would type in
CD slash home slash Ernie slash test
slash intestine 2/10 3/10 for and that
takes us back to the test for directory
so again we're moving down right we
moved down from the home directory and
now we're in the test for directory now
let's say you wanted to switch to the
test 3 well we can type that all out
again and remember this is the absolute
path so we'll type in home ernie test
test
to test three and we hit enter and now
we're in the test3 directory now what if
you wanted to go right back to the test
for directory and you didn't want to
type out that entire path well all you
do is type in CD space - and take a look
at that it takes us right back to the
test for directory if we wanted to go
back to the test3 directory we would
just hit CD - again and so on and so on
so let's go back to the test for
directory now what if you wanted to get
to the test - directory and you didn't
want to have to type out the full path
well there's a quick way to do that and
remember anytime you want to change
directories you need to type in CD now
the shortcut so you don't have to
actually type out the directory name is
period period and then slash now the
period period in this case moves you up
one directory and as you know we need a
directory separator so let's actually go
ahead and do that first and you can see
it moved us up one directory to the
test3 now let's go ahead and switch back
to the test for directory now what if we
wanted to move up two directories well
we can do that and we just type in CD
and then of course we need dot dot and
then slash now that will move us up to
the test3 but we need to go up even one
more directory so we need to do dot dot
slash so we basically repeat the process
and so you can see how this is a lot
faster than typing out name and perhaps
these names are very long names and you
just don't want to type all these out so
let's go ahead and hit enter and take a
look at that it moved us all the way up
to the test
two directory so that's what the dot dot
is it's an easier way to move around now
think about this the dot dot allows you
to move up so that's just what we did we
moved up two directories right we went
from the test four to the test
two now if we went from the test two to
the test for that would be considered
moving down directories but again a dot
dot slash will move you up one directory
and you can add as many as you want so
let's actually go ahead and flip back to
the test for directory and remember to
do that again we hit CD space - and now
let's actually go ahead and move up
three directories so we need three sets
of that dot dot slash and this should
put us in the test directory right we're
moving up to the test directory try to
remember that you're moving up or you're
moving down which way are you moving in
the hierarchy so let's go ahead and hit
enter and you can see now we're in the
test
director so that's how you can quickly
navigate around in Linux now one final
point I want to make is you cannot use
these dots to move down in directories
they are only for moving back up so just
keep that in mind the dot dot separator
moves you up not down so if you wanted
to go back to the test for directory you
would have to type the path out okay
that's gonna do it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
