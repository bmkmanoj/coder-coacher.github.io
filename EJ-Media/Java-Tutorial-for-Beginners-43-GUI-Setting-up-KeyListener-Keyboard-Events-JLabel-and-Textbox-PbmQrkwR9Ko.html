beginning Java now in the last video
we've been dealing with listeners and
interfaces and at the end of this series
we'll actually be doing a 2-d mini game
and we're going to be using listeners
when we design that game so this is a
good introduction to listeners now if
you're following along you'll want to
import these three libraries right here
and again we're going to create a class
called GUI we're going to extend off
jframe and that will create our window
and in this video we're going to
implement the key listener so we're
going to be able to respond to
keystrokes
now the key listener has three methods
that we're going to use and remember
when we take those methods from the
interface which is what this key
listener is is the key listener
interface we must use its methods and
there are three of them there is key
typed key pressed and there is the key
released method now we are going to be
using the key pressed method in this
video so one thing I wanted to point out
that is if you don't use a method from
an interface you should put a comment in
there that you're not going to be using
that method so that you remember later
on when you come back to it that you
didn't use it and so let's go ahead and
put a comment in the key type of method
because we're not going to be using that
as well so again so again here's the key
listener interface and now we're going
to be using two new components from Java
swing and these are components so in the
last video we dealt with the J button
and this one we're going to be using a
text box which is called J text field
and we're going to be using the J label
so we're going to be using these two
components from the java swing library
now this text box will allow us to type
in text and we'll be able to respond to
that now in the constructor we're going
to make it 80 characters long and when
we fire up our J label we want to
actually have some text already there
and it's going to say press the fire
button so we're just going to simulate a
little bit of a game here it's not going
to actually be a game but we're going to
actually say hey press the fire button
and we're going to expect the user to go
ahead and do that and when they do that
we want to respond to that and we want
to respond to what they type in the text
box so that's why we have here key text
and we're adding the listener
to our text box right up here so we want
to respond to that input and then when
the user type something in there we will
respond to it with the key pressed
method and of course here are the
methods that we use for our jframe
window of course we're going to set the
size same thing we've been doing for the
last several videos so these are all the
same now I'm going to introduce briefly
the concept of layout managers and what
layout managers do is they allow you to
put your components where you want them
within the screen and it allows you to
do it rather easily so if we look here
there's several parameters let's
actually get rid of this and you can see
we have several different parameters so
we could put it east we could put it
Center with it but at north and we want
it north so again it allows you to place
your components in an area of the screen
that you want it in a very very easy
manner now if we didn't use these layout
managers we'd actually have to do a
little bit more Kody and we don't want
to do that so this makes it much easier
to use and it will actually keep things
aligned in a very nice manner we don't
have to add all this unnecessary extra
code that we would have to if we didn't
use layout managers so again this means
our label will be at the top and you'll
see that in a minute and our textbox
will be right in the center of the
screen so our text box right here our
label right here and this is where we're
going to put our components we're using
the layout manager to tell Java where we
want our components okay let's move on
so now we need to fill out the method
that we're going to be using as I said
we're going to be using the key pressed
method so we need to start putting it in
code for that and again we want to
respond to input against our object that
we created up here our textbox object
and here of course is our jlabel
object okay so let's go ahead and do
that and actually I think what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to copy and
paste the code that I created here and
we'll go through it now every key on
your keyboard has a key code and so when
you press a key an actual key code is
sent that's the event a key code gets
sent and this get key code method here
will get the key code from whatever the
user types in the textbox right up here
so the listener will get triggered and
this will get the key code for the
button on the keyboard that's actually
been pressed and these are the actual
key codes right here and in this case
we're going to respond to the
button which is of course for the fire
button and if we take a look here and we
hit dot you can see let's actually go
back space here hit dot you can see we
can map to all these different
keystrokes right all these different
buttons on the keyboard but in this case
we want the F button for fire and when
we do our a 2d minigame will actually be
mapping many different keystrokes but in
this case we're just going to use the F
button now what we're doing here is
we're going to set up some conditions
and what we're going to do is say hey
that key code that came in from our
textbox if that equals F do the
following and I'll talk about do the
following in a second this will be our
do the following so we're going to say
and this is an event actually so key
code an event actually usually go hand
in hand and we're saying hey if it
equals that the event that came in from
here remember it's an event that came in
from here if it equals what they use or
press which should be an F we're going
to say hey update the label now now the
label originally was pressed fire button
that should change to you pressed
actually let's say you pressed the fire
key or the fire button let's just say
that actually that's not that's better
okay you press the fire button and
actually now when we get to our 2d game
these will actually be bullets but in
this case we're just going to send a
message to the user and so we're going
to update the label and that's the nice
thing about the label component you can
continuously update that so if you're
going to keep track of the highest
scores in a game this would be one thing
you could use you could use this key
label components now we also want to set
up an else condition that is what if the
user doesn't press the right button they
don't press the fire button then we want
to update the key label to say hey you
press the wrong key we probably should
have something here that says press the
fire button but let's assume they'll
eventually realize that rather shortly
and I think you guys saw the rest of
this code right down here so let's go
ahead now and fire this thing up now if
you don't see the textbox here blinking
where you can type in text go ahead and
press down into the this was actually be
a focus issue so you need to press with
inside the window and then you should
see this flashing right here and let's
go ahead and type in a key and you'll
notice it says we pressed the fire
button because we hit the F now I want
you to hit another button and it says
you press the wrong key because I press
the G
hit the F button and you can see how
this works now right as long as we hit
the F button it'll say hey you press the
fire button but if we hit any other
button this else condition will get
tripped and it'll say hey you press the
wrong key so that is how the key
listener works and also that is how the
label and text box work for Java swing
okay I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
