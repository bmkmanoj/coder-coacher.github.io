we would examine the major components
that make up Linux and they divide this
into three major layers or levels
whatever you want to call them so that's
what we're gonna examine in this video
those three layers now at the top layer
is the user space the middle layer is
the kernel and at the bottom is your
computer the physical hardware so those
are the three main layers as you can see
here the kernel sits between the user
space and the physical hardware and he's
the one that's doing all the
communications back and forth to the
hardware as well as a user so the user
issues the command the kernel will take
that and execute it accordingly so as I
mentioned at the top layer is the user
space and the two main components of the
user space is the GUI and the shell and
this is actually where we're gonna spend
a lot of our time we're gonna spend a
majority of our time in this level and
that's because this is where you will
issue your commands from and
specifically you use the shell and
that's actually what we're gonna talk
about in the next video
the shell is essentially a program that
allows you to type in commands into a
console and that's actually the terminal
window and so you can essentially
execute these commands so the shell is
effectively the interface between you is
the user and the kernel so again it's
absolutely one of the most fundamental
aspects to Linux it's the way you can
interact with the kernel and the system
and in many respects it's very similar
to the command prompt in Microsoft where
you have a command line and you can
start issuing commands and how do we do
that we do that through a terminal and
again we're gonna get going with the
command line and the shell in the next
video now as I mentioned sitting right
in the middle is the kernel and as I
mentioned in the last video this is what
Linux distributes there are two main
functions of the kernel the big one is
it manages processes that's really the
most important thing the kernel does
what are processes well a process is
just an instance of a computer program
that is being executed and if you think
about it a computer software program by
itself does nothing it needs to run as a
process before it can actually do
anything so that's essentially what a
process is and the main responsibility
of the kernel is to manage the process
that are executed on the cpu now the
device drivers are also maintained on
the kernel and of course you probably
know what hardware drivers are they
basically act as an interface to your
computer hardware so again the kernel
will manage all the device drivers for
your system now the kernel also manages
all the memory that needs to be
allocated for the processes and of
course that means the RAM so it will
keep track of all the memory that is
being allocated to all the processes
that are running on your Linux system so
that's another thing the kernel does it
also manages system calls and we'll talk
about that in later videos now the
bottom layer is your actual hardware
whatever computer you're running and the
two main components here are your CPU
and RAM as well as your physical devices
these could be optical drives all sorts
of peripherals that you're plugging into
your computer and this is actually where
a process runs it will actually run in
your main memory or your RAM and again
it's the kernel who keeps track of all
of the processes running on Linux okay I
think that's a good start and I really
thought this video would be very
critical so you have an understanding
how Linux is constructed and these three
main layers are very important to
understand before we go forward ok see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
