this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to remove a traced object from a
background and in this digital photo
what we want to do is get this rose out
of this background I will also show you
how to keep the pattern of this if you
want to use it for future reference or
future drawings that you're going to do
so the tool you want to select is the
Bezier tool right here and you don't
have to be too exact early on you want
to select the points that go out and
select the points that go in and then we
can use the edit pass by node tool to go
ahead and move them in and out and
sculpt it closer to the object so we'll
select this right here first because
this pour throughs out will go right
here to this area because it pour
throughs in and you can just do this
rather quickly again you don't need
accuracy early on
keep in mind too and I'll show you this
you can always add nodes later on if you
need them okay
now let's use the zoom tool here and
zoom in so you can get greater accuracy
and then select the Edit path by nodes
tool and you can just drag this out and
you can see it fits it pretty good
now again I'm not going to have time to
do this as accurate as I would want
otherwise I'll bore you guys to death so
let's just keep moving along here but
you get the general idea now in this
case you'll notice we got some extra
space here so here you can double click
add a node and then you can get a little
bit more accurate here and you can use
this handle here to move this part out
and you can see here now if we want to
capture this we can add another node
here and then add another one here and
we can make this a little bit more
accurate
and I'm just going to cruise along here
like I said I would do this a little bit
more carefully if I was going to keep
this
you
okay that's pretty good so let's zoom
out here and now what we want to do is
select what we've traced here
right-click do a copy and if you paste
over here you'll see now that we have
the pattern so you can use this to start
filling in with colors if you want and
you can save this pattern for future use
if you want now to give what we traced
over here out of this background you go
ahead and reselect this and then hold
the shift button down and select the
background and then go up to object go
to clip hit set and there you can see we
have that removed from our background
now so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial I hope you found this useful
and if you did please check out my other
escape tutorials
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
