today we're going to be talking about
conditionals and there are three types
of conditionals that we'll be dealing
with now in this tutorial we're just
going to be dealing with the most common
conditional the if statement so a little
bit little bit of background on writing
computer programs your computer program
could have hundreds of lines of code
there are going to be many times when
you do not want to step through every
line of that code it just doesn't make
sense
you would create a lot of unnecessary
overhead you will need to be selective
about what code gets executed and in
order to achieve that you can use
conditionals so in terms of the program
you want to think about if statements
you're giving the computer a decision to
make and it could be a or B that's just
a simple way to look at it so if it's a
it will execute this block of code if
it's B then it will move to that block
of code and execute that so that's
really just a simple way to think of
that it's just a decision that your
computer is making alrighty then so
let's create a if statement we're going
to first though create a very variable
called touchdown and we're going to say
that's equal to six and then we're going
to create the if statement you guessed
it you just type in if and open
parenthesis this is where all the action
takes place this is where the condition
goes and a condition an easy way to
think of a condition it's just a test
we're testing to see if this is true so
we're going to type in touchdown the
variable and we're going to use an
operand here and equals equals now the
equals equals operand is not saying that
touchdown is equal to six it's just
testing to see whether it's equal to six
and if it is equal to six then we will
go ahead and do something if it's not
equal to six then we will do something
else so again it's that decision-making
process that I was talking about earlier
so keeping that in mind we need to add
another statement if a touchdown and
score
so we're going to add a squiggly bracket
and we're going to do a system dot out
dot print if the condition is true and
we'll say a touchdown was scored so this
so if it equals six we will go ahead and
do a system out print a touchdown with
scored so now let's add a condition if
the statement is not true and we
accomplish that by adding the else
statement the if and the else statement
work together if the condition is true
we will go ahead and print this out if
it is not true the program will move to
the else statement we do that by typing
in else we will need another open
squiggly bracket and hit enter we get a
closed squiggly bracket now we're going
to print out to another system dot out
print for the else statement and we're
going to say here a touchdown was not
scored and we're getting some
intellisense here else without if so
that's telling us they need to be
attached and why are they not attached
because we have to get rid of the
semicolon see how nitpicky code is okay
so now again all the intellisense
warnings are gone and we can go ahead
and run this now
so let's do that so again we're this
should match the condition of six so we
should get we should hit this first
statement here and it did it says a
touchdown was scored now let's change
this value to three so a field goal was
kicked instead so now it does not match
six so let's go ahead and run this and
you'll see a touchdown was not scored so
it did not match the true condition so
it hit moved to the else and printed out
a touchdown was not scored so that's
pretty much it for if statements oh one
more thing let's go back to this if
statement and the condition here and
let's discuss the operands again again
the equals equals test whether this is
exactly equal this variable is exactly
equal to 6 so the equals equals is
saying is this exactly equal to what
this variable was assigned to here the
value that was assigned but we can also
test to see if it's not equal to that
and we do that by typing in an
exclamation point equals and that will
basically say is this not equal you also
have your greater and less than sign so
if we put in a less than sign we're
saying here is 6 less than 3 and we can
switch that and say greater than is and
then in this case we're saying is 6
greater than 3 you can also add equals
to the greater or less than sign so we
could add in equals here and what we're
saying here now is 6 greater than or
equal to 3 and we and we can flip that
and we're now saying is 6 less than or
equal to 3 so that's how that works all
righty so that will wrap up this
tutorial and I will see you guys in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
