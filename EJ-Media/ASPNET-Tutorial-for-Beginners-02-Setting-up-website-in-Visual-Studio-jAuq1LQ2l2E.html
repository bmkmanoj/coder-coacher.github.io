project for our asp.net website and
we're going to use the code that we
worked on from CSS layout episode 18 now
if you haven't watched that video yet
and you need the source you can go to
that video it's in the CSS layout series
and I've created some links where you
can get the source for the HTML and for
the CSS so you can go ahead and download
those and then we will be using this
source for our asp.net website now for
the Rome picture you can get this off of
Google if you just go to google and type
in ancient Rome you'll see it about
halfway down but you can use any image
that you want so again this is the code
that we're going to use from that series
now the first thing we're going to do is
create a folder that will contain all of
our website files so we're going to call
that website appropriately enough and
I'll just leave that on my desktop but
you can put it in any path that you want
now what I want you to do is open up
visual studio and you should have
installed this so you should have visual
studio community we're going to close
out the start page we don't need that
we're going to go to file we're going to
go to new and we're going to select
website now there's a couple things we
need to do here I want you to select
visual c-sharp I want you to select
asp.net empty website because we're
going to create our own files for this
website now some of these other
templates here will actually give you a
website that basically is almost a
complete website but we want to start
out from scratch because we're here to
learn things so we're going to start out
with an asp.net empty website in this
drop-down select dotnet framework 4.5
point 1 now it doesn't matter what
version you use if you have 5.0 or 4.5
or 4 because the concepts that we're
going to be exploring in this series are
very similar to all the framework
versions but we're going to go ahead and
select 4.51
and down here we're going to go ahead
and browse the folder that we just
create so we're not going to use this
default one that they create we're going
to actually use the one that we just
created and if I go up to desktop
I want to deselect this we're going to
select the website folder that we
created so let's hit open and there you
can see now we have it selected and so
now when I hit OK here our new project
will be created and you'll see it in a
second so I hit OK
you can see Microsoft is creating the
project now on the right here is
solution Explorer this is basically like
Windows Explorer this contains our
entire website so all the files that we
use in this series will now be on this
right-hand side will it'll be right in
here and as you can see we didn't get a
lot we got a web config file we'll talk
about that much later on but we didn't
get any other files we don't have a CSS
file here we don't even have an HTML
file because we didn't want that now
what we're going to do is start adding
some files and creating some folders now
the first thing we want to do is create
a central repository for all of our
images that we're going to be using so I
want you to right-click on website this
node right here and you're going to go
to add and then we're going to add a new
folder and we're going to call that
folder appropriately enough images so
this will contain all the images for our
website now we could just drop images in
here if we wanted to but this area would
become very cluttered so it's good to
use folders for our images so let's go
ahead and minimize this now and now what
I want you to do is take the code that
we use from CSS layout episode 18 and
we're going to drop all of this into our
website folder that we're using for
visual studio by the way you can see
here a couple files that the visual
studio created for our website and so
those are the two default files that get
put into our project folder now we're
going to drag the image into our images
folder and then we're going to go ahead
and drag in our HTML and our CSS files
now what I want you to do is right-click
on our HTML file and we're going to
rename that to index and I'll explain
that later but basically the standard
that you will use for the front-end page
on your website is either going to be
index or default and we'll talk about
that in future videos but for now we'll
rename it index so this is good we've
got all of our files here so let's keep
this open and then let's open up visual
studio again and you'll notice that
those files don't show up here that's
because we still need to add them
because we didn't add them in visual
studio visual studio yet doesn't
recognize that they're there now we can
do this a couple different ways one is
you can go ahead and right-click on the
website node and then you can go to add
and you can add all
kinds of different things here you can
add a new item if we hit this add new
item you'll see here that we could add
our HTML page if we wanted and all this
stuff but the easier way to do it is
actually just to click and drag them in
and I'll show you how to do that so
let's just go ahead and resize our
visual studio window here and now what
we're going to do is just drag our files
into our solution Explorer and so let's
go ahead and drag our image into images
and there you can see solution Explorer
is now aware of our image and then let's
go ahead and drag our index in our
stylesheet into our website and you want
to place it in the website not down here
anything place it right over the website
node and there you can see now we've got
our index.html which is the first page
of our website and we've got our
stylesheet that we've been using in the
CSS layout series so let's close this
out let's maximize our visual studio
again and this is working pretty good
here we've got our website that we were
working on in the CSS layout series and
now it's ported to visual studio now if
we right click on website we can go
ahead and view this in the browser and
you can pick whatever browser you want
but we're going to use Google Chrome
here so if we select that you'll see
that it looks exactly similar to the
website that we designed in the CSS
layout series and you can see that it
looks exactly the same but oh the image
isn't displaying and the reason is that
you will remember in the CSS layout
tutorial we had the image in the root
folder but now we've created another
level we created an images folder and of
course we didn't have that in the CSS
layout series so we need to edit our
index.html so let's browse down here and
we'll find the path and there you can
see right this is pointing to a root
level image and of course that's not in
the root directory anymore it's in the
images folder so so start typing images
right here and you'll see how nice this
is visual studio recognizes that we had
an images folder so you can just select
that and then it pulls up the contents
of that folder of course we want Rome
PNG see how easy that is we barely had
to type anything out and now we've got
the right location and now we need to
change this actually to index dot HTML
and see how it pulls it up for us and
now everything is synced up so let's go
ahead and hit save all and now actually
we can fire our website from this button
right here
so if we just hit play this will fire up
our website in Google Chrome so if we do
that you can see now that the image is
displayed now this actually fires up the
whole project so it's in this debug mode
so you want to do is go up here and hit
stop debugging we'll talk about this
later on for now though we're in good
shape we've got our project set up in
the next video we're going to talk about
master and content pages see you guys
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
