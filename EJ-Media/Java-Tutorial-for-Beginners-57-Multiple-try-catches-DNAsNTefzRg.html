setting up multiple try caches we're
also going to introduce another type of
exception that we're going to capture
and we're also going to talk about a
generic exception handler so several
topics to cover now you can see here was
the original code from the last lecture
that we worked on we had our try and our
catch and of course we had this array
and we tried to print out an element
that was not in this array now you can
see right down here below the catch I've
set up some new code and what we're
gonna do in this lecture is create an
arithmetic exception and that is another
very common exception that you can get
in both Java and c-sharp now a really
good way to quickly create an arithmetic
exception is to divide by 0 so you can
see that's what I've done here I create
this variable and we're dividing by 0
and that should throw an exception so
let's go ahead and run this so that we
can ensure that the exception actually
is created so let's go ahead and run
this and there you can see we got our
arithmetic exception and we tried to
divide by 0 and it did not work and of
course we also caught our first out of
bounds exception up here and that's
still working so that's all good so what
we're gonna do is create another try
catch block to work against this code so
let's go ahead and create our try and of
course right after the try we need the
catch and actually you know what might
just be easier to go ahead and copy and
paste this up here so let's go ahead and
just do that so we'll just copy and
paste here and of course we want this to
be an arithmetic exception has occurred
so let's just put an arithmetic
exception has occurred and so you
probably guessed it the class that we
want to specify here is arithmetic
exception and I misspelled it
we don't need an eye right here there we
go so let's go ahead and run this and if
everything works we should catch this
exception and we'll print out a more
readable message so let's go ahead and
run this and the exception was caught
and we printed out this more readable
message so let's go ahead and close this
out now there is also a generic type of
exception bucket that you can use
and that is just exception so if you
weren't sure exactly what type of
exception your code might generate you
can go ahead and just use that so let's
go ahead and get rid of the arithmetic
here and even though we're gonna
generate an arithmetic exception again
we probably should get rid of this and
make this more of a generic exception
message so let's go ahead and rerun this
and make sure it still works and it did
so that's another type of exception
class that you can specify in your
argument okay so let's go ahead and
close this out now you might be asking
the question why didn't you just insert
this code up in the try and then just
put another catch block down here well
you can do that but there actually is a
difference in terms of the execution of
the program and we'll talk about that in
the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
