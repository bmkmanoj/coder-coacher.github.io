to make your element draggable using the
jQuery UI and this is something that's
becoming more and more popular with
websites more and more websites are
becoming a lot more interactive they're
allowing their users to drag elements
sort elements to all sorts of things and
a lot of websites use jQuery to do that
because jQuery makes it very very easy
so let's go ahead and do that and what
we're gonna do is make an image
draggable actually so I'm gonna open up
my website folder here and you can see
I'm going to bring back gold Julius
Caesar and we used him what several
videos ago but we're gonna use him again
now so use whatever image you have if
you have the same image that's fine so
go ahead and copy that to your website
folder as always and first thing we want
to do is let's go ahead and load up the
web page first and actually you know
what let's expand this out there we go
and let's go ahead and load up the web
page and what we want to do is place our
image inside of our main div right here
so we're gonna put the image right here
so let's go ahead and do that and let's
scroll down here and here of course is
our main div and you know what we're
gonna go ahead and just copy this and
we're gonna nest this div that were new
div that we're creating right inside our
main div there we go
and this will hold our image and what
we're gonna do is actually create an ID
here and let's call this draggable very
original right and now we just need to
create the IMG element I know this one
by heart so I've used that Caesar image
so many times now so let's go ahead and
make sure it displays before we do
anything and there it is and you know
what let's actually add a little margin
to this and a border just to make this
look a little bit better so let's go
ahead and do that really quickly here go
over to our stylesheet and let's just
copy and paste this here and we only
need two properties so we'll just get
rid of the rest of these and we're gonna
use the type selector IMG for the image
and let's go ahead and give this a
margin
of ten pixels there we go and we need
the border property now and let's give
that a black border so solid two pixels
Wow
there we go all right so let's save
everything up and let's just see how
this looks really quickly and that looks
a little bit more presentable good now
what we want to do is go ahead and make
our image now draggable and we're gonna
go ahead and grab our ID that we created
here which of course was draggable so we
need of course a hashtag and we just
specify draggable there we go now what
we need to do is call the method
draggable the jQuery method and it's
really that simple so let's go ahead and
load our web page and this should all
work and it does and this is really one
of the great things about jQuery you get
all of this functionality in just a few
lines of code so look at that we can now
make elements draggable and you can do
this with anything by the way you could
do this with text if you wanted you
could do this with any type of HTML
element that you want I think the most
common usage is with images but you can
also do this with many other different
things now in the next video we're gonna
learn how to make multiple images
draggable and we're gonna look at
options with the draggable method as
well see you guys that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
