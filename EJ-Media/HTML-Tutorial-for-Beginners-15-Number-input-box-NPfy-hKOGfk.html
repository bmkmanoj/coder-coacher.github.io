number input box so once again we are
using the input element but this time we
are setting the type to number and that
will give us a number input box so let's
go ahead and hit refresh here and there
you can see we've got our number input
box
now what this web control does is it
only allows the user to input numbers so
no characters or anything like that you
can only use numbers so we can enter a
very very large number in here if we
want then you'll also notice that this
number input box has an up and down
arrow so we can adjust it accordingly
now what if you want to specify a range
in terms of numbers that is you will
only allow a certain range between a
minimum number and a maximum number that
can be inputted into this field and
that's where the minimum and maximum
attributes come into play so we'll go
back over here to our HTML and I'll just
copy and paste this in here so again
we're using the minimum attribute and
the maximum attribute and we're going to
set this to zero and we're going to set
this to 20 well let's bump that up a
little bit let's set that to 50 so the
only number is now that the user can
enter our a number between zero and
fifty that's all that will be allowed so
let's save here now you'll notice when I
hit refresh this box will get much
smaller because we're only allowing up
to 50 to be entered so I'll hit refresh
in there you can see we have a much
smaller box and if we start using our up
arrow here you'll see that we're going
and we're going and we're going and if
we get to 50 it stops we can't put in
anything else okay so that's the number
input box I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
