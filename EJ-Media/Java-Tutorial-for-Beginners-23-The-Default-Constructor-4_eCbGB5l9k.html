subscribers asking about the default
constructor and wanting me to expand
upon that so we can do that now and take
care of it in this video so let's go
ahead and write up our program here
really quick we're going to first do a
int variable we're going to assign this
a value of 10 and then we're going to do
another int Y and we're going to assign
this a value of e to leaven and then
we're going to go down here and then
we'll type in a shortcut to get our main
method and all you have to do for that
is PS VM and then hit tab and boom we've
got our main method so we're going to
come down here and create our object and
I'll explain this in a minute and we're
just going to call this test we'll use
the new keyword and here is where we
will call our constructor and I will
explain this in a minute semicolon and
then we can do a system dot out dot
print now a shortcut for that is s out
hit tab there you go and we're going to
print out this variable X great so here
we go take a deep breath guys so this is
the default constructor right here now
when we came in here we had to tell the
class that we were going to base our
object off of which was new empty and of
course this is the class we're basing it
off of so we write in new empty right
here this is going to be the name of our
object which is test now at this point
nothing has happened yet
okay nothing has happened in order to
get a main going you must create a new
object if you don't do that you've got
nothing so we put the new keyword here
and once you use this new keyword this
default constructor gets invoked and
what does the default constructor do he
has one purpose and one purpose only in
his life and that is to create a new
instance or a new copy of this class and
the name of it will be called test that
is our object so again nothing can
happen without this new keyword think of
it like that we're saying hey I want a
new copy of the class new empty created
and
constructor and that's what that name
means by the way I will construct a new
instance of this class for you now what
do I mean nothing can happen well let's
go ahead and comment this out whoops
this isn't going to work now right we
can't do anything because our object is
not even going to be created so we have
to uncomment this out and then we're
good to go
so again this has to happen right here
before anything else can happen so let's
go ahead and run this and find we got
ten we didn't use why that's fine that
can just sit there by its lonesome we
could go ahead and use that later if we
want and we will use that later so let's
close this out
now the question some people are having
is where is this constructor in other
words people have emailed me and asked
me where is it in your previous examples
it was typed out up here and the answer
to that is you don't need to type out
the constructor up here if you do not
specify a constructor up here then when
you go to create your new object the
default constructor gets invoked
automatically by Java that is he assumes
hey you just told me I need to create a
new object a new instance of this class
so I'm going to go ahead and create this
default constructor for you and what
that is called is called an implicit
constructor that means we didn't write
it out so let's implicit that that's
what we wanted so Java creates a default
constructor now when you use the default
constructor you cannot use anything
between these parentheses it is called a
no argument or zero argument constructor
that means we can't put any values in
here therefore we have to either create
the value here assign it here or you
know you can go ahead and use your
object to a sign of value if we click
this you know we could we could go x
equals 12 you know you get the idea
we're not going to do that here though
you get the idea now so what I said was
this was an implicit constructor that we
did not type out up here now let's go
ahead and type that out up here and
let's say public
new empty and so there we go we type
this out this is called an explicit
constructor by the way this constructor
is the same as this constructor we just
decided to go ahead and type it out so
Java sees it here and says fine fact if
we run this we'll get the same result
which is 10 there is no difference
between this one and this one the only
difference is we decided to go ahead and
type this out now we could go ahead and
place the value of this variable down
here so watch this let's get rid of this
and let's now say inside this
constructor it equals 10 and we'll go
ahead and run this and we should get the
same result 10 now what happened here
well ok we basically said when we create
this new instance of this class I want
you to go ahead and assign this value of
10 to this variable at the time that
this new instance of this class new
empty is created now keep in mind we are
just a sign of value here nothing is
going through these parentheses remember
that we're not passing anything into
these we're just saying assign a value
right here at the time that the new
instance is created with this
constructor so I hope that clears a
little bit of it up and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
