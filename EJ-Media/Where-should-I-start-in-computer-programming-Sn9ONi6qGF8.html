to start in computer programming so this
video is really intended for people that
are just starting out and want to know
where they should first begin and in my
opinion you should start with HTML that
handles the basic structure of the web
page so that's a good place to first
start then you should tackle CSS and CSS
and HTML sort of go hand-in-hand and CSS
has become more and more important as
the years have rolled by so that's the
second series that you should take then
you will want to take a look at the CSS
layout tutorial that's sort of a follow
up series to the CSS series and
basically we'll start to use all the
concepts that we learned in the HTML and
CSS tutorial for beginners now after
that you should take a look at
JavaScript and JavaScript sort of has
become the default programming language
of the web so those are the big three
I'd like to calm HTML CSS and JavaScript
those are the first three languages that
you should learn after that you may want
to take a look at jQuery now jQuery is
sort of a follow up to JavaScript and
even though it is JavaScript it sort of
extends JavaScript and it actually makes
your scripting life a lot easier so you
should take a look at jQuery now after
that you may want to take a look at a
server-side scripting language such as
ASP or PHP and then finally you want to
wrap it up with a back-end language like
C sharp or Java so I hope that sort of
clarifies things now you don't have to
necessarily follow that order but I
think it's just a good idea okay I hope
that helped and thank you for visiting
