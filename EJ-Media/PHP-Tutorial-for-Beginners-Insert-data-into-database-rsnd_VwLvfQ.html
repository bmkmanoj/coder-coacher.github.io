in this video we're going to insert some
data into that table and to do that
we're going to use the very famous
insert into command now any of you that
have experience with sequel will
recognize this command it's one of the
major commands in any type of sequel
environment so here is the sequel
statement that we are going to use and
again we use the insert command to
insert data into our table we have to
specify again the table that we're going
to insert that data into now here's the
important part the first part we need to
specify the columns in parentheses that
we want to insert data into and you'll
remember we created these in the last
video there right here the name in the
address column and each column inside
these parentheses is separated by a
comma so if we add another column we
would have to put a comma here and add
that column and so on now next we use
the keyword values and this is the
actual data that we'll be inserting into
our columns and these values correspond
to our columns so the name column will
correspond to this placement right here
and we're gonna put in the name mark and
then the address corresponds to this
second position right here where we're
gonna put in the address and again we
need a comma to separate the values and
those again correspond to D columns so
it's pretty simple as you can see and so
everything is arranged perfectly so
let's go ahead and copy and paste this
into the command prompt and we'll just
hit paste here let's go ahead and hit
enter and there you can see our query
was okay by the way that's the lingo
they use in sequel it's always a query
so that's why we get this very simple
message query okay but that means all
the data went in correctly now to make
sure everything went okay we need to use
the Select command and we're gonna
specify star here that means we're just
gonna select everything and then we're
gonna use the from keyword and that
basically just specifies which table
were retrieving data from and in this
case of course the table is user data so
let's go ahead and hit enter and there
you can see look at that we've got our
first row how about that
now one more point I want to make if you
try to enter some more data here let's
say you try to enter in some other type
of day
and we put in Sarah or something here
this would actually throw an error
because we only created two columns we
don't have a third column so if we had a
third column here this would have been
entered into but if you try to put a
value in for which there is no column
sequel will throw an error so I just
thought it would let you know that okay
that's gonna do it for this video I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
