options that you can use with the
resizable widget and the first one we're
going to take a look at is the max width
property now this basically will only
allow you to resize the width of the
image to 300 pixels and then after that
you're basically done so let's go ahead
and see if it works and it does look I
cannot expand the width out any more
than 300 pixels now you can also do the
same thing for height so if you want to
test this out with height you can do
that as well there's also a minimum
width property as well so let's go ahead
and see how that works now basically the
way this will work is that the minimum
width has to be 300 pixels so you'll
notice that when I start to expand this
it will automatically go right to 300
pixels in terms of the width now watch
this
see how that went right to 300 pixels I
cannot resize that any shorter than 300
pixels but I can go out further now if I
want so that's how the minimum width
property works with the resizable widget
now you can also auto hide this marker
if you want so all we do is come over
here and we set this to auto height and
then the value we use is true so let's
go ahead and see if this works and there
you can see the marker is now gone now
if I highlight over that spot it appears
so that's the way the auto hide works
now we can also use the distance
property so let's go ahead and put that
here and basically what this does is we
put a value in here and let's set this
to 230 pixels and basically that means
resizing will not take place until we've
resized this image 230 pixels no matter
what direction so let's go ahead and
refresh this and let's move this 230
pixels see how nothing's happened and
finally it kicks in once I've moved 230
pixels so that's how the distance
property works now we can also create a
ghost effect and actually this is one of
my more favorite properties with a
resizable widget we can actually create
a ghost image when we start to resize
the image so we just put the ghost
property right here and we just set this
to true and let's go ahead and save this
and let's see what we get and see what
happens when I start resizing the image
we get that nice ghost effect and then
once I let go it resizes the image
appropriately so I've actually used
property many times I actually like this
one quite a bit I also like the next one
and let's actually refresh the page here
and you notice how when I resize the
image the aspect ratio gets distorted
well we can actually keep the aspect
ratio by using the following property
and that is you guessed it aspect ratio
and we just set it to true so let's go
ahead and save this and let's see what
we get and take a look at that now the
proper aspect ratio is maintained so
that's another very very useful property
in fact I use this one also quite a bit
now we can also go ahead and create an
animation effect and we just specify the
animate property and we set that to true
and watch what happens here see how we
got that nice animated effect so that's
how the animation property works now we
can also make the animation faster if
you want so we just add on duration and
then what you want to do is actually set
this to fast and this actually takes
quotes so we just set that to fast so
let's go ahead and save this and let's
see what we get and see how that's much
faster now so that's how the animate
duration property works okay that's
gonna do it for this video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
