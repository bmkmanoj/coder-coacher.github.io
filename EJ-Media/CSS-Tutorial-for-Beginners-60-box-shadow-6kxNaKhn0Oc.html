to our text now what if we want to add a
shadow to a block element such as a div
for that we need to use the Box shadow
and the parameters are actually very
similar to the text shadow property we
talked about in the last video and I'll
show you that in a minute so you can see
I have a very simple div here and of
course this is a block element so that's
why we have to use the Box shadow
property I've given it a width of 600
pixels a height of 200 pixels and edit a
color of blue and we can see it over
here so we want to do is add a little
shadow to the bottom and to the sides
now we don't need to see the HTML
anymore so let's go ahead and just
resize everything up here and let's give
this a lot of room there we go okay good
so let's go ahead and put in the box
shadow property and you guessed it it's
just box shadow and then like I said
this is very similar to the text shadow
property some of the values are very
similar so the first value is for
horizontal the second value is for
vertical so let's just make this 15
pixels and 15 pixels and let's go ahead
and make the shadow orange you'll
remember this is where the color goes so
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh there you can see we've got a
nice little shadow here now similar to
the text shadow property we can also
blur this as well so let's blur this
let's say five pixels so we'll go ahead
and save this and there you can see now
we've got a little bit of a blur effect
going here now unlike the text shadow
property the Box shadow property has a
fifth value that we can specify and that
is called the spread radius and we put
that right after the blur value and
again we can specify this in pixels so
let's say we want to increase the spread
by seven pixels let's go ahead and do
that and let's take a look and see what
happens here and there you can see it
increased the size of the shadow so
that's how that works now one thing that
you can do with the box shadow property
is that you can actually add inner
shadows now this works usually best with
lighter color so let's actually make our
background color light gray you could
actually make it
if you want it stands out very well
against that as well and we're going to
get rid of all of this and the key word
that you want to use to create an inner
shadow is in set so that's what we do
now rarely do you actually give vertical
or horizontal dimensions here so we're
just going to leave that at zero pixels
we're not going to specify anything
there and then we're going to blur this
by 15 pixels and obviously since we want
this shadow to stand out we want it
darker than the background color so
let's go ahead and make this black and
black is usually a really good one to
use when you're trying to cast an inner
glow or inner shadow so let's go ahead
and save this let's refresh and see how
that looks really kind of snapping looks
really nice doesn't it so that's how you
create an inner shadow or sometimes they
refer to it as an inner glow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
