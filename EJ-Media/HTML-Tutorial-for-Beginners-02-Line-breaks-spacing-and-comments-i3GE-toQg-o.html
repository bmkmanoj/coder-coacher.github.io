beginning HTML today we're going to look
at adding line breaks comments and
spaces to your HTML code now if you
follow the last video we're going to go
ahead and use that HTML file we created
in that video and so let's go ahead and
double click that now if you follow it
along we named it test dot HTML so let's
go ahead and open that and here is the
header that we created in that last
video the two headers actually and here
are the paragraphs that we created with
the paragraph tag now what we want to do
is we want to add some space in here
between this section and this second
section so we're going to add some space
right here so let's go ahead and close
out Internet Explorer now and what we're
going to do now is reopen this with
notepad and that will allow us to look
at the code and so here was the first
section that we created this you will
remember was the header and this is the
paragraph and this was the second
section that we used the h2 header tag
to identify and then we had another
paragraph right here so what I want you
to do is go ahead and hit enter three
times and that should give us the space
between our sections so one two three
and then I want you to hit save as and
we're going to save this as HTML again
because after you open a notepad by the
way it will want to keep it in the
notepad file format and we want this
back into HTML so go ahead and save that
as HTML close it out and let's reopen
this up and you'll notice that nothing
happened here and actually I wanted that
so you'll notice we didn't get our
spaces well what happened there let's go
back into here open this up and what
happens is is that you actually have to
identify line breaks with HTML code
otherwise it's as if nothing happened it
will just ignore these and keep going to
the next section so we actually do have
to put a line break here now you'll
notice there's an automatic line break
after each tag but if you want an
additional line breaks you have to put
in you have to put in the BR tag and
let's go ahead and do that and there you
go we
now have a line break and we can go
ahead and copy and paste these now you
will remember in the introductory video
you'll remember I talked about empty
elements and an empty element does not
need a closing tag so we can just put
these in here and not have to close them
and the reason is is because we're not
putting anything in between these as we
are liking this paragraph tag
we're just saying hey do a line break
here so let's go ahead and save this
again and we'll save it again as HTML
and if we go back to our test page
you'll see hey look we've got our line
breaks in there now so now it recognized
it and we're good to go
okay so let's close this out and let's
go ahead and reopen our HTML document in
notepad again and now let's do a comment
now a comment section is used to keep
notes in your HTML code that is you want
notes for your code but you do not want
it to be displayed on your web page in
order to do that we use the less than
angle bracket and then an exclamation
point and then two hyphens and then we
can put whatever we want here and again
this is internal to the code only we're
keeping private notes on our code so
we'll say this is the start of the HTML
code for the second section and we will
start each section with a header tag and
then we close it with two hyphens and a
greater than angle bracket and so let's
go ahead and save this as a HTML
document again
and let's open it and you can see the
code did not show up that's what we
wanted right it was an internal comment
now watch what happens let's actually go
back in there and let's remove the
exclamation point let's go ahead and
save as again and watch what happens now
it displayed it you'll notice because
when we took out that exclamation point
it's no longer a comment and the browser
now treats this as actual text so just
keep that in mind if you're fat-finger
it it'll actually show up in your site
which you probably realize because you'd
be doing some quality assurance I'm
assuming on your actual webpage so let's
go ahead and fix that and we're back in
business okay now I will show you how to
add spaces or additional spaces between
text so right here let's type in test
space test and let's do another save as
and let's open it up and you can see
there it automatically will create one
space now let's go back in there and
let's add a bunch of spaces here and I
think you know what's going to happen
but let's go ahead and do this anyways
and you can see the browser did not
recognize those extra spaces we put in
so in order to accomplish that we have
to use the following we need to put in
ampersand n B SP and you can stack as
many of these as you like so if we want
four spaces we'll just put four of these
and I think what the designers we're
thinking here whereas if you put
ampersand and be SP that's probably not
something someone's going to actually
type out so if you put that in there it
will actually create a space so let's do
our save as again
and there you can see we got the spaces
between test and test so that's going to
do it for this video I will see you guys
in the next eight GML video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
