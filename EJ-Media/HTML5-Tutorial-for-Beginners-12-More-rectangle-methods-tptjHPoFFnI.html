using the rectangle method and we went
ahead and filled it with the color blue
and we made the outline red of course
now there are two other main rectangle
methods that canvas provides and we're
going to talk about those in this video
now let's say all we needed to do was
make a simple rectangle we didn't need
anything else we didn't need to fill it
with blue we just needed a simple
rectangle well as I said canvas provides
a method to do that and it's called the
stroke rect method so basically what
you're doing here is you're just
combining these two lines into one
method now you might ask well what's the
big deal about that well you're cutting
down on lines of code that's what that's
all about
so you don't need as many lines it's a
little bit simpler to make just a quick
rectangle now keep in mind if you do
that you will not be able to fill the
rectangle just we'll create a simple
quick rectangle so again we don't need
this line because it's gonna go up here
it's all gonna be combined into one
method and the method again is stroke
rect so let's go ahead and create that
and we capitalize the arc here that's it
so again now we have everything combined
into one method so again we don't need
this line anymore we can just go ahead
and get rid of it and as I said these
three lines will not be executed this
just creates a simple rectangle with an
outline that's it so I'm gonna leave
these here just to show you that it
doesn't in fact get filled it won't
because this will just give us a simple
quick rectangle so let's go ahead and
run this and let's see what we get and
there you can see we got our simple
rectangle but it is not filled and
that's what I wanted to show you these
lines not will not get executed this
will just create a quick rectangle for
us now there's another method yet
another method that's provided what if
you wanted to do a quick fill you wanted
to have a rectangle that was filled with
a color well you can use the fill rect
method and that's all that does now of
course this will just give us a
rectangle that is filled with the color
red actually let's switch this up we'll
make this black this time so we'll do a
fill with a black and obviously since we
don't have an outline anymore
we don't need to create a line with here
and of course we don't need these three
lines either we never did when we were
using these combined methods so let's go
ahead and run this and we should now get
a black filled rectangle and we did so
those are just two additional methods
that you'll want to know in your ongoing
training of HTML canvas okay we're going
to move on to a new subject in the next
video see you guys on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
