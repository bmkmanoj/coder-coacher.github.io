downloading the jQuery library and
specifying it in our HTML code there are
two ways to specify jQuery in your HTML
code one way is through something called
a CDN that means content delivery
network and jQuery has become wildly
popular over the last five to six years
because of that jquery's library is
hosted by Google Microsoft several of
the very large companies and so you can
actually point to one of these servers
we're not going to do that until later
so just keep in mind that's something
you can do but we're going to do that in
a later video we're going to do it the
old-fashioned way and that is point to
the library locally so what does that
mean we need to download the source from
jquery's website so I provided a link to
the jQuery website in the information
section of this video so what I'd like
you to do is go to the jQuery website
and what I want you to do is click on
this download query link right here and
then you're going to get this page that
has two different jQuery versions we're
going to use this version right here
download the uncompressed development
jQuery 1.11 dot
and download it now these files are not
huge so you really you should download
all of them even the jQuery 2 dot X
series so that you have them for
reference in the future if you need them
now the main difference between 1 dot X
and 2 dot X is that 2 dot X drop support
for Internet Explorer 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 so that's
why we're going to use 1 dot X and
that's why I use 1 dot X because I don't
think it's a good idea to ever drop
older browser versions in fact you'd be
surprised how many people are still
using Internet Explorer 8 my mom still
uses it so that's why we're going to use
1 dot X but in reality there's just very
little difference between the two it's
just that 2 dot X drops some of the
older browser versions now if you want
to use 2 dot X in this series feel free
to do that
this series will support any version of
jQuery that you want to use so that
being said go ahead and download the
developement jQuery one 11.3 and once
you have that I want you to create a
folder called website you can call it
whatever you want and then
in there are two files as we've done in
every series we're going to have an
index.html and a CSS stylesheet by the
way I will provide the source for all of
these videos in the information section
of this video so again there will be
pasted links so you can go ahead and get
all this code and then what you want to
do is open up the jQuery source that you
downloaded and in this case I downloaded
both of them and so I've got the one dot
11.3 and the two dot one dot four but
we're going to use the 1.11 version and
we're going to use the development
version now you'll notice well let me
drag this over here a little that the
size of this file is 278 kilobytes now
if we go to the production version
you'll notice that it's 94 kilobytes so
this is the same exact version as the
development version it's just a
compressed version because you want to
have this file as small as possible when
you go to production you don't want the
user to have to download large files so
this is just the compressed version but
again we're going to use the development
version because we're going to because
we're really in a testing phase or a
learning phase if you want to think of
it like that so this is the version we
will use so what I want you to do is
just copy and paste that because you
want to keep the original version in
your library so we'll just copy and
paste that right into our website
project folder there we go now let's go
ahead and close this folder out and
let's go ahead now and open our HTML
file and we're going to be using notepad
plus plus just like we did in the Java
Script series if you watched my
JavaScript series you will know how to
use this IDE and I hope you did watch my
JavaScript series because it is very
relevant to the jQuery series if you are
watching this series for the very first
time and have not watched my other
series you should go out and download
notepad plus plus all you need to do is
put notepad plus plus in the Google
search engine and it will come up it's
very very easy to download and very
quick to install so let's go ahead and
edit our HTML document and here is the
HTML source that we will be using in the
next video and again I will put this in
the information section so now we need
to point to that jQuery library where do
we do that well if you watched my
JavaScript serie
in video 48 I mentioned that we need to
point to the JavaScript library now
remember that the jQuery library is
really a JavaScript library that's why
I'm calling it a JavaScript library and
you probably will notice that it has a
dot J s extension and you'll remember
that in episode 48 I said that we need
to point to the JavaScript library right
before the closing body tag and it's the
same reason why we're doing this here we
want the entire web page to load before
we load our JavaScript library because
that will increase the performance of
the load time so I'm just going to go
ahead and copy and paste the line right
here
there you can see as always we use the
script element tag we use the source
attribute and we simply point to our
jQuery slash JavaScript library it's
that simple by the way it actually let's
minimize this you'll notice of course
and you probably already know this by
now that the name we used in the source
attribute matches the name in our folder
also we don't have to specify a
directory here because the library is in
the same folder as our index.html okay
that's going to do it for this video in
the next video we will get started with
jQuery see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
