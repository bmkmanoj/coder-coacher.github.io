at selectors we've looked at CSS
selectors and jQuery selectors in this
video we're gonna look at a method the
CSS method so we use CSS to specify the
CSS method and then just like every
method we need parentheses and inside
those parentheses there's two things we
need to be concerned about first we
specify the property and that is
surrounded by quotes you can either use
single quotes or double quotes and then
you have to specify a comma and then you
put in whatever value you want to put in
and so you can put any CSS property you
want here so let's go ahead and just
change the color in this first paragraph
so we'll just specify the ID here which
of course is pound left and like I said
we can use any property so let's go
ahead and use the color property
and let's put in a value of blue let's
change the text to blue so let's go
ahead and save this let's refresh our
page and we'll hit our button down here
and there you can see the text is blue
and again we can use any CSS property we
want here let's go ahead and change the
border and we'll put in the usual border
values so we'll make it solid two pixels
wide and we'll change it to red so let's
go ahead and save this will refresh our
page if we hit our button there you can
see now we've got our red border so
let's go ahead and save an example of
this so that you have this and we'll
just put in a comment here now you might
be asking how do I combine CSS rules how
do I do multiple rules and the way we do
that is first we have to use squiggly
brackets to add multiple CSS rules so we
put that just inside the parenthesis and
actually we want to move this over here
so this actually equates to the CSS
squiggly bracket so if we go over to
this stylesheet we need to have these
squiggly brackets to have multiple rules
so let's go back to our web page and now
instead of having a comma here you put a
colon and here's where the comma goes it
actually separates the rules so we put a
comma there and then we can put in a new
rule so let's so let's just go ahead and
being pasted this over here and what
we'll do
whoops we have to stay inside the
bracket okay and what we'll do is we'll
change the color of the text to blue
which we did in the first example so
we're gonna be doing multiple things so
now this is kind of useful because you
can do a mass change at once you can add
as many different rules as you want just
remember you have to separate it with a
comma so let's go ahead and save this
and if this works we should have our
border red and the color of our text
blue and it worked now there are other
ways to do multiple things that is add
multiple rules and that is called
chaining and we will talk about that in
a few videos so just soak this in and
we'll talk about a new method in the
next video see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
