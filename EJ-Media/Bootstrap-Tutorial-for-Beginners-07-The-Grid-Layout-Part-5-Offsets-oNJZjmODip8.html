bootstrap grid over the last several
videos now one question that a lot of
people have is can I move columns to an
exact spot where I want them can I place
them in an exact position and bootstrap
gives you a very nice class that has
that type of functionality and so that's
what we're going to cover in this video
and so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead and get rid of columns 7
6 &amp;amp; 5 this of course is in our second
row so we're gonna go ahead and get rid
of those and we're going to go ahead and
keep our fourth column in our second row
so let's save this let's reload this up
and see what we get and there we go
we've got our column four still and the
rest of the columns are now gone so what
we want to do is move this column all
the way to the right and so we'll just
go ahead and keep this web page loaded
and we'll keep refreshing so I can show
you how this works now what happens is
the class that bootstrap provides always
moves from left to right so when you
play around with these values just keep
in mind that it will always move the
column from left to right in this
direction so let's go ahead and we're
just gonna minimize a page we're gonna
flip back to our code so here is where
we are going to place our class that
will allow us to move our column and
we're actually gonna put it right
between these quotes so the first thing
we do is type in Co L then a hyphen then
MD then another - and here's where it
gets a little bit different now you're
going to type in offset so that is the
standard format that we use and this is
sort of similar to the normal column
class now we just put in a number and
this number equates to how far you're
going to go ahead and push your column
so let's go ahead and we'll start out
with a 5 so let's go ahead and save this
and let's go back to our web page and
let's go ahead and hit refresh and there
you can see it moved it right to the
middle so if you wanted it right there
you could certainly keep that number but
again we want to move this all the way
to the right now again you have to play
around with these numbers kind of the
same way you have to with the normal
column class play around with the
numbers until you get the exact position
that you want so let's go ahead and
minimize this and let's go ahead and I
believe it was a 9 I was actually
testing this the other night let's go
ahead and save this
let's open our
back up and we'll hit refresh and there
you can see look at that it pushed it
all the way to the right so again this
is a very useful class that you can use
in bootstrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
