beginning HTML today we are gonna look
at adding links to your web page now
what would your web page be without
links well it wouldn't be much
navigation is a key consideration in to
designing your website and so we will
begin with adding links to your web page
now there are two ways to add links
first is to link to an outside web page
and second is to link to a section
within your web page in this video we
are going to cover linking to an outside
URL now links are added with the anchor
element and within the anchor element is
an attribute called href and that tells
the anchor element where the destination
is for the link and the destination can
be like I said it can be a web page on
the same site or it can link to an
outside website and as I said we will
link to an outside URL in this video ok
so let's first create ap element or if
you remember this stands for paragraph
because we need to add some text and
sentences inside and around our link so
will embed everything within that and
now we will add our anchor tag now
within the opening a tag and opening P
tag we are gonna create some text and we
are gonna say please click on this link
and this will just come out as straight
text and it will come out before our
link which is embedded in here and now
we're gonna create the href attribute
we're gonna hit equals and then you're
gonna put in quotes and here is where we
are going to put in our outside URL that
we want to link to in our web page and
in this case I am just going to link to
my YouTube channel page so we'll go
ahead and just copy and paste that in
here and we have to create a end quote
now we can add some text before we make
the closing anchor tag and that text
will become the link so this does not
actually get displayed what will be
displayed as a link is the text that we
put in here so we will say EJ media
channel page
and actually I think I made a mistake
here we need to actually keep this tag
open so this actually has to stay open
we do not use a angle bracket here
because this is all part of the link so
again if you put that angle bracket in
get rid of it and now this should work
let's go ahead and save this and let's
actually do something different here
let's actually open this up within
google chrome and you can see we've got
our link now and if I click on that it
should go to my YouTube channel page and
it did now if we pull up the source here
you can see that there is the text again
where we said please click on this link
that is not actually part of the link
because it comes before the a element
the anchor element and there you can see
the text that we created for our link
and that is part of the link because we
put that between the closing angle
bracket and the closing anchor tag so
that becomes part of the link and
obviously that's a little bit easier to
read than the actual URL and obviously
you guys have seen that many times when
you've been out on the web okay that's
gonna do it for this video in the next
video we will look at links again and we
will look at linking within an existing
web page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
