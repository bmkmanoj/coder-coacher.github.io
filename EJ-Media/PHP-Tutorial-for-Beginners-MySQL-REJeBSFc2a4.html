sequel database now you might be going
wait a minute I thought this was a
series about PHP why are you working
with my sequel and the reason is because
almost every server-side language
whether you're using ASP or PHP works
against a database and I've seen some
tutorials out there where they don't
even mention my sequel and that's just
amazing because we really need to spend
a few lectures talking about my sequel
and get that going because we're going
to create some scripts that will work
against our my sequel database so it
makes sense to take care of this now so
as usual I will guide you through every
step of the way now first thing I want
you to do is open up your zamp control
panel and I want you to fire up your my
sequel so go ahead and start that I've
had few problems by the way starting
this up it's much easier actually than
Apache but if you do have a port
conflict you will want to resolve that
and you may have to do a search on
Google so we can go ahead and just
minimize this now what I want you to do
is go down to the Start menu and you're
going to type in command here and that
will bring up the command window if you
have the Metro Yui down here if you're
on Windows 8.1 or above you can just
right-click on it and that will allow
you to bring up the command window now
the next thing we want to do is browse
to our installation directory wherever
you installed zamp in my case I just
took the default so it's sitting right
on my C Drive so we're gonna open that
up and then we're gonna go ahead and
scroll down to my sequel and then we're
gonna open up the bin folder and what
we're gonna be calling is this my sequel
app now an easy way to do this is simply
to just go ahead and copy the path here
and then we can come over here and let's
just go ahead and do a CD backslash here
and that will get us at the root
directory now you can right click up
here you can go to edit and you can hit
paste and see that's much easier than
having to type all that out and then
what we need to do is specify my sequel
and actually I've caps on so I better
take that off and we can close this out
now now what I want you to do is hit
space and then you're gonna type in -
you and then root and basically this
will log us in as the root user meaning
you don't need to use a password so hit
enter and you'll get all this gibberish
don't worry about any of this and they
should be at a new prompt and you should
see this mariya DB you may see my sequel
here and if you do that's just fine
this Maria DB by the way this is the new
my sequel my sequel was bought by Oracle
a few years ago and the my sequel
developers have started up a new type of
database basically the same thing it
just says Maria DB now this is where the
database goes now you can see we don't
have any databases at this point and
that is fine because we haven't created
one yet but that doesn't mean there
aren't databases that are already out
there they were created when we
installed zamp
let's actually make this a little bit
bigger so now that we are logged in
let's go ahead and issue our command and
we're just going to type in show
database and this is just to make sure
everything is working by the way you
will always end this with a semicolon
that's the way this works once you're
logged in to my sequel I'm gonna call my
sequel by the way because I'm just too
used to calling it my sequel so you're
gonna go ahead and hit enter and it
didn't work what did I do wrong I can
just hit f1 here again and the actual
command is show databases that was a
mistake I apologize for that and we'll
go ahead and hit enter and you should
see this returned once you enter the
command you'll see database and this
will tell you all the databases that are
already installed and we could use one
of these if we wanted to but we're not
going to now what we need to do is
create our database so let's go ahead
and do that and the command we use is
create and then we use the keyword
database and then we call it whatever we
want to in this case I'm just gonna call
it test DB and then remember we have to
use a semicolon at the end now that
doesn't seem like a lot we just got this
message to test query okay one row
affected well that doesn't tell you much
couldn't there be a message that says
your database was created a nice message
like that but no but it was and that's
the very Spartan message that we get now
just to make sure our database was
created let's go ahead and do another
show databases and there you can see
there's our database test DB so great
now what we want to do is actually
switch to this database we want to use
this database and the command we issue
is just use that's it you specify the
database that you want in this case we
want test DB we hit enter and look at
that we're now using the test database
and you can see right here let's
actually make this a little bit bigger
you can see right here we're now logged
in to this database you can
because it says test DB right here so
that's how you can actually tell what
database you are using okay that's gonna
do it for this lecture and the next
lecture will actually start to do some
interesting things inside this database
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
