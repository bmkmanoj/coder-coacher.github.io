set today we're going to look at static
variables and I got to tell you my first
encounter with these was not good this
took me a while to understand how these
things work because no book really
explained it that well now I know I'm
digressing a bit here one of the things
I've done in my own experience is to
develop a relationship with several
developers and kind of query them on how
things work and it's really surprising
when I was going through the Java book I
would take that book to some of these
developers and they would look at me
with a very quizzical look and go no no
no no that's that's not how it's done
here's how it's really done and you kind
of pick up from the developers how
things are really done in the real world
and so a lot of the information and
useful tips they've given me I'm sharing
in these videos with you so sorry about
the digressing but okay so let's get on
to static variables so we have this nice
keyword here static for our variable
here so this becomes a static variable
and we come down here and we've got a
static method now static variables are
just that they're static they never go
away think of them as like a cliff
against the raging sea they don't go
away it's always there no matter what
it's like a rock object or instance
variables as we know do go away with the
lifetime of the object so think of
objects I like to think of them as
on-demand we need some work to get done
the object is created and then we get to
use this variable and then when the
objects done all this goes away static
variables never they stay around well
they don't stay around forever probably
for the lifetime of your program but for
a long time so static variables are
there for a very very long time
now it's useful to talk about the JVM
here for a little bit the java virtual
machine that's loaded right now in fact
as we speak now we do not need to get
into the specifics of the java virtual
machine it's only necessary to talk
about that in the broadest sense because
it will help explain how static works
because you really don't have to know
how the JVM works behind the scenes it
does all the memory allocation for you
and that's a good thing now it used to
be in languages
C++ and C you had to do a lot of memory
management in Java that's not necessary
but it is necessary for a little
discussion about it here because it will
assist us in understanding how this
static keyword works so what happens
when we save and compile our class when
I go over here and hit save the class
gets compiled and again it goes into the
java virtual machine inside that java
virtual machine is something called the
class loader he's the guy that takes
this gets a hold of it and allocates it
for use whatever we call upon it but he
also does something else he will come
down here and start scanning for the
keyword static and he'll look for him
and when he finds it he finds a match he
will load this static variable into the
runtime memory so that static variable
is good to go now again I'm using
runtime memory in the broadest sense
here guys I mean we could get into the
heap and we could get into the stack and
all that stuff but that is for tutorials
much later on for now I'll just use that
term runtime very loosely so again he
gets loaded to the runtime he's ready to
go same thing by the way with The
Ecstatic he's going to see this and say
oh I've got to load this out there he is
a permanent fixture and since there's no
copies of this we're not going to make
any instances of this this is not a
object or instance we can go ahead and
load that out of the runtime memory same
thing again with the static variable
we'll never make any copies of this he
gets to live forever and how lucky is
that these guys they only have a very
short-term existence but the static
variables they get to survive on and on
and on now you don't believe me okay
let's go over here to the main and for
our purposes let's actually copy this
and we'll paste it back I want to show
you guys this so copy and then let's get
rid of this now if we type in the name
of this class registration over here
look you notice we get the static
variable username and our static method
because those two are loaded out in the
runtime we could technically start using
these right now and by the way that's
the same thing with our main that we've
always
been using this is loaded out there -
that's exactly what this does he's out
there ready to go as well now the reason
we use the class name here is because we
haven't created an object and even if we
did create an object we can't use an
object to reference a static variable
it's not even part of the object so
that's why you always use the class name
to refer to the static variables so
let's go ahead and get rid of that and
we will copy and paste our code back in
and apparently I copied the public
static void main we don't need that
anymore and let's go ahead and do a save
here just so this is all nice and neat
and tidy and we got rid of the
intellisense okay so and let's go to I
just to be a little cleaner let's get
rid of some of these extra lines okay
now let's go back to registration and
let's talk about our class that we're
going to be creating objects from so
this registration class is going to
handle new users that come in to our
website our hypothetical website and so
when they come in here our constructor
will go ahead and assign the username
that they enter to this variable and
then our nice little method down here
put user name into the database we'll do
that obviously this is hypothetical -
we're going to return their user name
here and then let's just assume we have
some hypothetical code here that puts
that username into our database and then
at that point the objects done its work
so pretty simple and as you can see I
typed all this out because I don't want
to bore you guys typing this all out and
I'm not a very good typer in the first
place now let's go ahead and run this
and let's just arrange this nice and
neat now I want you to clear this out of
your memory just forget that we even see
this and forget even that this is typed
in okay let's act like all that's here
is this public static void main you're
in the matrix right now and you can do
whatever you want
you're slowing things down quite a bit
now let's make some more assumptions
here let's assume that when somebody
comes into our website and they submit
the form that has the username we have
some additional code that will actually
begin to generate the code to kick off
this odd
and it'll create the new keyword and
then kick off our constructor to get
registration to do what it needs to do
so our website goes live and five days
later we get our first user named Mary
Mary comes into the website fills out
all of our information
it's that submit button and then on the
back end our registration takes that and
is going to go ahead and plug that into
our database so let's take a look at
this
we had our object created here
everything starts with this new keyword
it invokes our constructor registration
and takes Mary's user name which just
happens to be Mary it comes over here
and it tells the class loader hey class
loader I need a copy of registration to
do some work so please do that for me go
ahead and load that out into the runtime
memory and by the way I'm going to do
some work here too
I'm going to go ahead and take that
value of Mary and assign it to this
string variable and I'm also at the same
time going to go ahead and increment our
static variable by one notice we started
out zero now that becomes one and now I
am all done everything's over and so
let's go back to our main program and
after the constructor is done we're
going to go ahead and invoke our put
user name into the database so we're
going to go ahead back here the username
of Mary gets returned to this method and
that method goes ahead and plugs it into
our database and this method has done
its work it's done we come back to here
and this confirms that it's been done
Mary's username has been created and
entered into the database the objects
life now is done as we know it and go
through a process called garbage
collection by Java that is he tosses it
out like a piece of trash isn't a great
name garbage collection get it out of
here right we don't want any more game
over for that object and that's it now
the main goes back to this little normal
life here is just sitting here in the
runtime waiting for something else to
happen well Mary goes out to lunch with
Larry and tells Larry about this great
website that she just joined and Larry
comes back to the office and one hour
later he logs in and
creates his username named Larry the
event handlers and all of our listeners
and all that stuff all that other code
we got to kick off our new object there
we go we've got our new keyword which
invokes our constructor it takes the
username Larry entered which was Larry
we go back here and it takes the new
value for this username and it is a new
value so this variable is a new variable
as well right and he gets that username
Larry assigned to him and the
constructor says increment the static
variable now the static variable he's
been out there all this time right he
hasn't changed his value doesn't reset
this one does he keeps taking new user
names but this one it just stays the
same and so it's going to go up to two
now because we got another tick tick
tick right it's up to two now so we go
back to the main and our put username
database method gets invoked you know
what it does by this time down here
Larry is now into the database the
object is over with he's done his job
and he goes through garbage collection
good night Irene for him and so some
more time passes and our main is just
sitting out here along with our static
variable and our static method and the
next day Mike my boss walks in and goes
you know we've been monitoring our
network with all our website and we've
noticed that the website that you did
the backend Java for that's getting some
traffic I need you to run a report and
tell me how many people are registering
and I say no problem and I go ahead from
my internal website and run a report and
eventually through all these classes and
all this other stuff it invokes my get
user name static method and so we go
back here and the static method is going
to go hey return me the value of this
static variable name username and you
know what actually it would have been
more appropriate to call this username
count remember in a previous tutorial I
actually said we should name these four
they're doing I like to do that so let's
call that count and now we're going to
get all kinds of intellisense so let's
go ahead and fix all this count and
let's call this count
because that's really not a username so
that was a little bit misleading of
course as we know let's go ahead and run
this again and just get our st. we'll
get the same output of course but I just
wanted to be clean and so Mike told me I
need to get the users and so I invoked
our get username count method over here
which is a static method he is going to
go out and say hey return me the value
of this static variable which is now at
2:00 and that of course is what gets
returned here and I go tell Mike the
good news that we got two people and
Mike is very happy at that point now two
years later apparently we had a bad
marketing plan because everything went
south and we haven't had a user in two
years so this poor little mean and these
poor little static variables are just
sitting out here waiting doing nothing
right well somebody finally logs in our
new and revised marketing plan has
worked and you guys get the idea right
we get a new object and this thing gets
invoked he's going to go and tell the
class loader I need a new object of this
so I can do some work and blah blah blah
right okay you get the idea and then
yeah we got to run the report again and
this time it shows we've got three
people I think you guys are getting the
idea how this works now before we go I
want to talk about one thing that's kind
of important to mention static and
Static go together like peas in a pod
now it's interesting as actually
watching yesterday I was actually
watching some YouTube's on this and I
think I watched five tutorials on static
variables only one of them actually
mentioned that you should have static
methods going after static variables and
he all he said was you know you just
need to do that and that's it didn't say
anything else well here's the reason now
we can apply this to what I want to say
about static methods and static
variables going together like peas in a
pot now let's say I totally lost all
sense of my wisdom here and decided yeah
let's go ahead and do that let's try to
return this object variable up here
let's see what happens even if we do it
let's let's see because this can it
probably tell me to get lost as it
should by the way Java is probably
thinking is this guy out of his mind
nope can't do that non
static variable username a cannot be
referenced from a static context wow
what does that mean that's it you know
that doesn't tell us a lot right well
basically what's going on here is if we
go back to our timeline and the new user
one that we created to put Mary in the
database is no longer there it's gone
it's gone from the world forever so now
I'm going to go ahead and try to kick
off a static method to call something
that isn't even there anymore now in
this world you can't reference something
that's no longer there in reality I
can't go back and have this it's gone it
never will exist again now maybe if you
had some supernatural abilities you
might be able to do that but I don't
have those abilities yet so sorry you
lose this is over with and you can't
have it again now there was a moment in
time when these two coexisted right the
new user one object coexisted with the
static variable they were alive at the
same time but now that is no longer the
case and that's why it's great to have
your static method go after your static
variable because guess what they will
both always be there it's almost like a
guarantee it's like I can guarantee that
that static variable will be there for
my static method I cannot guarantee that
an object variable will be there and so
that's the best way to think of that
okay so to wrap this up just keep in
mind that this is only one way to use
the static variable in terms of how we
were using this counter but this is
always a good way to explore the concept
of a static variable and as you saw it's
a good way to keep track of how many
objects get created from our
registration class and one final time
when the new keyword is used the
registration constructor gets invoked
and it goes over here and request a copy
from the class loader to be made or to
be put into memory and then he does
whatever he needs to do okay that's
going to wrap it up for this tutorial
talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
