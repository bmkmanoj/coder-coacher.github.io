page to our website that we've been
working on in ASP so where should we add
it well why don't we go ahead and add it
to our navigation bar so we'll add
another link here to our navigation bar
so let's go ahead and go to visual
studio now and what we want to do first
is add the ASP page and since we've
already got our master and content pages
all set up we can just go ahead and add
it right to our miscellaneous folder so
what I want you to do is go ahead and
right-click and copy our contact page
and then go ahead and just paste it back
into the miscellaneous folder and then
what we're going to do is go ahead and
rename this to login and then what I
want you to do is go ahead and just
close out this contact aspx and open up
the login dot aspx now obviously we
don't need this content anymore this was
for our contact aspx page so let's go
ahead and just get rid of that now what
I want you to do is go to the
description of this video and go to the
pace link where it says HTML needed for
this show and go ahead and copy all of
the content and then you're going to
come right here inside of our div
element and you're going to go ahead and
right-click and paste and you might
remember this if you took my CSS series
we designed this in the CSS series so
now we're going to actually put this to
good use and we're going to go ahead and
use this now so good we have that set
now what I want you to do is open up the
CSS style sheet and we're going to
scroll all the way to the bottom here
now what I want you to do is go back to
the description of this video and copy
all the source that I provided for the
CSS needed for this show and then just
come right here and you're going to
right click and paste and you should now
have all the CSS and you will remember
this also this is the CSS that we used
when we designed that form in the CSS
series so this should look very familiar
good so now we have the HTML and we have
the CSS all set now we need to go to our
master page and we're going to come
right down here and here's of course our
navigation bar and what we need to do is
go ahead now and add the link for our
login aspx page so let's go ahead and
just copy and paste this one right here
and then you're just going to change
this to login dot aspx and let's just
call this very
simply login okay so now we should have
all the HTML and CSS that we need so go
ahead and save all in the project and
let's go ahead now and load our page and
see what we get
and there's our login button let's go
ahead and hit that and I'm glad this
actually happened because this is a
little weird quirk sometimes in Visual
Studio now if you remember the form that
we designed in the CSS series it didn't
look like this of course we don't have
any of the formatting here we don't have
the border or the padding or anything
here and if you see the entire form
you're fine but if it looks like this
then you're not fine so you have to
follow the steps and I'm about to do
here and again this is just a strange
little quirk in Visual Studio so go
ahead and close this out and then what I
want to do is exit out of Visual Studio
now what I want you to do is go to the
website folder right click on it hit
copy and paste right back onto the
desktop and now you'll have a copy now
open visual studio back up and then what
I want you to do is go ahead and open up
the copy of the folder that we just made
so just go to open we're going to go to
website and we'll go all the way to the
bottom here and here is the copy so
let's open that up and now we'll go
ahead and reload the site and now we'll
hit our login button and take a look at
that the form now loads I am not sure
why this occurs but anyways it's a
little quirk in Visual Studio and like I
said if you saw this initially you were
fine but if you experienced what I
experienced then you need to follow the
procedures that I just showed you okay
that's part one of the login but we're
not done we have a lot more to do and
we'll continue on with our login script
in the next video see you guys on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
