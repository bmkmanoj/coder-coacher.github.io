we're going to have a review session of
many of the concepts we've covered so
far and there will also be some new
material as well and at the end of this
I'll also give some advice so of course
we've been talking about establishing
inheritance hierarchies when we design
our class structure and of course why do
we use inheritance because we've
determined that some of our classes have
certain behaviors and characteristics
and attributes in common so for instance
if we look at this dog superclass we
determined that the beagles and German
Shepherds both have a common behavior
they both move and they both eat so we
can go ahead and connect these classes
together in a relationship called
inheritance
so remember inheritance is not just
about reusing code it's about
establishing relationships and behaviors
between the various classes or common
characteristics so the subclasses beagle
and German Shepherd inherit from the
superclass dog and therefore we inherit
all of the dogs methods and therefore we
can use all the functionality of the dog
superclass now remember what we
discussed before super classes are less
specific and the sub classes are more
specific so if you take a look at the
move method in the superclass that will
be less specific than the beagle
subclass move method and you can see
here that's why I put beagle specific
code and why do we do that well because
German Shepherds and beagles might move
a little bit differently they also
probably eat a little bit differently
that's why we have to have code that is
specific to their own move method within
the subclass and that's what we mean
when we extend the behavior of a method
and as I said that makes sense because a
German Shepherd will move a little bit
differently than a beagle and eat a
little bit differently and so we need
some specific code in those subclass
methods to address that now also keep in
mind that when we inherit methods from
the superclass
we are overriding the superclass method
that is this is now a different method
the only thing we are
reusing is the name of the method of
course which is move the arguments as
well as the return type but the specific
code inside of it of course is something
new and different from the superclass
method now remember we can always add
more methods and instance variables that
are unique only to the subclass so if
you take a look at this German Sheperd
subclass I added a guard method to that
because German Shepherds of course can
be guard dogs now we don't think of
beagles as guard dogs so that's not a
method that we would put up in the dog
superclass we're just going to add that
into the German Shepherd subclass and
therefore it becomes unique to that
subclass so it is not a method that we
are inheriting and the same thing with
an instance variable you can see here I
added a sharp teeth instance variable to
the German Shepherd so now the Shepherd
subclass has two overridden methods in
terms of the move method and eat method
and one unique method which is of course
the guard method and of course now we
can add any new dogs to our hierarchy
because now it's in place we can just
extend off the dog superclass and we
could add a poodle if we wanted and so
on and of course we could tweak our
superclass too we could go ahead and add
a sleep method to our dog superclass and
then all the rest of the subclasses
would inherit that now you might ask the
question well if I override the
superclass method I can't use any of
that code anymore
so how can I use code from the subclass
method and the superclass method and the
answer to that is to use the super
keyword right here so we could call the
code in the superclass execute that and
then once the code in the superclass has
been executed in the move method the
beagle specific code in the move method
will then execute and then it will
finish so it's kind of like having the
best of both worlds it's almost like a
hybrid between the superclass code and
the subclass code and you get to use
both lines of code so again the super
keyword will call the inherited version
of the move method in the superclass
and after the super is done doing its
work it returns to the beagles move
method specific code and execute that ok
so I want to talk
out some design patterns that you should
think of when you're starting to design
your classes and again you always want
to design your class structure before
you actually write any code you want to
kind of have that in place and so what
we just talked about is this style over
here where we have our superclass as
less specific and our subclass as more
specific so we kind of work downward we
have this hierarchy in place but you
don't necessarily have to do it that way
and that is the point I want to make
here you can also actually put
everything into your superclass and have
that be more specific and then you can
have your subclasses just call
everything with the object dot you know
method or object dot whatever you want
to put there so again you can call
everything from the subclass to the
superclass so that's one way you can do
that so just keep that in mind the other
way is just to do a standalone class
where there's no inheritance hierarchy
in place and this is basically a class
that's just by its lonesome little self
and some developers actually prefer this
they don't want to have a huge hierarchy
chain because they find that more
complex they find it easier to keep
everything inside one class they don't
want to have methods that are overriding
each other and then figure out what
method is doing what in what class they
want it all in one class now the
drawback to that is that this might be
harder to maintain especially if you
have a lot of classes it's always easier
to maintain code if you have an
inheritance hierarchy in place but again
it's how you want to do it now I have
some advice first is keep your methods
simple and specific as a general rule
you don't want methods longer than a
page if it gets long it'll be hard to
maintain and read so keep it simple and
if methods get too long they're probably
doing different behaviors and remember
we want that method name specific to the
behavior so if it gets too long chances
are you probably have to break the
method up the second point I'd like to
make is reuse as much code as you can
you don't want to reinvent the wheel
every time you start a new project so
that's important the other point I'd
like to make
is there's a lot of open source out
there that do a lot of different things
including the Java API there's all of
this code out there that will do
everything from reading files creating
arrays for you all of this stuff that's
already been done for you so you're
taking these tutorials and you're
developing skills that will allow you to
read code so you should be able to take
that code and meld it into your own code
but remember it's always easier to reuse
somebody else's code that's free
open-source rather than start from
scratch starting from scratch is always
very very difficult so what you want to
do is reuse code and then add your own
code to it and then merge it into your
own project make it work for you now you
don't want to let it dominate you it
should fit into your project it
shouldn't become the end-all but you
should try to reuse as much as you can
okay that is going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video and just as a side note here in
the next video we are going to get
started with polymorphism abstract
classes and interfaces which are the
absolute key to becoming an effective
Java programmer I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
