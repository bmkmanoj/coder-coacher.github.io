if statements in PHP now if statements
are all about outcomes and specifically
if you want multiple outcomes if you
don't want multiple outcomes and you
just want a single outcome then you
really don't need to use an if statement
so if you want multiple scenarios you
want to use an if statement now if you
were walking down a path and you came to
another path do you stay on the same
path or do you take another path and if
statement can decide that for you and
that's the basic premise behind all if
statements regardless of what language
you are using them in furthermore if
statements are either true or false so
you could create a set of code that if
you stay on the main path that's the
true condition if you take the other
path then that is the false condition
now every if statement has four basic
parts there is the if keyword and that's
what we have to put right here the
second part is the test condition and
that is always in parentheses so that is
what we are testing to see if something
is - or false and then if it is true we
will do the third part which is execute
the block of code between our curly
braces right here if it is false then
nothing gets executed and it just exits
from the if statement now in the next
video we will use the else statement to
create another block of code for a false
scenario but in this case nothing will
happen so those are the four basic parts
to an if statement and it's almost
universally the same no matter what
language you are using so first things
first let's go ahead and create a
variable and we'll just call that number
now and let's go ahead and give that a
value of 6 and then of course we come
down here and of course we need the if
keyword first we already have that and
now we need to put some stuff in our
test condition and of course that goes
right between these parentheses and you
can put a lot of different things in
here so you can put functions in here
you can even put comparison operators
and even though we haven't talked about
comparison operators we're going to
introduce a few in this video and a
comparison operator does just that it
compares against something so they
almost go hand-in-hand with test
conditions in your if statement you're
going to use a lot of comparison
operators within these parentheses so
the first thing let's do let's go ahead
and put our specify our variable in this
test condition
and we're going to go ahead and use the
greater than sign and that is a
comparison operator and we're going to
specify four here so is this true or not
well yes this is true because the value
that we gave here six is greater than
four so whatever code we put inside of
our curly braces will be executed and
let's go ahead and just echo out
something very simple here let's go
ahead and we'll just echo out a string
and we'll just echo out to say something
very simple and we'll just say the
condition is true so let's go ahead and
save this let's go ahead and click on
our lesson dot PHP and we got a parse
error on line seven where that lobs we
don't need the equal sign here so let's
go ahead and resave this let's click on
this again and there you can see we got
the condition is true I'm glad we got
that parse error PHP will usually return
the line that it found the error on so
you can go ahead and we went right to
seven and I realize we didn't need to
assign this value we're just echoing out
something we don't need to assign a
value to this but in any event you can
see that this tested out true so that's
what we wanted now let's go ahead and
set this to 14 and now this is going to
turn out to be false so now we should
just get a blank page here because
nothing's gonna happen so let's go ahead
and refresh our page and that's exactly
what I expected this is now false
because we know that 6 isn't greater
than 14 in this world and that's why we
got the blank page now let's put an
equal sign here and what this will say
is is our variable greater than or
equals to 7 and that still should be
false right because it's not greater
than and it's not equal to 7 so let's go
ahead and see if we still have a blank
page and we do but now let's go ahead
and set this to 6 now this should be
true because our variable is at least
equal to 6 it's not greater than but it
will actually turn out to be equal so
let's go ahead and hit this and we get
the condition is true so that is how an
if statement works at the very basic
level now in the next video we will talk
about the else statement and that will
give us the ability to execute another
block of code for our false condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
