the different ways you can organize your
try-catch blocks now here's the code
that we used in the last video this
error handling to class and I created a
diagram over here so this will be a
little bit easier to understand for you
and I will also upload this as a paste
like these notes so you can have these
now again here's the code that we used
in the last lecture and we used to try
caches and you can see that right here
so we had one try catch and we had code
that threw an exception and then we
handled it in our catch block and the
same for the second try catch down here
we had a try block and the code threw an
exception and then we had a catch block
that handled that exception so basically
what we did here we created try catches
four different sets of code but you can
actually dump all of your code into one
try block in this scenario down here and
then you can create as many different
catch blocks as you want that can handle
the different types of exceptions that
might occur so this is just another way
that you can organize your try catch
block but there is a big difference and
that's what I want to point out and that
is once an exception occurs the next
line will not execute and I'm going to
show you that in this video so basically
let's go ahead and just run our old code
here in this original class error
handling to Java so let's go ahead and
run this and there you can see both
exceptions were handled now let's flip
over to error handling 3 and all I've
done here is basically duplicated the
error handling 2 class but we're going
to go ahead and edit this so that we
have this model down here so let's go
ahead and close this out so what we want
to do now is move all of the code in
this try block and put it up here so
everything's going to be wrapped around
one try block so let's go ahead and just
copy and paste some of this
and then let's go ahead and take our
system out print and we'll just put that
right here and now of course we don't
really need this triblock anymore so
let's go ahead and get rid of that but
we'll go ahead and keep the catch block
now this brings up another point if you
have multiple catch blocks associated
with one try block you want to put the
specific exception classes first and
then the last catch block should have
the generic exception class and so
that's what we have right here so this
should catch anything that we miss with
the more specific catch blocks so now
we've simulated this model down here so
let's go ahead and run this and you're
going to see what happens now and look
at that we got an exception occurred so
we hit this last catch block now you
might be asking the question wait a
minute why didn't the other code get
executed and that's because of this
comment that I put right here the second
line will not be executed and the reason
is very simple we hit an exception right
here it came down here and the catch was
activated it handled it and then the
program is done at that point it will
not come back to this try block and try
to execute this second line it's
basically done at that point so that may
be the way you want your program but if
you want your program to continue that
is if you want the program to continue
after an exception occurs you need to
set your program up with this model
right here this first model that we have
in this error handling to Java so
there's really no right or wrong here
it's really how you want to set up your
program do you want it to keep executing
after there's an exception if you do
then you need to split your code up into
multiple try blocks okay that's going to
do it for this video I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
