first section in this video we're gonna
add the rest of the section so let's go
ahead and first add section 2 section 3
and section 4 so let's go ahead and do
that we're just going to copy and paste
this first div of course we need to
create the HTML placeholders and we'll
just call this section 2 and section 2
repeat the process three and three and
then four and four good so this will
create section 2 section 3 and section 4
ok let's go ahead and flip over to the
style sheet and let's go ahead and just
copy and paste this for our section 2
and let's go ahead and make this section
2 here for the class now in terms of the
grid in rows we know that section 2
starts right at column line 2 so we need
to specify this right here but Row 1
will stay the same because it starts at
Row 1 right here and again if we don't
put in a stop value it will just end at
row line 2 which is what we want and
let's go ahead and switch this to dark
green just like we have it in the
finished product good that looks okay I
think that's gonna work just fine
alright so let's go ahead and create our
section 3 CSS code and we'll change the
class name and you've probably guessed
it by now we need column line 3 right
here and then by not putting in a stop
value it will end at column line 4 so
let's go ahead and specify 3 here and
similar to section 2 this will start a
grid row line 1 and then let's go ahead
and switch the color and we'll make this
Brown we're just using the solid color
names here and then let's go ahead and
create our section 4 and so we need to
go ahead and make this class 4 and of
course now this is section 4 we're
dealing with so we're going to go ahead
and start this at column line 1 and as
we know if we don't put in a stop value
it will end at 2 so that will be 1 but
what's gonna change here now is the row
right we're starting now at row line 2
instead of row line 1 so we have to
specify row line 2 here and of course it
will stop at row line 3 so this will be
a 2 so 1 &amp;amp; 2 and then let's go ahead and
switch the color and make
this red okay so let's save everything
up and let's go ahead and close out of
this and let's launch this in the
browser and take a look at that it
worked great now your mission should you
choose to accept is to fill out the rest
of these sections and don't worry as
usual I will provide the finished code
so you can refer to it if you get stuck
so go ahead now and try to put in
section 5 section 6 section 7 section 8
and section 9 and if you get stuck try
to go ahead and refer to this diagram
first before you actually look at my
code try and refer to this if you can
but if you do get stuck again I will
provide the code okay I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
