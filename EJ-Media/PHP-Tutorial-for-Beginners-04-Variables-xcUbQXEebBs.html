variables in PHP now there are three
basic types of variables string
variables numeric variables and arrays
we will deal with strings and numbers in
this video arrays we will talk about at
a later time now the most important
thing is in PHP you must place a dollar
symbol at the beginning of all your
variable names there is a reason for
this actually and it makes it much
faster for PHP to know that you are
declaring a variable so it improves the
overall performance so once again you
have to put this before every variable
that is not negotiable so this is our
variable name right here now you can
name these in almost any way you want
except for a few exceptions and here
they are you can't start your variable
name with numbers so I can't put a 1
here that's not going to work you also
cannot use hyphens so no hyphens are
allowed you can however use underscores
those are allowed you cannot use
whitespace so I can't put any whitespace
in the variable name it has to be one
continuous set of characters now if you
do want whitespace I suggest you use a
underscore in this place and of course
the biggest rule as I said before you
need a dollar symbol at the beginning of
every variable that you declare now
there are a couple of rules that are
considered good coding practice in PHP
the first is put all of your variables
in lowercase do not mix and match your
case keep them all in lowercase you
can't put them all in uppercase if you
want but I wouldn't recommend that I
would keep them all in lowercase if you
use several words in your variable you
should separate them with an underscore
so if I for instance if I spelled var
out two variable I would probably put an
underscore right there or if you have
three or four names in your variable
that's fine but just separate each word
by a underscore and that makes it much
easier to read now as I said in the last
video this is an entire statement now
the first part we declare the variable
and we are just giving it a name in the
second part we are assigning a value to
this variable so think of a variable as
a container it just stores whatever data
we want to hold to use later on we
assign values to the variable in this
case we are assigning this
string value to this variable once we
have the data stored in the variable we
can use it over and over again that's
the great thing about variables you
don't have to type out the data over and
over again you can just reference the
variable name because this set of
characters in this string is now stored
in this variable name and of course it
is done using this equal sign so they
give it something similar to boxes that
you have at home you store things in
those boxes and put stickers on the
boxes to identify what's inside them so
the box would be the variable name that
stores our string variable then when you
come back later they are there and you
know what's inside them now the
quotation marks signify that this is a
string which of course contains
characters now what's different here
than from many other languages is we
don't have to define the datatype if you
took my Java C or you'll remember you
always had to define the datatype but in
PHP and similar to JavaScript actually
you do not have to declare the data type
PHP will actually do it for us
automatically when we set the value and
it doesn't because it realizes these
quotes here are going to be a string
datatype so PHP just does it
automatically for us so this variable
again will hold a string and we can use
it at a later time and we're going to
use it very quickly so in this case
let's go ahead and use it with echo so
you can output this string variable to
the browser so you will remember from
the last video we just type in echo and
then we can just go ahead and reference
our variable name it's that simple
and then remember every statement has to
be closed with a semicolon and so now
this will output the contents of this
variable which of course is this string
so let's go ahead and save this now open
up the browser that you want to use in
this case I'm going to use Chrome you'll
see here I set a favorite to my local
host lesson dot PHP so I no longer have
to type this in you may want to do that
too because we're going to using this
file over and over for a while so if I
hit this there you can see we got our
output now as I said there are also
number variables which can contain you
guessed it numbers so we can store
numbers which is very useful if we want
to do math and all sorts of different
things so let's go ahead and rename our
variable to something a little bit more
relevant we'll call it integer there and
all you do is put in the number that you
want so let's put in 22 that's what
we're
use now you'll notice this time we don't
need the double quotes once PHP sees
that this is a number it knows that it's
an integer datatype and by the way you
can also put decimals here so if we
wanted to make this 22.7 you can do that
but we're just going to make this 22 and
then we have to put our new variable
name right here so we'll just call this
integer very simple and let's go ahead
and save this and then we'll rerun this
in our browser and there you can see we
got the output that we wanted 22 okay
that's going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
