video where we were talking about
functions in this video we're going to
expand upon functions and we're going to
talk about the opening and closing
parentheses now as I said in the last
video this is where we pass data or
information into our function and then
we can do whatever we want with that
data we can multiply it we can subtract
it we can divide it anything is open
game and so let's actually change our
function name because we're going to add
some data in this function so let's
change this to add something so it's a
little bit more relevant and then we're
going to create the parameters that
we're going to use now these are called
parameters but they're actually
variables because they will actually
hold the data that gets used by our
function the only difference is we don't
use the VAR keyword we can actually just
write out the name of a variable I like
to think of it more as a placeholder
it's kind of a temporary placeholder
where it just holds the data that gets
passed into our function and then as I
said our statements will work against
whatever data the variables in this
parenthesis are holding so we're going
to do multiple parameters here now you
can do one parameter you can do two
parameters you can do as many parameters
as you want you just have to put a comma
between each parameter or variable so
let's call our first variable num
because it is going to be a number and
we will call the second variable STR
because that is going to hold a string
and as I said you could name this
anything you want it doesn't matter you
could have this a hundred characters if
you wanted it does not matter but I like
to make the variable name somewhat
relevant to whatever data or information
it is holding well now we'll pass in
data when we call our function down here
but for now let's go ahead and put some
statements into our function let's get
rid of this comment and then what we're
going to do is create a variable inside
our function and we're just going to
simply call that add and then we're
going to say that is equal to num plus
STR and then of course a semicolon so
basically this variable will add up
these two variables in our parentheses
and whatever data is stored in them and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to alert and we're just going to
alert on the variable name and that of
course
is at so we just put ad in there and now
we need to actually call our function
down here and so again this is where we
pass in data to our function so we need
to obviously change the function to add
something because this is the function
we're calling and let's first pass in a
number because that's the first variable
that we have up here for a number and
let's pass in 455 and then we need a
comma and let's pass in a string now and
we'll pass in the string programs too
right now I have a space here because if
we don't put this space here the output
would put the word programs right next
to 45 and we want this to read more like
a sentence so that's why I put the space
here so again this number is going to
equate to this variable and the variable
STR is going to hold this string for us
and then we have a variable inside ER
function that's going to add our two
variables and then we're going to of
course alert on that variable which of
course we'll see when we open up our
browser so let's go ahead and save this
and let's flip over to our web page that
references our JavaScript file and let's
run this in chrome and there you can see
we get our sentence 455 programs too
right and we'll hit OK to that now I
want to point out that this example has
everything coming in we are sending data
into our function but we can also return
values from our function as well and
we'll talk about that in the next video
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
