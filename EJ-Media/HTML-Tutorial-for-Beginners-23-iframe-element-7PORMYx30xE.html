at i frame x' in HTML now basically a
iframe is just another HTML document
that we can embed into our existing
webpage and you accomplish that with the
iframe HTML element so again it's used
to just insert content from an external
source in this case we're just going to
have external pages and this can be done
for advertisements or navigation menus
or images many different types of things
that you want to bring into your
existing web page and the benefit is you
don't have to reload your web page you
can just bring them in with the iframe
element you don't have to load a new web
page you don't have to even refresh your
web page that's the benefit now you can
see here we have our existing index that
we've been using and I've created a
couple other pages an HTML document
called first and an HTML document called
second and we're going to bring these
two HTML documents into our main index
page and as usual I've put all the code
for these HTML documents into the
description of this video
and let's just take a look at these
pages these are going to be very simple
the document called first just says the
initial page and then this document will
say the second page very very simple and
again we're going to bring these into
our main index page now again we use the
iframe element that's what we need to
use to accomplish that now the first
thing we want to do is set this frame
border attribute and it's either a 0 or
1 0 means it's off 1 means it's on we're
going to set this to a 1 and then we can
give it a width we use the width
attribute and let's set this to 200
pixels and then we want to give it a
height so let's set this as well to 200
pixels now you could put in percentages
here you could say 100 percent and 100
percent and then this would expand to
the width of the screen but we're not
going to do that now here is where we
specify whatever we want to pull in and
we'll come back to this in a minute
we're not going to put anything in here
for the moment now let's go ahead and
give this a name and we'll just call
this our iframe pretty simple and we
don't really need to worry about this
this is more for PHP and ASP we'll deal
with this in future series but we do
need to worry more about the ID and
we're just going to give it the same
name so we'll call this our iframe and
we'll talk about this in a minute so we
have this all set now what we're going
to do is we're actually going to put
some
in here and I want to show you how this
works so let's just put in some very
simple text and we're just going to say
do you see this and the reason I'm doing
this is I want to show you that this
content will not be displayed well very
likely will not be displayed if you do
see it it means your browser does not
recognize iframes but that's almost
impossible since almost every modern
browser supports iframes but anyways
that's why I'm putting this in here I
want to show you that the content we
pull in is from this source attribute
has to come through here if we put other
content outside the source attribute it
will not display and so that's what I
wanted to show you so let's go ahead and
save this and we will open up our web
page here and there you can see we have
no content here you can't see anything
you do not see this text if you do see
it it means somehow your browser does
not support iframes now you do see the
border here's the border that we made
and so you can see how that works if we
set this to zero you wouldn't even see
this border right now so let's go ahead
and close this out and now let's go
ahead and specify the content that we
want to bring in and we're just going to
specify our first dot HTML right here
this is what we're going to bring in
when we first load the page so let's go
ahead and save this well refresh this
and there you can see we brought in the
first dot HTML and so again that's how
that works so again this is the HTML
document we're first bringing into our
index.html but what about this second
dot HTML that I created well let's go
ahead and create an anchor link for that
now this anchor link will be a link down
here that we can click on that will load
the second dot HTML now of course we
need to put it outside of our I frame
element so that we can see it so let's
go ahead and do that and I'll just copy
and paste this in here because I've
already typed it out so here you can see
we have the anchor element now remember
this gives us the link here's the href
attribute and we're going to point to
our second HTML that's what's going to
get loaded now here's how this works we
use this target attribute and it points
back to our iframe right so because of
this target attribute this second dot
HTML will now be contained within our
iframe this is how it's done it's done
through this target so these two have to
match and then we just put some text in
here that says switch to new document so
let's go ahead and save this and we'll
refresh our page now and there you can
see we have our link now what I want you
notices when we hit this now we should
get our second HTML loaded into this
iframe but notice the webpage itself
does not refresh let's hit this and see
how that worked
no refreshed it's just instantaneous so
that is how I frames work oh I do want
to point out one thing you will want to
put all of these files in one folder you
can see I've called this folder 0 1 so
they all have to be contained inside
this same folder now if you decide to go
ahead and put these two documents
somewhere else
you just have to specify the path here
you have to actually give it a path but
if everything is contained within the
same folder that's the benefit we don't
have to put a path we can just specify
the name of the actual file ok I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
