along with global objects and again
those are objects that JavaScript
supplies for us and what does that mean
we can use that global objects methods
and properties so in this video we're
going to look at the math object so I've
created a variable here called number
and it's going to store a value of 4.7
so let's create a new variable to work
against this number so we'll call that
number new number and we'll create a new
value so we'll add 26 plus and here is
where we can use the math object and
actually we can just call the math
object by name so we'll say math and the
method that we're going to use is the
round method and we're going to round
our number variable which we declared up
here so what the round method does is it
will round it to the nearest integer
since 4.7 is closest to 5 it will round
it to 5 now if it was 4.4 it would round
it down to 4 so it's not going in any
particular direction I guess that's the
point I want to make it will round it to
the nearest closest integer which in
this case again is 5 so we should get an
output of 31 so let's go ahead and run
this and you can see we got 31 now let's
just set this to 4.3 or something and
you will see now it will round it down
to 4 and we should get an output of 30
so let's go ahead and run this again and
you can see we got 30 now what if you
wanted to go in one particular direction
let's say we wanted to round this up to
5 well we can use another method and
that is the ceiling method so we just
put in CEI el and now this should round
it up to 5 so let's go ahead and run
this again and you can see we got 31
which is what we expected because it
rounded it to 5 of course now let's set
this back to 4.7 and let's say now we
wanted to round this down to 4 we could
use the floor method and that wall is
round the number down so let's go ahead
and run this and we should get an output
of 30 and we did
now I want to show you the square root
method so let's go ahead and just get
rid of this variable and let's change
the value of our number variable so
let's actually specify our math object
again and we're going to call the square
root method which is sq RT now let's
pass in a value of 16 and so now as you
probably know the square root of 16 is 4
and hopefully that's the output we get
so let's go ahead and run this
oops note we need to actually set this
back to the old variable because we are
not using the new number variable
anymore and let's go ahead and run this
and you can see we got the expected
result of 4 ok so that's going to wrap
it up for this video in the next video
we'll look at another global object the
date object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
