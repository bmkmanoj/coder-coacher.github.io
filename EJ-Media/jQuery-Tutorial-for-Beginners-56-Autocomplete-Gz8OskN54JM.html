at the autocomplete widget that you can
use in jQuery now many modern websites
today put in suggestions when you begin
typing in a text box you've all seen
that so if you go to a website and you
go to a text box and you start typing in
something which will give you
suggestions that you can go ahead and
select and a lot of those websites are
actually using this very widget to do
that because it provides a very nice
drop-down which will give the user
choices to select and so that's what
we're gonna do again in this video now
you can see here I've in our sidebar
over here I've created a text box and I
just wrapped it around a div and I gave
that an ID of test we're gonna use the
same CSS that I used in the last video
by the way and all I did was just add
some margin ten pixels around the text
box so it's not crunched right against
the corner here and again I actually
used that in the last video for the form
and then of course I've added a little
label here for cities so we want the
user to put in the names of cities and
then of course when they do that we're
gonna give them suggestions of course we
don't have that done yet because we need
to add the jQuery and you can see right
here I've added a text box and you will
remember from the HTML videos we just
use the input element tag and then we
just define the type as text and that
gives us our nice text box now what we
want to do is go ahead and add the
jQuery but before we do that let's go
ahead and add an ID to our text box so
we can go ahead and grab this in our
jQuery code and we'll just call this
text box okay so let's go down to our
jQuery code now and we'll go ahead and
grab our ID really quickly here and then
the function that we call in jQuery is
auto-complete now in previous videos
that was all we needed right we just
needed the function but we actually have
to add the values that is what we want
displayed when the user starts typing in
various cities and to do that we use the
source property and of course we need
our squiggly lines and then we just type
in source then we need brackets and
inside these brackets is where we place
our values and we put these in quotes so
let's go ahead and specify Dallas that's
going to be our first city and then we
separate each value by a comma and let's
just go ahead and put in one more city
here that starts with a D and
go ahead and pick Detroit and let's go
ahead and put in one more city let's put
in New York okay so let's go ahead and
save this and let's see if it works
so we'll refresh our page over here and
let's type in D and there you can see we
get Dallas and Detroit
take a look at that and you can select
one of these now let's go ahead and type
in New York or an n there you see look
we get New York so that's how the
autocomplete works now you can go ahead
and put in a lot more cities if you want
to test this out but I think you get the
idea how this works okay I will see you
guys in the next video
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
