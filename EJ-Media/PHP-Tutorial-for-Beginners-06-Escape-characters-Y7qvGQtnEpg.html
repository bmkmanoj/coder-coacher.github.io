escaping characters now what can happen
here is let's say you want to put quotes
around the word you okay that's fine but
you see the problem here
PHP is going to interpret this as syntax
and think you are ending the string when
in fact you just want this to be a
character inside your main string so to
unconvince PHP we need to put a
backslash in front of both of the double
quotes that way PHP will only treat this
as just a character and not syntax but
before we do that let's send this output
to the browser and see what happens so
we'll click on our lesson dot PHP and
there you can see we got a parsing error
which was to be expected because PHP
doesn't know what you're trying to do
here it sees all of these double quotes
and doesn't know what's going on and it
even tells you hey the problem is in
line three and there's an unexpected
syntax error and so that's pretty good
error message it actually tells you
where the problem is so now what we need
to do is unconvenient of both of these
quotes so one right here and one right
here and you can see now the you changed
colors it's not bold anymore it's just
plain old text so this should work let's
go ahead and hit save let's hit refresh
and there you can see the quotes are now
rendered correctly in the browser and
they actually appear the way we wanted
them to appear so this technique
prevents PHP from ending your strings
too early by the way this would also
apply for single quotes if you had
single quotes here you would also need
to put in this backslash to unconfuse
PHP okay that's going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
