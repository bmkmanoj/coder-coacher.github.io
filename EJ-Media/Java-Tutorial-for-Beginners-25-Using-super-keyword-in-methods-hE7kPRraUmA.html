tutorial can you believe our number 25
well we just keep trucking along here in
today's tutorial we are going to discuss
the super keyword now there are two ways
to use the super keyword one is with
methods the other is with constructors
in today's example we're going to use a
super keyword with methods so I just
created a very simple program here to
show you how a super keyword works
because that's all we really need to do
to explore this concept and it's
actually a very simple concept but some
people try to make it a lot more
confusing than it really should be so in
this program we have a child class which
also could be called a sub class by the
way and we're going to inherit
everything from this base class which is
over here we're going to inherit the
methods and variables that we define
over here as you can see it's empty
right now it won't be in a little bit
but it is now and so this is our base
class which also can be called a
superclass whatever you want to call it
so let's go back to our child class and
we're just going to print out that this
was printed from child class this class
right here everything stays right in
here so let's go ahead and run that
great look at that it worked okay are
you guys surprised I'm not okay so let's
go ahead and copy and paste this over
into the base class and now the only
change we're going to make here is that
this was printed from the base class
let's go back here and you'll notice
we've got some intellisense here saying
yeah you just added a method with the
same name over here which one do I use
now we're not going to actually add the
override they want us to add well let's
go ahead and run this and you'll find
out which one gets printed out yep you
guessed it it's from the child class and
the reason is we are inheriting that
method of the same name from the base
class but this one right here gets
precedence now you're wondering well now
how on earth do I get to this print
something method in the base class and
use that one with the same name now okay
yeah I can go ahead and change the name
but what if you need to keep these the
same name I mean who knows maybe they're
doing something very similar and you
don't want to change a name because
you'll get confused that is where the
super keyword comes into
play so let's type that in right now and
we'll go down here and pull the method
and great there we go
now we don't need to print this out from
the child class anymore because we want
to go ahead and print out the method
from the base class now you could go
ahead and leave that if you want to but
we really don't want to do that because
we're trying to show how this concept
works perfectly so let's go ahead and
run this and look at that it printed it
out from here so all we said was hey I
want you to use this method right here
from our superclass which is base class
and another way to think of this it's
kind of a nice thing because hey you
know exactly where this is coming from
you may write you may come back to this
code like you know a year later and
wonder where is this coming from I
thought this was coming from here this
will unconvince a know you were using
this method from the superclass
so it's kind of like a reminder in a way
as well that's the way I like to think
of it okay so one final time I don't
want to beat a dead horse here we
basically use the super keyword to
override this method and go to the
superclass method and use this one here
to do our print all right so that's
going to do it for this tutorial I will
see you guys in the next tutorial where
we will explore the super keyword with
constructors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
