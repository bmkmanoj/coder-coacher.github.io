drop-down menu using bootstrap and this
is a very widely used piece of the
bootstrap functionality these drop-down
menus so again that's what we're going
to do in this video and the good thing
about this is once you learn how to set
these drop-down menus up once you learn
the basic structure it really then
becomes a question of just fine-tuning
what you want and we'll cover that as
well
so the first thing we need of course is
a div so let's go ahead and create that
and then what we want to specify is the
drop-down class and that is the main
class that you use for your drop-down
menu in bootstrap
then we want to go ahead and create our
button that we're going to use for our
drop-down menu so you'll remember we use
the button HTML element and we're going
to set the type of course to button then
of course we need to call the bootstrap
button class something we've been doing
quite a bit in the last few videos and
you will remember that is very simple it
is just BTN and let's go ahead and we'll
use the primary button for our drop-down
menu
now the next class we need to specify is
the drop-down toggle class so you just
specify drop-down toggle right here
exactly like that and that's really all
you need to do then what we need to do
is specify another attribute which is
called data toggle and you're just going
to set this to drop-down now let's go
ahead and we'll just put some standard
text in here so what we're going to do
is go ahead and just say choose a
selection and then of course we just
need to close our button out so there we
go now what we need to do is go ahead
and create the options that we're going
to use in our drop-down menu and what
we're going to do is go ahead and of
course we need to use the unordered list
the famous unordered list we've done
that in many previous HTML and CSS
videos so we're going to specify ul and
then we're going to call another
bootstrap class and that is called
drop-down menu so you need to put
another class in your UL as well just
remember that and again once you have
this basic structure you can just
continue to use this for whatever
dropdowns you want
you always have to first use the
drop-down class then you create your
button
then you finally use another bootstrap
class which is called drop-down menu so
it's really kind of a three-step process
I guess you want to look at it like that
okay so we go ahead and again the class
we call is drop-down menu and then
remember we have those roles those
bootstrap roles yes we have to use a
role again and the role we set this to
is menu that's all we have to do right
here and there you go that's yet we now
have everything we need for our basic
bootstrap menu and now let's just go
ahead and insert some allies in here
some li elements and these are just the
standard li elements we have used in the
past and of course we need an anchor tag
with that and an href we're not going to
actually put a link in here you can do
that for your own site if you wish so
we'll just use the hash tag that's all
we need there since we're not actually
putting a link but if you want to go
ahead and put a link in there you
certainly can and let's just say this is
going to be transportation methods so
we'll go ahead and provide our user the
option of selecting the car and then of
course we need to go ahead and close out
our anchor tag and we'll go ahead and
close the li out now okay and let's go
ahead and we'll just add a few more
options here so let's go ahead and we'll
give a few more transportation options
that the user can select and let's go
ahead and we'll make this one a bus how
about that and then we will add one more
option here and we'll make this an
airplanes we have three different
transportation options they can select
and then of course we need to go ahead
and close out our UL element and then we
need to go ahead and close out our div
which of course we started right up here
all right so let's go ahead and save
this up and let's go ahead and run this
and open it up in Chrome and let's see
what we get there we go we've got our
dropdown button and if we hit that look
at that we've got our three options now
isn't that formatted really nicely and
look we can select any one of those that
we want okay we will continue on with
the bootstrap drop down menu in the next
