about using the color replacement tool
right here and of course we painted a
new color over this flower that is one
way to do color replacement in Photoshop
but there is yet another way now what if
you didn't want to do all this painting
let's say you needed to very quickly
change the color of this entire flower
and you just didn't have time to do all
this painting maybe you needed to look
at several different colors really
quickly and you just didn't have time to
paint the whole flower well there is
another way to change the color of this
flower and again we can do it very very
quickly and we can use yet another tool
in Photoshop and the tool we're going to
use is the quick selection tool right
here so go ahead and select that and
what I want you to do then is select
this flower and you just kind of click
and drag around here you may need to
sort of mouse over some of the parts it
doesn't catch like right here so once
you have the flower selected you're
gonna go up to layer and then you're
gonna go to new adjustment layer and
then you're gonna select the Q
saturation option and then you're gonna
go ahead and of course name the layer
we'll just call it hue/saturation one
and you can see we have this black and
white remember we talked about masks and
you'll remember that everything that is
white is revealed and everything that is
black is hidden in other words the only
colour that we're gonna replace is our
selected flower right here so let's go
ahead and change the color here and see
how easy that is now you can change the
whole color very quickly see that now
you might notice that sometimes the
entire color of the flower isn't
replaced you can see that right here
some of these areas if you want the
entire color of the flower replaced you
want to select colorize so if you select
that then the entire color will be
replaced throughout the flower so you
can go ahead and play around with some
of those options now what we're gonna do
is go ahead and close this out and what
we're gonna do is go ahead and reselect
the flower so make sure you have the
quick selection tool selected again and
we're gonna go ahead and select the
flower yet again now what I want you to
do is right-click and hit select inverse
now we have the background selected
instead of the flower itself now now
what we're gonna do is go ahead and
create another adjustment layer and
we're gonna select the same option hue
and saturation and we're just going to
call that hue/saturation to
and now we can go ahead and switch the
background see that see how interesting
that is now now we can change the
background color quickly too as well and
so you can see how useful it is to use
the quick selection tool if you need to
change the color of the entire object
really quickly and then what you can do
is bounce around between both of these
layers now make sure that if we go back
to this first layer here make sure that
you instead of having the mask selected
make sure that you have the
hue/saturation box selected if you want
to change the color because if you're on
this mask it's not going to have the
hue/saturation color box so you just
need to make sure what you have selected
when you start switching from layer to
layer now here is where this gets really
cool let's say you need to compare three
or four different versions of this
flower but you want to keep this hue
that you've already picked well we can
go ahead and just duplicate this layer
so let's go ahead and do that and we'll
call this copy that's fine now we've got
an exact copy of this and now you can go
ahead and sort of switch the color and
then what you can do is come down here
and switch off the visibility if you
want to compare the different colors
that you've picked for this flower so
again using the quick selection tool is
very powerful if you want to change the
color of an object very quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
