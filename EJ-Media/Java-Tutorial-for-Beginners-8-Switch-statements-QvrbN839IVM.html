beginning Java in the last tutorial we
dealt with if-else statements and those
are good for situations when you only
have two possible conditions such as a
true/false situation but there are going
to be instances where you'll be testing
multiple conditions and you could use if
and else statements to accomplish that
but you'd have to do
you'd have to chain those to handle all
the different conditions and that's just
not the best practice so the best way to
accomplish that is to use the switch
statement and we'll get into that right
now
so let's create our variable so we're
going to do an int we're going to name
this field goal and we're going to say
field goal equals 3 so now let's kick
off the switch statement and you do that
by just typing switch and then open
parentheses and the variable we're going
to be testing against here will be field
goal so we're going to put that in here
and after that we will type in a curly
brace and actually we can give our
you'll need quite a bit of space here
because we're going to put in all of our
statements here and the good thing about
this is you don't have to use any more
curly braces that's it everything goes
within these curly braces for the switch
statement the switch statement uses
something called case statements and
those are used to test the variable in
the switch statement against the
specific values so instead of having to
type out a bunch of if statements you
can just use these things called case
statements and each one of these go in
the block statement these squiggly
braces here the switch block statement
so type in case and then put a 6 in
followed by a full cone yes not a
semicolon a full colon now what this is
doing here is we gave the case its own
value of 6 and this is going to be
tested against the switch
statement value field goal which of
course is three so let's create some
output for this case in case they match
now we know it will not but in case it
did hit this we will do a system let's
actually put that on another line system
dot out dot print and say this is a
touchdown we'll follow that by a break
now what a break does is if field goal
equals six then we can just exit out of
the program at this point and end it it
matched and it's over at that point if
it does not match then it moves on to
the next case okay so let's create some
more cases here within our switch block
of statements and we'll give this a
value of two and say this is a safety
and let's just do a few more here and
we'll say this is a case it's actually
aligned this a little bit better we'll
say this is we'll assign this a value of
three say this is a field goal and will
create one more case and give this some
arbitrarily really high number 3000 and
say this is an impossible score so what
this is going to do in this block of
statements is come down and check each
of these values and when it matches one
it'll break and exit the program at that
point and so let's go ahead and run this
and we get this as a field goal because
it matched on this case this value of
three matched the switches value which
is also three and then it printed this
out and you'll notice that it brought it
broke after this and it did not even
have to do a compare against this final
arbitrarily high number now you might
ask what happens when
and none of the case statements match
the value in the switches variable and
in that case we will have to create
another parameter called default follow
that by a full colon and we're going to
do a system dot out dot print and we
will write here nothing matches at all
you lose and we will also follow that by
a break because we are going to exit out
of the program at that point let's close
the output window here and let's go
ahead and change this three because
obviously we'll hit this case and it'll
break so and we don't want that to
happen so let's just put another really
high number here crazy well no not
letters I was getting a little out of
control there okay so now let's go ahead
and run this program and it should hit
the default here and say nothing matches
at all you lose so let's go ahead and
run this and very quickly we got nothing
matches at all you lose so to summarize
this one more time again we're creating
a variable here called field goal it's
three we created our switch statement
here and put in the variable and the
value of that head of three then we
created all these cases to test to see
whether that cases value matches the
switches value and in this case it did
not so it moved on we went to this case
and that value is two it did not and
this in this case it did it would match
because we just got rid of all those
zeros and the program would exit so
that's pretty much it for switch
statements and I will see you guys in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
