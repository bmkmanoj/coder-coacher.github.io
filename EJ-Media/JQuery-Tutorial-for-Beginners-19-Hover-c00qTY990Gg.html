hover method and of course that will
allow us to do some things when we hover
over an element and when we hover off of
it now the hover method actually takes
two functions and we'll get to that in a
little bit and the reason for that is we
need two separate lines of code one code
when we hover on and then one set of
code when we hover off you can't be in
both of those states at the same time so
that's why we need two different
functions and that's why the hover
method again takes two functions so what
element are we going to target with our
Hoover let's go ahead with our favorite
section right here so we'll put in pound
write and then let's go ahead and we're
gonna target all of the divs this is
kind of interesting so when we hover
over this write section here all the
rest of the divs will be affected kind
of interesting huh and let's go ahead
and we'll use the CSS method so I've got
the code typed out I'm just gonna copy
and paste it in here so this first
function covers the over and then the
second function which we're about to add
is the spot for when we hover off so
think of these as placeholders almost
the first function in the hover method
will always be for when you're hovering
over the element and the second function
will always cover so when we hover over
it we want the background colors of all
of our divs because we're selecting all
the divs here to turn yellow and it will
only occur by the way when we hover over
this right section that's it so you can
see how that works all right so now we
need to add another function something
we haven't really done yet and the way
we do that is we got to close this
function and of course we do that with a
squiggly bracket and then we use a comma
that will actually separate the two
functions so let's go ahead and copy
this function now because we can reuse
it now we're only going to copy it up to
here because we've already got our
closing bracket right here so let's go
ahead and just copy and paste this in
let's clean this up a little bit and
let's do something a little bit
different for when we hover off so we'll
change the color to gray about that
so remember this first function covers
the hover on and in this spot this
function covers the hover off that's the
way it works so again the hover method
accepts two functions and let's actually
put some comments in here so we'll say
hover over and then we'll put this here
and this and we'll say this is for the
over off or better yet let's be a little
bit more descriptive will say not hold
on whoops okay so let's go ahead and
save this let's go ahead and close a
page out and we'll just refresh our page
here load this back up and let's see if
this works
and it does now notice I'm hovering over
it now so this gets activated right our
first function but as soon as I hover it
off of it look this second function gets
activated because we're not hovered over
this anymore and it turns to gray so see
how that works so just remember we
attach the hover method to this right
section over here so this is the one
that's getting affected if we hover over
these other sections it's not going to
trigger because we only have this right
section selected so that's the only one
that affects the hover on and off and
then we said hey every div will be
affected when we hover on and off of
this right section as you know when we
hover over we get a yellow and when we
hover off we get a gray now you can add
other methods any method you want to
this you can do this hover on and off
with any method and we'll do that in the
next video we'll actually use some
different methods to associate with the
hover method see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
