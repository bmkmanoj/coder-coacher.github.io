chaining methods now if we take a look
at this code here that I have in the
comment section you can see here we're
using the CSS method which we talked
about in the last few videos and the
fade-out method we'll talk about that in
a little bit I'm gonna introduce that in
this video as well but what we're really
interested in is chaining methods and if
you take a look at this code here you'll
notice that we're using the same
selector so does it really make sense to
type these three lines out when we can
just chain all the methods these methods
right here off of our one selector
that's what we can do now you can do it
this way if you prefer this way you like
this way it makes sense to you you can
certainly write them out individually
but you can also change back so that's
what we're gonna do in this lecture so
the first thing we're gonna do is go
ahead and copy this first line and we're
gonna put this right here and instead of
using a semicolon now because this is
all gonna be part of the same line we
just use a dot because we're gonna be
again chaining all the methods off of
our object our selector object right
here so let's go ahead and grab this
second method and we'll just go ahead
and copy and paste this and then we'll
grab this third one here now we need the
semicolon to end the line so we'll copy
that this time and we'll go ahead and
whoops we got an extra dot there so
again this line of code does exactly
what this does they are the same thing
the only difference is a little bit
easier to write up because we only have
to write this selector one time so let's
go ahead and save this and we'll go
ahead and run this in chrome and
actually let's go ahead and minimize
this so we can have both of these lined
up against each other and we'll hit this
but in a second now this fade-out method
will actually fade out this entire div
because of course we're selecting this
first did with this pound left so that's
what this fade-out does it basically
just fades out whatever you want to fade
out in this case we're fading out the
div you could also fade out the text you
could fade out any element that you want
to fade out and this is milliseconds so
if you increase this number let's say
you made this 50
milliseconds this would fade out slower
so that's what this value does so let's
go ahead and hit this and there you can
see it fade it out and if you notice the
color actually did change to red and the
border changed to blue so let's go ahead
and refresh the page we'll do it one
more time so keep an eye on the text
keep an eye on the border and there you
can see it did everything we wanted so
again that is what chaining methods is
all about okay that is going to do it
for this video I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
