about adding rows columns and grids
using bootstrap and of course we've
created this nice grid and we've added
several columns and we've learned how to
rearrange the sizes of these and several
other things in this video we're gonna
add another row so let's go ahead and do
that now we have these previous columns
that we used right here so let's go
ahead and uncomment this out and what
we're gonna do is add another row so we
can just go ahead and copy and paste
this right down here so now we need to
close this out right here so let's go
ahead and do that and now we've closed
this row out right here this is all
self-contained okay so now what we want
to do is we want actually four columns
so let's go ahead and just copy and
paste this last column here column six
because we want seven columns now four
columns in our second row so we'll just
go ahead and copy and paste this here
and let's make this seven and seven good
we're moving right along now let's go
ahead and switch over to our style sheet
and we'll need to create a new rule set
for our column seven and we'll go ahead
and do that and let's make this seven
and let's make the color of this beige
make this beige so let's go ahead and
save this let's flip back to our
index.html and let's go ahead and make
each one of these columns in our second
row size three we'll make this a size
three now you can play around with the
different sizes that you want you may
only want two or three of these but one
thing you'll notice is these will
display differently depending on the
size that you pick so you have to play
around with them to get them to fit
accordingly in this case I had to play
around with these and turned out that
size three fit perfectly but like I said
you have to play around these a little
bit yourself to get the exact size and
arrangement you want so let's go ahead
and save this let's go ahead and load
this up and there you can see look at
that that looks really nice we have now
a second row all of these fit perfectly
and we can display whatever type of data
we want and that's the nice thing about
bootstrap you can add as many rows as
many different sized columns as you want
and you can do it very easily and you
can see we just did that in about
minute didn't take long so that's really
the nice thing about bootstrap once you
have everything set up it's really easy
to go ahead and add more rows more
columns whatever you need for your
webpage okay we'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
