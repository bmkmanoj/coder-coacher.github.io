beginning HTML this is gonna be a quick
tutorial I just wanted to talk about
nested elements and what nested elements
are is putting an element inside another
element it's that simple now the only
element that is not inside another
element is the HTML element and that is
called the root element but then we
would say that the head element and the
body element are both nested inside the
HTML root element and within the head
element and body element you can
obviously put other elements inside
those elements so the P element here is
nested inside the body element and we
would call this the child element and
the body element the parent element so
the body element is the parent element
and the P element is the child of the
body element that's how that works so
it's always good to put the starting and
closing tag inside the parent element so
what we don't want to do is like start a
closing tag here and then put the
closing P tag outside the closing body
tag that's called a mismatched element
and that is not a good idea you'll start
to encounter a lot of problems if you do
that so just remember that always keep
the elements nested inside each other
and keep in mind that parent-child
relationship okay as I said this was
gonna be a short video that's it I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
