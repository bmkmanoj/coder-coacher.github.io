innerhtml property and we were able to
completely replace the text on our
webpage in this video we're going to
change an image using javascript and
we're going to use the source property
and of course in JavaScript it's SR C
that's what we use to specify in our
JavaScript and again it's a property
just like innerhtml
so let's pull up the code now you can
see here we're using the same button as
we always have the only difference is
I've added an image now that we're going
to change I just wanted to keep this up
we use this some of this code from the
last video this paragraph element and I
just wanted to point out to you that the
inner HTML of course was a property that
worked against the content inside our
paragraph element the source property
works against the source attribute in
the IMG tag and that will allow us to
change this JPEG image to a different
image so we don't need this anymore I
just wanted to use this to make that
point so what we're going to do again is
when we hit this button we want this
initial image of Stalin to change to an
image of Lenin so again the source
property just works against the source
attribute and we've seen this many times
when we've used images and of course the
source attribute is part of the IMG tag
now I want to pull up the folder that
I'm using really quickly you can use any
image you want I'm using these images of
Lenin and Stalin if you go to Wikipedia
if you want to use these exact images
you can go to Wikipedia and search on
Lenin and search on Stalin and you'll
find these at the front of the webpage
but again you want to place these images
in your web folder that's what I'm doing
here also make sure that you're using
the right extension so if you're using a
jpg you need jpg but if it's a jiff you
need to make sure you put gif here if
it's PNG you need to make sure you put
PNG here and the way you can tell is you
can just click on this and it says jpg
right here and trust me that's throwing
me off many times so again copy both of
the images your two images to the web
folder that will be executing this code
out of okay so this is all good to go
we've got our source attribute pointing
to our stalin image that's the first
image that we'll get loaded on our web
page and we've created an ID we're using
an ID here with the
of image and so what does that mean
we're going to be using to get element
by ID method to grab this first so let's
switch over to the JavaScript code and
here you can see again we're using the
get element by ID method of course
that's going to grab our ID of image and
then of course we get to use the source
property which belongs to the document
object right and what we can do is just
flip that to lenin jbg it's actually
very simple so we're just specifying SRC
and then we're pointing to our new image
so let's go ahead and run this and we'll
see what we get here and if we hit the
Change button there you can see we've
got our new image so that's how you
change an image you have to go against
the source attribute and again you need
to use the source property which of
course is part of the document object
model so let's flip back to our outline
really quick so we just completed how to
change an image now these three subjects
right here we're actually going to hold
off on because we're going to start
looking at events so we'll come back to
these subjects and later videos but like
I said we want to start on the topic of
events and there are several different
types of events so in the next video
we're going to talk about the onclick
event
yes we've been doing that in the last
several videos so this should be very
familiar to you and we're not only going
to talk about the onclick event again
we're going to talk about what events do
and the different types of events and
there are many other events will be
covering over the next several videos
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
