major components of Linux and how it
comprises three layers the users face
the kernel and the hardware and we
talked about how the kernel is the core
of the Linux operating system and its
main responsibility is to handle
processes in this video we're gonna talk
about the shell because it's one of the
most important programs in Linux the
shell is basically your interface to the
Linux kernel and as I mentioned in the
last video it resides in this top layer
in the user space so again what is the
shell well when we talk about the shell
we are really talking about the command
line they are one and the same and what
is the shell it's a program that
basically will take your keyboard
commands and pass them on to the kernel
where they will be executed that's all
it really does it's your way to
interface to the kernel and when Linux
is started up the shell is also started
up as well if there's a problem with the
shell Linux is probably not going to
start now how do you interact with a
shelf well usually you interact with the
shell with a terminal emulator and we're
gonna fire that up in a minute to issue
our first commands to the kernel now
before we get started you can use any
version of Linux that you want these
commands and concepts are all the same
throughout the different Linux
distributions now if you do not have a
version of Linux installed that's okay
because I've made some videos how to
install Ubuntu Linux and I will put the
links to those videos in the description
of this video so what I want you to do
is go ahead and launch your terminal
emulator and you can see here I've
already got it open now when you first
fire up the terminal emulator you're
going to get a prompt that looks
something like this this is the shell
prompt and this is very similar to the
command prompt in Windows if you've used
that before now the shell prompt can
look different depending on the version
of Linux you have but it's basically the
same concept across the different Linux
distributions so what you'll get again
is the shell prompt now the first part
of this prompt is the user that you're
logged in as and you can see here I'm
logged in as Ernie that's the user and
I'm logged in as a normal user now if
you were logged in as root and you can
see right here at the top it says to run
a command as administrator user root so
if I was logged in as
it would say root at Ernie - VirtualBox
but I'm logged in just as a normal user
and the normal user is earning and that
has less permissions and rights than the
root user and usually when you log into
Linux you will come in as a normal user
unless you have a very specific reason
to go in as root and we'll talk about
the different users in Linux and later
videos so again I'm logged in as Ernie
and again I'm logged in as a normal user
now after the user name comes the Linux
machine that you are connected to and in
this case it's local and it's earning -
VirtualBox now it's possible you could
be remoting into another machine and if
that was the case it would show that
machine right here but again this is
local so it shows my local VirtualBox
name now depending on the linux version
that you have you may see a tilde sign
right here and that represents the home
directory and we'll actually talk about
this in the next video and then the
final thing is the dollar sign and this
always comes at the end of the prompt
the dollar sign means that we are logged
in as a normal user that is the account
we are using now if you are logged in as
an administrator you would likely see a
hash sign here rather than the dollar
sign but again we're not logged in as
the root user so that is why we see the
dollar sign so we're ready to issue our
very first command so what I want you to
type in is LS and this basically will
list the contents of the current
directory that we're in so go ahead and
type in LS and you can see the results
now depending on the Linux version that
you have some of the folders will be
color coded now the ones in blue are
directories now in Linux they call these
directories in Microsoft they call them
folders but they are one in the same so
we're gonna go ahead and stick with the
proper lingo and we're gonna call them
directories so you can see here we've
got a desktop directory we've got a
downloads directory we've got a music
directory and on and on and in white
we've actually got a file that is called
examples dot desktop now if you want a
long view of this you can type in LS - L
and go ahead and hit enter and you can
see we've got quite a bit of information
I actually prefer this view but some
people prefer the condensed view so
again here we're issuing some of our
very first commands the LS command is
one of the most widely used commands and
so get used to it we're gonna be using
it a lot throughout this series now I do
want to point out that these commands
are case sensitive so for instance if we
put a capital L here and a lowercase s
it's not going to be recognized and
you'll get this message command not file
so just keep that in mind
these commands are case sensitive now in
order to list all of the options for the
LS command you can type in something
before each command and that is man that
actually stands for manual and then you
type in the particular command that you
want to pull up the manual for and in
this case we're gonna hit LS and this is
very important because this will give
you all of the options for that
particular command so if we hit enter
here you can see here we're pulling up
the manual and it's going to give us all
of the options now to scroll through the
pages you simply hit spacebar and we can
go all the way to the end here once you
get to the end you can just press Q to
quit and it takes us back to the shell
prompt now let's say you wanted to clear
the screen you simply type in the clear
command and everything is cleared and to
exit the terminal you just type in exit
and the terminal is now closed okay
that's gonna do it for this lecture in
the next lecture we're gonna talk about
directories in Linux and we're gonna
issue more commands see you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
