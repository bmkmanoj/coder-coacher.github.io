troubleshooting in bootstrap with the
grid that we worked on earlier and
basically I'm doing this video because a
subscriber emailed me and indicated she
was having a problem with the grid and
she wanted a little bit of help so I
said I would do a video on this issue
because it is an issue that does prop up
from time to time and let's go ahead and
just load the grid up real quick here
and what she did was she put in h2
heading in this main column and it added
margin to it and this is sort of a weird
issue that can prop up in bootstrap and
it's actually not an issue with
bootstrap
it's an issue with CSS and actually it's
working as designed it involves this
situation called Reverse margins and
that's pretty complicated I don't want
to get into that right now
but I just want to show you what she did
and how we can fix it in case you run
into it as well so let's go ahead and
close this out and let's go ahead into
our main column here what we're going to
do is just go ahead and add an h2
element and we'll just right in here
main element and then let's just go
ahead and copy and paste this and then
we'll just go ahead and close this out
all right so let's save this and let's
make sure we can recreate this situation
and there you can see it shifted
downwards so how to fix this there are
two ways you can fix this and I will
show you both of them in this video now
maybe you want that maybe you want that
margin at it and that's fine if you want
to keep it like that maybe maybe that's
something you're looking for but if
you're not then there's a couple ways to
snap that back into place now one thing
we can do is use this nbsp right here
and if you followed my HTML series you
will remember that that allows you
basically to create multiple spaces and
so what we want to do is put this right
before the offending element which in
this case is the h2 element so I'm just
going to copy and paste that right there
and so let's go ahead and save this and
you'll see that everything is snapped
back into place and it is look at that
this section now is back up where it's
supposed to be now there is another way
to snap this element back into place and
I'm going to show you that now so let's
go ahead and get rid of this and let's
head over to our style sheet you'll
notice that to each one of our columns
we added three pixels so what you want
to do
- is go ahead and add the same amount of
margin to whatever element is causing
the issue so let's go ahead and just
copy and paste this here and we're just
going to put h2 right here and let's
just get rid of these three rules we
don't need them and so we're going to
add again the same amount of margin and
that should snap everything back into
place let's go ahead and run this and
there you can see take a look at that it
worked so that's how you snap these
sections back into place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
