we're going to be looking at this option
right here edit pass-by nodes but before
we can use that tool we actually have to
create an object so let's go ahead and
use the circle tool it doesn't matter
what object you use so let's go ahead
and create our circle and then we want
to go ahead and select that and then go
up to path and hit object path then go
select the Edit path by nose tool and
you'll see we have all these new options
up here and we'll take a look at some of
these right now now the area between
these two nodes is called a segment and
if you want to see the path outline of
this circle object you can select this
tool up here show path outline but let's
actually change the color of this circle
to black so it stands out and there you
can see the path outline around the
circle and to turn it off you just
select it again now Reece elect the show
Bezier handles of selected nodes and if
you go over to the edge of the circle
you'll get a hand if that once and now
you see we get these new nodes here and
you will also notice that these two
nodes here are highlighted so we have
this segment selected so if we go ahead
and drag this you'll see that we're just
affecting that segment so let's undo
that now to select multiple segments you
just hit the shift key go over here and
get the hand again and you can see now
we've got this segment and this segment
now selected now to insert an individual
node you can just highlight a particular
area and you get the hand here and then
if you just double click you'll get that
node and of course each one of these
nodes can be selected and moved as well
so before we move the segment and now
we're just moving the individual node
now it can also move the cursor outside
the circle and select specific nodes
that we want doing this so you can see
just these two nodes were selected or we
could just go down here and select that
node so that's a quick way of selecting
nodes as well and as always if you hit
the shift key you can deselect and
select nodes that you want now if you
hold down the control button and
highlight the node and single click
you'll see that we're changing the node
type so that's how you do that
now in the next tutorial I'm going to
show you each one of these options up
here but that's for another tutorial so
I will see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
