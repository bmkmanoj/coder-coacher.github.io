tutorial and this is the second part
we're doing on static variables and I
promise this will not be as long as the
last video we did on static this is just
kind of an extension on static now if
you remember in the last video we were
incrementing this user name count static
variable from our constructor well I've
removed everything out of that
constructor and now it's just back to a
default constructor and the point I want
to make in this video is that we can
also increment this from our objects
over here and you might ask well how is
that the case and well you'll hear
people out there and some of these other
videos say objects all share the static
variable
well that's true in a way and what
happens is remember in the last video I
said that the registration class is
loaded out there by the class loader the
class loader then looks for static
keywords and loads each one of these out
into the memory
now what happens specifically with that
is he makes a copy of this a one-time
copy only and copies it out into this
shared memory where it's ready to go I
think I called it the runtime memory but
you can also think of it as a shared
memory and then it just sits there for
good that copy just sits there for good
and then as we request objects to be
made from our registration class those
all go into this other type of memory
but basically since that static variable
is just sitting out there and shared
memory each object that gets created
down the line can see him and they can
actually alter his value too as well and
the class can see it as well so if we go
down here and we go down here and type
in a registration dot and there you can
see we can see our static variables now
since we've created our new user one
object off our registration class let's
see if the new user one can see it
and that's actually a bug in NetBeans
and we're actually going to have to hard
code the static variable in over here so
that's a bug in NetBeans where they
can't see it but the objects trust me
they can go ahead and reference the
static variable and as I just said the
class also which is also loaded out
there
the class loader loads the registration
class out into memory too so you can
also see it too because remember that
static variable is in shared memory so
that means we can go ahead and alter
that static variable from the objects as
well so let's go ahead and do that let's
go ahead and do that and so what's going
to happen here is new user one is going
to increment our static variable and
we're yeah it's giving us this little
warning message saying hey by the way
you're accessing static field username
count just to let you know it's a static
variable good we don't care now if you
remember in the previous video we were
incrementing this in the constructor now
all we're doing is we're waiting until
the object is created and then we're
going to increment and so it's
essentially doing the same thing just in
a different way so let's go ahead and
run this and you can see we got one and
so let's go ahead and create a new
object now in fact let's just copy and
paste all this because we're going to
need it at all and we'll just go ahead
down here and we'll just make this two
and two and two and we'll run it and
look at that we got two and so this
again is doing the same thing no
different really
then then putting it in this constructor
the only difference is this is a real
pain to type all this out so that's why
it's actually easier to use the
constructor I'm just showing you it's
kind of like you know it's kind of like
the same thing as having to type out
those variables remember we had to do
that and it's much easier putting them
in the constructor so same kind of
notion there now you can also reset the
static variable remember even though the
static variable is out there and if you
remember in the last video I was telling
you that the state doesn't change what I
mean by state is that memory is
allocated he's just sitting out there
that does really change but the state
always changes on objects as they come
and go because the memory gets allocated
and then it's deleted by the garbage
collector well we can go ahead and reset
that static variable so let's do that
let's go ahead and do the same thing by
another object we'll say okay now we
want to go ahead and actually reset that
so we'll make this object new user 3 new
user 3 new user 3 now instead of using
the incremental operator will say this
equals
zero so keep in mind that if we create
new objects we're starting over again so
always keep that in mind if you're going
to play around with a static variable
like that it's for good okay so let's go
ahead and run this and there you can see
this guy went ahead and reset it to zero
now we could also have the class do this
so let's go ahead and put in
registration and we'll go ahead and copy
and paste this into each one of these
now and let's just go ahead and get rid
of all of our objects we don't need them
anymore because remember the static
variable is not tied to the objects he's
out there by himself and we'll hit
registration everywhere here and let's
run this and we will get the same exact
result so as you can see there's two
different ways we can go ahead and
reference that static variable okay I
think we've talked about static quite a
bit here and we will move on to another
tutorial talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
