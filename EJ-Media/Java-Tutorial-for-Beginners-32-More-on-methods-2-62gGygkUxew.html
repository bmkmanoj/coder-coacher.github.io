today we're going to talk about methods
again so this will be part two of our
method series I think part one was a few
episodes ago and this might actually
just serve as a review session but I
wanted to point out some more uh
idiosyncrasies with methods that you
might not be aware of now first again
you probably already noticed by now but
this is the calling method and calling
methods always send arguments to the
receiving method okay
and that's the fancy term it will call
it an argument so if you ran into some
guy with you know a nerd pack on and you
said hey I'm passing a value if you
might say actually you're passing an
argument but that's just a fancy way of
saying hey I'm passing a value so again
just be aware of that this is an actual
argument technically that's getting
passed to this receiving method and this
is technically called a parameter but
you know a lot of people think of this
more as a placeholder right it's
receiving the value and it's a place
where the values held in we've called
that in fact I've called that a
placeholder in previous tutorials but in
reality it is a local variable this is
actually a local variable guys and if
you want to call it a parameter that's
fine but it's actually a local variable
and if you put a parameter here or a
local variable or a place holder
whatever you want to call it this method
now must receive something so always
keep that in mind when you populate this
we have to populate it with something
otherwise we're going to run into
telecentres
and you'll notice once we declare the
variable up here in these parentheses we
can now use it down here now you'll see
this trees too right here where we
declared the variable here and assign
the value so this is different from
trees because trees we have the value
passed into the local variable right
here here we actually declared it and
assigned a value so we did not put this
one in the parentheses so just to make
that distinction and of course we know
by now if you use the avoid keyword this
does not return a value to the calling
method down here right it will not
return a value it'll just go ahead and
do this system dot out dot print and
when it hits this curly bracket here
it'll exit and that's it nothing comes
back to the calling method and that's
basically what a return value means it
returns it to the calling method if it's
void it doesn't go back
now here's a little bit more when we
pass this value to this method up here
we do not actually change this value I
want I want you guys to be aware of that
so when it comes and it gets passed in
up here there's a little bit of magic
that occurs before this value gets to
the receiving method and what happens is
Java actually makes a copy of this so if
we came over here and there's a box over
here it actually would make a copy of
the value seven and then pass it into
this number trees method so this
original value is never affected that
stays at seven and then the copy that
goes on from here gets passed into this
method over here and then that's when we
work against this local variables value
which is now seven so let's go ahead and
run this and we get a twelve so it
happened again is we made a copy of this
seven it then got passed into our
receiving method and it was set to seven
and then we said hey this local variable
trees equals itself plus one which was
eight and then we declared an assigned
of value to this local variable trees
too and said hey that equals four and
then when we did a print we added the
two together and therefore we got twelve
and let's go ahead and close out of this
and then of course down here we did a
system dot out dot print a little bit
different here we said hey we're going
to call this return number method and of
course we know now that this is a return
method because we because first we
didn't use the void keyword and we used
int here so this has to return an int so
what happens is we pass the value of
fifty-five into this into X which again
is a local variable it came down here
and added one to it which made it 56 and
then we said return it back to the
calling method and then this prints out
the value so this actually is returned
to the calling method and the key point
here is when you declare a method is
going to return something
the datatype of the value that comes in
here has to match the datatype that's
being returned here these two have to
match otherwise you're going to have
problems the main point here is that I
guess I'm trying to stress is there's
all these different idiosyncrasies
sometimes five or six type of
idiosyncrasies for a particular concept
so like you know this is complete called
a parameter you could call it a local
variable we could call it a
older people refer to these things
differently and so just keep aware of
that and I'll try to point some of them
out to you so that when you hear them
and people are calling them different
names you'll be able to sort that out
because that confused me for a while -
people say well that's an argument like
well wait a minute I thought I'm just
passing the value down here I didn't
know there's an argument well it is
technically so anyways I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
