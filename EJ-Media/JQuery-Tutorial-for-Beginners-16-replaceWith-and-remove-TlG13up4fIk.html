the replace width method and the remove
method but first let's take a look at
the replace with method and here you can
see it just make sure you make this W a
capital and that's pretty much it
replace with notice we're submitting
HTML here HTML tags we're gonna replace
all of the paragraphs with new
paragraphs that say new text everywhere
so all these paragraphs should be
replaced with new paragraphs that will
say new text everywhere and so let's go
ahead and hit our button and there you
can see we now have new paragraphs with
our new text now let's go ahead and
refresh our page back to its normal
state and let's just replace the
paragraph in our third section here so
we'll say pound right and we'll put some
different text in here we'll say you
just clicked a button and that's
actually a common way this method is
used it's used to give a new message
once the user does something on your
webpage and you can also do things like
replace messages so let's say you put up
a new message and then something else
happened and this gets into event
handling but something else happened you
can replace it with a new message if the
user does something so that's really
what this replace method is for and
we'll deal with this in future videos
when we get to more advanced topics with
jQuery so let's go ahead and say this
will refresh our page again let's hit
our button and there you can see we got
our new paragraph that tells a user that
they just hit the button good okay so
let's take a look at the remove method
and that is exactly what you think it
does it just removes specific tags that
we want to take out of our webpage and
we don't actually have to put any
arguments in here so we can just clear
everything out of here and that's it
we're just calling the remove method and
in this case we're just going to remove
the entire section our right section
right here so let's go ahead and save
this well refresh the page and there you
can see the section is gone this is
useful if you want the user perhaps to
remove sections that they don't want to
see so let's say you had some ads up
here or something and you wanted to give
them the option to remove that ad this
is a useful method to go ahead and use
now we could remove all the sections on
this page and let's do that so so we'll
select all
the dip so this should totally empty out
our entire webpage so we'll go ahead and
refresh our page we hit our button and
everything's gone including our button
so that is how they replace with and
remove methods work I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
