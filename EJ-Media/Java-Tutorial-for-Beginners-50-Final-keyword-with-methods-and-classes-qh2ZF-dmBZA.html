the final keyword and using that with
variables in this video we're going to
talk about using the final keyword with
methods and classes and essentially the
concept is the same and it's a very
simple concept it involves something
that you do not want to change and so
you can use the final keyword to lock
down a method or a class in the same way
you can do that to a variable so what I
did here is I just set up a class called
address that returns an address and then
I extended off of address to create
another class called another address
which gives us yet a different address
and so what we're doing of course is
we're doing an override here we've got a
method called get address and we got
another method up here in our superclass
called get address so in our subclass
we're going to override that and put in
some new code and that is how the final
keyword relates to methods and classes
it involves inheritance and so you are
blocking inheritance so what we're
basically saying is you cannot override
this method down in the subclass so
let's go up into our superclass and
let's stick the final keyword in front
of this and you'll notice now we get
intellisense that says cannot override
get address because the method in the
superclass is now final so I have
basically said the code up in here is
rock-solid
it cannot be redone down in this class
so this method now is basically invalid
now if I put a 1 on the end of this it's
unique and then the intellisense goes
away because this is again a unique
method now the same applies to classes
so let's actually get rid of the final
keyword here and then we can go ahead
and get rid of the 1 and now we can go
ahead and override and inherit this
method now let's stick the final keyword
in front of our superclass and you'll
notice now we can't inherit from the
address superclass this subclass is no
longer legal and that's exactly what the
intellisense tells us we are now
blocking anybody from extending off of
our superclass so the class is basically
by itself
there is no inheritance hierarchy now
one of the main reasons is that because
this class might do a very specific
function that doesn't need to be
repeated or doesn't need to be extended
upon so the class and Method do
something that you really don't need
additional functionality to so you can
put the final key word in front of it
and actually a lot of the classes that
Java provides you will notice that they
have the final key word in front of them
now the other reason is for performance
and that is because using the final key
word gives you a slight boost in terms
of performance at runtime and the reason
is think about it for a second if at
runtime only this class has to be
executed and it doesn't have to go
through an inheritance hierarchy and
resolve all this obviously this is going
to move a little bit faster and so
that's one of the reasons as well okay
that's going to do it for this video in
the next video we're going to start
getting into some more advanced topics
we're going to start talking about
collections as well as generics see you
guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
