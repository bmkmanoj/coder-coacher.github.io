we're going to look at the area of
memory known as the heap now the full
name is the garbage collectible heap but
we're just going to call it the heat now
every time you create an object no
matter what it always is put in the heap
and so if you create a hundred instances
of your class they will all end up on
the heap where they will do whatever
work it is they have to do now the good
thing is Java manages all that memory
allocation for you you really don't have
to do a thing but you still need to have
a working understanding of how the
garbage collector works because
eventually we'll get into processes and
so it's critical to know how the heap
works and also in terms of the life and
death of objects on the heap that is
when an object is no longer being used
it is purged from the heap and that
frees up space so that it can be reused
by later objects and so let's take a
look at it right here and some of this
code that I've created
so I created a class called you guessed
it garbage now there's the heap right
out there and let's go ahead and create
our first object from this class now
keep in mind since we haven't created
any objects yet there's nothing on the
heap so the heap is empty so let's go
ahead and create our new object and
we'll just call this obj one
and there you see our obj1 is created on
the heap and let's just go ahead and
create another object and there you see
we have obj two on the heap as well now
you will remember in episode 30 I talked
about object reference variables and
remember I said that this is the object
reference variable and this refers to
the object on the heap that is it refers
to the memory of where the object is
located that's the value now what we say
here is that we have two active
references this object variable
reference refers to to this object and
obj 2 refers to this object on the
memory so we have two active references
that are pointing to objects on the heap
and we would also say that we have two
reachable objects because both are
reachable because both are being
referenced now what happens if we change
some values here let's go ahead and
assign the value of obj two to obj one
so let's go ahead and say obj one now
equals obj two now what's happened is
this object right here is no longer
being referenced both of these two
object reference variables are now
pointing to this object in the memory so
we would say now that we still have two
active references but we only now have
one reachable object and we have one
abandoned object and since this object
in memory is no longer referenced this
is a target for deletion and you can see
there it went away and that object is as
we say toast now if we created another
object like an object 3 then that would
appear here on the heap so let's go
ahead and do that and we'll just go
ahead and copy and paste this down here
and we'll say this is object 3 and you
can see now an object is created on the
heap so that's going to do it for this
tutorial I hope you guys now have a good
working understanding of how the heap
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
