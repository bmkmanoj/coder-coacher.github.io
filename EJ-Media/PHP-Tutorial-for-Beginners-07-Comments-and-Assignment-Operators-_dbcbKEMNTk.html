comments and assignment operators in PHP
now if this is your first experience in
coding comments are basically ignored by
PHP they will not be read they will
basically be ignored so you can see here
everything in green are comments now
there are two types of comments one is
you can do a single line comment and you
accomplish that through two forward
slashes so you can see once PHP hits
this everything is green from that point
on all this will not be used in terms of
the script and you can see here I just
put a comment that says this is a
variable which of course it is so these
are really notes to yourself or other
developers now you could also do
multi-line comments and that's what I've
got right here now a multi comment line
kicks off with a forward slash followed
by a wild-card and then you end it by
putting the wild-card first and then
another forward slash and so everything
here again will be a multi-line comment
okay that's all that really needs to be
said about comments now let's talk about
assignment operators the most basic
assignment operator is the equal sign
which we used in previous videos and all
that basically does is assign this value
to our variable here on the left so the
value on the right gets assigned to the
variable on the left it's that simple
and of course we know a variable in PHP
starts with the dollar sign now you can
see right here we're just echoing this
variable out and we'll get 25 we're not
going to run this but that's what you
would get you'd get 25 now what if we
wanted to add 10 to this this is where
we can use other assignment operators we
can use this plus equals right here and
this will add 10 to our variable now the
key here is it doesn't replace our value
on the Left 25 will stay 25 it just adds
10 to the value so again you're not
replacing the original value you're just
adding 10 Anto so let's go ahead and
just copy and paste this in here and
we'll just put that line of code right
here and so if this works correctly
which it should our new value now is 35
so first we assigned a value of 25 then
we came down here and said hey add 10 to
the current value which is 25 and that
gets us 35 and again a shorthand way of
doing this is to use the plus equals
operator now we could do the longhand
version of this which is right here you
could just take the variable which
equals 25 and add 10 to it so that's the
longhand way this is the shorthand way
so it's faster to program this way but
if you prefer the completely written out
method you can do that too so let's go
ahead and save this and then we'll click
on our link over here and we get the
expected result which we wanted which is
35 now as you see down here we can also
subtract 10 so let's go ahead and do
that we'll just switch this to minus
we'll go ahead and save this will
refresh our page and now we get 15 and
here you can see is the longhand version
of this you would get the same result
again
this assignment operator is just a
faster way to code now we don't need to
go through the division assignment
operator but I think you get the idea of
how this works
now just as you can add a value to a
numeric variable with the plus equals or
the minus equals or the division equals
operators you can append one string to
another using the concatenation
assignment operator which is right here
so we can go ahead and append one string
to another string and so let's do that
let's actually take all of this code
here and just copy and paste this up
here and of course we now need to echo
out our string variable so let's put
that here and then let's go ahead and
save this and let's refresh our page and
I forgot the semicolons that will cause
all kinds of problems okay let's go
ahead and save this there you can see
these two strings are now concatenated
okay that's going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
