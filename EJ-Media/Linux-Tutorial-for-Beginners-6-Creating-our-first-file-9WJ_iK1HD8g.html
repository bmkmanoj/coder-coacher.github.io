focused on directories in Linux and
we've created directories we've examined
the directory structure but now we're
going to switch focus and we're actually
going to create our very first file in
Linux and so let's go ahead and list out
our home directory and there you can see
our test directory which we created in
the last video and let's go ahead and
switch to that and then let's go ahead
and list out the contents and you can
see we just have one directory in there
the test2 directory which we created in
the last video so let's go ahead and
create our very first file and we're
going to create a txt file now to create
a text file in Linux you use the cat
command
so just type out cat and then the
argument we want to use is the greater
than sign right there and that actually
means to create a new text file and then
you can name the file whatever you want
I'm gonna go ahead and call this note 1
dot txt and then go ahead and hit the
enter key and you'll notice take a look
at that we did not return to the command
prompt and that is because we are
actually inside of our note 1 dot txt
that's what the cat command does when it
creates the file it assumes you want to
add some text to it which is a very good
assumption so it not only creates the
file it then opens it for you and places
you inside the file so let's go ahead
and create some sample text and we're
just gonna write this is some text for
our sample file there we go now to
create a new line you simply hit the
enter key and that will not only create
a new line it'll save the last line that
we just typed out so that line is now
saved and let's go ahead and create
another line ok and let's go ahead and
hit the enter key one more time
and now that line is saved as well now
to exit out of this and return to the
command prompt you simply hit control Z
and there you can see we are now
returned to our command prompt and we
are bright back in the test directory
which is where we were now let's go
ahead and list out the test directory to
make sure our note 1 dot txt is actually
there so let's go ahead and list that
out and there you can see it's right
there
and depending on the editor you're using
these are usually color coded so you can
see our file note 1 dot txt is in white
and the directories are in blue
and I think we talked about that a few
lectures ago now the cat command does
several things it not only allows you to
create files it allows you to view them
as well
so now to view this we simply type in
cat and then we type in the name of the
file that we want to view and in this
case of course it is note 1 dot txt so
let's go ahead and hit enter and there
you can see it displays the lines of
text that we created in that file now
there's a lot more things that you can
do with files and we're gonna cover that
in the next lecture see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
