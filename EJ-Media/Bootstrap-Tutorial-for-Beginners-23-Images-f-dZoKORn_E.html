to take a look at some of the bootstrap
classes that you can use with images now
if you want to follow along in this
video you'll want to copy the image to
your bootstrap folder and I will provide
a link of this very image that I'm going
to use in the description of this video
alright so let's get to it
so for this tutorial we're actually
going to create a grid to hold our image
and you'll remember you need three
standard things with a grid you need a
container you need a row and you need a
class that specifies the particular
device and size that you want to use in
this case this is for a medium device
and we're going to use a size three and
of course this is for an extra small
device and we're specifying a size five
so the first thing we need of course is
an IMG element and if you followed my
HTML tutorial for beginner series you
will remember we need a source attribute
to specify the image that we're going to
use and in this case it's going to be
the st. Louis Arch so we just specified
arch dot jpg there we go
and you always need to use the alt
attribute now a lot of people will
actually leave this empty but actually I
think that's not a good idea because
this will actually make your page more
accessible to screen readers and other
types of assistive devices so I
recommend that you always fill this in
when possible and what you want to do is
just put in what the image is about in
this case it's the st. Louis Arch so
that's what we're going to put in here
okay there we go so let's go ahead and
save this and let's go ahead and load
this in Chrome and see what we get and
there you can see there is our arch but
you'll notice that this image is way too
large it really didn't fit inside of our
grid and that's because by default
bootstrap will actually use the original
size of the image so this is the first
class we're going to specify to make
sure that this image is more responsive
and fits inside of our grid so let's go
ahead and close this out and the first
class that we're gonna call is the
bootstrap responsive class so we'll go
ahead and specify class and the class
that we want to specify is IMG -
responsive and now bootstrap will see
this class and we'll size the image
inside of our grid so let's go ahead and
save this and let's load this up
and take a look at that now the image
fits nicely inside of our grid so that's
the first class that you can call now
bootstrap also provides some classes
that allow you to go ahead and quickly
style your image so let's say we wanted
rounded edges well we can do that by
specifying IMG - rounded so let's go
ahead and save this and let's see what
we get
and now we've got these nice rounded
corners now you can also make your image
circular and all we do is specify circle
right here so let's go ahead and see
what we got and there you can see now
our image is circular now you can also
create a thumbnail and we do that by
just specifying thumbnail right here so
let's go ahead and see what we get and
take a look at that now you see we have
this thumbnail effect around the image
this little border that goes all the way
around it now what if you wanted to add
a caption down here well you can do that
as well but this is a little bit
different and I'll show you in the code
now what we want to do here is actually
remove this thumbnail class right here
and create a separate div and the reason
is is we want the image in the caption
which will create in a few minutes to
all be contained in one thumbnail and
the way you do that is to create a
separate div for this thumbnail class so
let's go ahead and do that so again
we're going to go ahead and get rid of
this so we're just going to back up here
and now let's go ahead and create our
div for our thumbnail and since this
thumbnail is no longer inside the IMG
element we don't actually need the IMG
part of that class we can just specify
thumbnail right here and that's all we
need and let's actually just go ahead
and close that out we'll just copy and
paste this right here there we go now we
have everything contained with inside
this thumbnail div now what we need to
do is go ahead and create our caption
and we actually are going to embed
another div with inside our thumbnail
div so let's go right here and actually
to save time we can just go ahead and
copy and paste this then we'll put this
right past our IMG element and the
bootstrap class that you specified you
guessed it
is caption Auriga and then of course we
need to close this div out and then we
need to go ahead and put in some content
and in this case we're just gonna say
this is the arch very simple or actually
let's say Saint Louis Arch you can tell
how lazy I am I just love to copy and
paste there we go okay let's go ahead
and save this and let's see what we get
there we go we've got our caption now
let's say you actually wanted this in
bold well no problem was just create
some CSS so let's go over to our style
sheet which currently is empty and let's
add some CSS code and I'm just gonna go
ahead and copy and paste this cuz I've
already got it typed out so we're gonna
call our caption class and you'll
remember we always need a period to
specify a class and we're just gonna set
the font weight to bolt so let's go
ahead and save this and let's go ahead
and reload our page and there you go now
our thumbnail is in bold now there's a
lot more to images and we will continue
on with this subject in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
