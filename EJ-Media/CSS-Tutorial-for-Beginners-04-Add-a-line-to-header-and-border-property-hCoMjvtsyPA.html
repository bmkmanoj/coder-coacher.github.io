this video we're going to talk about how
to put a line underneath the headings as
well as how to use the border property
and so let's go ahead and open up our
source that we had from the last video
and let's get rid of that background
color purple we don't need that anymore
it actually doesn't even look that good
and let's get rid of this rule that
changed the color to pink now in order
to add a line underneath our headers we
type in border - bottom and then we use
our colon and then we specify 1px now
that's for one pixel in terms of the
width and then we can type in solid
black now there are other values that we
can put in here but I will go over those
in later tutorials
okay so let's go ahead and save this now
and we'll go into the document and there
you can see we've got our line now let's
go back to the source and if you wanted
that to encapsulate the entire heading
now normally you wouldn't do this on a
header but you just get rid of the
bottom parameter and we'll go ahead and
save that and you can see now we've got
a box that goes all the way around this
and so that's how you add a complete
border all the way around but we just
wanted a line on the bottom and so we'll
switch that back to - bottom and as
you're probably surmising you can do
this you can put in a value here of top
right and left but we will go over those
in a later tutorial but I just wanted to
get you guys acquainted with that from
an early stage so again that's how you
add a line so that's going to do it I
will see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
