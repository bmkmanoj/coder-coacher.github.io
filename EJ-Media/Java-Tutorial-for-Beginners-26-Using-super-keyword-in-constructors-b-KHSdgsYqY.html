on the super keyword in the last
tutorial we dealt with the super keyword
and methods and this one we're going to
deal with constructors okay so I kind of
put together some code here and let's
just walk through this really quickly so
we're kicking off our new object down
here so we got the new keyword and we're
going to go ahead and have this
constructor get kicked off
but we're extending here right you see
we're extending so we have a superclass
that
the subclass is the child of so we come
down here and we're going to invoke the
Super's constructor first and whether we
do that or not the super constructor
always goes first that's the point I
want to make here and that is very very
critical that you understand that point
the super classes constructor always
constructs the superclass first so
that's how it works and then the
subclass constructor will do his work to
build the subclass and then they both
get merged into the object the super
constructor always gets built first
regardless whether I put this here or
not now if I don't put anything here
it's called an implicit superclass
constructor but in this case we want to
go ahead and pass these variables
through the superclass constructor and
assign them to the variables over here
so that's exactly what's going on here
now I want to point out you remember I
just said the superclass constructor
always goes first well if I drag this
down here look we get some intellisense
because now it thinks oh you're trying
to go ahead and execute the sub class
constructor first I'm sorry I can't do
that
so that's why it always has to be the
first statement in the subclass
constructor so let's go ahead and put
that back and we're fine so again it
calls this and says I want to pass a
three and four over here from these two
local variables and pass them into these
parentheses and assign them to these
variables and that will get built this
constructor will get built and then
we'll come over here and now the sub
class constructor comes into play and he
goes ahead and assigns these values that
we put right here one and two to these
object variables and then the object
gets built
and we can go ahead and print everything
out down here so let's run this and you
can see it worked just fine
and let's go back to the superclass over
here and let's just get rid of this
parameterised constructor and now we're
just using the default constructor right
here and we'll go back here and you see
it's giving us intellisense because hey
I can't find the parameterised
superclass constructor but we're going
to go ahead and get rid of these
parameters and now everything's
hunky-dory okay so now again this is a
explicit call we've typed this out but
it is no different if I actually remove
this it would be an implicit call so it
still gets done the superclass
constructor goes ahead and builds his
portion of the object and of course that
gets merged into what the sub class
constructor builds that we create that
we use down here and I'm going to go
through that in a few minutes again so
let's go ahead and run this thing again
and we get 1 &amp;amp; 2 now let's go ahead and
get rid of this and we'll run it again
and everything's fine still okay now
that was an implicit call it was still
done it was just done behind the scenes
now I want to take a moment and discuss
how the object is built in terms of the
subclass in the superclass coming
together to make the object when a
object is built like I just said the
superclass constructor always gets
invoked first whether we have it here or
not and of course now we don't
and then the subclass goes and does
whatever he has to do and then they are
both part of the object now right that's
inheritance that's how it all works so
I'll do a little bit of animation here
let's just assume we're running this and
the implicit call is made to the
superclass and then we get this little
box over here and that's the first part
of the object that gets created that's
now think of it that's the object that's
what the superclass constructor just did
and then guess what our sub class
constructor comes into play and that's
this red box and then the object is
created and then of course we can use it
in our main so that's how inheritance
works again so that's how it's all
getting built and then we can go ahead
and use everything that's in that
superclass right all its methods and
variables everything that we inherited
now let's remove
of this extent and you'll see what
happens here now this is just a
standalone object right this is no
longer inheriting anything it's by
itself it's by its little lonesome and
we're no longer of course inheriting
from this superclass da Java that we
created and then we would just be using
the standalone objects parameterised
constructor okay that's pretty much
going to do it for this tutorial I hope
you guys found this useful and I will
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
