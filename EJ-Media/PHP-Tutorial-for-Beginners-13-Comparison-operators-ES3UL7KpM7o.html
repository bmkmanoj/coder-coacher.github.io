comparison operators in PHP now we've
been talking about conditionals over the
last several videos and comparison
operators go hand-in-hand with
conditionals so chances are if you're
using a conditional you're probably
going to use a comparison operator
inside the test condition itself and you
can see down here I've created some
notes the main thing you're doing with a
comparison operators you're comparing
against a variable to see if it adds a
particular value and the two main types
of values are numeric or strings and
here are the main types of comparison
operators you will recognize a few of
these we use some of these in the last
video but one of the most important
comparison operators is this double
equal sign now it's important to note
that this is not setting a value like
the single equal sign does here this is
of course an assignment operator where
we are assigning the value of 10 to this
variable called num but the double
equals does not do that it does exactly
what a comparison operator does it's
testing to see whether this variable
really has a value of 10 so think of it
more like you're asking a question does
this equal 10 and again we are not
setting the value so that's what we're
doing here we're testing to see if this
is really in fact 10 and you'll hear
this referred to as an equality
comparison so it's a comparison for
equality which always again involves
these two equal signs okay enough of
that so let's see if this actually works
and it should we should actually get the
condition is true because the value of
our variable is of course 10 so let's go
ahead and refresh our page and we got
the condition is true now the other one
is the not equals these two are
basically the opposite of the Equality
comparison so here we're asking if these
are not equal to a particular value and
by the way these angle brackets and this
exclamation point equal sign they do the
same thing so you can use either one of
these let's go ahead and use the angle
bracket so we'll put this up here and
now we're gonna ask if the value inside
of our variable which of course is 10 is
not equal to 10 and of course that is
going to come back as false right
because they are equal so let's go ahead
and save this let's refresh our page and
we got the condition is false that's
exactly what we expected let's go ahead
and switch this to 11 and we'll go ahead
and save this let's refresh our page
the condition is true because yes 11 is
not equal to 10
now we've already worked with the
greater than and less than so you guys
can go ahead and walk through these but
I'll explain them really quickly the
greater than sign checks to see if the
value that we have on the left is
greater than the value on the right and
the less than sign does the exact
opposite of that and then of course we
use this greater than equal sign
operator in the last video and that is
basically is the value on the left
greater than or equal to the value on
the right and of course this is the
opposite so you can go ahead and play
around with these now we can also test
variables against variables so let's go
ahead and do that let's go ahead and
create another variable here and we'll
just call this num one and we'll keep
the value at 10 so they both equal 10 so
let's go ahead and copy and paste this
down here and we'll set this back to the
Equality comparison which of course is
double equals and so we're asking does
the value of our first variable equal
the value of our second variable and in
this case it does so we should get the
condition is true let's go ahead and
refresh our page and we did now let's go
ahead and set this to 11 we'll save this
refresh our page and now we get the
condition is false because now they are
not equal now let's go ahead and flip
this and ask if they are not equal and
now this should come back as true right
because these in fact are not equal we
hit this yep we get the condition is
true so that's how that works
now we can also test against string so
let's switch this variable name to name
and let's just say the name is fret and
then we'll ask and then we'll ask if the
name does in fact equal fret so this
should test out to be true so let's go
ahead and refresh our page and it did
now let's go ahead and change this
string to Fred D and we'll save this and
now this should come back as false and
it does so that is how comparison
operators work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
