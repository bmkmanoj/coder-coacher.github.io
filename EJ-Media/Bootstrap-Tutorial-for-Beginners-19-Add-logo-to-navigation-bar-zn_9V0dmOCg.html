of the classes that you can use in
bootstrap to create this nice-looking
navbar now in this video we're going to
explore some of the classes you can use
to create a logo in bootstrap and what
we want to do is stick our logo right to
the left here of our buttons so that's
again what we're going to cover in this
video so let's go ahead and close this
out and since we want to put the logo
before our buttons we're actually going
to stick it right before our UL class so
that's we're going to do so let's go
ahead and add a div and the bootstrap
class that we're going to specify first
is called navbar header so let's go
ahead and do that now the navbar header
bootstrap class basically goes
hand-in-hand with another class which
we're about to specify which is the
navbar brand so both of those classes go
hand-in-hand when you want to create a
logo using bootstrap and what this
navbar header class basically does it
alik AIT's about a hundred and fifty
pixels of space for your logo so
basically it will allocate that space
for whatever your brand name or logo
that you want to use and it also does
another great thing it makes the entire
area clickable for the link that we're
about to provide and it does yet another
thing it actually makes your logo very
responsive and what I mean by that is it
will scale appropriately for the
particular device it's on and as we know
bootstrap is a mobile friendly framework
so again the logo will scale
appropriately for the particular device
that's on it so let's go ahead and
create a link for our logo and so of
course we need an anchor tag and the
next class as I said we need to specify
is navbar brand and once again this goes
hand in hand with the navbar header they
work together and then of course we need
an href with our anchor tag and in this
case I'm not going to put anything in
here I'm just going to put a pound sign
but you can put whatever link you want
and then you can put in the text for
whatever logo or brand name that you
want to use and I'm just going to go
ahead and specify EJ media here and
bootstrap actually formats this very
nicely as you'll see in a second alright
so let's go ahead and close out that
anchor tag and then of course we need to
close out our div and whoops I put an
equal sign there
- - glad I notice that before I fired
this up this would have looked really
weird let's go ahead and fix that okay
there we go sorry about that
all right so let's go ahead and save
this and let's go ahead and run this in
Google Chrome and take a look at that
there is our logo and see how we can put
a hand over the entire area of the logo
this is about 170 pixels or something
and this is how major sites do this if
you go to Amazon you take a look at
their logo the entire area around it is
clickable and usually what they do is
they just link back to their main page
now let's see how responsive this is and
I'll show you how nicely these classes
work including the navbar header in the
navbar brand class let's go ahead and
minimize this and take a look at that
see how that handles our logo very
nicely puts it right on top where it
should be so again this code is very
mobile friendly which is one of the
basic mantras of the bootstrap framework
okay that's going to do it for this
video in the next video we'll create a
search box using the bootstrap framework
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
