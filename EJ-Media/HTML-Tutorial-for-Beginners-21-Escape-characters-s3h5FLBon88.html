whitespace and escape characters now the
way this works is the browser will
recognize one whitespace and that's all
so if you put two or three extra spaces
here it wouldn't recognize it you can
see that right here right now
one whitespace is recognized by the
browser but let's put in five white
spaces here and then we'll go ahead and
refresh our page and you can see it
didn't recognize those extra spaces and
that's where escape characters come into
play so these are the escape characters
right here for space and we need all
these the semicolon by the way is just
to end the escape characters so let's go
ahead and copy and paste five of these
into here and now let's go ahead and
refresh our web page and there you can
see now the browser recognizes those
white spaces because we have these
escape characters right here now we can
use escape characters for symbols as
well suppose you want a trademark in
your web page well we can go ahead and
use these escape characters and let's
just put this right here and let's go
ahead and refresh our page and there you
can see now we've got a trademark on our
web page and let's put a copyright
notice too let's use the escape
characters for that so we'll just put
that right after our trademark and we'll
refresh our page and there you can see
so you can use the scape characters for
those as well now some escape characters
are needed because you might confuse the
browser and I'll show you that let's go
ahead and type in a greater sign right
here now if we do that the browser will
think this is HTML code and it'll think
that we're trying to close out this
element when really we want this in our
content and so instead of typing that in
we can go ahead and use the escape
character for the greater than sign and
we'll just go ahead and copy and paste
that in here and let's refresh our page
and there you can see we've got our
greater than sign now and it's not
actually being confused as HTML code
that's the key the browser will not be
confused now there are many other escape
characters but these are the main ones
that are used so I will actually create
a link in the description of this video
if you guys want to go ahead and use
these see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
