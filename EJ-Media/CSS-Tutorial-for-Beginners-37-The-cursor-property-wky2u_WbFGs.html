cursor property in CSS and I've listed
out all the values here that you can use
for the cursor property now the default
is just that that is what the browser
uses by default and you will recognize
of course the very famous pointer and
you will recognize the hand icon when
you place the cursor over a link and you
will recognize the text icon you get
when you place the cursor over text but
these can all be override it by the
cursor property and that's what we're
going to do so first let's over I the
icon that gets displayed when you hover
over a link and so we'll go down here to
the hover rule set and you just type in
cursor and let's pick crosshair let's
try that so we'll just go ahead and save
this will refresh our page and now we
get a crosshair icon when we hover over
our button now we can also change the
icon when we hover over our main section
and so let's put a cursor property up
here and let's switch this to help so
we'll go ahead and do that and let's do
a save and refresh and now you see we
get a Help icon with the pointer and you
may want to use that if you have a Help
section so you want to just let the user
know that there over a Help section and
so you get the idea you can use these
different values now you can actually
turn off the icon altogether and you
just use the none value so let's do that
down here let's switch this to none now
take a look at this carefully I'll move
this pointer up slowly and you will see
the icon disappear and now I'm over the
button and you see no icon so that's one
way to remove icons if you don't want
them displayed let's try the move value
and now we get a moove icon and you may
want to use this if you allow somebody
to move an element I'll actually do a
future video on how to do that if you
allow somebody to move an element within
your webpage and that gives them the
sign to go ahead and do that okay that
is going to do it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
