this tutorial we are going to discuss
event handling and setting up the action
listener now in the last video we set up
the GUI our first graphical user
interface and we could of course click
on the buttons resize the windows but
our application could not respond to
user events and that is what we call
event handling and that is what we are
going to cover in this video now a user
event is something that happens behind
the scenes quite a bit when you turn on
your computer and you open up your
browser or you start typing on it user
events are being generated in the
background and so when you click on the
mouse or you type in keystrokes any type
of input device user events will be
generated now before we can receive any
events we have to set up our program to
listen it has to have the ability to
listen and Java gives us an interface
remember we did interfaces a couple
videos ago well now we're going to be
using them for a real application
so again Java gives us an event listener
interface that we can set up so that our
objects can listen or in other words
wait for a user event to happen and what
interfaces contain they have methods and
those methods will receive the user
input now there are two things we need
to do to set up the listener first is we
need to import the package and the
package that we're going to import is
right here it's the java.awt dot event
library and you can set it up just the
way I have it right there so we use the
swing library in the last video we
imported that so we need both of those
and it's the AWT library that contains
the interfaces that we need to set up
the listener and of course we need to
use the implements key word for the
listener interface that we're going to
use and it's going to be action listener
as you can see right here and what this
interface will do is will allow one of
our components in this case the button
that we add in the last video we're
going to be using that same button it
will allow it to generate user events
and there are different types of
listeners and we will review some of
those in the coming videos but for this
video we're going to setup the
and listener and again this is something
that's very common to all the languages
you're going to have to start dealing
with user events on a regular basis so
whether you're doing visual basic or
c-sharp or Java they all have user
events that is they allow user input and
when you allow user input something goes
on in the background and that's
something is we're going to be looking
at in this video
now the action listener has one method
and the name of that method is right
here it's action performed now you will
remember when we talked about interfaces
those methods are blank this is the
method that will get invoked by the
action listener interface so it will
send the events to this method and then
this method action performed will do
something and that's something that we
will do is up to us we have to fill in
their method remember it's up to us to
fill in the method the interfaces
methods are all blank the setup is there
but we have to fill in what's going to
happen once the user clicks the button
and when they click that button the
actionperformed method will get invoked
and it will do whatever we tell it to do
okay so let's review this once again so
we're going to go so we are going to
import this library the AWT library
we're going to use the action listener
interface now this is a method that I
created called create and show GUI and
again I like to use method names that
are rather descriptive so this is doing
exactly what we want this method to do
we want it to create and show our GUI
and it's very similar to the last video
remember we made our jframe object right
here and here we are going to make our
button object and you guys will
recognize these parameters right we used
all of those in the last video but
what's different is we're giving the
button object an action listener we're
adding it to the button remember the
object has to listen it has to wait for
something and so for each component or
each object that we add to our window
our jframe we need to add a listener to
it so if I had four or five more buttons
in here each one of those we would want
to have a listener for and so this is
where you add it and this keyword this
argument that
in here simply says this listener right
here is assigned to this object that's
all that means and then once we click on
that button the actionperformed method
will get invoked it'll actually come we
need these arguments these are the
arguments that we have to put in here
and whatever we tell it to do will be
inside this method and of course main
will kick it off so we're going to
create our GUI object and then our GUI
object will invoke our create and show
GUI method and then it's just sitting
out there waiting for a user to click
the button and so if we run this you can
see nothing's happen right we don't have
anything that method it's kind of the
same result as the last video we're
submitting this book this method is
blank so we got to put something in here
for it to do something and so the
program is just kind of sitting out here
running and the listener sitting here
waiting for us to click on this and when
we click on it something will happen so
let's go ahead and fill in our
actionperformed
method and we will go ahead and do our
famous system out dot print and we will
just type in information has been
submitted let's go ahead and rerun this
and let's actually make this window a
little bit larger and if we click on
this now you can see we've got our
output to the user we sent this to the
output window and it says information
has been submitted but up to now we've
kind of been doing system dot out dot
print to the output window why don't we
do something a little bit different
let's actually return the output to the
actual application window here so we're
going to do something a little bit
different so let's go ahead and comment
this out and we're going to put in some
new code here and we're going to invoke
our button dot object and what we're
looking for is set text and it's down
here somewhere let's see you can see all
the different methods we could use and
we'll go through a lot of these in
future videos but for now we're just
going to do a set text and there it is
so you can see we can put a string in
here and we're just going to put
something similar to what we had in the
syste
we're just going to put information has
been submitted but this
going to be very different because now
we're actually returning this to the
application so let's close our output
window and rerun this and let's go over
here move this over here we'll hit
submit and look it was returned to our
application now I want to show you
something before we close this video out
I want to actually bring up the code
from the last video so let's close this
out and let's close these out and let's
actually resize this window here a
little bit so you can see so we can have
both code lines up okay that's good and
then let's bring up the old code from
the what we did in the last video and
that's just this notepad here now what I
wanted to show you is talk a little bit
and we talked about this in previous
videos but I wanted to stress variable
scope now in this last video we just
stuck everything in the main method
because we didn't really care about
setting up a listener we just wanted to
fire up the window and do it quickly so
we could just draw everything in the
main method here though we had to
actually decide the listener we had to
do quite a bit more we had to set up
this create and show show GUI method and
we just use the main method just to fire
up the object and fire up the create and
show GUI method that's all we did
everything else happened up here now
what I wanted to show you is if you
notice in this code over here you'll see
that I declared and created the object
button in the method and so in a sense
this is a local variable and you'll see
here that I declared a global variable
up here and then so we declared the
variable up here but down here is where
we actually created the object so we
kind of split it up now had I not done
that and this was not a global variable
this method would not have been able to
access this variable because it would
have been local to this method let me
show you that let's get rid of this and
we'll actually go ahead and create it
here now and you can see he no longer
has access to it so keep in mind scope
is very very important we that's why we
have to declare this as a global
variable up here this now this since I
did this this is local only to this
method this
scope of this method and so that's why
this that's why this method no longer
has access to the object so that's why
it's important to remember scope so
let's put that back and you can see it
goes green now let's get rid of the type
here and you can see everything's green
and now all the methods will have access
to the button object because it's been
declared as a global variable so just
keep that in mind some of these concepts
that we were talking about before are
now coming into play okay that is going
to do it for this video I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
