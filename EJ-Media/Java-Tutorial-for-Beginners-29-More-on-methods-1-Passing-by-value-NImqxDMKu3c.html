tutorial today we're going to look at
methods in detail and specifically we're
going to do the two main ways to pass a
value one is to do the literal value and
the literal value is exactly that it's
the actual number and the other is to go
ahead and pass by reference where we're
actually using the name here I will
point out that there is no difference
between the two in other words both are
sending values to the method that they
are calling so just remember that in
this case right here we are actually
passing the value that this five that's
what goes through here so just keep that
in mind so in the first case let's go
ahead and we're going to pass this value
into this method class one right here
and it's going to go right to these
brackets first and this also can be
whatever I want to call it again this is
just a reference it's a placeholder
that's why I like to actually type that
in there it's a placeholder for the
value which will be passed into the
method and then do whatever work we want
with that value so let's go ahead and
run this and we get a 95 so let's take a
look what happened here we put in the
literal value right here and called the
method class one the method class one
received it right here the integer 45
and it passed it to the method so that
the method could execute it the method
then went ahead and we here you'll
notice we did it this so basically what
we do is here as we switch this from a
local variable to the class level
variable which is up here and said class
level variable which is up here plus
placeholder so 45 plus 50 and of course
the constructor set the value initially
to 50 and so the object variable had
that value and then we just simply added
45 to that and then we set it do a
return and then the method hits the end
of this brace and his work is done now
he knows to go ahead and do a return
because the return keyword and he also
knows what datatype to return that's why
we have to put an int here we have to
tell the method what type of data type
is being returned and in this case this
final value now is 95 and that gets
returned to the calling method and then
the method takes over and of course now
this value is at 95 now let's go ahead
and do another call to the method child
class and we'll just put this in here so
now we're going to
go ahead and run this and we got 60 now
you might be wondering how come I got 60
this time and 15 well I'll show you what
happened so this got executed first
because it was first in the list it went
up here and did a call to this method
child class and set the variable to 15
and then of course returned to 15 and
the object was also set to 15 that's the
value we set to now keep in mind in the
constructor we had set that to 50 but
this method here overrode with a
constructor did remember constructors
always come first and then methods come
second so the method resets it to 15
then then this method went ahead and
vote method child class 1 and so this is
no longer adding a 50 here it's adding a
15 plus 45 and that is how we got 60 so
just keep that in mind your object
variable can consistently be changing as
you go through your different methods
which might be calling different methods
and doing different things okay let's go
over this one this will be pretty quick
so in this one we're not actually
putting the value in we're doing a
reference by value but like I said this
is the value even though we put the
variable name here it's actually the
value that gets passed here and then if
we go up here this again can be whatever
we want to call in fact we could call
this some really long name it doesn't
matter and that's where people get
confused and obviously though but since
our method knows about this parameter we
have to switch that and now everything's
fine so again the calling name does not
have to match what's in the method
that's being called the parameter so
let's go ahead and run this and you can
see we got five which we expected okay
so that's pretty much it for methods I
hope that helped and just remember the
one thing that you need to remember is
that the value always gets passed no
matter what it's the value so don't get
fooled by these names and stuff it's the
actual value okay I will see you guys in
