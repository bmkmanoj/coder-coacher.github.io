we're going to look at how to do
multiple selectors and essentially how
to write a rule for more than one
element so let's go ahead and open up
our source that we use from the last
video and you can see right here we did
the h1 selector which went against the
header tag h1 header tag and we also set
up a rule for the paragraphs in our HTML
document right here and of course that
one against our two paragraphs now this
is just a rule for one element but you
can actually add multiple selectors to
that rule and so that's what we're going
to do in this video so let's close this
out and go ahead and look at it before
we do that and you can see right here
we've got this nice purple background on
the h1 header but what if we want to add
it to the h2 header right here well
that's pretty simple so let's go ahead
and open this up again and you just put
a comma here and put in h2 and we'll
save this again and we'll go into our
HTML document and there you can see with
just one rule we've applied that to
multiple headers the h1 right here and
the h2
now let's say you wanted to add pink
text to this but you didn't want to add
it to both of the headers we can go
ahead and do that too so let's go open
up the source and we will make a new
rule because we didn't want to apply
this to the h2 header so we just come
down here and remember to change the
color of the text you just type in color
that's all it is and we'll put in pink
as the value now we will remove the h2
header because we didn't want that
touched and we'll go ahead and save this
and there you can see we've got our pink
text just for the h1 header so again you
can apply different properties in other
rules to an element okay so that's how
that works I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
