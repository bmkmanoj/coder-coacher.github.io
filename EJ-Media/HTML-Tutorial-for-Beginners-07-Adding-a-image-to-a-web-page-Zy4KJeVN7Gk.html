in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how to add an image to your web page now
I want you to create a folder on your
desktop and in there put the image
inside there as well as your HTML code
and that way we don't have to worry
about specifying a location for the
image it'll automatically be rendered
when we add it to our HTML code now if
you want to add it to another location
you can do that you just have to specify
the directory where it's at okay so
let's go ahead and open up the source
and notepad now the first thing is let's
create a header tag you remember we use
that from the first couple videos and
let's create a header for our image and
we're just going to call this Washington
DC because that is where I actually took
the photo now let's create a paragraph
tag to encapsulate everything now for an
image we use the IMG tag and the
attribute we will specify his source
equals and then quotes and here is where
we will specify the source of our image
in this case is just an image dot jpg
and as I said we don't have to actually
specify a directory because it's in the
same directory as the source so the
image will be found and then we give it
an angle bracket now you might be
wondering why I didn't have to give a
closing IMG tag and this is one of those
tags it doesn't need a closing tag and
that is because we're only putting this
image here there's no other content that
has to go in here no text or anything
like that so let's go ahead and save
this and we will minimize this now and
let's go ahead and render it and there
you can see we've got our image we've
got our nice header describing where
this is and so that's how you put an
image into an HTML document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
