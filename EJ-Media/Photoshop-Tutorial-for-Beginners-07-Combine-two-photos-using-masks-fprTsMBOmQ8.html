to merge these two photographs using
masks and layers now what we want to do
is take this picture of Mars here and
you kind of see how the Martian sky is
very bland no offense to the Martians by
the way but we're going to go ahead and
remove the sky out of the Martian
landscape picture and take this picture
of the sky and merge it into the Martian
photograph now if you want to follow
along as usual I will provide the links
in the description of this video and
make sure you download the exact
resolution that I'm using so for the
clouds image you want the 1280 by 960
and for the Martian image you want the
1280 by 954 so what we need to do is
import those two images and we need
those images to be separate layers so
how to do that well there's a couple
different ways the main way to do it
from Photoshop is to go up to file then
go ahead and select scripts and then
you're going to select load files into
stack and then what we're going to do is
browse to those images and you can just
select both of those images and then
once you have them selected just go
ahead and hit OK and now you'll notice
in the layer panel we have two separate
layers for our images which is exactly
what we want and you will also notice
that when you import two images neither
one of the images are set as a default
in other words remember when we imported
an image in the previous tutorial it was
locked that is not the case when you
import multiple photos so just keep that
in mind so what we want to do again is
take the sky from this photo and place
it into our Martian landscape so the
first thing we want to do is go ahead
and drag our clouds photo to the bottom
because this will be our main image that
we're going to work against so we want
this on top and let's go ahead and just
drag this into the middle here so we
have a little bit more room to play
around with now let's go ahead and
reselect our Martian image and again I
just want to point out you always want
to make sure that you have the correct
layer selected because this is the image
we want to work against this is the main
image that we're going to work against
so again what we want to do is keep
everything in the Martian landscape and
eliminate the sky so what we're going to
do is go ahead over here to the left and
use the lasso tool so what we're going
to do is start right here
and I'm actually gonna cut this in right
below the horizon and now you can cut
this a little bit closer if you want but
obviously I need to move a little bit
quicker since I'm doing a tutorial so
let's go here we're gonna go right below
the edge and then we're gonna go off the
edge of the photograph and the reason
we're going to do this is we don't want
to cut the edges in below and if you
circle around like this like I'm doing
and then we're just gonna connect right
up here at the beginning and you see how
that's snapped in place here we actually
didn't have to cut this in so that's
actually a nice little feature of the
lasso tool so now how do we get rid of
this Martian sky well we can use masks
something we learned about in the last
video but we're gonna use a slightly
different mask in this video so I want
you go to layer I want you to go to
layer mask and we're gonna select reveal
selection and what this will do is
basically reveal everything that we just
selected with our lasso but what's nice
about this is it will hide everything
that was not selected by the lasso so
let's go ahead and hit this and you'll
see how this works and take a look at
that it worked basically everything in
our lasso was saved and everything
outside the lasso was hidden so it's
kind of a dual mask it works very nicely
when you want to blend photographs and
you'll see over here on the thumbnail I
didn't actually talk about this in the
last video but you can see remember
white shows everything that's revealed
and you can kind of see that in the
thumbnail and you can see up here at the
top black which hides everything is also
shown in this thumbnail so it kind of
gives you a representation of the masks
that we're using and remember what I
talked about in the last video that if
we have any layers below that content
will be revealed and that's exactly
what's happening here right we hid the
top portion of this photograph and so
this layers content is exposed which is
what we wanted so that's one way that
you can blend photographs using masks
and layers now one more thing I would
like to show you if we go back up to
layer and then select layer mask the
hide selection is basically the opposite
of the reveal selection it does the same
thing the only difference is everything
that you have selected will be hidden
and everything that is not selected will
be revealed so you can play around with
both of these when you merge your
photographs okay and as always thanks
