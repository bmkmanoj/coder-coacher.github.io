professionals in the industry and have
come up with some useful tips for your
tech interview so here they are the
first is flexibility now this is a
really big one for a lot of companies
today flexibility and teamwork now it
used to be there was sort of this idea
of the lone wolf developer where he or
she did everything but today many
projects are very large and very complex
and can encompass dozens of developers
and project leads so you want to lose
the attitude at the door present
yourself as a team player that can fit
into any scenario skill set you want to
highlight your strengths but you don't
want to overemphasize otherwise that
might come across as arrogant also the
cardinal sin is exaggeration of your
skill sets especially if it's a subject
you are unfamiliar with but the tricky
part is how to handle a skill that you
might be lacking if there is a skill set
you lack rather than saying simply you
don't know something rephrase it to
something like I have found that in my
own experience if I put my mind to it I
can accomplish and learn anything new
this is a good tactic because it shows
you are open minded and willing to learn
new things the dreaded code test some
tech interviews will present you with a
code test this could be on a computer or
even worse on a whiteboard the main
thing here is to keep your cool because
it's quite possible they are simply
judging your reactions are you cool
under stress now one little tactic you
can use here is to do a little
give-and-take with the interviewer so
write a little code and then ask them if
this is what they are looking for if
they like what you are doing then keep
going or follow any additional
instructions they give you this tactic
works really really well the environment
chances are you might have multiple
opportunities so which one is best for
you well a real big one for a lot of
people of course is the work environment
now if the company is leaning towards
offering you a contract before you
accept you might want to ask if you can
tour the workspace this might be easier
to do right after your initial interview
in a few minutes you can really pick up
a lot you can check out the office cubes
the kitchen do the people look tense or
relaxed in just a few minutes you can
learn a lot and this will help you in
the decision making process the greatest
interviewee
I once talked to a CIO and asked him
what is the best interviewee tactic he
indicated the best interviewees are able
to turn the discussion around from
themselves to the interviewer that is if
you can get the interviewer to talk
about themself for the company
you really have hit a homerun because
after all if the interview talks about
themselves at length how can he or she
possibly say the overall interview went
poorly chances are the interviewer is
going to like you a lot if you are able
to communicate in this manner now if you
liked this video I can do another video
with some more tips and as always thanks
again for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
