with conditional operators and we're
going to look at the end conditional
operator in this video now we're going
to use the same code we used in the last
video the only thing we're going to do
is switch this to an end conditional
operator and we do that with two
ampersands so let's go ahead and put
those in here and again these two
ampersands identify this is the end
conditional operator now you'll notice
in this little notepad file I've added
another column for the ampersand and
right away you'll notice that the
outcomes for these two are very
different you'll remember in the last
video the or conditional operator had
three true outcomes but notice the and
conditional only has one true outcome
the other three are false and what that
basically means is that both of these
conditions the one on the left and the
one on the right both have to be true in
order for the overall condition the end
condition to be true
if either side is false than the end
conditional operator will test out as
false so that's the big difference
between the end and the or conditional
operator so let's go ahead and run
through these ten years you can see we
already have both of these set up to be
true so let's go ahead and run that and
this should be the only true outcome we
get so let's go ahead and run this and
the condition is true which is exactly
what we expected now let's go ahead and
make B false
so let's flip this to 76 we'll go ahead
and rerun this and there you can see it
now comes back as false now let's go
ahead and test this outcome so the first
one will be false and the second one
will be true so we'll just go ahead and
flip these so we'll make this 56 and
we'll set this back to true so let's go
ahead and run this and we should get
another false result and we did and
again that is exactly what we expected
now let's go ahead and test out the
fourth outcome where both are false
we'll make this 68 so let's go ahead and
run this and there you can see we got a
false outcome which is what we expected
so again that's the difference between
the and and the or conditional operators
and remember once again it's all about
these outcomes what outcome are you
expecting and if you're not sure just go
ahead and test it out you can always
test the outcomes out by creating true
or
false conditions and that's again what
this equality operator is doing it's
simply a true or false it's testing out
whether our variable a truly does equal
five it's not setting it to five it's
just asking the question is this five
it's a simple true or false</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
