we're going to look at changing the font
color the font type in the font size and
so let's go ahead and use the source we
did from the last video and let's open
that up now now you will remember that
we created our first rule and that we
decided to go ahead and style the h1
HTML element right here and we gave it a
background color of purple and so let's
just go ahead and take a look at that
again and there you can see we have our
purple background now what I want to do
is create a new role so let's go ahead
and do that and so we just do the same
thing we did with the h1 rule we'll just
copy and paste that and we're going to
go ahead and style the P HTML element so
that's right here this one everything
within here and everything within here
now what I want to point out is we said
H 1 here and that equated to the h1
header when you put in P here and just P
we are going to alter everything all of
the paragraphs that we have in our HTML
document so it'll affect everything
both of these P elements and that's
actually very useful now in the old days
before CSS was even around you would
have had to come down to each one of
these P elements and put the same code
in for each one of these to change the
font type or color if you want to do you
had to put the same code now we can do
it globally from up here all we have to
do is put the P selector and then we can
go ahead and change everything we want
in all the P elements in the HTML
document okay so let's go ahead and get
rid of this property here because we're
not going to use that remember these are
properties and this is the rule and this
is the selector so we're going to select
again the paragraph element tag and
let's first change the color of the font
now let's go ahead and save this first
and you can see here that this was the
this is the first paragraph we had and
you can see it's in black and this is
the second paragraph element that we had
so let's go ahead back in there and so
let's go ahead and change the color of
that font to red and we will give it a
value of red of course now you'll notice
that this background - color that makes
a little bit more sense but for whatever
reason you would have thought
this might have been taxed - color no
it's just called color that will change
the fonts color and I find that a little
bit confusing but that's the way they
did it so you know you can see some of
these actually make more sense this
property actually makes more sense this
one just says color will color for what
well it is actually the font color but
they chose not to put in font - color or
text - color it's just color so let's go
ahead and save this and we'll go back in
here and you can see now that we've got
our red text and so let's go back in
here and we'll change those font size
and the actual property for that is just
font - size and again we use a semicolon
and we'll make this 25 px so we can
really see this use a semicolon we'll
save this again and we'll open it up and
there you can see we have increased the
size of this remember this is a lot
smaller and again we affect both of the
P elements okay so let's close that and
let's go back in here and now we will
actually change the font type and we
come in here and type font family and
let's change this to Helvetica so we put
in our semicolon let's save this and
we'll reopen this back up and there you
can see we've got our nice Helvetica
font and so that is how you change the
font type the size of the font and the
color and actually let's switch back to
the source for a minute I forgot there
was one more thing I forgot to say here
this px when we changed the font size
here this px stands for pixels and so
that is the unit of measurement that you
use and basically that's the size of the
text from the bottom all the way to the
top so pixels is the measurement and
that's what you want to put in here so
okay I will see you guys in the next
