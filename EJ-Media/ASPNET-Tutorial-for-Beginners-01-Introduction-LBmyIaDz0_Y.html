asp.net ASP is a Titanic subject there's
quite a bit to it and if you ever want
to make your websites dynamic you're
going to need to use ASP or PHP in this
series though we're going to go over ASP
and that stands for active server pages
it is a server based technology which
means most of your ASP code will be
executed on a server and then sent back
to the web browser
HTML CSS and JavaScript are primarily
client based technologies that is they
are executed on the browser without ever
making a voyage to the server and that's
where ASP really comes into play we can
do a lot of work on the server side of
things and not have to blog down the
browser that's one nice quality and ASP
offers quite a bit of security and
that's for a later topic now asp.net is
part of the larger microsoft.net
framework it's a set of components that
you can use to build something in this
case it's going to be a website c-sharp
and visual studio or other components of
the dotnet framework
what is asp.net do for us it allows us
to create dynamic websites that's really
the key here if you took my other
tutorials on CSS and HTML those were
just static web pages that we were
working on but asp.net allows us to do a
lot of things database queries user
login accounts master and content pages
and the list goes on and on but even
better we can do all our work visually
through visual studio visual studio is
the main conduit of everything including
asp.net so that will be our development
tool throughout this series and it's a
nice one-stop shop what are we going to
explore in a series we're going to
explore almost all of the tools in
asp.net and think of these tools is your
own personal toolbox you can use them
when you need them you learn of your
website that you want to make dynamic
and we'll cover many of the tools
offered in asp.net in this series we're
also going to cover very important
concepts such as master and content
pages and if you're using asp.net you
will almost always use master and
content pages because nearly every
website today has multiple pages
sometimes hundreds even thousands of
pages and master and content pages will
make your life a lot easier and so we'll
be covering master and content pages
very extensively in this series we will
create in this series a multiple page
website with many web controls now what
do you need for this series well the
first is software and that is the
Microsoft Visual Studio community
software now if you go out to Google and
you type in those keywords Microsoft
Visual Studio community the first link
you get will be a link to download the
software and it's a very easy install
you literally have to do is hit next
next next and you have everything that
we're going to need including iis
Express so we can actually fire up and
fully test out our website as though
it's in the real world and what does
that mean you can do all of your testing
and Visual Studio before you launch it
on whatever platform is going to host
your site now what do you need to know
well at a minimum you'll want to know
HTML and CSS and so if you have no
experience in HTML and CSS you should go
to my channel page and go through those
tutorials now as usual I will give you
every line of code and I will explain
every line of code I do that in all of
my tutorials and this series will be no
different oh one more thing before we go
I will provide a link to download
Microsoft Visual Studio community in the
description of this video ok see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
