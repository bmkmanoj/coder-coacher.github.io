left off in the last video and we were
talking about the levels tool of course
and we were working against this
underexposed image and we fix that using
the options here now one thing I want to
point out to you that I didn't show in
the last video is this little save as
default option here this is very useful
to use anytime you can use this in
Photoshop and it sort of speeds things
up especially if you have a particular
in which you like to fix your images so
for instance we use the find dark and
light colors to fix the underexposed
image so let's say you wanted this to
come up each time you would simply click
save as defaults and hit OK and so let's
go ahead and make sure that comes up
again let's actually just close out of
the levels dialog box and let's go back
to image adjustments and we'll open up
the levels dialog and go back to options
and there you can see this is
automatically selected now now one thing
also I wanted to point out to you is
that Auto when you click Auto
this will actually use whatever default
mode you set in here so before it was
using the original default which was
enhanced brightness and contrast but now
it will actually use the fine dark and
light colors so once again Auto will
correspond to whatever you set in here
okay so the three things we're going to
review in this video for the levels
dialog are these eyedroppers over here
these handlebars and these output levels
and you'll remember in the last video
there are two ways that you can access
the levels dialog one is you can go to
image and this allows you to sort of do
something on the fly but you can also
add it as a layer so that's we're going
to do so it'll be the same thing I guess
that's what I'm trying to say here we're
going to cover these options in our
adjustment layer but again it'll be the
same thing so let's go ahead and cancel
out of here let's now go over to layer
and we're going to hit new adjustment
layer and we're going to get and we're
going to hit levels and you can go ahead
and just use the default name here hit
OK and there you can see we've got our
level and again everything's pretty much
the same we have the eye droppers here
we have the handlebars and we have the
output layers and we have the auto
button but again we just don't have the
auto options now we're going to cover
layers later on but basically a simple
explanation is you can add as many
layers as you want and the nice thing
about layers is it allows you to do very
complex effects which we're going to get
into in future videos and basically what
layers are think of them like
see-through sheets you can make some
adjustments to it
but your original image this layer down
here is not affected so think of it like
sheet stacked on top of each other
over your original image you can make as
many different adjustments as you want
and in some very complex photos you'll
see dozens and dozens of layers and
again we'll get into layers in future
videos first we're going to take a look
at the handlebars these handlebars right
here that you can use in the levels
dialog and actually before we do that
let's actually open up a different image
here I'm going to open up the
overexposed photo just so we have a
different image we're playing around
with so again let's open that up and
let's go ahead actually have to create a
new adjustment layer here so we're going
to use the handlebars to correct this
overexposed image and as we know with an
overexposed image there's simply too
much light in our photo and we can see
that right here everything is trending
to the right we have nothing here on the
left for the darker portions of the
image so what we want to do is kind of
balance that out so that's what these
handles will do so basically the left
handle is going to increase the darker
portions of your image so if we start
dragging this to the right it will
increase the darker portions of your
image and of course that corresponds to
this value down here which as you see
start to zero this middle handle here
controls the mid-tones and we'll get to
that in a minute and then this handle on
the far right controls obviously the
lighter parts of your image and if you
started to drag that to the left it
would increase the lighter parts of your
image but we want to go ahead and use
this left handle so let's go ahead and
start moving this to the right and as
you can see the image is now getting
darker and we're getting close to
actually fixing this and making this
look like a normal image now you'll
notice that the mid-tones the mid tone
automatically adjusts as you move the
left handle and you can also see that
the value increased here so we have a
higher value in terms of the darker
portions of our image and you can play
around with this as you see fit what
this allows you to do is precisely fix
your image a lot more than anything you
can do with Auto even if you use the
options this gives you a greater level
of precision so again this image now
doesn't look washed out like it did
before since we corrected it by moving
the left handle in and increasing the
darker portions of our image so
basically this is distributed a little
bit more evenly okay so I think you have
an idea of how these handles work so I'm
going to go ahead and open up a new
image here and as always I will
provide the links to these images in the
description of this video let's go ahead
and open up this nice picture of this
Japanese garden and let's go ahead and
create an adjustment layer and of course
this is going to be levels as you can
see this is a little bit more evenly
distributed now one thing about the
mid-tone handle is this simply adjusts
the balance of the mid-tone levels in
the histogram so you can move this
either left or you can move it right now
if you drag the mid-tone handle to the
left it's going to open up the lighter
parts of your image if you drag it right
it's going to increase the darker parts
of your image so let's go ahead and
person with this left and you can see
how the image is getting lighter look
it's really opening up the lighter
portions of the image now if we go right
you can see it's getting darker so you
can see how actually we're really
improving the contrast of this by moving
this mid-tone handle the right look how
much nicer actually that photo looks so
again if you play around with these
handles you'll start to get an idea how
you can fix and make some of your images
look even better in terms of the
contrast now let's take a look at these
three eyedroppers over here the
eyedropper tools and we're just going to
talk about the basic function I just
want you to understand the concept of
these and then we're going to use these
in many later videos but I just want you
to understand what these are doing first
of all I want to let you know that these
three eyedropper tools correspond to
these three handles so you can see this
top one you see how there's some dark in
here this corresponds to the left handle
and you can see how this middle one here
corresponds to the mid-tone slider and
of course the bottom one corresponds to
the right handle so that's the first
thing you want to understand is these
basically just correspond to these three
handles so what is the difference well
here we're actually kind of controlling
the level in terms of the darkness and
the light and of course the mid-tone and
we're sort of doing the same thing over
here
but we're doing it by pixel that's what
these allow you to do you can actually
go here and select a pixel that you want
to set for the minimum level of the
channel so for instance let's go ahead
and select the dark eyedropper and there
you can see it says right there sample
an image to set black point now what I
want to tell you is that you don't want
to go and select a light pixel that
wouldn't make a lot of sense you're
actually what these are actually setting
the darkest point of the image that you
want to work against we'd probably want
to set something down here for instance
and there you can see that altered a
little
or we could go ahead and use this one
but what you don't want to do is go
ahead and select a light pixel see how
that really distorted the image actually
I'm glad I did that because you can
always revert the changes that you did
with this icon right here this basically
allows you to undo everything we just
did and seeing everything's back to
normal so that's pretty nice and I want
to show you one more thing while we're
talking about these icons out here let's
go ahead and slide this mid-tone slider
to the right now what this does is
allows you to actually toggle back and
forth between the original image and the
changes that you made in the level so
let's go ahead and hit that see how
that's nice
so you can go ahead and toggle back and
kind of review your changes and make
adjustments accordingly I've actually
used this quite a bit go ahead and
switch back and forth to see what the
original background image looks like so
I use these two quite a bit so again I
think you now have an idea of what the
eye droppers are used for you can
actually zoom in on a pixel and select
the color that you want to work against
now again I just wanted you to
understand these at a very basic level
we're going to use these later on in
many videos now let's talk a little bit
about this slider right here this
corresponds to these output levels so
this really kind of controls the overall
contrast of the image that's I guess the
best way to think of it but basically
these work a little bit differently so
let's go ahead and take this left handle
and start moving this to the right and
what this does is it actually pumps
light into the darker parts of the image
notice that take a look at this rock
down here you see how dark that is now
watch what happens when I start moving
that right see how that's getting
lighter and lighter so that's the way
that works now if we take this right
handle and start moving this to the left
see how this kind of dulls down the
image see how the lighter parts are
getting darker now take a look at that
sky see how that's working so again you
can use these to control contrast to now
the final thing I want to talk about and
this is where the levels tool can get
very interesting you can actually pick a
channel and in this case let's go ahead
and pick blue okay and let's go ahead
and start using the mid-tone slider here
and adjust this this actually can create
some nice effect see how that turns
green and now let's move this to the
left we start pumping blue into the
image see how we're pumping blue with
those mid-tones the opposite of blue
apparently is green so if you start
moving this to the right you get a
greener effect
you can actually select these channels
and start creating some interesting
effects to your photos if you choose to
do that so let's go ahead and select red
and then let's go ahead and move this to
the left and as you can see we're
pumping right into the image if we move
to the right or pumping more green into
the image so again this is how you can
start to do some interesting effects
with your images okay that's going to do
it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
