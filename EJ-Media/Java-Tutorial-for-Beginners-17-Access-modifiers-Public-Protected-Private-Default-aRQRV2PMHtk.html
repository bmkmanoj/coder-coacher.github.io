beginning Java today we're going to take
a look at access modifiers and of course
in several of the previous videos we
have seen these right we go over this
program we see this you know when we
define classes methods and variables so
it's only appropriate that we discuss
how these work so in this tutorial there
was a lot to type out so I typed
everything out and what I've done is
I've set up two packages and a program
in each one of the packages and both
program a and program B are identical
they are both accessing methods and
variables from this class template and
the reason I made these the same was
we're just going to talk about how these
keywords work in terms of public private
so it wasn't necessary to have different
logic in these programs and also I put
the comments in pink today please don't
tease me so you can see this a little
bit easier so here's the first comment I
wrote Java provides a number of access
modifiers to set access levels for
classes right here of course variables
right here and methods right here and
constructors we're going to go over
classes variable methods today we're not
going to talk about constructors the for
access modifiers are default and that's
where you put nothing in front of the
variable and actually we've been doing
that in almost all of our tutorials
public we've seen that in front of our
classes and our methods private we
really haven't done that yet that's
usually used with variables and
protected and again that's usually used
with variables too so let's start with
classes first now classes can only use
two of these four it uses default and
public you will not specify it as
private or protected and I wrote that
right here as well so again if we remove
this public this class now is only
available to everything in this package
is no longer available to anything in
this package and you'll see that here if
we go here now you can see oops we now
get a message saying I can't get to this
class template now you will notice that
this program here can still access the
class template because he's in the same
package but this one cannot now when
you're trying to access a class that's
in another package you always have to
use this import feature
that's why it's getting intellisense
first on this but this program is
essentially the same as program a the
only difference obviously and it's a big
difference it's in a different package
so again public means it's visible to
the entire world everybody can see it if
you remove the public key word the
default is its visible only to the
package and I actually wrote that down
here even though I wrote this for
variable it actually is the same for
classes and methods so again it's
visible the package the default visible
to the package only public visible to
the world so let's go back to the
template actually we already are in the
template and let's go ahead and type in
public and this intellisense now should
go away and voila look it's gone and now
it has access to this class template now
I will say that in almost all scenarios
you're going to want to use the public
key word here there are only be a few
scenarios where you don't want to make
your class visible but for the most part
you're always going to want to have your
class visible so other classes can call
it that's the whole point of objects
right so you can get to them so again
nine times out of ten you're going to
make your class public okay let's move
on to variables now like I said this is
the one we've been using the most where
we didn't put any access modifier in
front of our variable and again if you
do that it's visible only the package
the second type I wrote out here is
public and as we said that's visible to
the world the third type is protected
and that is a little bit less
restrictive than this option the default
option it's visible to the package and
all subclasses this has to do a lot with
inheritance and that's actually another
tutorial but I will show you how this
works in this tutorial with variables
but you're going to use this with
inheritance quite a bit and then there
is private visible to the class only and
this is the most restrictive now most
developers will actually make their
variables private and you're probably
asking the question right now well then
how do I get to it and I will answer
that so let's go ahead and run program a
and you can see it added everything from
this method that we told it to now
you're saying wait a minute this was
private how did it add year that was
private that was set to the most
restrictive the answer to that question
is that this method
prynt week that's defined in this
template is public so it has access to
this private variable remember we said
class only so again this guy is going to
have access to all the variables no
matter what they're set to because
everybody's got access to everything
inside the class template in this case
is exactly how most developers will use
this they will set their method to
public and let people access their
private variables through the public
method but the variables will remain
private because they don't want anybody
messing with their variable now what if
we go back to this program and we decide
to go ahead and give the variable
another value here so let's go ahead and
do that let's say new obj whoops now
take a look at this day month and week
are visible if we go back to the class
template the year is set to private it
is not visible did you guys see that
that's pretty cool huh only those three
will be visible because they are in the
same package now let's go over to this
program and try to set the variable obj
t dot and look at this only week is
available because week was set to public
all the rest of these are not available
because protected available only the
package default only available the
package and of course private only the
class so the only one we could see over
there was week that was it
let's get rid of that clear the
intellisense and we'll get rid of that
okay so now let's go back to the class
template and we'll talk about methods
and how the access modifiers work with
methods so let's go back to program B
and let's actually go ahead and run that
and look he's able to go ahead and sum
these all up because we have access to
this method in the template because it's
set to public now let's go ahead and
remove the public keyword and if we go
over here look we've got intellisense we
can't get to any more now you will know
is that program a over here still has
access to it in fact let's go ahead and
run it and it works because this is set
at the default method and as we said the
default method is visible to the entire
package so this method still has full
access to this class template and thus
can get to this private variable and all
the rest of the variables so let's go
back here reset this to public and the
intellisense should be gone now because
we have access to it and it's gone now
as I wrote here public is the most
widely used keyword for methods again
you're going to want to have your
methods public so people can get to your
variables it doesn't make a lot of sense
to lock these down so that's the most
widely used case and as I said before
with class as well it's really variables
that you're going to go ahead and set
restrictions against now you might be
asking wait isn't there another access
modifier called static but that deserves
its own tutorial so we're not going to
worry about static right now so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial I hope
you have a much better understanding of
how these access modifiers work please
check out the rest of my Java tutorials
on my youtube channel have a nice day
