left off in the last video and in this
video we're going to create multiple
images that we can drag around in our
web page so we just did one file and
that of course was this Caesar dot PNG
so again we're gonna add multiple files
in this video now open up your website
folder and you'll want to put two other
images in there so you want a grand
total of three and you can see I'm just
using this easier image over and over
again and if you're using the same image
you may want to put a number on it or
something or mark it in some way so you
know which image you're dragging around
so again you want three images to follow
along in this video so the first thing
we want to do is start in HTML where we
usually start and let's just go ahead
and copy and paste this div that holds
our image and we're just gonna copy and
paste this twice twice over there we go
and we want another one and then now I
forgot the names I think it was two and
three yeah okay so it's Caesar two dot
PNG and Caesar three now we don't want
to use an ID anymore we want to convert
this to a class since we want this to be
shared between these three elements we
want to reuse that code over and over
and you will remember if you watched my
CSS series we use a class for that so
we're just gonna convert this to a class
and we need to update this one there we
go and let's just take a look and see
what this looks like really quickly you
know what though let's make this look
more like a gallery so we want the
images going side to side to side so
let's close this out and let's flip over
to our style sheet we'll go all the way
down here and you will remember that
divs our block levels so that's why
those images are being displayed in a
top-down manner but we want them to go
side to side to side so if you took my
CSS series and I hope you did you'll
remember that we need to convert a block
level element in line if we wanted to
display side by side by side and we do
that of course with the display property
and so let's go ahead and do that and
we'll just set that to inline and let's
go ahead and get rid of this property we
don't need it and we're of course
specifying our class here which was dot
draggable
and there we go so let's go ahead and
save this and let's see what we get here
good
that looks great now everything's side
by side by side okay so let's close that
out and now what we need to do and all
we have to do now is come down and alter
this right we're not using an ID anymore
we're using a class so we just need to
put a period here let's go ahead and
save this let's rerun this and let's see
if this all works now and it does look
at that we can move around all of our
images anywhere we want so that's how
you can create a little gallery where
you can drag around multiple images okay
in the next video we will cover the
options that you can use with the
draggable method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
