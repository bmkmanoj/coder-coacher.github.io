talked about selecting elements and how
do we get those elements we get them by
using these three methods which we've
talked about extensively so we can kind
of take a break from these methods now
we can kind of move on but now we're
actually going to start changing content
we've changed the CSS styles but now
we're actually going to replace content
and so how do we do that well we can use
that with the inner HTML property which
we're going to talk about in this video
that's one of the ways that we can
actually replace the content itself so
we're actually going to use the same
exact code we use in the last video but
we're going to alter it a little bit
what I did here is I just changed this a
little bit I just said hit submit for
some new text I put in some text here in
our first paragraph and I put in some
text in our second paragraph and what we
want to do is actually completely
replace this text so what we want to do
is when we hit this button we want this
actually to say new text one and we want
this to say new text - so let's bounce
over to our JavaScript code that we used
in the last video and you can see here
we're doing exactly what we did in the
last video we're using the get elements
by class name to get our elements and
again we're going by class name we have
two elements and then we have to specify
the node for each so that's all going to
stay the same but we're not going to
change the CSS styles now so we're going
to get rid of these what we want to do
is specify inner HTML here and that
allows us to write new content to our
paragraph element and this is a property
it's not a method it's actually just a
property of our object our paragraph
object so what we're going to type in
here is inner HTML and then we need to
assign a value which is going to be our
new string that we want to write out and
we're going to say new text one and then
let's just copy and paste this in here
and now we're going to say new text -
for our second paragraph and let's go
ahead and run this
and if we hit the submit button we get
our new content which in this case is
text so that's what we're doing here we
are writing out completely new content
using the inner HTML property now in
this video we just wrote out the text
but there actually is a way just to read
the content and we'll do that in the
next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
