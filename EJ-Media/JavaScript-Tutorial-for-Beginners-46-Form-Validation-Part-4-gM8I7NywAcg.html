how to highlight a particular box that
was filled out in error and in this case
we're going to provide focus to the
first text box and that is the name text
box so what we want to do is if the user
fills it out incorrectly we want that
box to be highlighted in red with a red
border and I'll show you that in a
minute now the method that we need to
use is the focus method and so that's
what we're going to do now where to put
that well the good place to do that is
after the alert so after the user clicks
okay to the alert box then we will
provide focus to the element that was in
error in this case of course it is the
input element with name our name text
box so first thing we need to do is go
right here and we're just going to call
our box object and we're just going to
call the focus method and so what this
does is it just provides focus back to
our box element right here it'll just
highlight it but that in itself won't do
a lot now that we've called this we want
to provide a little styling with that
red border so I'll just copy and paste
the line of code I have and here it is
we're calling our box object we're using
the style object and then we're using
the border property and then we just
specify solid 3px red most of you will
have recognized that by now and so if
this works correctly if they fill out
this text box wrong this of course will
be true and this code will be executed
only this time focus will be provided
back to the element and we will
highlight it with a red border now I do
want to point out before we run this
we're only going to cover this outcome
right here this outcome where it's true
they filled out the first text box wrong
and they filled out the second one
correctly we will talk about how to
provide focus to multiple elements in
another video so let's go ahead and save
everything up and let's go ahead and
submit our page in chrome and so what
we're going to do is we're going to fill
out the first text box wrong again so
we'll only enter three characters like
we did in the last video the second text
box that'll be false
they entered everything correctly let's
hit submit we got our alert now if we
okay that first textbox should be
highlighted red and it is take a look at
that and so the user knows right away
they have to refill this out correctly
and if we hit submit the form is
submitted
okay that's going to do it for this
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
