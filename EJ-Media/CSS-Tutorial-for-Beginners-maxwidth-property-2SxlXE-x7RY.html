the max with property that you can use
in CSS
now the max width property is usually
used for smaller sections such as pop-up
windows tooltips that you don't want to
expand out to the entire size of the
webpage you want to set a max width so
that it can't expand out any farther
than that in the example we're going to
use is in a tooltip now we're going to
go ahead and use jQuery for this tooltip
now we're not going to talk about how to
set up the tooltip in jQuery
if you want to learn about that you can
go ahead and take that video in my
jQuery series but for this video we're
just going to talk about the max width
property and CSS so again we're going to
go ahead and work against the tooltip
now if we go over to the CSS code you
can see here that we have a max width of
300 pixels so when we load the page this
is basically saying the tooltip can be
no wider than 300 pixels and so let's go
ahead and load up the page and we'll
take a look and see what happens and if
I hover over julius ceaser we should get
a tooltip we did and that looks to be
about a hundred and fifty pixels
I think jQuery inside the jQuery
function it's actually setting this
width automatically but within our CSS
selector we're saying it can be no wider
than 300 pixels now let's go back to our
CSS code and what we're gonna do to test
this out to make sure it's working is
we're gonna go ahead and use the width
property now normally you wouldn't do
that with the max width property because
you're allowing it to be a number
smaller than 300 pixels but it can't go
any wider than 300 pixels so usually you
don't set a width because if you do that
you're setting an absolute with work but
to test it out let's go ahead and do
that and let's go ahead and we'll set
this to 250 pixels and let's go ahead
and save this and we'll go ahead and
reload our page and there you can see
the tooltip is much larger it expanded
out to 250 pixels because again we're
below 300 pixels now let's go ahead and
try to make this 600 pixels and let's
see what happens here so let's go ahead
and save this and we'll reload our page
and there you can see it's only 300
pixels now so that max width property
prevented us from going any farther than
300 pixels now of course
if you wanted this to be 600 pixels we
would have to increase the size of this
number we'd probably have to make this
700 pixels or something like that so
that is how the max width property works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
