beginning look at collections and
generics and collections are very
similar to arrays they do pretty much
the same thing they store items or
things or stuff that's basically what
they both do and these are of course
objects so that's why in this video I
want to talk about the differences
between a normal array and a collection
because as I said again they are very
very similar now you will remember that
in terms of a normal array we use these
brackets to define the array and here
we're giving the array name and here we
are of course are constructing the array
and you will remember that this is the
critical piece right here we decide the
size of the array right here and in this
case we're going to add three elements
and so we have to add three elements and
this array is gonna hold some different
types of food for us apples chocolate
and hamburger three different types of
food
now collections as I said do the same
thing but there are some notable
difference now before we move on I want
to say that Java provides several
collections that have already been built
for you in Java util and what does that
mean well you don't have to write your
own collection you can just use the
collections that Java already provides
and as I said there are many different
types of collections in this video we're
going to talk about the array list
collection and as you can see I specify
ArrayList right here that's the
collection again it's just a class if
you have NetBeans open right now you
could right-click on this and you would
see it's just a normal class now we'll
get to this in a minute this is the
generic we'll talk about this in a
second but again it's the same thing
right we have to define a name for it we
have to build it through a constructor
we use the generic again and we'll talk
about that in a second but here is the
key key key difference we do not provide
the size over here we are defining the
size when we build the array over here
we are not we do not provide an initial
size of the collection now what does
that mean that means that this is
resizable we can add elements as we come
and go right
I'm not forced now to add all three of
these elements I can add them when I
want so in this case I simply added a p'
in chocolate and at some point later on
I could add a hamburger and so that
really is the biggest difference you do
not specify size initially as you do in
a normal array and that makes this more
dynamic it makes it more flexible it
makes it resizable you can add things as
you want during runtime during runtime
you can't do that with a normal array
but during runtime with a collection you
can add and remove actually items as you
please now the other thing I want you to
notice here is that this is using
methods take a look at that we created
an object here called food and now we're
using the add method which comes by the
way from the ArrayList that's just a
method that's provided and that's how
we're adding elements over here we're
using the equal sign to assign the value
so we are not using methods over here
over here we're using methods now what
does that mean well when you use methods
that adds a little bit of overhead so
actually a normal array is a little bit
more efficient at runtime
than a collection so that begs another
question when should I use a normal
array and when should I use a collection
well you should use a normal array if
you know the size of your rape already
so if you know that I only need these
three elements and that will never
change by all means use a normal array
because it's more efficient if you're
not sure of the size of your array
initially then you should use collection
so that's the basic rule right there
so those are the two big differences we
don't define the size and we're using
methods to add the elements now let's
talk about generics generics are
actually pretty simple you'll see these
angle brackets right here in here we
specify the data type and of course I
specify a string what does that mean
that means down here I can only use
strings I can't use an int or a double
or a character you have to use the
datatype that you specify up here and
that is a generic that means the rest of
these elements that we add have to be a
string and you can specify int up here
you can specify double any type of type
that you want to use that's the generic
it goes right between these angle
brackets now I will say this if you
leave this empty and you
and then you can actually use mixed
datatypes down here so you could use an
int you could use a string I will say
that almost everybody specifies a data
type up here they do not mix and match
down here because that's not considered
good practice so you do want to specify
the data type up here unless you have a
really good reason not to okay I think
that is a good start with collections in
generics now in the next video we're
actually going to code this up and we
will actually use the ArrayList
collection so I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
