beginning Java in this video we're going
to talk about operators and specifically
we're going to be talking about math
operators math operators can be used in
your statements to crunch numbers in
your Java programs
let's review there's several of these
that you'll obviously recognize there's
addition operators subtraction
multiplication operators and we'll go
through each of those right now if you
have not done this already create a new
program you should know how to do this
by now from the first two tutorials
create a program called math operators
okay so let's get started here with
arithmetic operators
let's define a integer with a keyword of
int we're going to give this a variable
name of score we're going to say that's
equal to 40 on the next line we're going
to say the stat score equals score and
here's where we use the arithmetic
operator plus 10 and again we have to
put in our semicolons now you'll get
some intellisense here that says the
assigned value is never used the reason
that is because we need to output this
so let's go ahead and do that and we'll
say system.out.print and we need to get
put the variable name in here that we're
going to be printing which is score and
there we go so let's run that and you
see we get a total of 50 so we were
totally in the score which is 40 plus 10
so this is the arithmetic operator
pretty simple okay so let's run through
the other operators here mathematical
our operators so for a subtraction
operator we just put in a minus sign
here we'll run the file and you get 30
you can also do a division operator
we'll run that and 40 divided by 10
should equal 4 and you can also use the
multiplication operator
let's go ahead and run that 40 times 10
equals 400 you can also do more
complicated expressions we could we
could do so for instance we could add we
could add multiple operators so we could
say 400 plus and then put this in
parentheses this will add it will this
will add 400 to the score times 10 so if
we run that we'll get an entirely
different number here we'll get 800 so
that's pretty much it for mathematical
operators you can play around with these
for a little bit and we will move on to
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
