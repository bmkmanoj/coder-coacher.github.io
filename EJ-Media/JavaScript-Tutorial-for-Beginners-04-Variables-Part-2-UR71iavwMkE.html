about variables in JavaScript and I want
to talk about the concept of a loosely
typed language and mainly the
differences between a loosely typed
language and a strongly typed language
now languages like Java and c-sharp are
considered to be strongly typed
languages javascript is considered to be
a loosely typed language in terms of
variables and the main difference is
that you do not declare the data types
of the variables explicitly in
JavaScript so if we take a look at this
example that I use in the previous video
this is an integer obviously but we do
not have to declare it here we simply
type var for variable now if we look at
this same example in Java
we have to declare the data type which
is an int if you don't put that in there
you'll get a compile error but in
JavaScript you do not have to identify
the type before the variable so that's
why it is considered a loosely typed
language is it defined as an int when we
assign a value now let's run this and
we'll run it in chrome and of course we
get the message 35 years old and that of
course is from our alert function which
adds both of these variables up and it
says 35 years old now even goes farther
than that in JavaScript you do not even
need to put this variable keyword here
we can actually remove that and Java
will still assume that this is a
variable when it sees the equal sign and
the value that's assigned to it it'll
actually make an assumption oh I didn't
find the var keyword but this still must
be a variable and to prove that let's
run this again actually we'll save this
and we'll run this again and we get the
same result now even though you don't
have to put the var keyword in front of
your variable I do not recommend that
you do that so we're going to put it
back and the reason is it's considered
bad form not to put the var keyword in
front of the variable in JavaScript
because for one it makes it hard to read
the code you may be used to that but if
you have somebody else that needs to
read your code it will make it harder
for the person trying to enter
your code also it's not a good practice
to have JavaScript assume that this is a
variable in rare instances it can
actually lead to some problems where
JavaScript gets confused and this is not
treated as a variable so again I would
recommend that you put the VAR keyword
in front of your variable even though as
I said it is not necessarily required ok
that's going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
