beginning Java today we're going to look
at constructors now constructors can be
confusing at first but once you grasp
the concept they can be very useful so
let's take a look at them right now now
in the last couple tutorials we defined
an object called planet Java and created
a blueprint for it and then we created a
program called all planets where we
could create objects off of our template
and so we created an earth object off of
our planet template now what a
constructor allows you to do is instead
of having to write out this variable
here it allows you to define it on the
fly through these parentheses right here
so think of it as a quick shortcut an
easier way to define your variables on
the fly you don't have to type them all
out down here you could just put them in
these open parentheses right here so
it's doing the same thing only it's
making it a lot easier now this scenario
here is useful if you're only defining a
few objects but if you're defining
dozens of objects it makes sense to type
the variables out in the open
parentheses because it's a lot easier to
do so think of it like a shortcut it's
an easier to way to define your objects
much quicker now there are several ways
to do constructors in this tutorial I'm
going to show you the two basic
constructors and in later tutorials I'll
show you a more advanced way to do
constructors so let's go ahead and set
up our template in addition Java so if
you haven't created this go ahead and
create a class called addition and here
we're going to go ahead and set up our
variables and we're going to have one
variable called first number and another
variable called second number
and of course we need a method and we're
going to create a method that just adds
those numbers now at this point if we go
back to planet dot Java the blueprint we
set up over here
you'll notice it's very similar we set
up our variables and we set up our
method so it's the same thing what's
different now is now we'll set up the
constructors in our template that we can
call from our addition program so let's
go ahead and set up the constructors now
so we name the constructor addition now
it's important to note that the
constructor name has to match the class
name that's the way it works you can't
call this anything else so we create
open parentheses now you might be asking
well that's what we do with a method a
constructor is a type of method but it's
obviously very different so it is a form
of a method it's just different
so that's why we use the open
parenthesis here now we can go ahead and
define values to the variables that we
defined up here now this is called a
default constructor and this is where
you just go ahead and write out the
values for all the variables that we
define up here and we'll run that in a
few minutes but we're going to create
the other constructor too so this is the
first constructor this is the default
constructor and now we'll create one
more type of constructor that I'll show
you so we type in the same name this is
the other constructor we're doing open
parenthesis and we're going to type in
int and L and then int and B now I will
explain this in a few minutes this might
be very confusing but I'll explain it in
a few minutes and now we're going to
give a value but we're not really going
to assign a value here and this will be
confusing but like I said I'll explain
this in a minute
now in this second constructor we didn't
give this any values here like we did in
the default constructor because in this
constructor we want to be able to assign
whatever value we want when we make our
objects over here and I'll talk about
that in a minute here so just soak this
in for a minute the fact that we're not
going to assign any values here because
we're going to assign them when we
create our objects over here so let's go
ahead and create the program here if you
haven't already create the addition
program class and now we're going to go
ahead and create our object and we're
going to call this add object equals and
of course we've seen this before we're
not going to put anything in the
parentheses yet and let's do a system
dot out dot print I have to capitalize
that and we'll say the addition equals
and here is where we will call our
method that we created back here in our
template we'll take our object and now
call our method which was get number
semicolon already so let's go ahead and
run this thing and we got 30 because it
hit this first constructor where we had
10 and 20 and of course that equals 30
now let's go back here and put some
values in here let's put in 79 and 21
and let's run this again and look we got
100 so it hit this constructor because
it realized that values were placed in
these parentheses right here and we had
said to do that here the reason we gave
these weird letters here is because we
didn't want to give this a numeric value
the object of this is to put whatever
value you want here so again you could
put whatever you want right here we
could make this X it's just a
placeholder think of it like a
placeholder for the value we could say
this is X we could say this is X now we
rerun it
and we get the same result so again
think of these like placeholders and
that's how this type of constructor
works you're not going to define any
values here so this first int
corresponds to this one and the second
int corresponds to this one now this
also initializes the variables to be
used by this objects instance that we
are using and we assign the value right
here but again we're not going to put in
an actual value so again this
initializes it and here's where we set
the value and it's used by the instance
of this object now let's go ahead and
create another object and we'll call
this add obj one and now we can put in a
different value here let's go ahead and
do another system out and we will run
this and you can see we were able to do
different values right here and we got
the result that we wanted so that's what
this allows you to do now we can create
as many different objects as we want and
put in different values using this
constructor now you'll notice that we
didn't put anything before our
constructor that's because nothing is
actually getting returned here the
return values are from the program not
from here and once again each one of
these objects is using its own instance
of addition Java and more specifically
they get to use their own instance of
this constructor and thus get to use
their own values here to create a
different result now before we go you
might have one question
how come Java doesn't throw an error
because we're using the same name for
these constructors and the answer to
that is pretty simple now remember I
said the class name up here has to match
the constructor name so how can we name
this something else when they have to be
the same name as a class name and the
answer to that is the uniqueness of the
constructor is determined by what's in
here
that is the arguments that we put in
these open parentheses are what
determine what makes this constructor
YOUnique that's why there were no errors
now I'll show you that let's go ahead
and copy this and we'll paste it down
here and you'll see we'll get an
intellisense error saying you've already
defined this because what happened was
it hit this and said Oh guess what
you've already got this defined right
here sorry it doesn't even matter if I
threw other values down here whatever
it's not going to be unique still so
again it's determined what arguments
that you're defining here and in turn
what gets passed to the constructor over
here so you can make is you know we
could make another one if we let's say
we decided to go ahead and do int X int
B and int C you can see now that
exception went away because now it
recognizes hey this is actually
different you're setting up three
arguments that's going to be something
different so that's how that works so
that's it for constructors in future
tutorials I will explain more complex
things we can do for constructors but
this is a good start and I hope you
found this video useful if you did
please check out the rest of my Java
tutorials on my youtube channel have a
nice day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
