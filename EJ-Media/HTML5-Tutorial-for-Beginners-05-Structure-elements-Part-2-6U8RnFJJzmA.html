structure tags and we covered the header
the nav the aside and the section tag in
this video we're going to take a look at
the article element as well as the main
element but before we do that I want to
talk about the difference between the
article element and the section element
this is generated a lot of confusion and
mainly that's because these are very
very similar and I mean that they are
very very close and what they do and
basically they just group related
content so again if you use one or the
other you really can't go wrong but you
might ask well what is the difference
well the article element is intended for
content that might exist outside of the
article itself so this may be a running
blog that you have or it may be a news
feed something like that so in that case
you probably want to use the article
element the section element is intended
for content that exists only within that
section it's really more of a
one-and-done think of it like that a
one-and-done format but other than that
they are very very similar so first
let's talk about the main element tag
that you can use in html5 now of course
we identified this section in the last
video with the html5 section element but
actually you can also use the main
element here as well and what this does
is it basically identifies the main
section in your page so we can go ahead
and use main here instead of the section
element tag and again you want to use
that for the main section in your web
page pretty simple stuff and usually
you're only going to use this one so
you're not going to put multiple mains
around here it's a one-shot deal so
let's go ahead and update this and we'll
go ahead and put in our main right here
and then we'll go ahead and close it so
we're just gonna replace the section
element with the main element there we
go and let's flip over to our style
sheet and let's go ahead and update
section here we need to put in main now
since we don't have the section element
anymore and let's go ahead and save this
and let's just go ahead and refresh our
page and make sure everything looks ok
and it does good now what you can do now
is put articles inside the main element
tag because the main element tag is more
of a wrapper so you're actually not
going to put content directly inside the
main tag you're usually going to put an
article in there so let's go ahead and
do that so I'm just gonna go
here and copy and paste Sisk because I'm
lazy just kidding okay so let's go down
here and we'll put that right here good
and now let's go ahead and just close it
out and there we go we've got our
article element tag and what you're
going to do now is you can put all the
content that you want you could put in
your image you could put it images
paragraphs headings whatever you wanted
to do in this case we're just going to
put in one heading we're not really too
worried about content we've done that in
other videos I've got this already typed
out so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy
and paste that right in here there you
can see now we've got our h2 element and
it says article element good now what
you could do is let's say this was a
news story and basically another news
story came out well you could create a
new article and put it right here you
could have like an ongoing RSS feed so
that's what the article tag really is
forced it's used for blogs and news
feeds so let's go ahead and save this
and I added some CSS already before the
lecture and I'll show you what I added
so basically for the article I use the
type selector here and I just added a
border we've done this in many other
lectures right I added a margin around
it which gives it five pixels and I've
added a height of 200 pixels I also went
ahead and Center the text for the h2
element so everything is set and as
usual of course I will put this code in
the description of this video so let's
flip back here and let's actually open
up a new screen here so let's just open
up a brand new screen will and we'll
watch this in chrome as usual and let's
expand this out and there you can see
we've got our article element now and
again like I said you can just come back
and add as many articles as you want
that's sort of the idea here you're just
managing content you can just keep
adding articles to your ongoing blog or
news feed or whatever it is okay that's
gonna do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
