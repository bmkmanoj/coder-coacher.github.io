at the slider in jQuery now I will tell
you that I've updated to the current
releases of the jQuery UI and the main
jQuery library itself now I will also
tell you that I have tested the code
that I'm going to show you in this
lecture against older versions of jQuery
and it works just fine
so you can really use whatever version
of jQuery you want but if you want to
have the exact same version I will give
you the links to the download so I
downloaded the stable version of the
jQuery UI right here on this page and
then for the main jQuery library I
downloaded the uncompressed development
version 3.2 point
of this video so if you want to make
changes in your website folder you
should rename your existing folder to
underscore old or something like that
and then bring down the new version of
jQuery and just rename the folder to
jQuery UI and then here is the version
I'm using jQuery 3.2.1 but again pretty
much any version you have will work with
this code and then really the only
change you need to make if the HTML
source is right here
you just specify three to one and again
you may already have this version so
let's get going now the first thing we
want to do is go ahead and decide where
we want to put our slider and let's go
ahead and put it inside our main dip so
we're going to put it right here so
let's go ahead and create a div and
let's give this a name of slide really
original right and then for now we don't
really need any text we just need to
close to do okay good now let's go ahead
and work on our jQuery code down here of
course we need to grab our ID that we're
specifying and in this case of course it
is --slide and then the function we call
is slider that's all we need to get an
initial slider but before we do that
let's head over to our style dot CSS and
let's go ahead and put some margin
around our slider so let's just copy and
paste this right here this idea of tests
and of course we need to specify our ID
which is slide and again all we want is
a margin of 10 pixels so that works out
good make sure you save your stylesheet
let's head back to our index.html let's
save that and let's go ahead and fire
this up in chrome and let's see what we
get and there you can see we've got our
slider take a look at that where
nice we have our margin around it and
that works great so let's go ahead and
close this out now there are several
useful options that you can use with the
slider and I'm going to cover several of
those over the next several videos the
first one is the orientation property
now if you remember we need those
brackets to specify an option in the
jQuery UI and the first property we're
going to take a look at is the
orientation property and basically what
we can do is actually flip the slider
now the default is horizontal which we
just saw but what if you want to flip it
vertically well all we have to do is
specify the keyword vertical here so
let's go ahead and do that
and let's go ahead and save this and
let's launch it in chrome and see what
we get here and there take a look at
that now the slider is vertical so that
is the first look as a slider in jQuery
now as I mentioned there are many more
options with this and the first one will
actually allow us to create what's
called a range slider and what that
basically allows you to do is move the
slider and pick a number and so that's
what we're going to create in the next
