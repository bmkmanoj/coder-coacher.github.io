CSS in this video we're going to examine
the border property and so let's open up
our CSS style sheet and let's work
against paragraph for the CSS code in
paragraph four and that of course is
right here now of course we've already
talked about the border color the border
width and the border style properties
but we're going to examine these a
little bit more in depth but first let's
take a look at the border color property
now of course we know that in CSS there
are three ways to specify color one way
is to use the name and we're doing that
right here we're specifying black the
other is to use the RGB value and the
other is to use the hex code so let's go
ahead and put in the hex code and we'll
just come over here and paste this let's
save this let's open up our web page and
there you can see we've got a nice green
dark green actually border so let's
close that out now in terms of the
border width you can use three keywords
here you can use thin medium or thick or
you can just give the pixel size and
we've been doing that we gave this two
pixels but let's go ahead and use one of
these border width keywords so let's
make this thick and let's go ahead and
save this and let's open up our web page
and as you can see now we have this nice
thick border around our paragraph
element so let's close this out now the
third property of course is the style
property and this is where things can
get pretty interesting now we've been
using solid of course throughout the
series but let's let's take a look at
some of these others let's try let's try
dashed let's take a look at this one
so we'll save this and there you can see
we have a dashed border ah let's take a
look at double let's try that and you
can try some of these yourself as well
so let's go ahead and put in double
we'll save it again
and there you can see we have a nice
double border now now these bottom four
right here have a 3d effect and so these
can really make your border very dynamic
so let's try let's try Ridge and if we
take a look and you can see there's a
little bit of a 3d effect here now and
actually that looks really good in my
opinion and so let's go ahead and use
that for our border on our paragraph for
element and we'll just keep that okay
that is going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
