today we're going to be talking about
loops so to quickly give you an idea
what loops are in real life we really
hate doing the same task over and over
again it's something that is more like
punishment for us unless it's video
games but the computer will have no
problem doing that if you tell it to and
you accomplish that through loops so a
loop is a statement or block of code
that is repeated in a program over and
over you can specify a fixed number of
times you want to do that or you can run
it indefinitely so when you create a
loop statement it will cause your
program to keep returning to the same
place over and over again so that's
really a good way to think of loops in
Java there are three types of loop
statements that you can create there is
the for loop the do loop and the while
loop we are going to be dealing today
with the for loop and it just so happens
that the for loop is the most
complicated of the three loops so if you
get the for loop down the do and the
while loop will be a little bit easier
so to kick off the for loop we type in
the keyword for you can see it turns to
blue because it's recognized by Java and
then we're going to type in an open
parenthesis there are three parts to a
for loop that you need to be concerned
with there is the initialization section
the conditional section and the change
section and we will go over all three of
those parts so in the first statement we
want to initialize a variable and this
essentially is the starting point this
is where we're actually declaring the
starting point so let's call this let's
give this an int we'll say start
and we'll say this is equal to five
we'll start at five and then you're
going to go ahead and hit a semicolon
and we move to the second section which
is the conditional section and the
conditional section essentially tells us
when
you end this for loop so again in this
first section we're telling it to start
at five well we need to have a main
method here which we we can just copy
and paste this from another program this
is just the standard main method and
let's get a closing squiggly bracket
okay so let's move on to the second
parameter now or the second section
within this for statement that we've
defined and in this second section we
are going to tell the for loop how far
it should go so we'll use the variable
again we'll use the less than and equal
sign and we'll say 250 so what we're
saying here is this should run until
it's less than or equal to 50 and
basically it'll go to 50 so we're going
to start at 5 and end at 50 the third
section is called the change section and
this is where we're specifying what to
do each time this loop runs one time and
what we're going to say is increment
this by one every time this loop runs so
we'll use the plus + to accomplish that
and before we run this let's actually
this is going to produce too much output
so let's let's change the first section
to a zero and the middle section let's
switch that to a ten and then we're
going to do a system out dot print and
let's just print out the variable and
now we will run this and we should get
and you'll see here it printed out all
the numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 it
stopped at 10 because we said no greater
than 10 so are less than or equal to 10
so we said stop there do not go to 11
and it did and so that's how that works
now you could also increment this by 2
if you wanted to plus or equals to 2
if we run this again you'll see we get a
little bit so you can see down here
incremented by two each time so instead
of so we get 0 2 4 6 8 10 so in this
third section you specify how much to
increment by each time the loop runs
through and matches this second
condition and if it matches it and
continues you say increment it by 2
that's why it was 0 2 4 6 8 10 and that
is it for the for loop I will see you in
