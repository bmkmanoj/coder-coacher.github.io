validated against two text boxes and we
have forced the user to enter at least
one character in this video we're going
to force the user to specify a minimum
number of characters because that's much
more realistic very few websites would
allow the user to enter just one
character so what we're going to do is
we're going to specify a minimum number
of characters that have to be entered
into each text box so we have to tweak
the conditions we've been using for the
last several videos and so we're going
to introduce a new property and that is
the length property now we're still
going to continue to use the value
property because we need to get the
value from the text box but we're also
going to use the length property as I
said and so all we need to do is specify
dot length and this will get us the
amount of characters that have been
entered into the text box so we can just
append that onto our value property and
what we're going to do is we're going to
use less than and let's force them to
enter at least five characters so what
we're saying is if the number of
characters is less than five this
condition will be true and if it's true
of course we will stop the user and then
force them to enter at least five
characters so we probably should change
the text here so let's say something
like please enter at least five
characters there we go and now we want
the second text box to do the same thing
so let's just copy and paste this here
there you can see both text boxes now
have to have more than five characters
for this to be false and again it's the
same as the last video if this
expression turns out to be false then
our code won't be executed here and the
form will be submitted so let's save
everything up here and let's go ahead
and run this and we're not going to go
through all these different outcomes but
let's do the first one where both a and
B are true so we'll enter three
characters
we'll hit submit and it stopped us now
let's do this outcome down here and
we'll enter a bunch of characters and
it's submitted it okay that's going to
do it for this video and that's how you
force the user to enter a minimum number
of characters into a textbox see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
