going to review the select tool so let's
make a shape and we'll make a rectangle
and then go ahead and hit the select
button here the hotkey for that is f1 so
if we go here and select another tool
and then hit f1 you'll reselect the
rectangle so you'll notice all these
arrows surrounding the rectangle now now
if we grab this arrow here on the right
we can adjust the width of the object
and then if you hold the shift button
you'll notice it'll adjust both sides
now not just the right and that's the
same for the height as well and now I
will hold the shift button and you can
see we're doing both the corner node
we'll adjust both the width and height
and again it's the same if you hold the
shift button now if you just put the
cursor over the rectangle and you see
the hand here you can drag the entire
object around where you want to put it
let's create a circle now and go ahead
and select it at the top and then let's
select the diagonal node here on the top
left and you'll notice it's not keeping
the aspect ratio here and you may want
to do that but if you want to keep the
aspect ratio you hold down the control
button and move it to the size you want
it and you'll notice we're not losing
the aspect ratio here no matter what
size we put it at now if we click
outside the select and you try to select
it but you don't select at all you'll
notice it doesn't select it so you have
to completely surround the object in
order for it to be selected and that's
the same for two images so if we go
halfway across the rectangle will notice
it only selects the circle but if we
surround both completely now both are
selected so that's how that works now
let's select the rectangle and if you
hit the left-click button again this
will allow you to rotate the image so
let's click on the bottom node here and
you can see we can skew it you can also
go horizontally here
and again vertically so that's how that
works now you will notice this point
here in the middle when we were doing
our rotates we were rotating against
that point if you want to move that
point and rotate against a different
area you just pick it up move it and now
you'll see we're rotating against that
new point and now you can see we're
rotating against the point on the left
where we moved it now move the point
back into the middle and if you grab
this point on the top right here and hit
the shift key you'll notice it's moving
against this opposite side so that's
what the shift button does you can see
it how it works if we go from the side
so this could be helpful if you want to
do all kinds of things you can you know
combine shapes and rotate them the way
you want it so that's pretty much it for
this tutorial I will see you guys in the
next xscape tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
