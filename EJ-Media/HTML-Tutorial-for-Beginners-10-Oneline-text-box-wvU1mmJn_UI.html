initial look at HTML forms and forms are
something we use a lot when we're on
websites they are used to collect
information and so you might have filled
out a contact information form on a
website
and when you submit that it's handled by
a web server so we're not going to
handle that part of it that's for a
future video but in these next few
videos we're going to talk about the
actual input fields that's what we're
going to create with HTML now it all
starts with the form element tag you can
see that right here we have the opening
tag we have the closing tag now by
itself the form element tag doesn't do
anything it just declares in HTML that
this is a form that we're going to
submit and you can see here though we
have a blank web page nothing in there
because again the form element tag by
itself doesn't do anything we have to
put our input elements inside the form
element that's why I put this comment
right here input elements go in here so
the first thing we're going to do in
this video is create one of the most
common input elements and that is the
one line text box and you've seen that
many many times when you filled out
information on a website so I'll just
copy and paste the first line here and
so here we go we actually have a text
box right here and that is used by the
input element tag so I've created that
notice we don't need a closing tag
because it's just an element that goes
inside the parent form element so that's
the way it works now the key to this is
to understand this attribute right here
type equals text this text denotes that
this will be a one line text box that's
what's going to be rendered when we
refresh this page in a few minutes now I
don't want you to worry about these
three attributes the action attribute
the method attribute and the name
attribute we will talk about this in a
future series in a JavaScript and in a
PHP series because these have to do with
the server-side of this and that's not
what we're going to talk about in this
HTML series we are only interested in
creating a text box in this series with
HTML we are not interested in
server-side code at this point so don't
worry about those attributes right now
so let's go ahead and refresh our page
now and there you can see we've got our
one line text box is now
cool and we can create another one let's
go ahead and create a second one here
you can create as many as you want and
we'll hit save here well refresh and
there you see we've got two now if you
don't want these side-by-side we can
just put in a break tag which we've seen
before and we'll hit refresh and there
you can see now they're in a top-down
order and you'll notice that when we
click on the actual control this is
called the control by the way the actual
one-line text box though very few people
call it a control they usually just call
it a one-line text box but when we click
on the control it is highlighted in the
browser now let's say you want to change
the length of this box on your page
let's say it's not wide enough to
contain all of the information that you
want the user to enter well it will
automatically scroll to a lot more
letters but what if you want this to be
wider so people don't have to use a
scroll bar we can accomplish that by the
size attribute so let's go ahead and put
that in right here and we'll say size
equals and we'll say 100 characters and
we'll leave this bottom textbox alone so
let's go ahead and refresh this and
let's see what we get and you can see
how much lighter this is now in fact
let's lower that to a more reasonable
amount how about 50 characters and there
you can see it's now much wider if you
need a lot more information to gather
here so we're going to go ahead and just
get rid of this we'll keep the default
but I just wanted you to be aware of
this attribute okay that's going to do
it for this video in the next video
we're actually going to create some
labels for these one-line text box so
we'll do that in the next video see you
