line using HTML canvas in this video
we're going to learn how to add an
additional line because ultimately we
want to learn how to add multiple lines
so we can begin to make shapes that's
what it's all about using HTML canvas
and so we're gonna do is create another
line now as I mentioned in the last
video you always end your line with the
stroke method so if that's the case how
do we start another line and we do that
with another method and that is called
begin path so that's what we're gonna
put in right here and this takes no
arguments so this will allow us now to
create another line now let's just go
ahead and copy our previous line and
we'll just put it right below here now
what we want to do is actually put in
some different coordinates obviously to
start and end this line so let's make
this 30 and 30 and we'll make this 570
and let's make this a slightly different
color and the hex code I'm going to use
is 2 - 8 B 2 2 that's what we're gonna
use I think that's a green some sort of
green and we'll continue with the same
line width and we'll also round off the
line and actually we wanted this to be
70 sorry about that alright so let's go
ahead and save this up let's go ahead
and run this and let's see what we get
there you can see we've got our second
line now so now that we know how to add
multiple lines we can begin to start
making shapes and that's we're going to
get to in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
