at the color replacement tool in
Photoshop and this is one of the more
powerful tools that you can use it
allows you to change the color of an
object in your photograph and the nice
thing is it doesn't destroy all of the
shadows and highlights it simply
replaces the colors and so what it does
is it basically will sample an original
color that you pick by the way and it
will replace it with the color that you
have selected as the foreground color
and you'll remember we talked about
picking a foreground color in the last
video and you select it with this icon
right here so again you have complete
control in terms of the color that you
want to replace so what we want to do
basically is take the color of this
flower which is white and replace it
with another color and again the color
that will be used is what we have
selected here for the foreground color
so the first thing we want to do is
actually go ahead and open up the color
picker and we want to select the
foreground color there we go now let's
go ahead and move this over here now
what we want to do is go ahead and use
the eyedropper and what we want to do
here is capture the settings for this
first model here we want to populate the
values from this photograph so let's go
ahead and just select a portion of this
photograph you can kind of select
whatever you want so we selected this
area right here and you can see we've
got the white in here now and again here
this very first model is now imported
and you can see we've got the hue
setting at 62 the saturation at 14% and
the brightness at 91% now there are two
ways you can approach this first you can
change everything you can change the hue
the saturation and the brightness that's
one way and you can certainly do that
you could drag this all the way over
here and get a really bright version of
this color that we have selected or you
can just change the hue and so some
people want to kind of maintain the
correct brightness in terms of balance
so they will not change the brightness
and they will not change the saturation
they will only change the hue you can do
it two ways like I said go ahead and
test this you can go ahead and move this
over to the right and change the
brightness and the saturation or you can
go ahead and leave both of these values
the same and just change the hue so for
this lesson we're just going to change
the hue we're not actually going to
change the saturation and we're not
going to change the brightness and if
you want the color to look a little bit
more natural and blend in with the
entire photo you're
want to keep the saturation and the
brightness the same so let's go ahead
and change the hue now you will remember
when we want to change the hue we use
this slider so let's go ahead and just
slide this up to a different color here
and we're gonna select this blue right
here so again you may want to go ahead
and drag this in and make this a pure
blue so let's go ahead and hit okay so
now we've got our color selected so
that's the first part now what we need
to do is actually select the color
replacement tool and the place you're
going to go up to is brushes and the
first selection is the brush tool we're
gonna go ahead and go down here and
select the color replacement tool right
there now you can come up here and
actually increase the size of the target
area so we're going to do that we'll
change this to maybe 25 pixels and
actually let's let's make that even
larger let's set this up to maybe 77
pixels so there you can see we have a
much greater target area now now you see
this limits field right here you always
want to keep this set at continuous and
I'm going to explain why right now
basically the way this works is
Photoshop will continually sample the
color that's directly under the
crosshair that you see right here so the
crosshair is basically the sample that
you are telling Photoshop to replace
with the foreground color that we have
selected here so whatever is under this
crosshair will be replaced with the
currently selected foreground color and
we'll use all the pixels that fall
within the range of this larger circle
right here everything in here is the
area that will be replaced so if you
think about this for a second as long as
we keep the crosshair on the flower this
area we don't move off over here long as
we keep the crosshair on this flower the
only pixels that will be replaced will
be all the white pixels of this flower
shouldn't replace anything in the
background all right so let's go ahead
and start painting and take a look at
that see how it's maintaining the
highlights the correct highlights and
tone of the flower it's not destroying
everything and so that's why they call
this colorizing you're not destroying
the object now notice how I'm keeping
the crosshair over the flower I'm not
going off for the flower but see how
easy it is to break in the edge here see
how easy it is to do that and actually
you know we can bump this up and make
this a little bit larger you can see how
easy it is to use so you can actually
make the target area larger
let's do that and then you can actually
move much quicker here so let's go ahead
and finish this off
and again you always want to make sure
that you keep the crosshair over the
flower the pixels for the flower because
we don't want to replace pixels in the
background and I'm gonna move a little
bit faster here than I should you
probably could take a little bit more
time and take a look at that within just
a few minutes we have replaced the color
of this entire flower and actually we
need a little bit of a cleanup over here
and you'll see areas that you have to
kind of clean up and you can do that in
your spare time but what I want to point
out here is sometimes the pixels that
are near the edge in this case the edge
of this flower the pixels are not
replaced and that has to do with this
value right up here this tolerance
percentage so if you find that the
pixels are not being replaced in this
case it looks pretty good they were
replaced pretty good but sometimes
they're not and if they're not you may
need to bump this number up and what
this does is basically let's say we bump
this up to 50% what happens is Photoshop
will be a little bit more liberal in
terms of the sample so it'll be a little
bit more liberal in terms of replacing
colors now the default is 30% and that
usually works pretty good for me but
again if you find that some of the
pixels near the edge are not being
replaced you may want to bump this up to
40% or 50% if you go above 50% it
usually will just start replacing pixels
on the background so again I think the
optimal range is between 30 and 50% but
you can play around with this now here's
where you can start to do some really
interesting effects and let's go ahead
and actually make this much larger
because we're gonna actually change the
background and let's bump this almost
all the way up let's bump this way up
here good now you might have seen some
of these photographs where they make the
background black and white so this is
kind of a cool little effect that you
can do and you can do it really quickly
and all you do is basically just select
black so let's go down here and we'll
just select black and make that your
primary color and now watch what happens
when we start paint over this see how we
get this black and white effect now
everything is becoming grayscale in the
background and again this creates a
really cool effect and again a lot of
people do this if they want to highlight
their main object and look how really
neat that looks so this is very useful
there we go so again that's a
nice little effect you can do using the
color replacement tool okay that's going
to do it for this video thanks again for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
