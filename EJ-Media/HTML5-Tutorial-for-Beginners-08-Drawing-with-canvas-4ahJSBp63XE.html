and now we're going to go ahead and draw
something on it and to do that we need
to use JavaScript so you will remember
in the first video I explained that you
at least have to have a basic
understanding of JavaScript that is what
is a method do that kind of thing so
again we're going to use JavaScript in
this video to draw our very first line
on the canvas that we created in our
last video now you also noticed that I
got rid of the article and all of that
extra fluff we just want to deal with
the canvas element so I basically got
rid of everything else that was inside
our main element so if we're going to
use JavaScript we of course need to
create an ID in our JavaScript code so
we want to get ahold of our entire
canvas and you will remember in order to
do that we need to create an ID so let's
go ahead and do that and we're simply
gonna call that draw that will be the ID
that we use now what we're gonna do is
we're just gonna place our JavaScript
code down here you'll remember in the
JavaScript series I explained that you
want to always have that near the
closing body element tag because you
want that to load last now I've got this
already typed out so I'm gonna go ahead
and just copy and paste that into here
right now so let's go ahead and do that
and there is our JavaScript code now
let's actually align this up a little
bit okay good now what I'll do is I'll
explain all this now first we need to
create a variable to go ahead and grab
our ID up here it will basically hold
our canvas this variable called CA and V
for canvas so that's what this variables
going to do is basically just gonna hold
our canvas and we're grabbing it with
the ID of draw but that's not it next we
need to create another variable that
will use the get context method so what
we're doing here is we created our first
variable called camp and then we're
creating another variable called context
and basically what I'm doing there is
call our camp object and then we're
going to call the get context method so
basically once you have the canvas
object which we got right here you need
a second step or create a second
variable that will invoke the canvases
get context method and that basically
will allow us to create a
two-dimensional drawing and the argument
that we specify is 2d
that's what you'll always specify is
just 2d so you can think of the context
as almost as your tool that you use to
draw on your canvas think of it like
that so now that we have everything
wrapped up in our nice Conte object--
then we need to call three methods and
they are always these same three methods
the move to method the line to method
and the stroke method now basically the
way this works is the starting point is
this move to method and the end point is
this line to method and then we need to
call this third method the stroke method
and this is actually the method that
will actually draw the line so these
three always need to be called now what
these are our coordinates these are
coordinates and basically what this
means is move from the left and move
from the top so for instance if I put
zero zero in here and let's just assume
this was our browser for a minute it
would start right up in this corner
right up here if I put 10 which is in
pixels it would be 10 pixels over here
so first let's go ahead and we'll
specify 10 and 10 so what basically what
this means is we're gonna come in 10
pixels from the left and 10 pixels from
the top the first again is from the left
and the second is from the top that's
the way it works and it works the same
down here the only difference here in
this case we're gonna go 400 pixels from
the left and we're gonna come 40 pixels
from the top that's the way it's gonna
work so let's go ahead and save this and
let's go ahead and open up our web page
in chrome and let's see what we get
and there is our line and take a look
ten pixels again from the left 10 pixels
from the top and for our end point 400
pixels from the left and 40 from the top
now let's go ahead and close this out
and let's tweak this a little bit let's
actually set this to zero and zero and I
want you to see what happens here let's
go ahead and launch this in chrome again
and take a look at that and now it
starts from the very left corner of the
canvas so you can see how these
coordinates work go ahead and play
around with them put in some different
coordinates and we'll continue on in the
next lecture with drawing lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
