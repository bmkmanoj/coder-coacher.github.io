load method in jQuery but first we need
to talk about the difference between the
load method and the ready function
because they do something very similar
now let's read off this first line here
jQuery ready executes when HTML document
is loaded and the Dom is ready earliest
possible and what I mean by that is
first of all while the ready only comes
with jQuery it's not available in
JavaScript now what I mean by that is
the ready event will get triggered when
the Dom is ready now remember the Dom is
just a tree and everything JavaScript
and jQuery do is based off the Dom it
works against the document object model
so obviously that needs to be built
before we can execute any script so
that's what the ready function does in
jQuery the load is very similar only it
operates it a little bit later time so
the load executes when complete page is
fully loaded including all frames
objects and images that's the important
part
so the Dom has been loaded and
everything else essentially on the
webpage has to be loaded so that's the
big difference between those two so that
being said let's go ahead and use the
load and what we'll do is put that here
and we're gonna actually check to see
when an image gets loaded so we'll
select that with our jQuery selector and
we'll just put in here I am G that's all
we need so we're gonna check when our
Caesar image is loaded and let's just do
a simple alert
so we'll put up an alert box that says
the Caesar image as well we should put
has been to be a little bit better has
been loaded and this will only get
triggered of course when this IMG is in
fact loaded of course that will trigger
the load event which will in turn kick
off this alert box so let's go ahead and
save this and let's go ahead and run
this let's run it in Firefox this time
let's do something little bit different
hey there look we got our box it says
the Caesar image has been loaded good so
that's how that works now you can also
check other things you can check if a
Windows been loaded right here right
frame so let's go ahead and just check
the window now this isn't a element so
we don't have to use quotes we can just
put in whoops now
windows we can just put in window and of
course the window has to be loaded then
the load event is triggered and we'll
get an alert box and we'll just keep the
same text here so let's go ahead and
save this let's go ahead and run it it
will run it in Firefox again and there
you can see we got our alert box so
that's how the load event works I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
