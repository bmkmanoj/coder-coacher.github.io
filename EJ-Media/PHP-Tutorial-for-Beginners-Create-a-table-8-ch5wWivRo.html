in my sequel and now we're going to
create a table because you really can't
have a database without a table right so
that's what we're gonna do now you can
see I've already created the sequel
syntax down here for this and by the way
I'll put this in the description of this
video so that you don't have to type all
of this out
so let's go ahead and review this before
we go ahead and execute this command now
of course here is the command its create
table and then we just specify the name
of the table and in this case we're
gonna call it user data now we can do
many things when we create a table but
in this instance we're just gonna create
the columns we're gonna get the columns
going first and then in the next video
we'll actually add rows will actually
insert the data and that's when we start
getting our rows which will hold all the
different people that we want to put in
our database the name and in this case
the address so here's the first column
name and that's all we put there now
this is called a variable character
field and this is just basically a data
type that we can use in my sequel and
there are different types of data types
for our purposes we only need to be
concerned about this particular data
type now this data type will basically
allow us to store either letters or
numbers in our field so that's why we
use this type of data type now this is
the max length so we're only gonna allow
up to 50 letters or numbers that's it
anything past that will get truncated
don't worry about this not know this
basically means the field can't be empty
now all we do is put a comma and then we
can create our second column which we're
gonna call address and you guessed it
we're gonna allow the user to enter
their address and we're gonna use the
same data type now obviously addresses
are usually a lot longer than names will
allow 255 characters in this particular
field and again we specify not null so
that's how that works so let's just go
ahead and copy and paste this now and
we'll go up here right click let's paste
this and we're gonna hit enter and there
you can see we didn't get much of a
message again it just says query okay
but I can assure you our table was
created and just to make sure let's go
ahead and use the describe command this
is a very useful command by the way in
my sequel it allows us to do inquiries
on particular things in this case we're
gonna do
on our table to make sure it was created
and of course the name of our table is
user data and there you can see our
table is in fact created and here you
can see we have our two fields and
basically these are our two columns and
we have the name and address it gives us
the type which of course is a variable
character field and it gives us the max
length don't worry about the rest of
these we'll talk about these later but
we just wanted to make sure that our
table was in fact created okay that's
gonna do it now in the next video we
will actually input some data see you
