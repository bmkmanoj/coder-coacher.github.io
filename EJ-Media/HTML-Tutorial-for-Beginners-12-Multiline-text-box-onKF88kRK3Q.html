single line text box in this video we're
going to look at a multi-line text box
now you would think that we would use
the input element tag like we did in the
last few videos but for some reason they
decided to give the multi-line text box
its own tag and the element tag that we
use is text area so I'll copy and paste
what I've already typed out and here you
see the text area element tag and unlike
the input element tag we need to
actually close this out and then there
are two main attributes the ros
attribute and the columns attribute and
so this is very simple if you want to
increase the size of this text box you
just add more rows or add more columns
but we're just going to use 10 and 40 so
let's go ahead and see what we got and
there you can see we have our text box
and let me just type a bunch of stuff in
here and I'll hit return let's just type
a bunch of text and I want to show you
that the browser will actually
automatically put a scrollbar in here
for us so that's pretty nice so let's
hit refresh here and clear that and like
I said we can increase the size of this
so let's make this 30 rows and we'll
make our multi-line text box 80 columns
and so let's go ahead and refresh and
there you can see we have a much larger
text box now if you want to add a label
you can and we don't necessarily have to
use the input label you can just use
simple text if you want so we'll type in
comments so this is some sort of
comments or feedback box and let's add a
break tag and we'll refresh this and you
can see now we have a nice little
comments label above our box now what if
you want to submit button to allow the
user to submit all the text they have
just written out well this is where it
gets a little strange we get to use the
input element tag again and so here you
can see what I've copy and pasted in
here so we're using the input element
tag and again I don't understand why
they had to make the text area input tag
different but they decided to and here
we're just changing the type to submit
that's what will give us a submit button
so if you'll remember in the single line
text box we had text here and that made
it a single line text box here we just
have to put in submit and we'll get a
submit button the value controls the
text of the button so
Britt Lee we're going to call it submit
but you could change this to whatever
you want so let's go ahead and refresh
our page and there you can see now we
have a nice submit button that the user
can click on when they want to submit
their feedback okay that's going to do
it for this video I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
