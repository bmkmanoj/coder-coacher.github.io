tutorial today we're going to look at
the difference between primitive
variables and reference variables and
we've been doing these all along in the
previous tutorials
I just didn't explain the difference
because we really didn't have a good
understanding of what objects are but by
now we all should know what objects are
because we've been dealing with them and
talking about them in the last 10 or 15
tutorials now if we go up here I've
written out the three types of variable
names that we've called this yes it's a
primitive variable and we'll get to that
in a minute we've also called this an
instance variable and we've called this
an object variable an instance variable
because we get a new instance of this
variable when we create our object and
an object variable because as part of
that object right the object that gets
created now we're going to deal with
primitive variables so we don't really
care about these two names anymore we're
just going to get rid of those we're
going to deal with a primitive variable
a primitive variable is simply one of
those data types that we always use like
we use an int or a double and we give it
a specific value that's a primitive
variable so you remember there was
double int a long float where we assign
this a simple value in this case 20 or
in this case the decimal we give it a
5.5 now what about objects though
because yes when we create a new object
we're actually create a variable here
right this is a variable even though we
actually call this our object it's
actually a variable because we're using
this equal we're assigning what gets
built by this constructor to this name
and the actual long name of this is it's
called an object reference variable and
you might be like wow what does that
mean well it means yes that it's related
to this object but it's not actually the
object it represents a way to get to the
specific instance of that object but
keep in mind we could have several
different instances of this remember we
could create multiple objects of this
and this just tells us which instance to
go to so keep that in mind I like to
think of it kind of like a street sign I
kind of like to use that as the analogy
so think of it like the street sign is
not the actual road that you drive in
right it's just telling you that that's
the road that you're on but it's not the
actual road well it's the same thing for
objects this isn't the actual object it
just represents a way to get to a
specific
instance that object so we're not
actually going to run this code but
let's just say we did run it and we get
our object over here on the right and
there it is it's just a road object and
so it got constructed here and then this
name now basically associates it with
this object that's in memory right
remember the object gets put into a
memory and the actual memory is called
the heap so that's where the physical
object is and this is just a name that's
pointing and telling you that this is
the actual object now it's where I live
some you know a road will run through
different towns and each town might
actually call that road a different name
even though it's the same Road so we
could come down here and create a new
object reference variable and not have
to use the constructor right we already
constructed it up here but we just want
to create a new reference to it so we
would just come down here and use our
Road class and call this maple road and
put mile 15 and so all we did was say
hey maple roads value its reference
value equals what mile 15 s was it goes
to this object over here and that's why
I put this up here actually I mean
remember we did this in earlier
tutorials we're just saying the same
thing you know the same thing with this
primitive area y equals X's value which
is 20 so again this is an instance of
our road object and this is referring to
this instance of that road object now
let's say we want another road object
well we know how to do that we come here
and say Road and this is going to be
Smith Road and we're going to say this
equals and now we're going to invoke a
new object of the road class and so the
constructor will get invoked it'll go
build a new object of this road and it
will place it down here and this is a
new instance of the road so it's another
road object so it's allocated its own
memory in the heap so this reference
object variable refers to this instance
of the road object because we could have
a dozen or 100 Road objects how would we
know which one is which well that's the
way it's done and it's the same thing
with streets by the way if they didn't
have names how would you know which
street to go to we'd never know so it's
the same concept now you don't have to
get too caught up in these
idiosyncrasies some people just like to
think of this hey that's my object I'm
creating my object now you know I'm not
going to call this an object reference
variable I just think of this whole
thing is my AB
and to go back to the street analogy for
a second it's kind of the same idea
right you know if someone called me up
and said hey can you meet me on Main
Street I don't think I'd say hey you
know that word you just used Main Street
that really isn't the road that just is
a reference to the road that's not the
actual road well you see you see where
I'm getting here so anyways I hope this
helped explain the difference between a
primitive variable and an object
reference variable and I will see you
guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
