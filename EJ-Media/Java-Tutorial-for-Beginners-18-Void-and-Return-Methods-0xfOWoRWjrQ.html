we are going to look at methods and
specifically we're going to look at void
and return now we've all seen that void
keyword here and you guys are probably
wondering what that means well it's
pretty simple it basically means that
you're not going to return a value so
that's all you need to remember about
void you're not returning anything and
return well that's pretty obvious too
you're just going to return a value so
those are opposites and so if you have
void in your method you're not going to
return anything and if you return
something you have to use the return
keyword and I'll show you that now
we're going to use two classes here that
I've created a hamburger joint and food
we're going to create our food class
template over here and we're going to
serve the food in our restaurant
hamburger joint all right so let's go
ahead and create a variable and it's
going to be a string variable and we're
going to call this food a now if you
remember in the previous tutorial when I
talked about access modifiers I
indicated it's a good habit to make your
variables private unless you have a
really good reason to make it public so
let's go ahead and start making some of
these private and remember what I said
is we access these then through our
public methods so it's just a good habit
to do that so let's go ahead and create
a constructor and remember your
constructor name has to match your class
name if you haven't watched my
constructor tutorial you probably should
I think it's number 16 or something you
should go back and watch that and we're
going to go ahead and pass in a string
here when it call this string a and then
of course we need our famous squiggly
brackets and here is where we're going
to give this constructor a value and
we're just going to put that and if you
remember we don't actually assign the
value here this constructor gets built
or used when we use it as an object over
here and we will actually assign the
value over here if you remember we don't
assign it here so this is kind of a fake
value if you remember now let's actually
create the methods that we're going to
do for this tutorial to explain how
return and void work so let's go ahead
and make our method public remember we
want our method public so we can access
it from
our main program and that way we can get
to our private variable because remember
this method will have access to this
private variable because it's in the
same class and we're going to return a
string value so we'll type in string
here and we're going to name this method
get food and we need parentheses to
declare that this is a method and then
we're going to return and there we use
the return keyword because we're going
to be returning a value here and we're
going to be returning this value right
here food a so we're going to say food a
in other words you're going to be
returning whatever this value is
determined to be when we use the
constructor over here we'll put our
value in and it'll be passed in over
here and then this will return it okay
now you'll notice if we put void here
we're going to get some intellisense
saying hey you can't do that so if you
remember I said these two don't go
together when you're saying when you put
void here there is no return value so
we'd have to get rid of this but we do
want to return we want a return of a
string so we go ahead and type that in
and everything's fine again so let's go
ahead and put in a comma here so use
return when a value is returned pretty
self-explanatory okay and let's go ahead
and set up our void method now and we
use the keyword void and we're going to
call this method system print and we're
just going to do a system print of this
value right here so we'll go S out now
you can do s out and then tab and that
gives you system dot out dot print a lot
faster than having to type that whole
thing out and we're just going to put in
the variable here which is food a and
let's put in some comments to void only
if nothing is returned so nothing is
being returned we're just doing a system
print of this value okay so let's go
ahead and set up our program now so
let's declare our object and we're going
to use this class food so we specify
that right here and we're going to call
this serving let's call this serving a
and we're going to say this is a new
object
and we're going to go ahead and call our
constructor and since we said over here
that this is going to be a string we're
going to call this a hamburger that's
what we're going to be serving okay so
now we need to invoke both of our
methods that we defined over here so
first let's go ahead and work against
this method the method that returned a
value here and we're going to go ahead
and do a s out I like to call that s out
now and we're going to specify serving a
hit dot and here's where we see our
method get food now remember since this
is public we can access this from our
program over here so get food and if we
run this we get hamburger there you go
and let's go ahead and call our void
method over here now so we'll do serving
a dot and there it is system print and
we'll go ahead and run this and we
should get to hamburgers and we did so
you'll notice this one's a little bit
different since we were doing our print
here just a straight print we didn't
actually have to do a system print
before this we're just calling this
method which is already doing this print
and again this method returns nothing is
just doing a print of this value whereas
this one this get food method that we
defined right here is actually passing
through this value a value is getting
returned here which is hamburger so
that's how this works it's pretty simple
now there are some nuances with void you
can actually put in arguments in here
but we're not going to get into that in
this tutorial I will show you that later
but you already understand 95% of this
by just understanding that a method
either return something or it does not
return something at that basic level you
already understand 90% of it in the next
tutorial we will discuss the keyword
static we'll finally get to that so I'll
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
