jQuery UI filesystem in our web folder
and so now we can go ahead and start
adding widgets which is really the fun
part and the first widget we're gonna
add is one of the most popular widgets
the date picker widget and you can
really add that to any element you want
so let's go ahead and we'll put it in
our first section now there's a couple
ways you can do that you could just add
it right to the div or you could create
an input element and if you took my HTML
series you will remember those input
elements that we talked about you can
add it to one of those type of elements
as well so that's what we're gonna do
and let's go ahead and just put it below
our second paragraph and let's go ahead
and type in some text here pick a travel
date there we go
and let's go ahead and add our input
element and we'll set the type to text
and you'll remember that will give us a
one-line text box and now we need to
create an ID so that we can grab it in
our jQuery code and we'll just set the
ID to something let's just set it to
pick date that works okay good let's go
ahead and save everything here and let's
just go ahead and refresh our page and
make sure our one-line text box is there
and it is so now what we want to do is
actually put our date calendar inside
this one line text box so let's go down
to our jQuery code and let's go ahead
and we'll just keep this jQuery code I
guess we're not gonna really do anything
with these buttons in this video but
we'll go ahead and save it so let's put
our next set of jQuery code right below
our click function and let's go ahead
and of course we need a dollar sign and
of course we're going to select the ID
that we created up there which of course
is pick date now the method that we're
going to use is called date picker what
a schock right and it's just a method
that we can call in our jQuery UI and
that is it it's really that simple
that's all we have to do and this should
give us a nice calendar where we can
select a date so let's go ahead and save
this let's refresh our page and let's
click inside this box and look at that
we got a calendar and we even got
today's date which is the 20th and if we
select let's select some date in the
future here let's go out to April 20th
and you can see the date is even stored
in our text box which is what we want
and so you can see how nice this jQuery
UI really is you can get a lot of
functionality from just a few lines of
code and with just a few lines of code
we were able to add this really nice
date picker to our web page now the nice
thing about the jQuery UI and let's
actually just click back in here and you
can see it kind that's kind of cool it
actually keeps the date for you as well
and if you select a new date it should
update it and it did but the nice thing
about the jQuery UI and some of these
widgets is that it provides a lot of
different options you get all this extra
functionality that we can put inside of
our argument right here and we'll talk
about those options in the next video
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
