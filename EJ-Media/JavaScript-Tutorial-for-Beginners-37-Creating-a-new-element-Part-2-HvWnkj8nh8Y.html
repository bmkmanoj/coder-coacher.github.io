for the first time and when we clicked
on this button we got this paragraph
right here in this video we're going to
add another element what we want to do
is add a heading for our new section
here because this is in fact a new
battle so we want to add a heading and
we want the heading to appear before our
paragraph so let's flip to our code and
here is the code of course we created
from the last video now remember I told
you that JavaScript will add the element
after the last element it finds within
that diff so obviously we need to create
our heading code before we create the
paragraph element because we want the
heading to come first of course so since
we're adding some more code here let's
actually create some comments so we'll
say this creates a paragraph good and
then we'll just copy and paste this and
we'll create an area here for our
heading that we're about to create and
we'll say this creates a heading good
and of course we can use the same code
like I said that we created in the last
video so let's go ahead and just copy
and paste this and let's use a different
variable name we'll call this element H
for heading and we'll put an h2 here and
so this will create our h2 heading above
our paragraph we can go ahead and use
this again and of course this will hold
our div now since we're creating this up
here we no longer need this code down
here because we can attach as many
different elements to this main object
once we've created it we don't need to
create this again because that just adds
extra overhead so let's go ahead and get
rid of this line now good so now that we
have our h2 heading element created we
of course need to append the child to
the div and we can just go ahead and
copy and paste this and of course now
we're going to be attaching a new object
and of course that is element H and then
of course we need to create our text
node for our heading and we're going to
call that the
battle of salamis much shorter than what
we had in the last video in terms of
text and actually let's add some quotes
here well okay let's just move this
there we go
and then you will remember once we've
created a text note we actually have to
attach the text node and we need to
attach that of course to the heading
node that we created up here so let's
just go ahead and copy and paste this
and of course this will be element H and
you know what we're going to give this
text another variable name too so let's
call that text H and text H good and you
know what we need a T here for thee that
wouldn't work too well
okay so let's save everything up and
let's go run our web page in chrome and
let's see if this works and if we hit
our button out there you can see now we
have a complete section the battle of
salamis so now we have a full section so
let's close this out now you might be
wondering if we can add an element we
should be able to remove an element and
that's what we're going to do in the
next video see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
