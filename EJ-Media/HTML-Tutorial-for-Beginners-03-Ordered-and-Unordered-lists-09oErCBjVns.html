today we're going to look at unordered
and ordered lists now lists are pretty
much an everyday part of life right
we're constantly putting together lists
you know you think of a recipe and you
have to have a list of ingredients if
you go to the grocery store you have to
have a list of items you have to buy and
if you look at virtually every webpage
they will always have some sort of list
and whether that's a menu or just a
bullet list we're always putting
together lists now HTML provides two
main ways to do lists unordered and
ordered lists and as we looked at in the
previous lessons it's just a simple tag
that we need to create and so an
unordered list is created with the UL
tag and an ordered list is created with
the Oh L tag now I will say right off
the bat that unordered lists is kind of
the default thing people use when
they're designing websites I would say
ordered lists are used to a lesser
extent but we'll look at both of these
today now it's common to both unordered
and ordered lists is the li element tag
now the L element is actually the list
item and I will show you that here in a
few minutes
so again unordered lists and ordered
lists and again both will use the Li
element tag which is embedded inside
either the O L or the UL element and so
let's first take a look at an unordered
list ok so within our body tag and
remember everything goes within the body
element so let's go ahead and create our
UL tag and then let's go ahead and close
it and now we've got our unordered list
element now let's hit the tab button so
that we can read these easier and then
create a couple spaces and then we'll
create our first Li tag and remember
this is where our actual list element
goes so let's imagine we're creating a
menu for our website and we want to sell
CDs DVDs and blu-ray so the first list
item that will put will be CD so again
we'll just close that and we can go
ahead now and just go ahead and copy and
paste that and we have to create another
list item for our DVD
and let's go ahead and create a list
element for blu rays okay great and
actually let's create a space there and
now this is nice and neat and so now
we've got our nice list that we want to
display on our webpage and of course we
use the list tag to accomplish that so
let's go ahead now and render this
webpage and let's save this as an HTML
document and there you see we've got our
nice list here displayed now later on
when we get to the CSS tutorials we will
actually use this HTML ordered list and
create a very fancy menu we'll use CSS
to style each one of these lists element
tags and create nice hover menus and add
colors and all sorts of things but for
now you need to understand how the HTML
works at a base level before we get to
CSS so let's go ahead and go back into
the code and we'll look at an ordered
list now and it's very similar actually
we just need to actually we'll do a
little bit of copy and pasting here so
we'll just take this and we will just
create our Oh L tags here and let's go
ahead and save this as an HTML file
again and there you see the difference
this is why this is called a ordered
list because we have numbers here that's
really the only difference this one
creates bullets and this one creates
numbers so it's really what you prefer
to use now later on when we get to CSS
like I said we will style each one of
these tags and create a lot of different
effects and one of the things you can do
is you can actually remove these bullet
points and numbers with CSS but again
we'll get to that when we get to CSS ok
that's going to do it for this HTML
video I will see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
