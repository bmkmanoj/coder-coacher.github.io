talked about error handling in Java and
we're going to introduce one more
concept and that involves using the
finally block now you will remember in
the last video we set up our try block
and then we set up to catch blocks after
that and when this line of code executes
right here where we try to divide by
zero an exception occurred and of course
we handled it right down here with this
catch block and then you'll remember the
way this is set up the program will no
longer execute and everything is
basically done at that point and so this
second line was not executed now what if
you wanted this set of code executed
well as we talked about you could put
this in another try catch or you could
put it in the finally block and you can
see I've created that right down here
here is the finally block and this is
where we will actually put this code and
if you miss but a couple points and I
put some comments here so that you'll
have these first and the most critical
one here is you have to place the
finally block after the try block and
all catch blocks it must come last
because that's what it literally means
it's the final deal and the second point
is the code will run no matter what
happens in the try block so once this
exception occurs up here when we try to
divide by zero and we handle it in our
catch the program then should move down
and execute any code we have in the
finally block whether an exception has
occurred or not that's really the key
point so it literally is the last stop
so let's go ahead and copy and paste all
of this code and we're gonna put it down
in the finally block so this should now
be executed after we hit our first
exception it doesn't even matter if we
leave it up here we can and actually we
don't need this system down out print
anymore we'll get rid of that and let's
go ahead and actually print out the
number one element so that we don't
throw an exception here so let's go
ahead and save this and now let's go
ahead and run this and we'll see if this
actually works and it should and there
you can see it worked we hit our
exception in our try block and then it
came down and executed all the code that
we had in our finally block okay that is
going to do it for this video we will
move on to new topics in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
