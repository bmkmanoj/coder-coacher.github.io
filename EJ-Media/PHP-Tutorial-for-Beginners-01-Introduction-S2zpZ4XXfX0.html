I have had numerous requests to do this
so I'm going to listen to my subscribers
so before we get started what are the
prerequisites for this course it's a
really good idea to have an
understanding of HTML and CSS if you are
not acquainted with those subjects and
those are available on my main channel
page if you want to take those series
what will you need for this series and
we're going to talk about this mainly in
the next video
xam pp I like to call it zamp and
notepad plus plus we'll talk about that
again
in the next video setting all that up
what is PHP PHP is a server-side
scripting language designed primarily
for web development ok so let's take a
look at this diagram and we'll see how
PHP at a very basic level works now you
have a potential user who's on his
workstation and he's browsing the web
and he comes across your website a
client web browser request is then
initiated to the web server where your
entire website is located it will have
all of your CSS files my sequel
everything that you need for your
website including your PHP files they
reside on the web server so this client
web browser request comes in and the
server runs the PHP script and generates
a new page a new page file which has an
extension of PHP but it comes back and
this is the important point it comes
back as HTML remember browsers only use
HTML so all PHP script processing is
done on the web server and the final
product that comes back is in HTML so
think of it this way the client web
browser request comes in the PHP script
runs and when it's done it finally puts
everything back in an HTML document to
ship back whatever it is you want to
ship back all of the PHP code is run on
the server and then again it generates
HTML and sends it back to the user so at
a basic level that's exactly how PHP
works so what does all this mean
well HTML pages by themselves are very
static and boring PHP will give life to
your pages by making them interactive
you can do so many things with PHP you
can handle forms you can fire off emails
when someone subscribes to your
website you can make calls to a database
it goes on and on and we will cover all
of those subjects in this series okay in
the next video we are going to set up
all the software that we need and I will
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
