we can go ahead and create a linux image
and the Linux distribution I'm going to
use is in boon to that is my personal
favorite now you may have another
distribution such as Red Hat or
something like that that you want to use
and that is fine it's pretty much the
same process for creating an image on
VirtualBox so if you want to go ahead
and use another ISO that is fine but in
this video we're going to go ahead and
use and Boon too so the first thing you
need to do is download the Ambu - ISO
and as usual I will give you the link to
this download so you're going to go
ahead and hit and boom to desktop and
then you're gonna come to another page
called the download and boon to desktop
and we want this LTS version right here
so you're gonna go ahead and hit
download but you're not done yet
then you have to come down here and hit
this not now take me to the download now
if you want to go ahead and donate to
Pay Pal feel free but I'm just gonna go
ahead and hit not now take me to the
download now this is a large file it's
about 1.5 gig so this may take some time
depending on the speed of your
connection so go ahead and hit the pause
button and when you have it down go
ahead and restart the video okay so I'm
going to assume that you have the file
down now what I've done is I've created
a folder on my C Drive called Linux and
then I created a folder called desktop
for the ISO and there you can see we
have it right there so now we can go
ahead and create our image on VirtualBox
so the first thing we're going to do is
go ahead and hit new and then you're
gonna go ahead and name the image and
I'm just gonna go ahead and call this
Linux and Boon - real simple and look it
already picked the version that we want
in boone - 64-bit now you can see all
these different versions out here again
if you wanted to use RedHat you could or
some of the other different flavors but
we're gonna go ahead and use in boot to
64-bit then you're gonna go ahead and
hit next now here's where you pick the
memory size I'm gonna go ahead and use
four gigs but you can pick whatever size
you want to use here depending on how
much RAM you have on your machine so
we're gonna go ahead and hit next and
now what we're gonna do is create the
virtual hard disk so we'll go ahead and
hit create and the default is VDI that's
what we want the VirtualBox disk image
so we'll hit next to that and then we
want the dynamically allocated amount
and I'm gonna go ahead and just take
their default which is 10 gig and there
we have our image created
but we're not done yet so we need to go
ahead now and start the image which you
can do right here now
you're gonna get this message where it's
looking for the startup disk and of
course we just downloaded that so you're
gonna go ahead and navigate to that and
in this case I created that folder
called Linux and here is the ISO so
let's go ahead and open that up and I'm
just gonna hit start now up here you can
hit don't show these messages again
that's usually what I do and they'll
keep popping them up so I just say don't
show them again now it may take some
time to set up the software so let's go
ahead and actually expand this out but
before we do that so you can see now
that this is a virtual image right my
host is actually this Windows image
right here so this is a virtual image
that we have of Linux now that is
running on VirtualBox and let's go ahead
and actually expand this out and you can
see how VirtualBox actually sizes this
appropriately very nice now you're gonna
get prompted to configure and Boon too
and what we're gonna do is go ahead and
install and boom - so I'm gonna hit that
and we're just gonna hit continue here
but if you want to go ahead and select
this download updates while installing
Ubuntu you can certainly do that I'm
just gonna hit continue here and you do
want to erase the disk and install and
boot it do not worry this is not going
to affect your hosts
we're just affecting the linux image
that we've created and that's the nice
thing about virtual images you only
affect the virtual image not the host
itself and that's why a lot of people
are increasingly using virtual images so
we'll just hit install now and we're
gonna hit continue again and then it's
gonna ask where are you and I'm just
gonna say New York even though I'm in
Michigan but I'll just say New York and
then you pick the language in my case it
is English now you need to put in your
name now here you can create the name of
your linux image i'm just gonna go ahead
and stick with that i'm gonna stick with
the username of Ernie and I'm just gonna
keep the password the same as my name
Ernie and I can give that out because I
don't think anybody's gonna want to hack
into this and I'm actually gonna go
ahead and select the login automatically
since this is just a test machine and
then the installation will continue and
again depending on how fast your machine
is this may take some time
now if you're really bored you can go
ahead and watch all these nice features
that in Boone to provides
okay there you can see the installation
is complete so let's go ahead and
restart now okay so we have our boon to
desktop loaded up here so let's go ahead
and see if we can log in and everything
looks great so let's just go ahead and
make sure the image is working okay if
you want to remove things from the
launcher you can just right click on it
and hit unlock from launcher and then
it's gone
and let's make sure the terminal is
working so you go up here and here's
where you can do a search and you just
type in terminal start to type it in and
then just pick the terminal and there
you can see it's working just fine and
this is what we're gonna be using in the
Linux tutorial for beginner series so
you're going to get quite accustomed to
using them right so let's go ahead and
power off our image now so you just go
up here and close out the image you'll
be prompted to either save the machine
state send the shut down signal or power
off the machine
I always power off the machine and there
you can see it takes us back to our
VirtualBox manager so you can see how
powerful this VirtualBox manager is okay
