the title and alt attributes within HTML
now we'll first talk about the title
attribute now it used to be in HTML 4
you could only place the title attribute
in particular elements you were
restricted in terms of the types of
elements where you could place the title
attribute but in HTML 5 they change that
and you can basically put the title
attribute in any element tag that you
wish so if you wanted I don't know why
you do this but you could actually put
it within the HTML root element tag you
could do that but for the most part
usually you're going to put these inside
an IMG element or a paragraph element
something like that where content is
actually displayed on your web page and
what the title attribute basically does
is it creates a nice little tooltip when
you hover over a particular HTML element
and in this case when we hover over our
Caesar image we should get a nice
tooltip and so let's go ahead and put
that in here and all you do is type in
title for the title attribute and then
we need to put in some text and in this
case we'll just say Julius Caesar so
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page and now let's hover
over the Caesar image and there you can
see we got our nice tooltip Julius
Caesar now later on in CSS and
especially jQuery we will actually
format this tool tip and make it much
more presentable now let's talk about
the alt attribute and basically that
stands for alternate and it's alternate
text for an image so what it really
allows is in case we can't display this
image for some reason say we have the
wrong path or the image is no longer
there you can display alternate text so
that at least something is displayed and
so that's why you would use the alt
attribute now you should use text that
is relevant to the image that you're
trying to display so we wouldn't put
Alexander the Great here we probably
should put in Julius Caesar and so
that's what we're going to do so we go
ahead and type in alt for alternate and
then we put in whatever text we want to
and in this case as I said we'll just
put in Julius Caesar now we have to
actually change the name of our image
here so that it doesn't load and then we
will have our text from our alt
attribute displayed so we'll put a 1
here
on the end let's go ahead and save this
let's refresh our page and there you can
see our image is no longer displayed but
we got the text displayed from our alt
attribute okay that's going to do it for
this video I will see you guys in the
next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
