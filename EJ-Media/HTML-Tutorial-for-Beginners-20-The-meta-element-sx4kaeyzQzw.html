meta element now the meta elements are
always put inside the head element so
they will always go inside the head
element and the reason is because meta
elements are not visible to your web
user and as you can see over here on the
webpage none of the meta elements appear
they will not appear on your web page
and so the user will not see them they
are merely to tell search engines about
your web page and so you can provide all
this information to the search engines
using meta elements now we create a meta
element using the meta tag you can see
that right here and you'll notice we
don't have a closing meta tag you only
have an opening meta tag and then you
just have to close it with a typical
angle bracket so again it does not have
a closing tag
now meta tags use attributes to provide
information to the search engine and
there are different types of values for
the name attribute and it is the type of
value that gives each meta element its
identity and so again the meta elements
are differentiated by what value you set
the name attribute to first one we're
going to look at is description and
that's probably the most important one
and the two attributes that you use are
the name attribute and the content
attribute and in this one we're going to
use the description value to provide a
description to a search engine about our
webpage so this identifies it as
description and then we put whatever
content we want for our description in
the content attribute and I said this is
a webpage about fish we cover all the
fish in the world so again this
description is used by search engines to
understand what your web page is all
about now there's about a maximum of 155
characters so you should only put a few
sentences in here because sometimes this
is actually displayed in the search
results so when you go out and do a
search on google it'll pull up the
website and then you'll see a
description right under it and I'll show
you an example right now
this is PBS's website i did a google
search for this and here is their
description so this is being pulled from
that meta element description tag they
put all this in a meta element that use
the description value so that's what
they put
here you can see it's kind of being cut
off so remember I told you you have
about a hundred fifty-five characters
you can see right here it's being cut
off so again you want to keep that to a
few sentences now the next one we're
going to look at is key words
now key words are words that a web user
might search to find a particular page
most search engines don't use this
anymore for instance Google has said
that they do not use this so they will
not use this to rank your website
however I usually put it in my website
because some foreign search engines
still very much use this so it's not a
bad idea to throw a few keywords what
you think people might search for so
again I just put in fish because this is
a fish website I put an ocean and
aquarium I think I spelled aquarium
wrong if so again it's just the keywords
that you think people will put into
Google now the next one we set to author
now you'll notice we use a different
attribute here so instead of using name
we just use HTTP - acquit but it pretty
much does the same thing and this is
just putting in the author of the
website so again we set the value to
author and we put in our name here
whoever the author of the website is and
the final one tells the search engine
what language your webpage is in again
we use the HTTP - equiv attribute and we
set this to content - language that's
the value and then we use en - us to say
that this is in English and again that
tells the search engine what language
it's in and then what country it's from
in this case the u.s. I think French
would be something like FR FR actually
so if you want to put these in different
languages you can actually look these up
out on google now I will point out one
thing if you do not put in a description
in the browser we'll do it for you and
it might not describe your website very
well so again of all the meta elements I
recommend you to at a minimum you use
this one okay that's going to do it for
this video see you guys in the next
