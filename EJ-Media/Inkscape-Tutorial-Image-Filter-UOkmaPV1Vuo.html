image effects if you want to import a
photo into Inkscape you can go up to
file and hit import you can also just
click and drag it into the workspace now
I will point out that BMP file types are
the best type of image formats to use
when you're using these image effects I
find them easier to use then rather than
using like PNG or JPEG images so again
try to use BMP if you can for the format
I'm going to be using one photo to show
you this is a street level view and it's
usually pretty good type of photo to
test out the various effects now to get
to image effects you go up to filters
and you go to image effects and you can
see there's about 15 of these here now
edge detect horizontal edge detect and
vertical edge detect are very similar so
I will show you those at the end of this
presentation so first let's select age
and you can see it makes it look like a
kind of like a 1920s photo an old photo
so if you have a photo that you want to
make it look like some Wild West photo
you can go ahead and use the aged filter
so let's right-click and undo that will
print it makes it look like it's a
blueprint and that's kind of a cool
effect as well and then you can also
make it look like a drawing and you can
see here that didn't work quite as well
as the blueprint did so again the
success of these depends on the photo
that you're using some photos will look
particularly better than other photos
but generic street-level view photos are
usually pretty good to test these
options out film grain is probably one
of the most popular film effects and it
gives your image kind of a retro look
the liquid drawing effect is pretty neat
too you can kind of make it look like
it's from behind a pane of glass if you
want and so that's kind of neat as well
now let's take a look at the oil
painting effect and you'll see here it
didn't really do much and I'm kind of
glad that happened because I want to
make another point if you go back you
can actually run it again and it'll
distorted even more and if we do it
another time it'll just sort it even
again so you can see it starts to look
more like an oil painting so the point
here is that the effect doesn't really
take effect you can keep a
it over and over again to distort it
more to get the desired effect that you
want and you see we have to undo this
three times to get back to where we were
all right let's check out old post card
and as you can see that didn't do a lot
so let's go ahead and run it again it's
starting to make it look more like some
sort of post card as you can see some of
these don't quite have the desired
effect that you want and there you can
see so it's starting to make it look
like kind of like a postcard effect so
let's undo that pencil drawings usually
pretty cool and that usually works
pretty good as you can see it looks like
a pencil drawing now and that actually
came out really well in my opinion I
don't use sharpen too much so you can
see that didn't do a whole lot I usually
don't use that one a lot
sharpened more is kind of the same thing
so our focus lens is really cool now you
can do this to particular areas if you
want if you want to blur your photograph
and make it look like you use a soft
focus lens and let's go ahead and apply
that one more time and you even get more
of a blur effect so that's useful okay
so let's go ahead and reduce this about
here actually let's right about there
and then I'm going to go ahead and
duplicate this and we'll move it here
and I'm going to show you now these
different image effects edge effect and
now let's go ahead and do a horizontal
edge effect and as you can see these are
very close this one obviously has more
detail because this is just rendering
the image horizontally so you can see
this first one - the one I like so I
like to use a little bit more let's undo
that actually let's undo this one too
let's go back and redo the whoops and
let's actually go back and apply the
horizontal edge effect and over here
we'll do the vertical edge effect so you
can see the difference now you can see
how this one renders it vertically and
this one is doing it
horizontally soo this wire here we see
in this one but here we don't even see
it so that's how those work and that
wraps it up for this tutorial please
