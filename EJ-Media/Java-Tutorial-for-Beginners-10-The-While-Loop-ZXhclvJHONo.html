beginning Java in this tutorial we will
be dealing with the while loop now if
you remember in the last video we were
dealing with for loops those were quite
complex we had three sections that we
had to be concerned with the while loop
is a lot easier to deal with it only has
one section that you need to be
concerned with and that is a conditional
test the while statement will test the
condition at the beginning of the loop
before any statements in the loop have
been handled and if it keeps testing out
true the loop will keep going around and
around
also if the testing condition never
changes the loop will just keep going
around indefinitely so you have to be a
little bit careful unless that is what
you are intending alrighty then let's
get started we're going to define a
variable we're going to call that let's
call that top number and we're going to
say that is equal to 15 and then we're
going to define another variable and
we're going to call that the bottom
number we're going to say that is equal
to 1 actually we got to put in our
semicolons and now we will type in the
wild keyword and that will kick off our
while loop we have to type in open
parenthesis and like I said before we
only have to be concerned with one
section here so this is much easier than
the for loop and we will set a condition
here in the condition we're going to set
is we're going to say the bottom number
must be less than the top number and if
it is not then the loop will end and
what we're going to do in this loop is
to a system dot out dot print so let's
do that and we are going to print out
the line this is a loop now if we just
ran this program here it would loop
indefinitely and the reason is is we
have not incremented this bottom
variable here so we need to do that now
so we
we specify here bottom number and we use
the plus plus operator to increment this
one each time the loop is run so I think
we are all set now let's go ahead and
run this and we should get a bunch of
lines printed out and we did and I
believe this will equal 14 lines so
let's let's run through this so
basically this looped around each time
and incremented the bottom number
variable by one each time when it hit 15
this condition was no longer true
because the bottom number equaled the
top number the bottom number was 15 and
that equals the top number so it exited
out of the program now what I want to
show you let's say we set this bottom
number to 16 so the first run is going
to be false so it won't even get to this
statement it will stop right here
because the bottom number is now larger
than a top number we say and that would
be a false condition so let's go ahead
and run that I'm expecting we will not
get any output here and we did not so
that's how while loops are done and I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
