basics about the circle tool so let's go
over here and create a circle and you
can see there we just create a nice
elliptical circle now if you want to
create a symmetrically perfect circle
you hold down the control button and
there you can see it sizes it correctly
and all the proportions are
symmetrically correct
now this little circle here can be
dragged and it will control the arc so
you can see there we just created an arc
you'll notice up here now these buttons
are now highlighted so if you wanted to
segment this you just select this button
here switch to segment and you get these
Knights segments now you can switch it
back if you want to an arc or you can
switch it back to a circle now if you
want to be more precise with these nodes
you can use these two fields up here
there's a starting node and there's an
ending node so you can control both
nodes and we can create like a pacman
and again you'll see that these are
highlighted so you turn this into a
segment you can turn it back to an arc
you can turn it a segment and back to a
circle now let's create another arc and
if we click on another tool and you come
back here to draw another circle you'll
notice it creates more arcs you have to
set it back to circle if you want to
create new circles so let's delete all
these circles now by selecting all and
then cutting and let's create a new
circle now to change the colors of the
circle and the border go up to object
get filling stroke this width here we'll
adjust the size of the border you can
see we size it down and then if you want
to size it up we put it 244 you get this
much wider border now if you want to
adjust this border color go to stroke
paint and you can see here you can
select whatever color you want on the
wheel you can also use RGB but I like to
use the wheel if we want to adjust the
color in the center of the circle go to
fill and it's the same process now let's
create one more circle and then go up to
edit and hit select all and to combine
these you go to path and hit combine
reselect both of them and now these are
combined and so that's going to do it
for this tutorial I hope you
on this useful and please check out my
