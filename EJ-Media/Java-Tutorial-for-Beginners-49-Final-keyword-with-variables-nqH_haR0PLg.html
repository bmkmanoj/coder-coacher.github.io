final keyword now there are three ways
to use the final keyword you can put it
in front of a class you can put it in
front of a method and you can put it in
front of a variable in this video we're
going to discuss using it in a variable
so let's go ahead and type it in and you
guessed it all you put in is the keyword
final and what this does is it basically
says that when this variable field
length gets initialized this is the
value and that's it you cannot change
this value to anything else now let's
just make an assumption that we were
coding a game here and specifically it's
a football game and we wanted the length
of that field to be 100 yards now
obviously it can't be any other number
we only want it at 100 yards so it's
something that will never change so I
can go ahead and mark this variable as
final and this value cannot be altered
by a method later on and so yeah I just
created this simple program just to show
you the concept you really only need to
know the concept here at this point so
let's go ahead and run this and of
course we get 100 now let's create a
method and we'll try to alter this value
so let's go ahead and pretend for a
minute we're going to create a set
method to assign a new value to our
field length variable so we'll just type
in what void set length and we need of
course our parentheses and then let's
try to give this a value now and we'll
try to set this to 90 yards instead of
100 and there you see we get some
intellisense and it says cannot assign a
value to final variable field length so
that proves my point once you put this
keyword here that is it you can't use
actually this should be length but that
proves my point once you put this
keyword here to final this value cannot
be changed by a method later on now if
we take this final keyword off the
intellisense goes away and then we can
go ahead and change the value of this
variable if we want to but we don't want
to change so we're going
to just remove this method okay in the
next few videos we will talk about using
the final keyword with classes and with
methods see you guys that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
