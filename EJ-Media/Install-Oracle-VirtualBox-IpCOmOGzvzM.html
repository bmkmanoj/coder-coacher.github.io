to install Oracle VirtualBox
an Oracle VirtualBox allows you to
create images of any OS out there and
this has become an essential tool for
any developer or QA tester because again
it allows you to create as many images
as you want so you can bounce around
from host to host to test your code very
quickly so this is a very easy install
and actually this will be a very quick
video because we're just gonna cover the
install and then in the next two videos
we'll actually talk about setting up an
actual image so what I first want you to
do is go to the VirtualBox website and I
will provide the link to that in the
description of this video and what I
want you to do is go ahead and select
this option right here windows host once
you have the software down you'll have a
file that looks something like this and
this is just a simple executable so I
want you to go ahead and double click
that and then you're gonna get the
installation wizard and you'll just hit
next right here
now in the second dialog box you can
specify the directory where you want to
install it in this case we're just gonna
go ahead and use the default so go ahead
and hit next and I'm gonna go ahead and
keep all of these checked so we're just
gonna hit next here and you're gonna get
this warning message just go ahead and
hit yes to that and then you're going to
go ahead and kick off the installation
now if your prop it for any user account
control access or any drivers just go
ahead and hit yes and here we have the
device driver that Oracle wants to
install and I'm just gonna go ahead and
hit always trust Oracle Corporation
okay the installation is complete and go
ahead and start up the oracle virtualbox
just to make sure it works and it does
now in the next video we're actually
going to go ahead and set up a linux
image now if you're more interested in
Windows I will show you how to do that
as well and that would be the third
video so you can watch the particular
video that interests you or you can just
simply watch both of the videos if you
want to setup a Linux and a Windows
image okay thanks as always for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
