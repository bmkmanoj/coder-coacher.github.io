be taking a look at directories in Linux
and this is a very very important topic
because if you're gonna be learning
about Linux you're going to be dealing
with directories quite a bit now if we
take a look at this diagram here Linux
is organized in a hierarchical directory
structure so the best way to think of it
is you have a main branch and then you
have all the small branches hanging off
of that main branch and the directory
hierarchy in Linux always starts at root
and that is identified by this forward
slash right here now this is a forward
slash not a back slash so that's really
the key point I want to make right there
and then you can see all of these
directories hanging off the main root
directory you can see here we have been
dev live home sis temp user and var we
will talk about all these directories
that hang off of the root directory but
over the next several lectures we're
actually just gonna be talking about the
home directory and the home directory
basically holds all the personal
directories for whatever user is logged
into that Linux session and you would
store several different files here you
might store music files or video files
things like that and when a user logs in
a folder is created for whatever
username he or she logged in with and
pretty much all Linux installations will
conform to this standard and we'll be
taking a look at this in a minute so
again you have the root directory right
here which is identified by a forward
slash and then you have all the
directories that hang off of root now in
many respects this is very similar to
Windows if you've used Windows you're
very familiar with the C Drive and in
Windows that is the root directory and
then you have a bunch of folders that
hang off of the C Drive the difference
is that Windows uses a drive letter
whereas Linux does not do that and of
course the drive letter here is C the
other big difference is that in Windows
you can have multiple Drive so you might
have a D Drive and F Drive and so on and
those drives have their own folders in
Linux that is not the case all of the
directories hang off of the root
directory there are no separate drives
like there are in Windows so that's a
really big difference right there so if
we open up our terminal
let's go ahead and list out the contents
and there you can see all the
directories and files that are in our
home directory now if we pull up the
diagram again you can see here this is
the home directory right here this
represents this home directory right
here on this branch and the home
directory again hangs off of route and
how do we know we're in the home
directory again it's identified by this
tilde sign right here now if we were to
open up files here on the left and it
boon - and we open up the home you can
see this corresponds to what we have in
the terminal take a look at that we have
a desktop we have a documents they both
correspond to each other so again you
can see we have the same files and
folders now one question you might ask
well why don't I just use this GUI right
here well the reason is later on we're
gonna get into servers and Linux servers
primarily do not use a GUI pretty much
everything you do in a Linux server
you're going to be using the terminal
and the second reason is it's just more
efficient you can do a lot more things
in the terminal than you can in the
Linux GUI so that is the main reason so
let's go ahead and close this out so
what we're gonna do is learn how to make
a directory and we use the NK Durer
command so you type in NK dir and then
you just specify the name of the
directory in this case we're just gonna
call this test so go ahead and hit enter
and since we're already in the home
directory that directory should have
been created inside of our home
directory so let's go ahead and list out
the contents and see what we get and
there you can see right there we have
our test directory now in order to
change directories in Linux you use the
CD command so if you type in CD and you
type in test and go ahead and hit enter
you can see now we change directory to
the test and if you take a look at here
at our props it now shows us that we are
now inside the test directory and let's
go ahead and make a directory inside the
test directory and let's call this test
again then let's go ahead and change
directory so that we can go inside that
test again directory and now you can see
we are inside the test again directory
which is inside the test directory and
the test directory of course resides in
the home directory and you can see that
slashes are used to identify the
subdirectory so the home directory is
right here then we have a slash right
here that ident
is a sub-directory which of course is
test and then we have another slash here
that identifies another subdirectory
which is test again so that's the way it
works now what if we wanted the full
path of the directory that we're in what
if we wanted to see the full path and
this is actually called the absolute
path and we'll talk about this in future
lectures what an absolute path is what a
relative path is but for now we're going
to go ahead and list out the path that
we're currently in and to do that you
type in PWD and there you can see it
listed out the entire path now let's
break this down
this first slash here this actually
represents the root directory right
there and as we talked about that's
always identified by a forward slash and
as we know the home directory hangs off
of the root directory so that is the
next directory
this next slash is a slash that
identifies a subdirectory and in this
case it is Ernie now remember I said the
home folder will contain a folder for
the user and in this case my user name
is Ernie so that's the folder that gets
created and then we have another slash
which represents a sub directory and
that subdirectory is tests and we just
created that a few minutes ago and then
we created another sub directory inside
the test directory called test again and
that is identified right here by this
forward slash so now you know how to get
an absolute path this is the absolute
path that we are currently in now if you
want to switch back to the home
directory you just type in CD and you do
not put in a directory name and there
you can see now we're back in our home
directory
and let's actually go ahead now and show
the absolute path by typing PWD again
and there you can see we're in our home
directory which is Ernie and again that
is identified by this tilde right here
okay we will continue on with
directories in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
