on JavaScript now in the last video I
said we would be using notepad
throughout the series but I kind of
changed my mind because it's a little
bit easier to use notepad plus plus with
JavaScript now if you want to use
notepad that's not a problem you can
continue to do that but if you want to
use notepad plus plus it's very easy to
download and it's a very quick install
in fact if you open up your browser and
go to Google and just type in notepad
plus plus you'll see it comes up very
quickly here and you can just hit this
download link right here and as I said
it's a very very quick install now once
you open up notepad plus plus I want you
to go ahead and copy this template right
here because this is going to be the
default template that we'll use
throughout the series and then I want
you to go ahead and save as and then
save it as a HTML document and I just
saved it on my desktop so we'll be
reusing this code over and over again
this basic template now as I said in the
last video our JavaScript code goes
between our script element tag this is
an HTML element tag so we have an
opening tag and a closing tag and then
everything in between is our JavaScript
code now this is going to be a basic
video we're just going to get started
here with some very simple JavaScript
code and also explain statements now as
I said all of our JavaScript code will
go between the script element tags and
this is usually the place that you will
put your JavaScript code now there are
some other places you can actually put
your JavaScript code and we'll get into
that in later videos but for now we're
going to go ahead and put our JavaScript
code right in here and of course there's
the body HTML tags and all of our web
content goes in here in this area so
let's go ahead and write some JavaScript
code okay so what I want you to do now
is type out document dot write and then
I want you to type in parenthesis and
we'll get into that later on what this
is but essentially this is a function
and basically what this allows us to do
is write out any HTML content to our web
page and I'll show you that in a minute
it's going to be very simple and inside
I want you to put quotes and we're just
going to use the very famous hell
world which is usually used in someone's
first program so we'll use that here and
then we're going to end this with a
semicolon
now since this video is about statements
this entire line of code is referred to
as a statement and what is a statement
think of it as a little bit of code that
does some work for us some computations
so that's what a statement is now you
could have hundreds of statements in
your JavaScript code and we will
eventually get to that later on now to
end a statement you always use a
semicolon and then you move on to the
next statement so let's go ahead and run
this and we'll watch this in IE now you
might get a message down here that says
allow blocked content and so just go
ahead and hit that and so there you see
our document dot right has printed out
hello world for us and so if we decided
to add more code this is going to be
fake code we would put another semicolon
you know that's how statements work they
go in a top-down order so again the
semicolon ends each statement and
actually let's go ahead and get rid of
these because we don't want to save that
so in the next video we will talk about
variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
