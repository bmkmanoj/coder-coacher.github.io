search for a particular string of text
in multiple log files so in this video
I'm going to show you how to do that
using notepad plus plus and it's really
the only way I do it and notepad plus
plus makes it very easy to accomplish
that so the example we're gonna use here
we're just gonna use these four log
files that I created right here now
there are times where you may have
dozens and dozens of log files and in
fact I think last year I was searching
80 files at once for a particular string
of text and again it's a lot easier
using notepad plus plus to do that
rather than opening up each file
individually and searching for the text
so as I said I've created these four
sample log files so let's go ahead and
open up this first one and you can see
here that we've got some system
information and let's say we want to
search on this OS type and specifically
we want to search on each log file that
contains win 10 obviously that means
Windows 10 so that's what we want to
search for but again we want to search
all four of these files for that
particular string of text simply open up
log two you can see we've got win seven
if we open up log three you can see
we've got win eight and if we open up
log four we've got win ten again so the
only search results we should get are
for log 1 + log 4 so the first thing you
want to do is select all 4 files then
what you want to do is right-click and
hit edit with notepad plus plus and
you'll notice now that notepad + + has
opened up all the files good so now what
you want to do is go to search you want
to hit find and the string of text we're
gonna search for is win 10 that's what
we're looking for and then the key here
is you don't want to hit find next you
actually want to hit find all in all
open documents and of course we have all
the documents open and again you could
have 40 documents here listen as I said
I've actually had 80 documents opened up
before in notepad plus plus and it works
very well so let's go ahead and hit find
all in all open documents and there take
a look at that it found two hits and two
files and it gave us the name of the
file in this case it was log 1 and in
the other case it was log 4 and so as
you can see it's working because we know
that when 10 is not present in log 3 or
log 2 and the other nice thing about
this is you can open up the document
simply by clicking right here and did
you see how it bounced us to log 1 now
if you
quickly bounced back to law 2 in the
search window you can do that
so no pad plus plus comes in very handy
if you need to search for a particular
string of text in multiple files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
