content page and we put all this text in
our content page but this doesn't look
so good we should work on this a little
bit so one thing we want to do of course
is add a little bit of margin here to
push this text away from the edges of
our content page we don't want that so
close because it's difficult to read
that and then let's add a little bit of
space between each line so it'll make
our text easier to read and we're also
going to set a default size for our text
so we'll make this 16 pixels or
something like that now you can make it
whatever size you want but I'm just
going to set it at 16 pixels so we're
going to do all of this in Visual Studio
so what we're going to do is actually
create a div to encapsulate all this
text and then we're going to create a
class in that div to create a margin and
do the other things I talked about so
first let's put this div and we're going
to put it right inside of our main
content 1 and so we'll just come right
down here and we'll just create the
standard div we're going to give it a
class and you will remember that from my
CSS tutorials if you follow them and
we're going to call this content text
that will be the name of the class and
then we're just going to drag this
closing div down all the way down here
and now we've got all of our text and
closed in this div called content text
that's name of the class now I want to
point out one thing here this div is now
encapsulated within the main content ASP
so keep in mind this doesn't actually
get loaded from the template it gets
loaded from our content our main content
1 so that's the main point I wanted to
make now what we need to do is put this
inside of our CSS stylesheet so we're
going to do that now so let's open up
our stylesheet and we'll go all the way
to the bottom here and I've already
typed this out so I'm just going to copy
and paste this in here and here you see
I've got my usual comment and we're
saying here format the text on the
content page and this is what we talked
about we wanted a margin to put 10
pixels around all of our text we're
going to increase the space between each
line and we're going to set a default
size of 16 pixels and actually I need to
rename this to content text
I believe that's what I called it right
content text yes okay so let's go ahead
and save everything up and we'll load
our webpage up if we drill down into
here Wow doesn't that look better now
we've got a little bit of space between
our text and the edge of the page and
we've got a little bit more space
between each line but now we need to add
some HTML we want to make this bold to
really stand out because this is the
first subject the roman senate so let's
go back to visual studio and let's go
back to our rome aspx so let's actually
make this bold so we'll just use the
standard bold HTML tag and you can see
visual studio is nice enough to create
an ending tag how nice whoops let's just
undo that that didn't go well
okay there we go so that will be in bold
now what we need is some space between
our main subject here now we could use
an h1 and if you want to go ahead and
use that you can but I think I'm just
going to put in some breaks so what
we'll do we'll put in some breaks now we
could wrap all this in a paragraph block
element but that really depends on
whether you're going to format this text
some more if you decide to you may want
to use a paragraph element tag but again
it's up to you but in this video we're
just going to put it in some breaks and
we may change that later on we'll see so
let's just put these in here now we
actually need two of these to create a
full space so we need two of those and
then we're going to need one here right
two more so we'll just put those in and
we'll put two more right here and then
we want to make our Roman Assemblies we
want to make that bold as well so we can
just go ahead and copy
well actually we can just copy this
these three right here put these in and
then let's make this an opening bold tag
there we go
so that'll look good and now what we
want to do is put it in the rest of our
line breaks so we'll put two right here
- right here - right here and we don't
need one at the bottom of the page so
let's save this up and now see what we
get
and there that looks much better doesn't
it this is in bold now and clearly
indicates that this is a new subject
we've got spaces between our paragraphs
and that just looks a lot better now in
the next video what we're going to do is
we're actually going to add an image to
our content page and it's going to be a
really big image to make this article
look even better so we'll do that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
