left off in the last video and we're
going to write our very first jQuery
code in this video and we left off of
course specifying our jQuery library in
this script tag now we're going to do of
course is at our jQuery code but we
don't want to put our jQuery code inside
of this script element we want to
actually create another script element
where we can specify our jQuery code and
of course we want it after we load the
library not before because remember we
want the web page to be loaded first and
our jQuery library to be downloaded and
then we can go ahead and manipulate the
Dom you will remember in the JavaScript
series it's all about manipulating the
Dom and you'll remember the Dom is just
a tree right it's just a tree that
represents our HTML document and that's
of course always what we are
manipulating so let's create a script
element tag to hold our jQuery and we'll
just close it down here and there we go
now before we actually write our jQuery
code I'm going to copy and paste a
jQuery function in here and there it is
it's called the ready function now this
is X more like a wrapper we will put
from this point on we will put all of
our jQuery code inside this ready
function that jQuery provides now all
this does is it basically waits until
the web page is actually downloaded
before any of our jQuery code is
executed and that's nice because
remember we cannot manipulate the Dom
until the Dom has been created so that's
why this jQuery ready function that
jQuery provides is very nice to use and
like I said you can just forget about
this you really don't have to remember
anything else the only thing you really
have to remember is that we're going to
put all of our jQuery code inside this
function and so that's all you need to
know so before we actually write our
jQuery code let's actually fire up the
web page and see what it looks like and
you can see I've got three content areas
a left center and right if we stretch
this out they would be side-by-side okay
so now let's write our jQuery code now
to call the jQuery library you always
start out with a dollar sign that really
just stands for the jQuery library now
you could write out just jQuery you
could actually do that in
instead of writing the dollar sign but
that's not really how people do it so
you really just want to use the dollar
sign now once we specify this dollar
sign again we are calling the jQuery
library and jQuery creates an object for
us to use it will remember objects from
the JavaScript series so I'll go ahead
and copy and paste this here now this is
the basic format there's an open
parenthesis and we have either single
quotes or double quotes in here in this
case we're using double quotes and then
we just use a selector in this case a
CSS selector to select whatever element
or elements that we want to manipulate
it's that easy
so let's manipulate this right content
area here first so as you can see in the
HTML we gave it an ID and we called it
right so you will remember from the CSS
series we always specify a pound sign
for that type of selector and then we
can just put in right it's that simple
now you will remember from the
JavaScript series remember all the code
we had to do we had to use the get
element by ID method and then we had to
sign it to an a variable which of course
was an object that's all done right here
look how easy that is we simply put in
our selector and we've got our object
it's that easy and so that's why jQuery
the fundamental level is so much easier
to use than JavaScript we can just use
CSS selectors to select the elements
that we want to manipulate now you will
remember in the JavaScript series the
dot allows us to access two main things
from an object you will remember there
are properties and there are methods and
so that's what we're going to use we're
going to use our very first jQuery
method and that is the hide method and
you'll remember that we use open
parentheses to specify a method and then
we close it with a semicolon and so here
is your very first jQuery method so
let's go ahead and save this now if this
works our right content area now should
disappear let's refresh the page and it
did take a look at that now isn't that
really amazing think about this if we
were doing JavaScript we'd probably need
at least three to four lines here to do
all this here we're just doing this in
one line isn't that amazing and so you
can see just how much easier jQuery is
to use now let's say we want to select
another el
let's select this div here with the
center ID
now you remember and CSS to do that we
just put a comma and then we can use
another selector and in this case it's
going to be pound Center so we'll go
ahead and save this will refresh our
page and now the center element is now
gone now if we were doing this in
JavaScript we have to do a whole slew of
things to get both of these elements
selected but here is just as simple as
adding the correct CSS selectors so you
can see how nice jQuery is to use and
really at its basic level jQuery is all
about knowing the selectors to use and
learning the methods and properties once
you do that you have about 90 percent of
jQuery down and so that's what we're
going to spend a lot of time in this
series doing we're going to learn all
the selectors and by the way it's not
just about CSS selectors there are
selectors that jQuery provides to us
that are not in CSS so we have to learn
those as well and as I said we need to
learn the methods and properties so
that's the main thing we're going to be
doing in this series okay see you guys
