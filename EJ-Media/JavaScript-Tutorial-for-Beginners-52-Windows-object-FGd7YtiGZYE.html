windows object and how to do a page
redirect but first let's talk about the
windows object now previously we've been
talking about of course the document
object so what is the difference between
the windows object and the document
object the document object basically
comprises our entire webpage inside the
browser that is the HTML document but
there may be times that you need to work
against the browser window itself that
is all this stuff outside the HTML
document you may need to do certain
things and that's where the windows
object is very useful and one of the
main reasons JavaScript developers use
the windows object is for page redirects
and we've all done that you've gone to a
page and basically that's not the web
page anymore right they want to redirect
you to a new web page that is where you
can use the windows object because again
we have to work against the URL that's
in this address field inside the browser
so again you need to use the windows
object in JavaScript do that and the
good thing is all of the modern browsers
support the windows object in JavaScript
so this is very useful you can go ahead
and change this using the windows object
so that's what we're going to do in this
video now you can see here I've got four
files in my website folder this is the
index old which I guess that's not
really an original name but this is the
page that our users are first going to
come to and think of this as our old
website so we no longer want to use this
we're going to link to our new web page
which is this web page we were just at
that one I just closed so this is the
new index.html and this is the old one
and as usual I will provide all the code
for this lecture so the new index.html
has its accompanying stylesheet right
here these two files and then the index
old will be using this javascript file
right here these two files will go
hand-in-hand and so we really don't need
to update anything in here we're just
going to be linking to this new web page
these are the two ones that we need to
be concerned about the old index.html so
that being said let's go ahead and close
this out and let's just go ahead and
load our old index page here we'll just
load this in chrome go ahead and
minimize this so you can see here this
is a very
basic webpage I guess there's a reason
we're linking to that new webpage
there's not a lot here and I just put in
some text the webpage has moved to a new
site please click the button to go to
new site I probably could have worded
that a little bit better then we have
our button here hit submit for new site
and this is something we've been doing
throughout the series you guys all are
aware of how the on click event
attribute works now when we click this
button our function will get executed
which in this case is called change page
so this is all set to go so what we need
to do then is go to our JavaScript code
and basically this is going to be fairly
simple you're going to see how easy this
windows object is to use so what we
basically need to do now is write some
code and again it's going to be a very
simple line we just need to redirect to
our new web page and again the object
that we use it represents this whole
browser window is the windows object so
you just specify window that's all you
have to do and then of course we have to
use the XS modifier remember to access
our properties and methods with this
object and of course we use the dot for
that and the property that we're going
to be using is the location property
right here that is what we're going to
be using this is the property that
represents the URL itself that's in this
little address field that's what we use
to access this and in this case we want
to alter this URL so that's the property
that we use for changing URLs so we're
just going to go ahead and put in our
new web page that we want to redirect to
and in this case of course it was
index.html which is in the same web
folder and of course we need our famous
semi colon and now this should work now
I should add that if you want to go
ahead and just put in a real-world
address here you can you know you could
put in Google's address right here just
remember you need to put in HTTP you
need to start it out with that you could
also do that if you just want to
redirect to a real page out on the web
you can go ahead and certainly do that
so let's go ahead and save this and we
should not have to actually save our
index.html we should just be able to hit
the submit button it should work let's
see what happens and it did look it
redirected to our new web page and so
that's how the windows object works and
that's how a page redirect works okay
that's going to do it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
