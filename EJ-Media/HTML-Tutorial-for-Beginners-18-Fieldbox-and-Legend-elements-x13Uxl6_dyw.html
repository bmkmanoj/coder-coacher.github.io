and take a look at a few more elements
that you can use with your HTML forms
and that is the fieldset element and the
legend element but before we do that
let's actually go ahead and add another
text box here just so we can make the
form a little bit larger and let's go
ahead and just add a line break and
let's just go ahead and add another one
and we'll just create a text box to hold
a name and of course we need an input
element and let's just go ahead and save
this will refresh our page and there it
is good
so our forms a little bit bigger now now
first let's go ahead and add the
fieldset element and what that does is
it adds some nice styling to your form
and what it will do is it will actually
draw a box around our entire form so
what we want to do is nest all of our
input elements inside the fieldset
element so let's go ahead and create the
fieldset element and that's all you need
and let's go ahead and close it out down
here alright so let's go ahead and save
this and let's see what we get and there
you can see we've got this nice box now
around our entire form now we can also
put a caption inside of the fieldset
element so it'll go right inside this
box so let's say we want to actually
move this this part where it says enter
day you want to travel a cancun that'll
actually look nicer if we put it inside
the fieldset box so let's go ahead and
do that so we do that with the legend
element so let's go ahead and create it
and let's go ahead and close it right
here so let's go ahead and save this and
we'll see what we get there we go see
how nice that looks so this really adds
a lot of pizzazz to your forms okay
that's going to do it for forms in HTML
we're going to move on to another
subject in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
