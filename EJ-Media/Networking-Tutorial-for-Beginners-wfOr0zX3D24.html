look at computer networking and how
networks work from beginning all the way
to the end now there are two primary
ways to connect to the Internet
one of course is through your computer
and the other of course is through your
mobile phone and you can see here I've
got two main portions to this one is of
course the Internet and then I have a
distributed network over here that
represents a company's website that you
might connect to so let's start from
beginning all the way to the end so if
you're over here on your computer and
you type in HTTP now HTTP is the
protocol that is used to communicate
back and forth from your computer to a
web server and then of course from the
web server back to your computer now
when you attempt to connect to a web
server that is called a request the
message that gets sent back is called
the response so that is going on when
you open up your browser and you type in
HTTP and the web address that you want
to go to now when you first make that
request you will hit your local ISP now
it used to be that the major ISP and the
local ISP were different companies but
today those local ISPs have been bought
out by the big ISPs so it's not uncommon
for these to be the same company so once
again you'll hit this local ISP then
before you get to the major ISP you will
go through several third-party cloud
devices as well as several content
delivery networks then eventually your
packet will eventually make it to the
major ISP and then the major ISP will
redirect it to the website that you are
intending to reach now you'll notice
this big brick wall here this represents
a firewall and companies will put up
firewalls to protect themselves from the
internet so they will only accept
certain types of requests that come from
your computer the packet has to be
correct with the correct port and IP
address and we'll talk more about that
actually in the next video
how packets work so anyways if
everything is correct you will be
allowed through this firewall think of
this almost like a gatekeeper from
medieval times a gatekeeper will allow
only certain people to enter into the
castle he will reject everybody else
that does not have the proper
credentials so once you are accepted
through the firewall you will hit the
web server now this is a very important
server obviously because this hosts the
landing page
or the homepage this is what you see
when you hit the company's web server
now I do want to point out that in very
large companies they will often have all
kinds of load balancers switches and
routers before you even hit the
webserver
so once the webserver does whatever it
needs to it ships it off to an
application server now an application
server is a web server but usually does
not actually host out the landing page
or home page that is what the main web
server does the application server will
handle the communications to the
database server that's one of its
primary functions and then whatever data
needs to be stored will be done by the
database server and let's say you made
some sort of configuration change and
let's say you were setting up some stock
symbols that you wanted to watch and he
wanted to have some alerts set up that
would be stored on physical storage and
this is actually the lowest level in
this entire chain and then the response
would be sent from the web server back
to your screen so this entire process
from request to response is called the
roundtrip that's what you'll hear
Network professionals call this the
round-trip now I also want to point out
something else that is used inside the
distributed network you will hear people
often call this this layer right here
they will refer to as the front-end tear
that is because this is at the front
line again this is the landing page or
home page that you see so they will
refer to this layer as the front-end
tier it is also called the presentation
tier now this tier the application
server is often called the middle tier
or logic tier now at the database level
this is often called the backend tier or
data tier so this is the lowest level
now why is this important well a lot of
web programmers will refer to this when
they're developing their web application
they may say hey we're working on the
front tier or we're working on the
middle tier or we're working on the
lower level tier the other important
note I want to make here is you'll hear
these buzzwords today called application
performance monitoring and that is
becoming more and more important and
what does that mean well companies are
very concerned about that round-trip
from your client to their web servers
and how long that takes so that's called
application performance monitoring and
basically you know when you've been on
the web and the page doesn't load that
is a performance issue and so they want
to know what is causing that is
on your PC is it out in the internet or
is it within their own distributed
network and so if that slowdown is
inside their distributed network they
want to know where that slowdown is
occurring is it occurring in the front
end tier or is it a problem in the low
end here so that's becoming very
critical companies are more and more
concerned how their application is
performing and how long that round-trip
takes from your client to the web server
okay that's going to do it for this
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
