video and start to take a look at color
in Photoshop and that is a very
important subject so over the next
several videos we're going to review
color and a good place to start is the
color picker now the color picker is
probably the most widely used tool in
Photoshop in terms of picking a color so
it makes sense to start out reviewing
that now if you take a look down here on
the left this is where you can access
the color picker and you're gonna see
two colors here one on top and one on
the bottom the one on top picks the
foreground color and you can see where
that says foreground color right here
and if you click on the color below that
will give you the background color so
you can select the background color and
this arc arrow right here allows you to
toggle them if you want to do so I will
tell you that the foreground color is
gonna be the primary color that you're
gonna use that's gonna cover about 95
percent of your needs so we're gonna
actually just work with the foreground
color because that is gonna cover almost
all of your needs so you're gonna use
that for all of your paint brushes all
of your fills and as I mentioned the
background color really isn't used a
whole lot I mainly use it for some of
the special effects now when you first
come into the color picker tool you're
gonna see three main areas the color
slider which is located right here and
this allows you to pick the main color
or hue so this is where you're gonna
start out first and we'll talk about
this in a minute now once you pick your
main color you're gonna come over to the
color field and this allows you to pick
a shade of the main color that you
selected over here in the color slider
so this is the second area that you need
to be concerned about and then there's a
third area which are all of these values
and basically these are arranged in
terms of color models so the first color
model is right here and by the way this
is the most widely used model so H is
for hue s is for saturation and B is for
brightness and this is the one which
we're going to be working off in this
lecture we'll talk about this in a few
moments the second model is RGB so if
you wanted to use RGB you could use this
to select your color now you see this
pound sign right here this is yet
another model and this is hexadecimal
now if you took my CSS for beginner
series you will remember that I used
hexadecimal when specifying the color on
a webpage so if you're using this tool
to pick a color for your website you can
use the hex
for that purpose now there are two other
color models that are here as well these
three values right here are called the
lab model and these four values right
here are called the CMYK model and we're
going to talk about these in later
lectures these are not as widely used so
again we'll talk about these in later
videos but the model we are going to
talk about is this HSB model because
again this is the most widely used model
and again the H stands for hue the S is
for saturation and the B is for
brightness so when you first come into
here again you want to use this color
slider and pick your main color and this
actually relates to the hue the hue
values are actually based on degrees
because actually this relates to the
color circle you might have seen that at
one time well I guess they couldn't fit
the circle on here so they condensed it
into this slider but this actually is
based on a range from zero degrees to
360 degrees so again you want to think
of that color wheel so what I'm going to
do is I'm basically gonna start sliding
this up and you'll see the hue number
increase so the lowest number is zero
and that's actually for orange but if I
go up here watch what happens see how
that number goes all the way up to 360
while we're at 356 now but if we went to
the very top that would be red so you
can see how the huge changes as we
adjust this slider so basically let's
say you have a favorite hue that you
like you want to go ahead and remember
that number so let's say you like this
hue this number 10 here and it's sort of
an orange shade then you could write
this down and remember it and that's
kind of how I do it as well so for
instance a big one is green pure green
starts at 120 degrees so let's go ahead
and put that in now watch how the color
slider will adjust when I put this in
whoops I put in 210 sorry let's go back
and I'll put in 120 see how green comes
up so what you want to do is kind of
remember these main hue numbers and then
you can just punch them in when you come
back here and I believe blue pure blue
is 240 so let's go ahead and punch that
in and there you can see now we're at
pure blue okay so once you have your hue
selected then you want to come over to
this color field and here is where you
pick the shape and at first this looks a
little daunting but I'll tell you
exactly how it works so basically if you
go sideways that controls the saturation
this value right here if you go up and
down that controls the brightness so
that's the way you want to think of this
and as you can see if we
higher it gets lighter if we go all the
way the bottom here it's completely dark
so again just remember up and down
controls the brightness and from the
sides it control saturation so let's go
ahead and click in here and there you
can see right away we've got 64 and 65
now watch what happens when I move to
the left here watch that saturation
number it's gonna go down because as you
move to the left you actually start to
lose saturation as you move to the right
the saturation increases but you'll
notice that as I move the saturation to
the left it gets gray or watch this now
see how it's dropping and the color is
getting grayer now watch what happens I
move right the saturation is increasing
see that it's almost at 100% you're
almost getting to pure blue now if you
wanted to get to the brightest blue then
we go up see how the brightness now is
increasing if you went all the way to
the top-right corner here and I can't
quite get this at 100% I probably could
but this is a tutorial I don't want
spend all day on this but you can see
though we have almost 98% saturation and
98% brightness so this is almost pure
blue but again as you go left see how
that saturation drops and see how this
shade of blue now is moving closer to
gray so that is basically how the color
picker works that's all you really need
to know it's actually very simple once
you understand how these values work so
just remember once again you're always
gonna pick your main hue first you're
always gonna come here and pick your hue
in the slider then you're gonna come
over to the color field and pick the
shade and brightness of that color now I
do want to point out that once you've
done all this work and selected this
color that you want to use you might
want to go ahead and add it to your
swatches or you can write down the
values from the HSB model or you can
just take down the hexadecimal value as
well now there's one final thing that I
want to talk about and that is what if
you want to select a color from an
existing photo and as you probably know
you use the eyedropper but how do you do
that from the color picker well it's
incredibly simple and we actually have
to open up a photo for that so let's go
ahead and close out of the color picker
for now and I'll just go ahead and open
up a photo really quickly here and I'll
open up this photo of the Penguins
remember these guys so let's go ahead
and reopen the color picker now if you
move the cursor off of the color picker
dialog box you get the eyedropper see
that so what if you wanted some color
out of here so you just click it and
then look the color shows up in the
color picker so that's very useful if
you want to quickly
select a color from an existing photo
okay that's gonna do it for this video
