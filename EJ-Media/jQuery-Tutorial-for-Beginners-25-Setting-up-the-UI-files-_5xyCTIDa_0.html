jQuery UI within our source code now the
first thing I want you to do is go out
to jQuery UI dot-com I will put the link
to that website in the description of
this video and when you reach the site I
want you to click on this button right
here the stable button and then I want
you to download the jQuery UI once
you've done that you should have a
folder that looks like this with a bunch
of files in it we're gonna keep the
entire folder now what I want you to do
is go ahead and rename the folder
because this will make it easier for us
to specify the path and our source code
so go ahead and just get rid of all the
release information we don't really need
that if you want to keep it you can but
you'll have to type out the full path
when we do that later on in this video
so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of
it and it now should just be jQuery - UI
and then what we're gonna do is copy it
to our website folder so we're gonna
keep the entire folder inside of our
website folder okay so let's go ahead
and open up our website folder and we'll
keep it on the right side here now what
I want you to do is open up the
index.html our main index dot HTML and
then let's go ahead and open up our
jQuery UI folder and we're gonna use
quite a few of these libraries and the
first thing we want to do is use this
jQuery - UI that's the main library we
need to specify to load up the jQuery UI
on our web page now later on if you
decide to go ahead and use this in your
Production website you will want to
specify this library instead of this one
this is just a larger version so we can
use that since we're just testing so
let's go all the way to the bottom here
and here you will see we put our
original jQuery library now this always
has to come first we always want to load
this first so anything that we do with
the jQuery UI we want to put after our
main jQuery library so let's just go
ahead and copy and paste this and you
don't want to make this easier let's
actually go back to our main folder and
let's get rid of that - - we'll make
this really easy to specify so there we
go now we just have jQuery UI so the
first thing we want to do of course for
the path is just specify the folder name
which of course is just jQuery UI and
then we need a slash and let's drill
back down into our folder and of course
here again is the name of the file that
we need so it's gonna be jQuery - UI
and then we can get rid of all this
version information and it'll just be
dot J s so now we've got our jQuery UI
library specified in our web page and
again you always want to load this after
our main jQuery library now as I said in
the last video there are many other
files that the jQuery UI provides it
provides images and it provides CSS
files so this is really a fully
developed interface that we can call and
that's what we're gonna do we also have
to specify all of these CSS files in
this case we're gonna take the jQuery UI
CSS stylesheet the structure CSS
stylesheet and the theme CSS stylesheet
we need those three CSS files and it's
the same process we basically want to
load all these style sheets after we
load our main stylesheet so let's just
go ahead and copy and paste this like we
did before and it's the same process
we're just gonna put in the folder name
first and then specify our first style
sheet which is jQuery - UI let's get rid
of the style and there you can see we've
got our first CSS stylesheet specified
but we need these other two as I said so
let's just go ahead and copy and paste
again and then this one we need a dot
structure good and we'll copy and paste
one more time so we can pick up this
third file down here and this one of
course is dot theme so let's go ahead
and save everything up let's go ahead
and just load our web page just to make
sure everything's okay and as you can
see everything looks great
so we are all good to go in the next
video we will add the date picker which
comes right from the jQuery UI see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
