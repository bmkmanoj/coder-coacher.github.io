from the last tech interview tips and
several subscribers wanted me to do a
part 2 so this should round out the
discussion now you want to maintain good
eye contact with the interviewer that is
very very important and it's even more
important when the interviewer is
talking when you maintain eye contact
you are sending a message that you are
listening to what he or she is saying if
you look away or look down you are
sending a message that I am NOT
interested in what you are saying and if
the interviewer thinks you are
uninterested in the job then it's
essentially a done deal you will not
land the job open-ended questions
chances are the interviewer is going to
ask you some open-ended questions these
could be all sorts of questions such as
what are your strengths and weaknesses
where do you see yourself in five years
what do you think of your last manager
now really these types of questions are
designed to see how well you communicate
you don't want to give one word answers
but you don't also want to overdo it so
several concise sentences should do you
might create some test questions and
practice answering them out loud
appearance this has changed over the
last several decades now it used to be
you needed to be in a suit for your
interview no questions asked but these
days many companies have a dress code of
business casual so if you are unsure the
best thing to do is ask the recruiter
about the dress code that way you won't
be in danger of over or for that matter
under dressing for the interview
practice makes perfect one thing several
tech professionals have told me is that
practice makes perfect that is you will
likely find the first interviews are the
hardest but as you interview more and
more you will find the process eases up
a little bit you will start to perfect
your responses and basically you will
have a much better idea of what the
interviewers are looking for and perhaps
most importantly you will feel more at
ease during the actual interview itself
job offer okay so let's say you have
completed the interview process and
chances are you have had to go through
several interviews and even panels but
let's say the company wants to hire you
what type of salary are you in a
position to demand or do you simply
accept the company's first offer the key
question here is and this is really
fundamental do you currently have a job
if you have a job
you are in a far better position to
negotiate for a higher salary if you do
not have a job it's much more difficult
to ask for a higher salary because of
the simple fact you are going to be
concerned first and foremost with
landing a job so just keep that in mind
okay that's going to do it and as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
