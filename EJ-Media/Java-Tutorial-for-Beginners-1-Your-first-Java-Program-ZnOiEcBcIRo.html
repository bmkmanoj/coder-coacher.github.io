beginners this is the first video I'm
going to take a minute and just show you
where you can get some of the software
if you want to follow along if you have
eclipse or your own version of NetBeans
you can certainly use those the the code
that I'll be doing here is applicable to
all versions of NetBeans so if you have
your own version that's okay the first
thing you'll need is the JDK so if you
go to the google and type in JDK select
this link here Java SC development kit
you select that and if you scroll down
at the bottom or actually midway down
you'll see the various os's
pick the OS pick the file that you'll
need for the particular oh s that you
have in my case I selected windows
64-bit if you have windows 32-bit you'll
select the x86 version there's also a
Mac version Linux versions so you want
to install that first and after you're
done with that you'll need to go and get
the NetBeans IDE so you can just type in
NetBeans you go to welcome NetBeans here
you'll see there's a link for NetBeans
IDE so you select that and then you just
go over here and this to the download
link on the right hand side here and
that will download the latest version of
NetBeans and like I said before if you
have different version of NetBeans you
can follow on in these videos as well ok
moving right along now I'm assuming that
you've installed the JDK and NetBeans so
I'm going to open up the NetBeans IDE
now I do not have a project so I'm going
to create one we have to create a
project before we can actually create
our program so I'm going to go up here
on the left and select new project the
first note is Java we're going to use
that and you're going to select java
application and hit the next button
after that I'm going to name the project
that we're going to be using I'm going
to just call this main Java project and
in this tutorial we're just going to be
doing a quick program to get you up and
running here just kind of show you some
of the key concepts and then we'll move
on to more details in the later
tutorials you want to deselect this
create main class because we're going to
do that when we when we do our
program so you can just deselect this
create main class and hit finish and
then it should create the project for
you and you see up here on the Left we
have main Java project okay so now we
are ready to add our first program and
so we're going to go up to file in the
top hand left we're going to select new
file and we're going to select the first
note here Java under categories under
file types we're going to select empty
Java file hit next for the class name
we're going to call this my first
program and then hit finish and you'll
see here we have my first program and it
gives the dot Java extension now we can
start coding the program first thing
you're going to need is class I'll talk
about classes really quick you don't
need to get too hung up on this a lot of
people have a hard time understanding
the concept of a class but think of it
simply as in Java everything that you do
everything that you program all the
statements you code will be contained
within a class and this is where we
define the name of the class so the name
of the class we're going to give it is
my first program let's add a open curly
brace now and hit the enter key you'll
notice that it's smart enough to
populate the closing curly brace so
these are the curly braces that contain
everything for this class now we're
going to type in the second line of this
program type in public that's basically
so everybody can access this I will get
more into this later
same thing with static don't worry about
this right now void main I'll talk for a
couple seconds here about main because
this is very important a method is a set
of statements where most of the works
going to be done in your Java program so
your Java program will always need at
least one class and one main method
now we need to define the arguments to
this method and of course the method
again is mean so we do that by creating
an open paren or typing in an open paren
you can see intellisense smart enough to
put the closed paren in for us and this
is going to be a string array so we're
going to type in string I'll explain
arrays later but and to define this as
an array we're going to do a square
bracket and intellisense again is smart
enough to put in the closing square
bracket and then we put in the name of
this array which is going to be called
args a our GS so now we need to create
the opening brace squiggly brace for the
method the main method so you hit that
hit enter again right here it created
the closing brace for the main method
you see if I highlight that it will
actually show you these here so if you
highlight this bottom one here that's
the main those are the squiggly braces
that continue everything for the class
let's now create some output for this
program and you really can't have a
program and not have output right so
we're not going to create any variables
in this tutorial we'll get into that in
the next tutorial so we're just going to
create some output for this program and
then we'll execute it so on line 3
you'll type in system dot out dot print
and then open paren and we're going to
put a quote I'm gonna say this is my
first program and every statement needs
to end must end in a semicolon and you
can see what's probably why we're
getting some intellisense we got some
more intellisense this package system
design is whatever okay so so system dot
out dot print this is my first program
and this will basically output it this
is just standard output but this will
output it to the command line and now
we're ready to actually you know what
this is a problem we need to have that
as a capital S you can see how
case-sensitive this is the stuffs very
case sensitive you don't have the right
case you'll have intellisense warnings
so you see how that cats correct it now
okay so let's wrap up this tutorial by
reviewing all the lines of code that we
just wrote so again we open this up with
the class definition here the name of
the class we gave was my first program
the squiggly bracket opens squiggly
bracket here defines all the code for
our class that's a block of code that's
what's actually called a block of code
on the second line we defined our main
method and remember every program needs
a main method and a class at least one
method in one class we defined a string
array here and we gave it the name args
that's the name the next bracket is
actual is actually the block of
statements for our main method and in
this case it's just we're just printing
out the string which is this is my first
program now we have to save our program
I already have so it's grayed out for me
but if it isn't for you you want to hit
save all now when you hit save sometimes
it automatically NetBeans will
automatically compile the program for
you but if it wasn't compiled you want
to go to run and compile the file and
again it's grayed out for me so I don't
need to do it and then we're going to
run file before we do that I want to
point out that there are your project
your Java project could have dozens even
hundreds of programs and again every
program needs a class but you're but one
class will kick off everything and so
you need to tell your Java project what
class that is and again that's usually
not a problem if you only have one
program but realistically you'll be
developing several programs so to tell
the project what class to kick off you
go to main Java project right click on
that we're going to go to properties and
then you're going to go to run and here
you'll see this main class field you
want to browse and of course we only
have one here and you want to select
that and it may not be selected for you
sometimes it isn't and if it isn't just
go ahead and select it I'm going to
cancel out of this because because it's
already selected for me and then we're
going to exit
the program you do that right here run
project and this says this is my first
program and so it was successful zero
errors and everything ran fine so that's
the end of this tutorial in the next
tutorial we will get into variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
