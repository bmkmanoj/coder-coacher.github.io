about the doctype declaration that we've
been putting before our HTML code now
the doctype declaration is always the
very first thing that you put in your
HTML document and it always comes before
the HTML tag it is important to note
that the doctype is not actually an HTML
tag it is an instruction to the web
browser about what version of HTML the
page needs to use that's all it really
is now previously this was very
confusing to web developers you had to
put all of these different versions in
that you wanted to support and I've
listed some of these down here and so
you had to be always concerned about
what version you needed to put in there
with html5 this is all you have to put
now and that will support everything
it's like a one size fits all so going
forward to the near future this is all
you need to worry about so really you
don't have to worry about it at all you
just put this in and everything should
work just fine these are considered now
to be legacy strings although if you did
put these in the browser actually would
support it but from this point on all
you need to use is this type of doctype
declaration and again the only function
of this is so that the browser knows
what type of document to expect that's
all this does okay so that's going to do
it for the HTML tutorial for beginners
but I get asked a lot of questions what
should I do next what should I do going
forward the next series that you'll want
to take is the CSS tutorial for
beginners now it's not as if we're done
talking about HTML hTML is a critical
part to CSS in fact they go hand-in-hand
together so again this really isn't the
end of our discussion with HTML we will
be dealing with new tags that are more
relevant to CSS in the series CSS
tutorial for beginners we will also be
going over HTML forms all sorts of
things we'll be discussing in the CSS
tutorial for beginners so that's the
next series you should take after that
you should take the CSS layout series
once you've completed that you should
move on to the JavaScript tutorial for
beginners and at the end of the
JavaScript tutorial for beginner series
i will discuss where to go from there
but these are what I consider to be what
I like to call it
the big three in web development HTML
CSS and JavaScript okay I will see you
guys next in the CSS tutorial for
beginners series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
