other methods that you can use with the
Hoover method and specifically we're
gonna use the show and hide method those
are two very popular methods that are
used with the Hoover method and you can
use it to show and hide many different
things on a webpage any element
basically that you want but I'd say the
two most common uses for it are showing
and hiding images and menus so in this
video we're actually going to use it
with images and in a later video we'll
use it with menus so what we want to do
actually is show and hide old julius
caesar here but before i do that let's
give this some more relevant text we'll
say
hover over this area to show julius or
something like that let's change our
text here so we'll say over over this
area to show Julius good and now let's
go ahead and we're gonna specify the
show method and remember this first
function gets activated when we hover
over the element in this case it's going
to be the same element we used in the
last video so when we hover over this
right section here it will reveal this
image when we hover off of it it will be
hidden and of course our second method
is for the hover off of course now we
don't need any arguments in our show
method so that doesn't need any
arguments it will just show whatever we
tell to show in this case we want to
select our IMG right and we want to
select it down here as well of course
and then we're going to use the hide
method right here and we're gonna get
rid of all the arguments and let's go
ahead and save this and let's go ahead
and reload our page and hopefully this
works and it does look at that it says
hover over this area to show Julius so
when we hover over it we get Julius when
we hover off of it it disappears so
these methods can really start to make
your page very interactive I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
