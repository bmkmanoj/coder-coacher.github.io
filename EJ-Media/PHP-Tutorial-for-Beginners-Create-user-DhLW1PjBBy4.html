to add a user to our database and in
this case it's our test DB that we've
been using throughout the series now
adding users to databases is a very very
common thing in web development usually
the users are stored in one database so
you will store all of your users in one
database and in this case we'll store
this user in our test DB and that's
always a wise practice you do not want
people logging in with root you want to
give them their own unique ID and unique
password and usually you will store all
of the users in one single database you
won't put them in multiple databases and
this is the same concept in Microsoft
sequel server as well it's the same deal
you want to store the users in whatever
database that you're using for your
application right now of course you
should be logged in with root because we
haven't created our user yet and then
you want to go ahead and use the test DB
now the first thing we need to do is use
the create user sequel command and you
just specify create user and then you
want to specify the username that you're
going to create in this case is going to
be tester 99 then you specify app and
then you specify the server where your
database is located in this case it is
localhost and this just means our local
computer this is where we installed our
my sequel and now if this was a remote
server some other machine we would put
that machine name right here but in this
case we can just go ahead and use
localhost and then the next thing we
need to use is the identified command
and that basically is the password and
in this case we're just going to make
the password the same name as our user
ID now you could make this different if
you wanted to but I'm just going to keep
the name the same in this example so
let's go ahead and first we'll execute
this sequel command we'll just go up
here and of course it worked so now we
have our user created but the very next
thing you need to do is grant privileges
because when you first create that user
the user has no privileges so that's
what we need to do here and you guessed
it we use the grant command and we're
going to just go ahead and grant all
privileges now normally you probably
wouldn't do that you would only grant
privileges for certain types of sequel
commands such as select update that type
of thing but we're just going to go
ahead and grant all privileges and then
we go ahead and
testify the database in this case it's
the test DB and of course we need to
specify our user and then the localhost
again and we go ahead and put the
password in here so let's go ahead and
run this command and we'll see what
happens
and it worked now you're probably
wondering what is this flush privileges
well when my sequel first starts up all
the privileges are loaded into memory
and even though we just granted
privileges right here they are not
loaded into memory by default so this
basically refreshes all the privileges
and so then everything will be loaded
into memory and will have the current
privilege set so let's go ahead and do
that here and it worked now what we want
to do is try to go ahead and login to
our database
with this new user so let's see if it
works and you know what my screen
totally hung up and I had to close it
and reopen it but I just edited all that
out so you didn't have to see that but
again we can go ahead and try to log
back in and let's try that and now we're
prompted for the password you want to
put in whatever password you decided to
use you can enter here and there you can
see it worked
we were able to connect in with our new
user and our new password now let's go
ahead and run some other commands here
just to make sure we're authorized to do
that so let's go ahead and we'll use the
insert command remember we did this a
few videos ago and let's just see if we
can insert some data into our table and
we did and again we are doing this with
our new user that we created okay that's
going to do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
