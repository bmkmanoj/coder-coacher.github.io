the 14th tutorial on beginning Java
today we're going to be looking at
inheritance now if you remember in the
last video we dealt with classes and
objects today we'll add another wrinkle
inheritance as I just said if you look
at this diagram in the top here in the
previous video we created a class called
planet and then we created objects from
that template planet if you didn't watch
the previous video if you remember
classes are reusable code that is we
just don't have to type it over and over
again if we want to reuse it we can
create objects by using shortcuts to the
methods and variables in that class so
again think of class as reusable code
and specifically reusable methods and
variables that we don't have to re-type
over if we want to reference them now
that top diagram though is not a
realistic scenario and that's where
inheritance comes into play inheritance
is when you start adding multiple
classes and what do these multiple
classes have they share a set of common
characteristics so if you take a look at
that diagram below that is a more
realistic scenario now I just talked
about common characteristics well candy
has sugar and so do gumdrops so there's
a couple points I want to make here
about this bottom diagram first is we
call the candy class the superclass or
parent class because it's on top of all
the rest of the classes that are below
it and then all the classes that we
create below it are called the subclass
or child class that would be the gumdrop
class and then we can get to our objects
as you see so we're adding another layer
of complexity but it's really not that
complex when you think of it that is if
you think of it as an inheritance
hierarchy now in terms of the hierarchy
I also want to point out that your top
class or superclass is always a generic
class and the lower you go they get more
and more specific so for instance candy
is pretty generic and then gumdrops are
more specific so you wouldn't want to
put gumdrops first and then create a
subclass of candy below it you just
wouldn't do that so again the top class
should always be your generic class and
then you work your way down in terms of
specifics the other point I'd like to
make which I just made is they share
common characteristics and as we said
they share sugar
one of the common characteristics so for
instance you wouldn't create a class
called train and then create a class
called gum drop after that well they
don't share any common characteristics
well I mean if you're in some strange
world maybe they do but in this world
they don't so I wanted to make that
point as well so if you take a look at
this diagram what we'll be doing in this
tutorial is creating a set of methods
and variables that the gumdrop class
will inherit from the candy class that
is we won't have to re-type them out
over and over again and then the object
will be created from gumdrop and we
won't have to re-type out the variables
from gumdrop or candy so that's the
power of hierarchies okay so let's go
ahead and create a real inheritance
structure here in NetBeans okay so let's
go ahead and create our new class now
obviously we're going to start out with
our superclass first because he's the
guy we're going to be inheriting from
when we create our subclass so as always
we go to new file and we're going to go
ahead and select empty Java file and
we're going to name our superclass candy
so we are following that diagram to the
letter and let's define that class here
and let's go ahead and give this a
comment here and we'll say this is our
superclass now if you remember in the
previous tutorial I said every class
should have an attribute and a behavior
and the attribute is essentially a
variable so let's go ahead and give an
attribute here of sugar amount remember
in the diagram we said candy and
gumdrops share a common characteristic
and sugar and we're just going to hit
semicolon so there we go for that so now
we're going to give this class a
behavior or method so we're going to go
ahead and type in the usual public void
and we're going to call this method
display sugar amount there you go and
let's create the squiggly bracket so we
can create our code what this method is
going to do what this behavior is going
to do if you want to think of it like
that okay so let's go ahead and do a
system dot out dot print here which
we've done in many tutorials actually
we'll do a line break we'll do open
paren and let's print out a text string
here and we're going to say sugar a ma
don't is space and then we're going to
go ahead and add that variable amount
that we defined up here whatever it is
we use later on in our object again
we're not giving it a value here we're
just going to go ahead and add it to
this string when we define the value
later on and that of course is sugar
amount and once again I'd also like to
point out remember in the last video
that we said that our class templates do
not have a main method this is just
reusable code this isn't a program
itself so keep that in mind we're not
going to give it a main method here we
will do that when we create our program
to create our objects from this class
template so let's move on and let's
create our subclass now and we'll call
this class you guessed it gumdrops now
here comes the key point to this whole
video now you might be asking yourself
how do I tie the subclass to the
superclass you do that by the extend
statement this is where the gumdrops
class becomes the child of the parent
class or superclass candy again we use
the extend statement so let's go ahead
and do that now is the first statement
that we'll put in so we'll use the usual
public keyword now this is where we
define the subclass which is gumdrops
and this is where we use the extends
keyword so we go extends and it's going
to be our candy superclass so to review
this really quickly gumdrops always
comes first the subclass always comes
first and then the and then the
superclass comes after the extends
parameter so gumdrops extends candy
inherits everything from candy that's
what ties gumdrops to candy okay good so
let's move on and before we do that
let's just put in our usual comment this
is a sub class spelling it wrong yet
again terrible typer as you guys can see
okay so now we need to define some
attributes of gumdrops specifically what
are the flavors of gumdrops well I can
think of a few let's give this first one
cinnamon and we're going to give that a
string of cinnamon great and then let's
think of another one here and I Wow okay
sorry about that okay and let's go ahead
and define another attribute here
another type of gumdrop ah let's go with
isn't there spearmint okay whoops again
No
so there we have our flavors defined now
we need to give this class some methods
some things to do some behaviors so
we'll go void give me cinnamon and let's
have this method do the following
behavior we're going to do a
system.out.println and let's print out a
string and we'll say this is a cinnamon
and then we're going to go ahead and add
the variable that we have here which was
cinnamon and then we'll do another
string at whoa that's way wrong and we
want to give this spaces here so this
prints out in a nice neat sentence so
let's create a method for the spearmint
flavor and we can just go ahead and copy
and paste this so we don't have to keep
doing this over and over again
so there we go we've got our gumdrop
subclass now which is inheriting the
behaviors and variables that we defined
in candy so now we can go ahead and
create our program which is going to
create some gumdrop objects from these
two classes that we defined and let's
call this inheritance program and we'll
do the usual public class keywords of
course and let's put in our comments
this is the actual program and now let's
put in our main method well that's going
to look pretty similar to you guys
now remember what I said before was that
the main method goes in the program we
do not put it in our classes so now we
can go ahead and create some gumdrop
objects and let's do that so if you
remember in the previous tutorial we
specify the gumdrops class first
followed by the name of the object that
we want to call this now when I was
younger we refer to those as red
gumdrops so let's call this red and I
need to capitalize that D actually
otherwise we'll get Intel assents
problems and we will use the new keyword
to say this is a new object based off
the gumdrops class and we will type in
gumdrops again and let's do the same
thing for the spearmint flavor let's go
ahead and create a green gumdrop we're
going to give this new object based off
the gumdrops class the name of green so
now let's go ahead and have these
objects do some things so let's go ahead
and do red dot and let's go ahead and
give me cinnamon so we're pulling this
method using this method that we don't
have to retype out from the gumdrops
class that we defined now let's go ahead
and give it a sugar amount
and you'll see that is right here there
we go and we're going to say that is
equal to ten grains of sugar so let's go
ahead and review what's going on here we
created this object off the gumdrops
class template and we're going to go
ahead and use the method that we defined
here from that class we don't have to
retype the whole method out we can just
use a shortcut which is give me cinnamon
next we're going to go ahead and use the
sugar amount which we're getting from
the overall superclass of candy because
gumdrops inherited that from candy we're
able to do that remember this object
came from the gumdrops class and that
gives it access to this superclass and
let me show you that let's go ahead and
get rid of this extends here and you'll
notice we should get intellisense and we
do it no longer knows about that because
it can't get to it because this is no
longer inheriting the sugar amount so if
we stick that back here now we have
access to it you see how that works then
we need to go ahead and use the method
from the superclass which was if you
remember display sugar amount so we're
going to go ahead and use our object
here our red gumdrop object and we'll go
ahead and display the sugar amount and
so let's go ahead and run this now and
there you see we've got our cinnamon
gumdrop and the sugar amount is ten oh
but now we want to go ahead and add
another object to this we want to go
ahead and get a spearmint gum drop so
let's do that so it'll be pretty much
the same deal we're just going to go
green dot give me spearmint and we're
going to go ahead and
go ahead and give this a sugar amount
and let's say here that there's only
nine grains of sugar in the spearmint
flavor it's not quite as deadly okay and
so you see how this works guys it's so
much easier to go ahead and use these
quick references rather than having to
type this code all out again much easier
to use and then we have to go ahead and
display the sugar amount whoops we're
not using we're using green dot and
let's go ahead and display that and now
let's run this and now we've got two
gumdrops
we should get yeah we got a spearmint
cinnamon and it even came with the sugar
amount that goes in each one of them
because they all have sugar right okay
so let's flip back to the slide here for
a second and you can see this has
changed before we close this video I
want to show you now if you take a look
here so you can see how you could start
adding other classes here we could
create a new class called jelly bean and
you can start creating objects off of
that and the key is we do not have to
recreate our superclass of candy it's
already there we can just go ahead and
start with the subclass and so that's
how this whole hierarchy thing works so
I hope you found this useful please
