tutorial today we're going to discuss
variable scope within methods and this
is a relatively easy concept to
understand so this shouldn't be a long
tutorial now when you create a variable
or an object inside a method it is
usable only inside that method and that
is what variable scope is the scope is
the block in which a variable exists in
a program it's that simple
and so all of the variables and objects
you create inside that method will only
be available to that method if you want
them to be available to other methods
you have to define them outside of the
method in the class itself and that's
pretty much the way we've been doing
things actually we've been defining most
of our variables outside the method
inside the class itself so it's
available to all the rest of the methods
now these brackets right here is where
the variable scope is set everything
within these brackets in this method are
local to this method only so if we
define a variable in here it's
accessible only to everything inside
this method that's why it's called a
local variable and as I mentioned if we
put the variable outside of it it
becomes available to all the rest of the
methods so everything inside this method
is considered to be out of scope it's
unreachable every variable or object
defined outside of this method is
considered to be in scope it's available
to any other methods that we create so
let's do an example now so let's declare
an int variable and we'll call it number
and we'll give it a value and we'll do
some comments here this is a local
variable and we are declaring it and
initializing it if you remember in the
last video that we did we said that a
variable does not get initialized until
you assign it a value so that's what we
did here we declared it and gave it a
value and this is a local variable again
because it's contained within this
methods block so no other methods will
be able to reach it okay so now let's go
ahead and do a system out that print and
we'll just print out the variable name
now you can see it can reach it right
here it's available you also know that
this isn't in green that's because it's
not available to any of the rest of the
methods so everything is reachable
within this block this method now let's
go ahead and create another method and
try to reach this variable and you'll
see what happens here in a second so
we'll do a static void and we'll call
this method get' number and we'll do
another system dot out dot print number
and you can see we get some intellisense
here indicating there's a problem with
the variable scope it can't reach it
because it's inside this method so let's
go ahead and comment this out now and we
will copy and paste this outside the
method and remember we have to use the
static keyword here to make this
available to all the rest of the methods
and now you can see look this can reach
it and you'll also notice this changed
to green because now it's a global
variable and it's available to all the
rest of the methods now I will point out
that we did this example with static
methods and static variables you'll
remember that in the previous video we
said that when you do static methods you
have to use static variables but we
could also define a object variable here
and it's the same concept it would be
available to all the rest of the methods
so it's the same concept again for
object variables we just use static
variables for this example on variable
scope so that's pretty much it it's
pretty easy to understand I will see you
guys in the next job a tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
