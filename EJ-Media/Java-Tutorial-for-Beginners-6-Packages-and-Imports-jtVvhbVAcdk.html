tutorial I've got a few emails about
packages and people not really
understanding how to use those so they
wanted me to explain that and I can do
that in this tutorial so we will take a
break from coding here and just explain
packages this will be a really quick
tutorial now I have been working at IPC
on here on the left pane over here I've
been working out of the default package
now if you are going to code a large
project that is highly discouraged you
want to create a your own unique package
and the reason is is that these class
names right here have to be unique if
you're going to use the default package
otherwise if you name a class that is
not unique and it's the same name as a
classes in Java dot Lang la + G it will
override that class so that's why it's
always good to create a new package and
not work out of the default package so
basically if you create your own unique
package that ensures that there will not
be a name conflict between your classes
and any of the pre-canned classes that
come with Java so to create a new
package it's very easy we're just going
to go up to our main project node over
here right click on that hit new and
select java package and we'll just take
the default here new package hit finish
and you can see here down here under the
source packages node we get new package
now by itself that means nothing in
order to activate that in a sense we
need to actually add a class to that so
we'll add we'll right-click on the
package and hit Java class and just call
that new class and you can see here now
that color changed from grey to yellow
and it's an active package I would also
point out that this also applies to
Eclipse it's the same deal with the
clips now you can also move existing
classes that you've created to other
packages so now that we've created our
new package
let's move one of these classes that we
created in the default package over to
new package so we'll drag my first
program Java over to new package it will
ask you to refactor that you can also
move without refactoring but you
probably should refactor it's a hit
refactor
and there it is now it's in new package
so if you were following a lot of these
tutorials you want to move everything I
default package you can certainly go
ahead and put that into the new package
that we just created in working with
packages you may want to organize the
packages in a meaningful way for
instance if you were designing a game
and you had audio code that you wanted
to keep together you may create a
package just to hold all those classes
you may create another package to hold
all of your GUI code and another package
that holds all of your boards that you
create so there's various different ways
that you can organize those so let's say
you have multiple packages and you might
ask the question how do I get to a class
that's in another package if I want to
reference that class from my current
program yet that class is in another
package so for instance if we open up
math operators Java how do we get to new
class dot Java over here and the way we
do that in the first line of the Java
program always has to be the first line
use you write package and then you will
give the name of the package in this
case new package and then a semicolon
and then you will be able to start
referencing the classes in new package
so it's pretty simple to use another way
to import packages is to use the import
keyword so we could get rid of this line
one here and you could type in import
and then the name of the package which
is new package and then dot and you'll
give the name of the class in this case
we'll just select new class and we need
a semicolon and then that would import
the classes so that's another way you
can actually import a class that's
outside of your package keep in mind
that you only have to do this if you're
working out of different packages if
you're working out of the same package
for everything that you're doing you do
not need to import classes or packages
alrighty then I think I've exhausted
this subject on packages we will be
moving on to conditionals in the next
tutorial and specifically if statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
