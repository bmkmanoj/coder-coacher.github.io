index.html into our master template and
our default.aspx page and that gives us
our main page but now what we want to do
is make this a multi-page website and so
what we're going to do is add a web page
to this link so when the user hits this
link it will drill down into a new
content page that will have content
regarding this subject so let's flip
back to visual studio now before we add
our new content page I actually made a
mistake in the last video and sorry
about that we actually needed that ASP
code that we deleted out of our head so
I'm just going to copy and paste that
back over our existing code and there
you can see we've got our content
placeholder IDs back and this is for our
head section and I forgot I'm kind of
doing this off of memory but we actually
did need this and what it does is it
basically pulls in our style sheet for
the rest of the content pages that we
had so that's how our style sheet is
pulled in it's pulled in by using this
content placeholder ID and of course
this was a default that's all we deleted
yesterday so I've just added it back and
then all we need to do is add the HTML
tags back to our content page and this
is stuff I just deleted in our last
video so we'll just put those back and
there you go that's all we needed to do
and again any further content pages that
we add and we're going to do that in a
minute we'll have this as a template and
I'll show you that in a second and as I
said this actually pulls in our style
sheet from our master page master now
you can just kind of forget about this
because we're going to really use our
main content that's why I named this
main content we really don't have to
worry about this anymore it's just sort
of in the background it'll pull in our
style sheet and we can forget about it
we're really still concerned about this
ASP tag that we were working on in the
last video and same goes for this we can
kind of just forget about this and let's
just save everything up here and let's
just make sure our website continues to
work it should but it's always good to
test it when you add new code or code
back in this case and yeah everything
looks good so let's flip back to visual
studio and so now let's add our further
content page now what I want to point
out is that you will probably only have
one master page for your website because
this is our template and this kind of
represents the theme
of our entire website you might add
another master page but usually I only
add one but you could add a couple but
again I kind of like to keep the same
theme throughout the website and so that
means using the same template so usually
I only use one master page and as I said
in the last video once you get that
master page going you're really just
adding content pages your life becomes a
lot easier so think about this you'll
probably only have one master page
template but you could have dozens even
hundreds of content pages so given that
fact that we could have hundreds of web
pages it doesn't make sense to dump all
of our content pages into our root
directory because it will become a mess
very quickly so what we want to do is
create a folder to hold all of our
content pages and we can set up a nice
folder structure so let's add new folder
and we're simply going to call this web
pages pretty simple and so we want to
break this down even further let's add a
folder for all of our Rome web pages so
let's add a folder we're just going to
call that room pretty easy stuff and now
let's create our content page for our
subject on rooms so we're going to add
new item we're going to select web form
and of course we're not going to use
default that aspx that name is reserved
for our main content page so we're going
to call this Rome dot aspx very
appropriately we're going to select
master page now you're always going to
do that for any further content pages
that you add always have to select our
template right we want to pull that in
and we only have one master page so
that's pretty easy we hit OK and there
you see now we've got our Rome dot aspx
and I want you to take a look at this
this is pretty cool here's our master
page that we're pulling in right but
look at this it automatically creates
our content placeholders for us based
off what we had in our default look at
that it even took the same ID names that
we used in this case it used main
content 1 so we don't have to type any
of this over look how easy this is but
like I said we're only concerned about
our main content one placeholder we
don't care about this anymore this is
just pulling in our CSS so now we have
to go ahead and put some content in here
right and so I've already typed all this
out I'm going to copy and paste this in
here
either way I will put all this text that
I'm about to put in here I will make a
link for this to all this text in case
you're following along
I'll also re-upload the code for both of
these pages since we change them okay so
let's go ahead and copy and paste
everything in here that I've typed up
and you can see I've typed up this nice
little article here I've got a subject
on the Roman Senate and then we're going
to talk about the Roman assemblies by
the way can you tell that I am a history
buff I am actually this is the only time
I'm going to do this I've never plugged
my history den YouTube but I have
another YouTube site that's called
History Day and it's all one word it's
called history done right there so if
you're interested in history you can
check out that channel as well okay so
this is the article that I've typed up
here and so you can see all the little
line breaks and everything here so let's
hit save all and we're just going to
save this SLN file again and whoops
there's one more thing we have to do and
I just remembered it let's see here we
have to actually point to our page and
we're going to do that on our default
page right here so we're actually going
to have to point to our page now right
we're pointing to this old index.html
that's not going to work so let's switch
our href to our new Rome aspx content
page and so we're just going to type in
web pages we're going to do a backspace
and then we're going to type in Rome for
our there folder and then our actual
aspx page which reports is Rome dot aspx
and now this content page will load up
when we click on our link so let's go
ahead and save all now before we load up
our page I just want to point out one
thing this is attribute right here this
target this actually loads up a separate
page when we click on the link and I'll
show you that right now so what we'll do
here is we'll load the web page first
with this parameter so you can see what
it looks like opening up a separate page
and then we're going to remove this
parameter because I like to keep all the
content within our main page because I
think that's easier on the users but if
you prefer to open up separate pages you
can go ahead and keep this a parameter
but I think it's better actually to keep
everything on the same page because I
like a common look and feel to
everything so let's go ahead and load up
our web page and hopefully our first
content page drill down works
let's click on this and there you can
see look at that now I find that jolting
to open up a separate window here the
whole point of this is to keep
everything in our main content pane so
let's close all this out and let's
remove this parameter and we'll do a
save all let's go ahead and load our
webpage up again click on our link and
look at that it stayed right inside our
main content window and look how nice
that is we have the same look and feel
this is very easy on the user now
nothing here changes and that's the
whole point of master and content pages
we want to keep everything the same it's
easy on the eyes
simplicity is the key and that's why
this is really nice now if we go back
and we hit this again just keep an eye
nothing changes it we're just loading
content now now we're going to create
some back buttons in the future and do
some other things but for now we just
have to hit the back button but we'll
change that in future videos now I want
to point out that obviously this doesn't
look too good the text itself so we need
to actually add some styling to this yes
believe it or not this isn't all just
about ASP I want you to think of visual
studio as your end environment we're
going to continually add HTML CSS all
kinds of things is not all about ASP you
will always have to refine your webpage
and we can do all of that in visuals to
do that so that's we're going to do in
the next video we're actually going to
add some CSS and some HTML to make this
look even better so you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
