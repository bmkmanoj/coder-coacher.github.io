today we are going to be looking at
arrays arrays are variables so let's
just start that right off the top here
arrays our variables the difference is
they are a bunch of variables that are
grouped together under a common name so
it's kind of like a so if you wanted to
do multiple variables you can do it
under one names kind of like a short way
to do that so with that being said you
can create arrays in the same way you
create a variable and the same type of
information that can be stored in a
variable can also be stored in an array
so we will get to that now and we will
type in int the same data types that
variables use are also used by arrays
because arrays our variables the only
difference is like I said before we're
going to use square brackets to define
this as an array and the other thing is
so so for instance when we say that
arrays have the same data types that
variables do we can also do string
arrays we can do single character arrays
we can do byte array all the different
data types that variables are defined
with can also be used by array so we're
going to start out with an integer array
and we're going to use square brackets
so the Java note and I'm doing squiggly
brackets square brackets and now this is
going to be an integer array so we're
going to say we're going to give it a
name and we're going to call this
numbers now a quick point here when you
create arrays they should be in groups
of related variables so to use an old
cliche
you're not going to mix oil and water
and so well so for instance let's say
this was going to be oils and we were
going to do a bunch of variables on oils
bunch of oil variables we would not put
water in there because that's not
similar to oil we would have to do a
water array with different types of
water variables
so again they should be variables that
are similar in nature so that's just a
way to think of that and all this
relates to objects now we are not going
to get into objects in this tutorial but
we will get into them in the next
tutorials and I will discuss after we
learn about objects how they relate to
arrays but for now I'm just going to
talk about the functionality of arrays
so let's go ahead and put back in our
name so to recap we've defined an int
datatype for this array we've put the
square brackets here to tell Java this
is not going to be a single variable
it's going to be an array of variables
the name of it is going to be numbers so
now that we have the name of our array
we can go ahead and start referencing it
in the rest of our program just like we
have been referencing variables in the
other tutorials so let's do that we're
going to go ahead and say numbers the
name of our array equals we're going to
use the keyword new here and then we
have to specify how many different items
will be stored in this array in this
array and those are called elements now
don't get too confused with elements
they're basically variables I guess you
could call them elements but we're just
going to define here how many elements
will be stored in this array and what
we're going to say here is int and then
we're going to do square brackets here
the only difference here is we are going
to say how many elements or variables
will be stored in this array and in this
case we're going to say 10 and we're
going to go ahead and put a semicolon
there and there you go
so to recap here's where we define the
array we called it number so this is
essentially an int array variable you
want to think of it that way and then
here is where we said this array numbers
is going to have 10 elements or 10
variables in it and here is where we
specified how many elements are going to
be in this array and we
there are going to be 10/10 elements or
just think of them as a 10 int variables
it's a good way to think of that now I
want to point out one thing right here
you cannot mix and match data types in
an array so here we said this is going
to be an integer array we cannot go over
here and say well no this is actually
going to be a string it does not work
that way you have to use the same data
type throughout so that's an important
point so now we're going to go ahead and
create all the int variable zhalong with
their values down here but before we do
that let's actually switch this to 5
because I do not want to create 10 of
these suckers so we're just going to
create 5 variables and the way we do
that is we start out with the array name
which is numbers and the reason we use
the array name here is because we are
storing all over all of our variables
under a common a rating which is numbers
so they do not have individual variable
names remember that okay
so we're going to go ahead and put in a
square bracket now we're going to put in
a 0 now that's actually identifies the
variable the 0 and I'll explain that a
little bit but it always starts out with
a 0 and it goes to 5 in this case now if
it was 100 would go 0 1 2 3 you'd count
all the way to 100 we're going to give
this variable its value in this case
we're going to say this equals the
number 35 a nice hole number for our int
data type okay now we're going to go
ahead and do some copy and pasting here
because I don't want to go ahead and
have to put all that back in there
and we're going to create 5 of these 1 2
3 4 5 and then again we're going to go 1
2 3 4 so this is this section in the
middle here is called the index this
like I said actually identifies the
unique variable 0 1 2 3 4 this is the
index so and this will always be the
same it will always start at 0 now
you're going to notice that the 4
actually equals the 5 and that is
because computers and I don't know who
decided to do this always start
it's zero so just keep in mind when
you're referencing this fifth variable
here it's actually going to be a four
that's actually the fifth variable of
four so just keep that in mind okay and
let's give these different values so
we'll make this you know let's make this
65 we'll make this 135
we'll make this 335 we'll make this 535
so there we go so again let's recap we
created our array here we called it
numbers it's an int array type here we
said okay this array we're going to put
five variables in here and down here is
where we actually created the individual
variables and assign the values to them
the numeric values and this is the index
and this is actually where we identify
the unique variable so this and it
always starts out again with zero and
one final point before we move on you
can call these variables or elements
remember that you'll hear these referred
to as elements once again this could be
a variable or element the best way to
think of it though is just a variable
easier for me at least to understand
okay so let's move on now and what we're
going to do now is create some output
for this and actually reference one of
these variables here and print it out so
we will do our famous system dot out dot
print now you will put in the array name
here which is numbers and in square
brackets we will specify the variable
that we want and to do that we go to the
index and so let's go ahead and print
out one so we will go ahead and do that
the other thing I'd like to point out
remember
so these always go zero one two three
four you do not give these unique
variable names that's the whole point of
an array but this is where you go ahead
and specify the variables that you want
and the value that you wish to print out
so we're going to go ahead and do a 1
and now we will go ahead and run this
and it's really taken its time here and
we got a 65 exactly what we expected now
let's go ahead and change this up and
reference for now remember if you tried
to put in a five here that would not
work because we always start at zero so
let's go ahead and run this as a four
and we'll see what we get and we got the
assigned value 535 now let's see what
happens if you try to go out of bounds
here we'll actually select a index that
does not actually exist so this variable
doesn't even exist and you'll see here
we get an exception is thrown that says
by the way you just tried to reference
something as index it didn't work all
righty then so moving along remember I
said that arrays can use different data
types just the weight variables can so
let's do that now let's do it go ahead
and do a string array so we're going to
go ahead and call this candy and we'll
go ahead and rename the variable to
candy so that it's more appropriate and
actually we're going to only do two of
these because you guys already get the
idea how this stuff works so we're just
going to do and then we'll go ahead and
just get rid of the rest of these okay
and now we're going to go ahead and put
in the strings because we're not going
to be using a whole number anymore
because this is no longer an int
datatype and we have to use quotes
remember that because this is a string
so we're going to go ahead and put in a
string here for a type of candy let's
just say this is mint and then we'll
come down here and say that this is rock
candy whoops so there we go we've got
two types of candy and we're getting
some intellisense here because remember
I said you cannot mix and match
datatypes I forgot to change the int so
we need to switch that to a string and
let's specify the zero we'll take the
first one mint we want to print that out
and let's go ahead and run this and
voila
there you go we've got mint
so let's go ahead and close out this
output window there is one final way I
would like to show you that you can
actually create arrays and it's a little
bit shorter and quicker and what we do
is we actually take the index these
indexes here and the values and we place
those right into the square brackets
itself so we would type like mint here
we would type in Arak you would actually
place the values up here and this
becomes the index the index so this
actually equals zero this actually
equals one and let's do that now it's
actually easier to show you this really
quickly with an int so let's go ahead
and we define int so we will define the
array with the square brackets and we
will call this numbers again we're going
to say equals two now instead of a
square bracket we're going to use a
squiggly bracket let's put in the number
five and then we're going to go ahead
and put a comma in or we're going to put
in the number nine then we're going to
go ahead and put in a closing squiggly
bracket followed by a semicolon and
we're going to go ahead and take this
numbers array that we define down here
and put that down here now like I said
let's go ahead and print out the number
nine now this remember these are the
values and the indexes even though we
don't see the index numbers here this is
a zero this is a one let's actually put
in another let's put in a number number
here so put in 45 so this would be zero
one two okay for the index and this is
the value so it's just a quicker way we
don't have to define everything down
here like we did in the other arrays and
then let's go ahead and print out two
and I will expect that we will actually
get the number 45 and let's say that we
did right down here 45 and let's go
ahead and we'll print out zero we should
get a 5 now personally I prefer the
other way because I like to see all of
my variables
a sign and written out down here but
this is just a quicker way to initialize
these so that's pretty much it for this
tutorial I will see you guys in the next
tutorial have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
