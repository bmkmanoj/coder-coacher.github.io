important concept called kiss and no I
don't mean kissing guys sorry it stands
for keep it simple stupid now some of
the best developers in the world will
tell you that the reason that they're so
good is because they follow that very
simple methodology keep it simple stupid
that is they do not create massive
methods that are not understandable in
other words their methods only do a
couple of things at the most usually it
just does one or two actions and that's
it if they need to do something else
they create another method and that's
the main point I want to make here is
that you don't need to make an overly
complex method if it serves its purpose
move on and create another method
because if you create monster methods
good luck debugging that if a bug comes
about you only want to have to debug
maybe 10 to 15 lines at most if you have
a hundred line method it might work at
one point but if there's a bug later on
with the JVM or something and so the
basic point I'm trying to make is you
don't want your code to become
unmanageable you always want to be in
control of your code not the other way
around and the same applies to classes
at the class level you really want to
set up a inheritance hierarchy so you
want to use interfaces and abstract
classes to the maximum benefit you don't
want to have a bunch of classes that are
unrelated to each other because you
won't really know what's going on you
won't understand the relationship
between those classes you don't have to
write overly complex code to accomplish
the goals that you want to accomplish so
that is the main point I wanted to make
so I thought we'd take a little bit of a
break from coding if you've been
following the entire series in the next
video we will start to do some
interesting stuff we're going to be
doing some file saves so we're going to
be actually saving objects okay I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
