left off in the last video now in the
last video of course we validated
against this first text box the name
text box in this video we're going to
validate against the address text box as
well so both of these text boxes now
have to be filled out so I've added
another get element by ID right here and
I created a box too variable and if
we're going to validate against another
text box that means we need to add
another condition so we'll have multiple
conditions and here is the second
condition and in order to do that we
need to use a logical operator and in
this case we're using the or logical
operator so you can see I've got two
conditions here now the rest of the code
that we use from the last video will
pretty much stay the same we're not
going to alter it so basically we want
the same result if the user doesn't at
least put at least one character in
these two text boxes an alert will
inform them to do so and actually I
don't think we want this to say this
feel this the field marked in red
because we're not actually going to use
a focus method in this video we'll do
that a few videos but not in this one so
we'll just say the field cannot be blank
that's what we'll say now when you start
adding multiple conditions things can
get a little bit more confusing and
that's why it's helpful to create a
diagram and so that's what I've done
down here I've created a diagram that
will walk us through each of the
scenarios and there can only be four
outcomes so this is the first condition
and that will be condition a and the
second condition will be condition B and
0 will be false and one will be true and
you can see I've got them listed here so
in this scenario the first condition
would be true in the second condition
would be true and that would make the
overall expression true that's because
the or operator only needs one of these
conditions to be true that's it only one
has to be true in order for the entire
expression to be true and you can see
that here the first one is true the
second is false but the overall
expression is still true and so that's
why it's helpful to write these
conditions out to make sure the outcomes
are what you expect and of course it's
the same as the last video we want this
to be true if the user didn't fill out
both of these forms true
cents yes they filled it out incorrectly
and our code gets executed if this
overall expression is false that means
they filled it out correctly and we
won't stop the form from being submitted
so let's walk through each one of these
now and see how it works
okay so in this case the first condition
will be true and the second condition
will be true so that means both of these
are null because that again we did this
in the last video we said it's true if
this is set to null so no characters
will be put into each one of these text
boxes so we hit submit and it stopped us
good let's go to the second one now the
first one will be true so this will be
no but the second one is false that
means they filled this out correctly
they put in some characters and it
stopped us write the expression will be
true because of the or remember only one
has to be true and it's true yes they
didn't fill this out completely because
the first one was left not so let's go
down to the third outcome so the first
is false so they put in some characters
up here but the second is truth so it
remains no so let's go ahead and hit
submit and it stopped us okay let's go
down to the fourth outcome both are
false so this means both of these fields
had characters in them if we hit submit
ah it let us go through because in both
cases they filled out the textbox
correctly they put in characters and if
you take a look at this now three of
these outcomes will be true if there's
any truths in here the or operator will
be true and it will stop the form from
being submitted so there's only one way
they can fill this out correctly and
that is to have characters in both text
boxes and then both of these conditions
will be false so I think you can see why
it's nice to fill out these diagrams to
see how some of these logical operators
work and it's very useful again like I
said if you want to start adding
multiple conditions now you might ask
well how could I add a another condition
for this phone text box well we're not
going to do it in this video but you
would simply just make another variable
B box 3 you'd get the element ID for
that which in this case would be phone
right phone and then you would create
the third condition here and actually
you would use the or operator again so
you would put it here and then you would
put the third condition right here it
would be box 3 value and that's how you
can add
another condition but you have to use
the or operator again okay that's going
to do it for this video I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
