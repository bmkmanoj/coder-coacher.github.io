collections and generics and of course
we got started with that subject in the
last video and now we're actually going
to put together some code now the first
thing we want to do of course is import
the ArrayList this is something that
Java provides again and we get that out
of Java dot util and it's just like any
other object that we've created we're
going to specify ArrayList as the type
and here is the generic which I talked
about in the last video goes between
these angle brackets and we're going to
be doing a list of numbers that's what
this collection is going to be holding a
list of numbers now we could write in
string here and we could hold a bunch of
strings such as names or lists of
countries any type of list that we
wanted to hold but as I said we're gonna
do integer we're gonna name this test
collection and that of course is our
object and of course this is the usual
thing we have to do we have a
constructor to build our ArrayList and
as I said in the last video we don't
have to specify the size of the array
this is a dynamic array so we can add
and remove as we wish at runtime so
that's the big difference between a
normal array and an ArrayList collection
we don't have to put size here we can
add and remove as we wish and so that's
a big difference and so let's add our
first number and so we're going to
specify of course our object and then as
usual if we hit dot we get all the
methods that we can use in the ArrayList
and you can see there's quite a few here
and we're going to use the add method
and then we're going to specify the
number that we want in this list in this
case it's going to be 12 followed by a
semicolon now the key difference here is
you will remember in the normal array we
had to put a index so we'd have to
specify zero you do not have to do that
with an ArrayList it is automatically
assigned to it so this first add would
have an index of 0 automatically and
again we don't have to specify it and
obviously like I talked about in the
last video we're using methods here to
add values to our array in this case
we're going to be using a 12 and then we
can just add as many different numbers
we want here so let's add a 33 and let's
add a few more numbers let's add 45 and
we'll even add one more let's add a 69
now we can go ahead and print this out
and we should get a nice list of numbers
so let's go ahead and run this and you
can see we got our list of numbers
printed out here now as I said we can
use other methods in this ArrayList at
run time so let's say we wanted to
remove one of these numbers we want to
remove the 33 so we just call our object
again and this time we're going to use
the remove and we're going to specify
one and I'll explain that in a second
now this is actually not the number that
we put in here to remove up here we
actually specify the index and in this
case we're saying remove index 1 which
is 33 so if we wanted to remove 12 we
would specify zero if we wanted to
remove 45 we would specify 3 and we need
to actually put another system data out
print past this because remember this is
at run time and we've changed the
collection so we'll actually get to
system dot out prints now and we'll run
this and here you can see that 33 is in
fact removed and then you know let's add
a few more numbers here so you can see
how dynamic this is we can just keep
adding removing so we'll add 175 here
let's add another number
we'll add 4002 big number and then we'll
do another system dot out print and we
will run this and there you can see
we've got our revised list here at the
bottom now as I said there are several
methods to this ArrayList and you can go
through each one of them there you can
actually do guess where you can get the
contents of the entire list you can get
the size of the entire list and to do
that again you just hit the dot here of
course and that will provide you with
all the methods that are in this
ArrayList and like I said there are many
different methods you can get the size
you can do notifies there's all
different types of methods in this
ArrayList and I
encourage you to go ahead and play
around those okay that's gonna do it for
this video I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
