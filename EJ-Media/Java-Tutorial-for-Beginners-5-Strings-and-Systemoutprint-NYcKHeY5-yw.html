tutorial in this tutorial we are going
to talk about strings and the
system.out.print now in the previous
tutorials we've touched on some of these
but I just wanted to have a tutorial
dedicated just to strings in the system
print out because they are very
important strings are very critical to
Java programs they use these to
communicate with users and as I had
talked about in previous tutorials
strings are basically collections of
texts and characters and pretty much
anything else you want to put in there
if you're going to be coding in Java
you're almost always going to be using
strings so let's just talk about a few
of the ways you can store texts and
strings and then present it to users
which is of course what strings are used
to do so the first way we can store a
like a single letter or a number we can
do that through the keyword CHR so let's
do that here and then we're going to say
this we're going to assign this variable
name name it letter H where he's a
semicolon and then we're going to say
the letter H equals and then we have to
put in single quote and you do that you
use single quotes so that Java does not
get confused and think that's a variable
name and then we'll just call that H put
it in semi semicolon and we will print
that out so let's run file and we get H
now you can also do this as I mentioned
before with numbers so let's just say
this is will keep the H but we'll just
we'll just flip this to a 1 run this
again and that is and then we get a 1
now the other way we can store a
collection of characters is through the
string and we'll type that in here now I
want to point out one thing unlike int
and car CHR you have to actually
capitalize the S on string or you will
intellisense warning so let's assign
this string a a name we're going to call
this sentence and then we'll just hit
semicolon we're going to then say
sentence equals now unlike the CHR that
we use before which took single quotes
here you have to use double quotes for
your string so we're just going to say
this is a sentence and again these
double quotes are used so that Java
basically does not get confused and
think this is some sort of variable name
so you always have to have double quotes
for whatever string you're using this is
a sentence that you should read and
let's put in a semicolon and we are good
to go we'll go ahead and run this there
you see our sentence has been sent to
the user to the command line here that's
the output and that's basically all
right moving along let's talk about the
system dot out dot print and obviously
I've been talking about that in all the
previous or using that in all the
previous tutorials but let's go over
that now and just talk about a couple
things I want to talk about with this so
let's close out that and we'll get rid
of these variables here and we'll just
keep the system dot out dot print so
let's talk about the system dot out dot
print and this is easier just to show
you then exploiting it so let's first
we'll do that so let's type in one and
then we'll copy and paste this again and
type it in one line so let's run this
now and you'll see that these were
printed out on one line if you want
these to have their own separate line
you have to type in println so it's
basically we'll just tag on an Ln at the
end here and we'll use different
line and you'll see now we'll run this
and you'll see now that these are on
separate lines so that's the basic
difference between the print and the
print
LN pretty simple stuff one other item I
would like to mention you may ask the
question what if you need to use double
quotes so let's get rid of this line and
you want to say something like Henry
said quote he was angry end quote
well as you can see here we're going to
get an intellisense warning Java is
going to get confused because it's going
to think you're trying to part another
string when in fact this quote here is
part of the main string so in order to
uncover
we need to use a backslash to so we put
a backslash before the double quote and
then we put a backslash before the N
double quote and you can see here now
that the intellisense warning is gone so
let's run this and you'll see how this
comes out so here it's displayed Henry
said and there is the double quotes so
Java is no longer confused so you can
use those special characters to
accomplish that it's the same process by
the way for single quotes as well so if
we put a single quote here and run this
there you get a single quote so it's the
same same idea there are several other
special characters that you can use
we're not going to get into all of them
right now but I will show you one more
that you can use you can use a /n -
backslash n to create a new line so we
could say this is
line we will run this again and you see
here this is a new line is has its own
line so that's another special character
that you can use so that's it now for
special characters you can also paste
two strings together and that that's
probably fairly obvious but you can use
the arithmetic operator to do that so
let's let's do I'll show you that really
quickly so we could say Henry is going
whoops
going to Mary and then we will use the
plus operator so we'll add these paste
these strings together Alice
oops until I am a absolutely terrible
diaper okay so let's go ahead and run
this and you can see these well we
actually put a space in here so that
reads more like a sentence we'll run
this again Henry is going to Mary Alice
so you can see that these two were added
together so you can paste rings together
that's one way you could do that there
are many more advanced things that you
can do with strings and when you start
getting to the more advanced topics
you're going to be invariably using
methods you're going to have to start
using methods so you can do a lot of
complex things you can compare strings
against each other you can count the
number of characters you can convert
lowercase to uppercase in fact let's
let's do that now so let's get rid of
the system dot out or we'll keep that
actually let's just create a new line
here and we will define a new string
variable name we'll call this well let's
call this country
and will say this is equal to United
States semicolon and then we will define
another string and we will call this now
you notice how we put that United States
in the lower case so we're going to be
switching that to uppercase so it'll
look a little bit more presentable so
we'll just call this string uppercase
and then we will say equals two and we
will say whoops we didn't put the equal
sign in and then we will say country dot
now here is where we're going to call a
predefined and you can see here we're
getting some intellisense we're going to
use a method and it's sort of
recognizing that because we put the
period in and so this is really helpful
you can just come over here and use two
we're going to use this to uppercase and
it put that in nice and neat these
parentheses here define that as the
method so we're going to hit that and
now we're going to do is we're going to
print out this uppercase variable name
that we defined here and we'll go ahead
and run this and you can see we got the
United States and it's been converted to
all caps so that's one thing you can do
with method we can also use a method to
look for a string in another string and
it'll tell us the position of where that
particular string is or our character so
let's let's do that we will I'm going to
delete the second line we can keep the
first line so let's declare an int and
we'll define the name of this variable
is index equal whoops equals country dot
now the method that we want to use is
index of that's that's the method that
we want to use here and we're going to
be looking for a particular character
here so in double quotes
let's put the character you okay
and the what so we'll print this out and
we're going to print out index and let's
go ahead and run this now you can see
that it's in position zero here is the U
so it found it it located it the index
up located in our string and it simple
the way it always works it always starts
out with zero now let's switch that to N
and run this again and you'll see that
we get a number one here and that's in
position one now let's let's actually
put a character in here that doesn't
exist in the string let's put in Z and
we'll run this and you'll get a negative
one a negative one basically is a return
value that says hey we couldn't find
that character in this string alrighty
then so that is going to wrap up this
tutorial it was a little bit more than I
expected I presented quite a bit of
information here but I hope you just
soak it in and we will move on to the
next Java tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
