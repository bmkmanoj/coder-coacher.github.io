first shape using HTML canvas and we're
going to go ahead and use the rectangle
method and we'll get to that in a minute
but basically we're going to go ahead
and use some of the methods and
properties we've been using all along so
we've been using the line width property
we're going to use that again we're
going to set this to 12 pixels and of
course stroke style allows us to set the
color and so we're going to go ahead and
use that we're going to set it to red
and of course you have to end anything
that you draw with these stroke methods
so of course we need to use that but
here is the rectangle method which
allows us to draw a rectangle and so
that's what we're going to talk about in
this video now these first two values
here are the X&amp;amp;Y coordinate that
determines where we position our
rectangle on our web page by the way
it's always that way whenever you're
trying to determine a position the X
always comes first
and then the Y always comes second so
for the X the X is for the horizontal
access and the y coordinate is for the
vertical access so we're basically
saying here is how many pixels do we
want to come in from the left side of
the screen it always moves left to right
on a horizontal axis and we're going to
say 190 so we want to come in 190 pixels
from the left on the horizontal axis and
then the y-axis we're going to be coming
down from the top of the page and we
want to come down 90 pixels so now we
have the position determined now we want
to determine the width and the height
and the third value is for the width and
we're going to set that to 170 pixels
and then for the height let's set that
to 100 pixels okay so let's go ahead and
save this and now let's go ahead and
execute this and take a look at that we
got our rectangle right there and
doesn't that look nice now one thing I
want to point out is these X's and
y-coordinates those work against the
upper left corner of this rectangle
that's how you determine the position so
if you wanted to move this down just
keep in mind those coordinates work
against the upper left corner of the
rectangle and so basically if the x
coordinate we said come in 190 pixels
from the left right to this upper left
part of the rectangle and same thing for
the Y we said come down 90 pixels right
to the upper left corner of the
rectangle so again that's how that works
now
we can also fill this rectangle with the
color so let's go ahead and do that now
this is a little bit different when you
want to start filling you basically have
to do that outside the stroke method the
stroke method will not allow you to fill
the rectangle that's just the way it is
so we basically have to come down here
and write some new code and the first
thing we want to do is call our object
of course which is Conte and what we're
going to do is close the path now you
might be wondering why do I have to do
that well the reason is we actually have
to close this part right here we have to
close this out in order to fill the
rectangle so you just have to call this
method and it doesn't take any values we
just need to call it and that will close
out the path and then we can go ahead
and fill and then what we need to do is
specify the color that we want to use to
fill our rectangle and in this case we
use fill style that's what you use and
we're going to give this a value of blue
that's what we're going to do good and
of course we need our semicolon now
similar to up here where we had to close
out our stroke we also need to go ahead
and close out the fill and actually we
can just take this right here because
it's very similar and we'll just come
down here copy and paste that and
instead of stroke we use fill and that
will now close out the fill so let's go
ahead and save this and let's make sure
it works and if they look at that we
fill the rectangle with blue that's very
nice now you might be asking yourself
well in the last video we use this move
to method first we have that as our
first line of code why aren't we using
it again well it's a good question first
of all this does the same thing we
specify an X and a y-coordinate that
tells us where to start but we don't
need it because the rectangle method
already had that so if you're using a
method that draws a specific shape and
you already specify the x and y
coordinates there you don't need to use
this move too method so that's why we're
not using that method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
