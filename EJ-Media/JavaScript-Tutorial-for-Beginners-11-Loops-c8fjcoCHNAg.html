along with JavaScript syntax and
specifically we're going to take a look
at loops and even more specifically
we're going to take a look at while
loops now loops will look very familiar
to you if you have experience in other
programming languages now loops are very
similar to if statements which we
covered in the last few videos when we
talked about conditionals and loops do
something very similar they are testing
a condition that condition has to be
true or false
if it is true the block of code will get
executed if it is false it is all over
but here is where loops are different
than if statements if this condition is
true it will execute this line of code
and it will loop around and then test
the condition again and if it is true it
will keep going and so that is the
difference between if statements and
while loops while loops will keep
executing it as long as it is true until
it hits the first false condition and
then the loop exits out of the program
so again that is the key key difference
now you might ask well what if this
condition is always true then you get
into what's called an infinite loop
scenario and that is not a good scenario
because you'll never get out of this
loop but it'll just keep going around
and around in a vicious cycle and the
rest of your program will not run so
this has to eventually test out false or
again you will have an infinite loop and
the way we do that is we set up a
counter and we'll do that in a second
but first let's set up the condition and
we're going to say I which is less than
5 so as long as I is less than 5 this
condition will be true now the first
thing that we need to do is create a
variable called I and so we'll do that
right up here and so we're going to say
I equals 1 and this I stands for index
our index will start out at 1 and so if
we executed this now while 1 is less
than 5 and so this would be executed but
we would still have an infinite loop
because this would loop around and I
would always be 1 so we have to change
the value of I and how do we do that
through an incrementer which we talked
about a few videos ago and so let's put
that right down here and
so now this will get incremented by one
each time this while loop runs so let's
just walk through this so we define the
variable I here and started it out at 1
the loop will get executed it will be
true because I is less than 5 the block
of code will run and then after that
this will get incremented by 1 and so it
will come around here and this value for
our variable will now be incremented by
1 to 2 and it will go all the way around
till it reaches 5 and then obviously 5
is not less than 5 and the program will
terminate it at that point so let's go
ahead and save this and we'll flip over
to our web page and let's go ahead and
run this in Chrome and there you can see
we got the expected results we got four
sentences of a statement has run it
didn't run a fifth time because again
five is not less than five and that's
what we expected okay that is going to
do it for this video in the next video
we will continue on with loops and we
will take a look at one of the more
popular loops that is used in JavaScript
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
