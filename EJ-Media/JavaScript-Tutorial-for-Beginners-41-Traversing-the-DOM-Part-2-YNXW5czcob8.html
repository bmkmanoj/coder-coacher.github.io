traversing the Dom was all about and we
moved from the parent to the child and
that allowed us to select some of the
children to manipulate their element in
this video we're essentially going to
reverse what we did in the last video so
we're going to move upwards rather than
downwards we're going to move up so
we're going to get the idea of the first
paragraph and that will allow us to move
up and then we can target the parent
note so that's what we're going to do in
this video so essentially again like I
said we're just going to reverse what we
did in the last video and that's another
way to traverse the DOM you can go up
you can go sideways and you can go down
so let's take a look at the code here
and I've inserted an ID here because we
need to target one of these paragraphs
and then that will allow us to get the
parent node so let's flip over to the
JavaScript code and we'll fill this in
so I'll go ahead and copy and paste the
first line here and you can see as I
said we're starting out with a child so
that's the first object that we're going
to create and we're going to go ahead
and get the ID and of course it is p1
and now of course we can specify the
parent node and so we create our parent
object we use the child object we just
created and then we can just specify
parent node and that will give us this
div right here now you will remember in
the last video we had to specify which
child node we wanted to target that's
not the case here because there is only
one parent so it will only target this
parent node we don't have to specify a
position and so that's kind of nice and
then we'll do what we did in the last
video we're just going to change the
text color to blue and we know all about
what this line does now so let's go
ahead and save everything up and let's
make sure this works and you will
remember since we are setting the color
of the text to blue all these child
elements should inherit that from the
div and so the color will change for all
the text in this section and it did
that's what we expected now you can also
specify parent element but again there
is no difference because it'll just pull
the element here it's one in the same
same node same element we don't have to
specify any type of position or anything
so it should work exactly the same so
we'll just save this here and
go ahead and run this and we should get
the same results and we did okay we will
do one more video on traversing the dumb
and actually we're going to go from
sibling to sibling to sibling you can go
sideways like I've mentioned so we'll
talk about that in the next video see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
