but we're going to talk about where to
place the script tag it of course has a
reference to our JavaScript file now
throughout the series of course we've
been placing it in the head section and
it didn't really matter because we're
just learning JavaScript but for
production it does matter where you
actually place this tag and the reason
we didn't talk about it earlier is
because we didn't really know what the
document object model was but now that
we do know what the document object
model is we need to talk about where we
really should put this script tag now
give you a little bit of history the
recommendation used to be to actually
put it in the head section so you can't
actually put it there but it's not
recommended and here's the reason think
about this for a second the browser
actually has to download these files
when it's going to render the web page
and remember the browser will work in a
top-down order so he'll hit this head
section and then he actually has to stop
and download this javascript file now it
looks pretty seamless to us but there
actually is a little bit of overhead
added when we have this script tag right
here and then it'll have to download the
stylesheet and then it'll go ahead and
render our entire web page and most of
that is in the body section now think
about this for a second why would we put
the script tag up here when this whole
document has to be loaded remember
JavaScript operates against the document
object model so it hasn't even been
loaded yet so why would we load the
JavaScript file here when it comes after
the fact so it makes sense to put this
down in the body tag because we want the
entire page rendered first before any
JavaScript code gets executed now
obviously we want the stylesheet loaded
and the HTML loaded first so the
stylesheet will stay here so let's go
ahead and move this script tag and
you'll see that it doesn't change
anything so let's go ahead and just copy
and paste this so we'll get rid of this
and we'll go right down here and this is
the recommendation you put it right
before the closing body tag so we'll put
it right there and it's not going to
affect anything so keep in mind that our
entire web page will be loaded first and
then it will go ahead and download the
JavaScript file by this point we don't
really care right because our page now
has been loaded and so we don't care
about the little overhead added to
download this file and this will also
sure that the document has been created
before any of our scripts our JavaScript
gets executed so that's really where you
want to put it so let's go ahead and
we'll save this and we'll go ahead and
execute this now just to make sure that
everything's working and of course this
is the same code from the last video so
let's go ahead and put in two or three
characters here now we should be stopped
right and we are and so we know our
JavaScript is working okay that's going
to do it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
