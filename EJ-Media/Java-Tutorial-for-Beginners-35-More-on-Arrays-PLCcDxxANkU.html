we were first introduced to arrays in
episode 12 but that was before we were
talking about objects so I'd like to add
a few more details about arrays in this
video now we're not going to actually do
any code here because in a few episodes
we're going to actually do a sample app
and we'll be using arrays in that
example now a Rays are a great way to
organize an efficient list of things
they also give you fast access by
letting you use an index position to get
to any element inside the array now you
remember here is the index which goes 0
1 2 3 4 and each one of these are the
elements now always keep in mind that
every single element inside an array is
just a variable but what those variables
are can be very different now in this
example this is an array that holds
primitive variables and you will
remember that primitive variables hold
absolute values so here we're giving
absolute values like 41 111 114 now in
this array over here this is an array
that holds objects and you can see the
difference here in the elements here
we're actually declaring a new orc so
this array holds objects and this array
over here holds primitive variables but
they both kind of do the same thing
right they both hold something and
that's the key here I almost want you to
think of arrays as a line of boxes on
your shelf each one of those boxes hold
something so for instance box 1 would
hold this primitive value of 41 and this
one would hold 111 and so on and the
same over here this box would hold this
orc and box 2 would hold this orc so you
can see how that works now the key point
here to both of these arrays is every
array is an object no matter what it
holds
so even if it's an array of primitives
this array as a whole is treated as an
object this int array here that we
defined and the same thing over here
this object array that we called
monsters is also an object it's just
what's contained inside
the arrays that is different so keep
that in mind that's a huge point that
you want to remember arrays are always
at the highest level objects no matter
what you have inside them
now this array over here is never
considered a primitive array again it's
an object that holds primitive variables
but we would never call the array itself
at the high level a primitive array
doesn't work that way so that's really
the key point that you need to
understand and the key point of this
video because again we hadn't dealt with
objects when we first discussed arrays
in the earlier episode so let's take a
look here really quick again what we do
to make an array first we declare the
array variable which we did in both of
these then we create the new array and
assign it the previously declared
variable that we just did before and
then we can go ahead and either create
objects or variables that hold primitive
values and then of course later on we
can call them when we need them
so that's pretty much it I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
