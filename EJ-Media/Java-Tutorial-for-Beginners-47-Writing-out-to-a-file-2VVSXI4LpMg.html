Java today we're going to take a look at
several concepts and the main concept is
we're going to learn how to write a file
out to your hard drive you want to
import all four of these Java classes
and interfaces and we're going to go
over each one of these in this video the
main thing we're going to be doing is
implementing serializable which is right
here now this is an interface but it's a
strange interface and basically it has
no methods and I mean that not even
blank methods which is what a normal
interface usually has now this is called
a marker interface and all this does you
can think of this very simply all this
does is basically tell Java hey I want
this class to be serializable I want to
be able to write an object out to my
hard drive and that's what we're doing
we're going to write an instance of this
class out to the hard drive and what is
an instance well it's an object and
where does an object reside while it
resides out on the heap and what are we
saving well we're saving the object but
specifically we're saving the value of
instance variable and in this case it's
going to be a name and we define the
name down here as Walt and so we'll be
saving that object out to the hard drive
now you won't be able to read that file
because it's in binary now you can also
write text files and we'll get to that
in a future video so you either write
binary or text files but in this video
we're going to be writing a binary file
and so I just create a class here that
will allow us to assign a name which
we're doing right here we're calling it
and that name is going to be Walt and so
this will this will actually be the
value that will be assigned to this
variable and that's really what we want
to save when we save our object now
let's take a look at our main here I'm
going to be introducing for the first
time some exception handling and this is
called a try/catch now the Tri basically
does all this work if it fails then it
hits this catch and it'll kick out an
exception and what we're basically doing
here is just kicking out a system dot
out dot print to say hey an error
occurred so if this doesn't
at work you will get a system that out
that message it says it didn't work
basically so that's really what a
try-catch is and it's very useful if
you're doing something risky and writing
files is always a little bit risky you
know you might have a permissions issue
or something might not work so it's
always good to use a try-catch when
you're trying to write out a file now
these are the two classes that we use
that we specified up here file output
stream and object output stream and they
go hand-in-hand together the file output
stream class which we're making an
object out of called file out basically
creates the file out on your hard drive
and what I did here was I just called it
test that SCR and we're just going to
put this in the C root directory now
this class could not handle objects
that's why we need this object output
stream class that we're creating here he
actually prepares the object to be
written and so these two kind of work
together he prepares the object and he
creates the file and that's why we
specify the object right here this
object output stream needs to know about
the file out now down here is where we
do the actual write and we're calling
the right object method and this is the
object of course we're writing which is
what we did right here where we assign
the name wall and so he writes it out
now you will always put this flush right
after the right object and that
basically says hey do this now I want
you to write this file out right now no
waiting around just write the content
out right now and then we do a file
close and that basically closes the
stream so it's kind of a five-step
process 1 2 3 4 5 and those are the five
steps you will always do and again if
this fails it'll hit this catch no work
will be done and we'll kick out a system
dot out dot print so let's go ahead and
run this and see if this works
and it said it did now if this worked
we should have a file out on our C Drive
so let's go take a look
and there you can see we've got our
binary file now like I said you really
won't be able to look at this because
this is in binary in a future video I
will show you how to write out a txt
file
okay that is going to do it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
