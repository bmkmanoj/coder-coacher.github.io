picker widget now one thing that's
really nice about the jQuery UI is you
not only get all these wonderful widgets
but they also provide all these very
useful options that you can use with
whatever widget you decide to go with
and one of the great things about this
is they're very easy to use once you
understand the basic format they're very
easy to plug in and they designed it
very similar to the way we use
properties in CSS and if you took my
series in CSS you will remember that we
use squiggly brackets and then we put
all the different types of properties
that we want inside those squiggly
brackets and then of course we add the
value and it's exactly similar in jQuery
we just use squiggly brackets then we
specify the property that we want so
very very similar again so of course
within these parentheses we need a
squiggly bracket and there we go now you
can just specify the properties that you
want to use now the first one I'm going
to talk about is called number of months
so we're just gonna go ahead and write
this in now these are case-sensitive so
if you're not sure just select it from
the intellisense that you get from
notepad plus plus and there you can see
we've got a capital m and a capital o so
make sure if you type these in manually
you want to get the case right and then
similar to CSS we use a colon and then
we specify the value in this case we're
just gonna pick 3 now what does this
property do well say you want to expand
this out to 3 months you want to show
all 3 of those months at the same time
that's actually what this property does
so it's very useful so let's go ahead
and save this let's refresh our page and
actually we need to expand this out to
see this and there you can see we've got
3 months now back to back to back pretty
nice let's go ahead and minimize this
again now you can also add some nice
dropdowns to the calendar and one of
those is the change month property so
all we do is put in change month and
again it's case sensitive and we don't
use a numeric value this is just a
simple true or false well chances are
you're gonna use true because you want
to see this in the calendar so let's go
ahead and save this will refresh our
page and take a look at that we have a
drop-down now that will allow the user
to select any month that they want
that's pretty cool now you can also do
this by a year if you want so that's
pretty cool
so we can actually go ahead and just
specify you're here if you want them to
be able to select by year and we'll go
ahead and refresh and now look now we've
got this by year so that's really cool
as well now you might be wondering can I
add as many different properties as I
want you can and all you do is put a
comma right here and then you can add in
the next property so there's another
property called show week and that
allows us to show all the different
weeks of the particular year that you're
in and this is just a simple true or
false as well so let's go ahead and
refresh and there you can see we've got
all these weeks numbered now take a look
at that and if we go forward in our
calendar to April you can see they're
numbered appropriately 12 13 14 15 16
all right and let's go ahead and just
set this back to one property now
certain properties only go together with
other properties for instance we can
change the text for the column that we
just added in the show week property for
the week column those numbers that we
just saw so if we go ahead and add week
header and then you can put in whatever
text you want for the week you could
just write in week if you wanted pretty
simple so let's go ahead and refresh our
page whoops I forgot the colon I don't
get you every time let's go ahead and
save this and we'll refresh our page and
there you can see now we've got this
spelled out as week if you wanted to do
that now you know how sometimes you're
in a calendar and you see the other days
of the previous month and the next month
you can do that as well and we can do
that with the show other months property
so let's go ahead and do that and there
you can see the intellisense for notepad
plus plus brings that right up this is
what's very nice about notepad plus plus
it recognizes which property you're
trying to select and this again is just
a simple true or false see how easy
these are to use very very easy and so
you'll see what we get here and there
you can see we've got the days from the
previous month and the days from the
next month so that's very very useful as
well okay we will continue on with date
picker properties in the next video see
you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
