autocomplete widget that you can use in
jQuery in this video we're going to
review some more options that you can
use with the autocomplete widget now of
course we already talked about the
source property and so in this video
we'll review a few more properties that
you can use now one property I like is
called auto focus now let's go back to
our text box and let's type in D and you
can see there nothing is auto focus now
if you want the first item in the list
to auto focus you can use the auto focus
property so let's go ahead and add that
now you'll remember if we want to add
multiple properties we simply need to
use a comma to separate the properties
so that's what we'll do here we'll just
put in a comma and then of course we
need squiggly brackets for our new
property and what we're gonna do is go
ahead and type in auto focus and then
we're just gonna go ahead and set that
to true so let's go ahead and save this
and let's refresh our page and let's see
what we get so we'll go type in D again
and there you can see look Dallas is now
highlighted so that's how the auto focus
property works now you can also set a
delay in terms of how fast this list
appears now you may want to set that if
you don't want the results to display
right away some users don't like that
they want some time to type in whatever
it is they want to type in and then the
list will show appropriately so let's go
ahead and put in a delay now so we just
use the delay property and let's put in
a really long delay so that it's
apparent so we'll go ahead and set that
to 3,000 milliseconds so let's go ahead
and save this let's refresh our page and
let's type in D and it should take about
three seconds yep see how long that took
it took about three seconds so that's
how the delay property works with the
autocomplete widget now we can also use
the minimum length property and what
that does is it basically specifies the
minimum number of characters that you
want the user to type in before the list
starts to appear and the default of
course is one but let's go ahead and
we'll set that to two and you'll see
what happens
and again we'll set it to two so let's
go ahead and we'll refresh our page and
now let's see what happens when we type
one character first nothing happened
right now let's type in de and there we
get Detroit so that's how the minimum
length property works okay that's going
to do it for this video I will see you
guys in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
