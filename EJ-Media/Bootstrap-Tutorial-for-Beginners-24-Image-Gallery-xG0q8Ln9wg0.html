off in the last video and of course we
created this nice thumbnail code but I
forgot to add an anchor tag so let's go
ahead and do that and you kind of need
that for a thumbnail so let's go ahead
and add that we're gonna add that right
here so of course we're just gonna
specify an anchor tag here and of course
we're gonna use an href and then we're
just gonna point to our file which of
course is our CH jpg and since it's in
the same folder we don't need to specify
a directory here okay that's good so now
we should get our link so let's go ahead
and save this and let's load this up in
Chrome and we'll see what we get and
there we go take a look at that now
we've got our hand and if we click on
this it creates a larger image which is
what a thumbnail is all about so let's
go ahead and close this now that we have
our code set we can go ahead and create
our image gallery and you will remember
when we talked about the bootstrap grid
you of course first have your container
then your row and then your columns but
of course since we already have our row
and container specified all we need is
this column right here all the code
right here so we're gonna go ahead and
copy and paste this code right here only
to create our second column with our
image and this is why once you get your
code set like I said it's really easy to
create an image gallery in bootstrap
so let's go ahead and copy this and
we're gonna come right down here at this
div and hit space a few times and we're
gonna go up one here and then go ahead
and copy and paste our new column in and
of course these two divs right here
close out our container and roll but we
do not want to copy those over and over
again again we just want our column code
with our thumbnail that's all we need so
let's go ahead and save this and let's
see what we get take a look at that that
looks great but these are a little bit
too large when you say usually when you
have an image gallery with thumbnails
they're much smaller so let's go ahead
and lower the size of these a little bit
so let's make this a two and let's make
this a three and then let's go ahead and
make this a two and let's make this a
three good let's go ahead and save this
and we'll reload this and there you can
see that looks a lot better these look
actually like thumbnails and let's make
sure the second one works
does good okay so let's go ahead and add
a bunch of more columns and like I said
it gets very easy in bootstrap once you
have your code in place so let's go
ahead and just copy and paste this over
several times all right and let's go
ahead and reload this and see what we
get and take a look at that we've got a
fully functioning image gallery and
bootstrap is doing almost all the work
for us
okay we will continue on with the image
gallery in the next video
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
