with html5 structure tags specifically
in this video we're gonna look at
figcaption and figure and the details
and summary element tags now first I
want you to copy an image to your
website folder I've used this a little
Julius Caesar image that I've used many
times in many of my lectures but go
ahead and copy the image that you want
to use and then with inside the article
element I want you to go ahead and
create an IMG element and point to your
image and actually let's go ahead and
get rid of this h2 element we don't need
this anymore
we're just going to do a few
housecleaning things here and let's go
over to our style sheet and we're going
to increase the size of our article
element to 500 pixels we need a little
bit more space for what we're gonna do
in this lecture so let's go ahead and
save this return to our HTML document
and let's just go ahead and load this up
real quick good there we go so there's
our image now I want you to notice and
just remember this that there's no
margin around this currently and that's
the way we want to keep it for now okay
so let's go ahead and close this out so
first what we're gonna do is look at the
fig caption and figure and they kind of
go together hand-in-hand you're gonna
use them together and these are two very
very useful tags it actually works very
well with images and if you guys
remember it was very hard to add
captions to your images in previous
versions of HTML and CSS now it's much
easier to do in html5 and I'm going to
show you just how easy that is in this
video so first let's go ahead and add
the figure element and we're gonna add
this right around our image so let's go
ahead and close it now
and then let's see what we get here so
let's go ahead and save this and let's
load our web page and see what that did
it added some margin so automatically
when you add the figure element it's
going to go ahead and add some margin
around your image because usually images
have margin around them so you can see
how that works okay so let's close this
out and now what we want to do is go
ahead and add the fig caption and again
this should put a caption right under
our image and it's so easy to use in
html5 and again this
is one of my favorite tags in html5 and
we can put this right below our image it
still has to stay within the figure
element so the figcaption element goes
inside the figure element it's nested
inside of it
so let's go ahead and do that and then
let's go ahead and just close it out
really quickly and then you can put any
caption you want in here some people put
figure one or something or figure two
we're just gonna say this is a bust of
Julius Caesar which of course it is okay
let's go ahead and save this and let's
see if it worked and take a look at that
we now have our caption and see how easy
that is to use very very easy okay now
let's go ahead and take a look at the
details and summary elements and these
also go together and in him now what
these basically do is allow you to show
and hide content it's similar if you
took my jquery series it's very similar
to the show and hide in jquery except
you can do it all in html5 now so these
are two very very useful element tags as
well so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go right below our figure element
but we're staying with inside of our
article of course and let's go ahead and
i'm just gonna copy and paste all this
because I already typed this out and
there you can see let me actually
arrange this a little bit better here
okay so here is the details element tag
and this is the first tag we want to use
and then we put in our summary and this
is actually what will be displayed first
on the page this is all you'll see and
what this will do is it'll give a little
arrow that the user can select to open
up the content and once they do they'll
get this paragraph and they'll get this
Caesar image and that's all you have to
do now to do a show and hide that's it
you don't have to do any jQuery you
don't have to use any JavaScript they
make it very easy to use in html5 so
once again you always use the details
element first and then inside there
you'll put a summary and usually this is
actually what the content is but you can
also tell them that they basically can
show and hide the content as well you
can put a little blurb about that if you
want and then you can put whatever
content you want in this case I just put
a little paragraph element and I just
use the Caesar image again so let's go
ahead and save this let's open this up
in Chrome and let's see what we get so
there it is there's our summary see that
and now all we have to do is click on
this little arrow and look there's our
content and we can toggle this on and
off how nice is that so easy to use in
html5 okay that's going to do it for the
structure tags in html5 we will move on
to a new subject in the next video thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
