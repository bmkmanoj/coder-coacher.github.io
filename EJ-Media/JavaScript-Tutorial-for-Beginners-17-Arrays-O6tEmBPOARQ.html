at arrays now in previous videos we've
been creating variables that hold just a
single value and if we wanted a bunch of
values for dirt roads here we would have
to create a variable for each different
flavor so in other words we could only
hold a single value arrays are just
simply variable that allows us to hold
multiple values and so instead of having
to create a different variable for each
one of these values we can put them all
into a container and store them into an
array it just can hold multiple values
so you'll often hear this called an
array variable and that's what this is
right here roads is our array variable
now you define an array using square
brackets and you can see those right
here and again these contain all these
different values and they get assigned
to our array variable now in order to
reference a value in here arrays use a
system called an index and each one of
these values has its own index and it
always starts at 0 so stone would have
an index number of 0 dirt would have an
index number of 1 cement would have an
index number of 2 and so on and so you
get the idea so once again if we had
hundreds of values that we need to
distort it's a lot easier to put those
in an array variable than it is to
create different variable for each one
of these values now how do we access
these values and we do that through the
index so if I wanted to access dirt for
instance I would use the array name and
then the index number which in this case
of course is 1 that is how we can access
values inside of our array and so how do
we use these values well one common way
is to assign these values to another
variable and so let's do that let's
create another variable let's say when
you did a variable to create a dirt road
in a game we had so we'll create another
variable called road traveled and we'll
say equals 2 and here is where we
specify the array and then what we do is
we need to use the square brackets again
and then we just specify the index
number in here which happens to be 1 for
dirt
so we put that right here now I should
point out also that these are also
referred to as elements so this would be
element zero this would be element one I
like to call them values but again these
are also called elements multiple
elements make up an array okay so now
that we've assigned the value of dirt to
our new variable let's go ahead and
write this out and so we'll just do a
document dot right let's go ahead and
save this and we'll go ahead and run it
in Chrome as we always do and there you
see we get dirt now you might ask the
question how do I update an array that
is let's say we wanted to change the
value of one of these and there is a way
to do that so let's say we wanted to
change dirt to cobblestone well we could
do that by specifying the array name and
then the index number and then the new
value that you want so I'll show you how
we do that so I'll just copy and paste
right here because I already had it
written out so here we go we specify the
array name we're specifying one for this
element right here which is dirt and
then we're saying hey assign it a new
value of cobblestone now if we rerun
this we won't get dirt anymore because
we reassign the value here in the array
to cobblestone and then this now should
be written out as cobblestone so let's
go ahead and save this and let's go
ahead and run it and there you see we
get the new update cobblestone which is
what we wanted now I should point out
that this is not the only way that you
have to write out an array and so let me
copy and paste this in here and I'm just
going to keep this commented out because
we're not actually going to run this but
here is a different way to create an
array now it's doing the same thing as
this array up here the only difference
is this is considered longhand the
longhand way of creating an array this
is considered the shorthand and if you
take a look at this here we are creating
an empty array in the beginning whereas
in the shorthand way to do this we're
putting all the values inside the array
when we create the array here we are
just creating an empty array and then
we're going to go ahead and assign the
values at a later time and you will
notice though here that you actually
have to specify the index number for
each one of these so that's that's
different than the shorthand version now
some people like this version better
because they like to see the index
numbers other developers like the
shorthand way okay that is going to do
it for this video I will see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
