the last several videos and we're going
to talk about what we're going to do in
this video and we're going to talk about
what we're going to do in the next video
now remember JavaScript at its basic
level is a two-step process first we
want to select the element we want to
target and we accomplish that through
methods we've talked about getting an
element using the get element by ID
method and of course we select elements
by their ID and in the last couple
videos we talked about get elements by
tag name and that's where we were
allowed to select multiple elements by
their tag in this video we're actually
going to talk about get elements by
class name yes there's yet another
method that we can use to grab hold of
an element and remember these three
methods are pretty much doing the same
thing it's just how are we grabbing the
element and with get elements by class
name we are grabbing it by the class
name that's how we're grabbing it now
once we've accomplished that first step
we can move on to the second step and
that is to change whatever it is we want
to change in that element we've actually
been changing CSS Styles right we added
a background color we've changed the
color of the text that's what we've been
doing the last several videos but there
are many other things you can do with
JavaScript in the next video we're
actually going to talk about changing
the text itself and what do I mean by
that we're actually going to replace the
text so that'll be something new we're
introducing to the series you can also
change images you can do validation you
can create entire new pages and you can
change the internal so we'll talk about
all these subjects in later videos but
in this video we're going to talk about
the get elements by class name method
okay so we're going to pretty much use
the same code we've been using
throughout the last several videos we
have a button and when we hit that
button we're going to change the text
and we're going to apply a new CSS style
to it the only difference is we're using
classes now take a look at that so let's
flip over to our JavaScript code and
I'll copy and paste the first step we
need to do remember first step we need
to get that element and what are we
using this time we're going to go by
class name so we're specifying the class
right here para and you can see that
right here and similar to the get
elements by tag method the get elements
by class name also creates a node list
so keep in mind when you have a
method in JavaScript it's grabbing
multiple elements almost always that
node list is going to be created and so
this first paragraph will be node list 0
the second one will be one and on and on
and on it could go one two three four
five six seven if we had a ton of
paragraphs in here we could have a very
very huge node list but in this case
it's just going to be two zero for the
first one and remember we always start
at zero and one for the second one and
so that node list is key because then we
can specify the paragraph that we want
to target once we get a hold of all of
our classes and so that's what this is
doing right here and so this method is
very similar to the get elements by tag
name method the only difference is we're
going against class okay so now let's do
the second step we want to actually
apply some CSS style to our text so I'll
copy and paste the code in here and
again this will look similar to what
we've been doing here is the node list
again we need to specify that we're
creating a new variable called change
text appropriately and again each one of
these lines of code is going against the
paragraph that we want to target so
again node list 0 and node list 1 and of
course we do that using our paragraph
variable up here which is now holding
all of our classes so we need to specify
our paragraph variable which holds all
of our class names and then we need to
again specify the actual node that we're
targeting and then we're just going to
use the style object and we're going to
use the property color to change the
color of the text so let's go ahead and
run this and if we hit the submit button
our text is changed to red okay that's
going to do it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial we're going to
start to change things up and we're
actually going to start working against
this second bullet item right here we're
going to create some brand new text and
replace some text and do some various
different things that you can do with
JavaScript to completely alter the text
on your web page see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
