Photoshop and like many of my videos
this is going to be part of a very very
large series that I hope is very very
informative and that you find very very
helpful now I want to point out
initially this is a tutorial for
beginners this is not for intermediate
or advanced users that being said we
will first start out with images which
the vast majority of people use
Photoshop for now I'm going to be using
this image right here I got this off of
Wikimedia Commons now if you want to use
the same image I'm using I will put a
link in the description of this video
and you can go get that image now I also
want to point out that this image is in
the public domain you see that right
here now if you go out to Wikimedia
Commons you can find all kinds of images
like this that are in the public domain
and if it's in the public domain that
means you can use it for any purposes
you do not have to put any attribution
and that even means you can use it for
commercial purposes so for any purpose
you want it is absolutely free in every
way so that's the nice thing about using
images in the public domain okay so the
very first thing we want to do is click
on window right up here then what I want
you to do is go to workspace and I want
to make sure that you have this
essentials selected right here that
means we'll be using the same exact
workspace the same exact layout so if
you don't have that selected go ahead
and select that now now we're going to
go ahead and open up our image so you're
going to go to file you're going to hit
open and in this case my image is just
sitting right on the desktop so I'm
going to go ahead and open that and
there you can see we've got this nice
image of a barn nice country image now
the basic layout for all Photoshop
versions is essentially the same you
have all your tools here on the left and
there are all kinds of things you can do
with these there's shrinking tools there
selection tools there's a racing tool so
we're basically going to go through all
of these eventually throughout the
entire series will actually hit every
single one of these tools because they
are very very important now if you click
on each one of these you'll notice that
the grid up here changes each time so
you get a different set of options so
we'll be going through these options as
well so that's the second thing I wanted
to point out and also if you right click
on the image itself you'll get a series
of different options for each one of
these tools so let's right click here
you can see here it says we can do
okay layer convert to smart object but
if we go down here to the zoom tool and
we right click on this you can see now
we've got a different set of options now
some of these options will be the same
for these tools others will have
different options so just be aware of
that and since we're on the zoom tool
you can zoom in and out so you'll notice
here that since this is darker down here
this means we have it selected so if you
hit zoom in you see it zoomed in if
you're right click and you zoomed out it
zoomed out and you can keep zooming out
and zooming in as you want now if you'll
notice on the right here when you first
import your image you're going to see
that it's automatically by default
locked and that's the way it is for just
about everything that you import into
Photoshop one of the reasons is just a
safety mechanism so you don't alter your
original layer and these are called
layers actually now I want you to
right-click on here and then you're
going to hit duplicate layer and then
you're just going to go to hit OK you
can name it whatever you want and there
you can see we now have a second
identical layer that mimics this first
one but you'll notice that that's not
locked anymore so you can do a whole
bunch more to this layer then you can
this first layer now if we go on to the
move tool
and by the way you see that little tool
tip you get there and did you see that V
that stands for the keyboard shortcut
for this tool and in this case it's V so
go ahead and hit V on your keyboard and
there you can see it automatically is
now selected so I'll also mention some
of the keyboard shortcuts that you can
use for these tools and it's easier for
you to bounce around so now let's go
ahead and let's pick up and move this
layer and you see now how we have that
layer and back of it the background
layer and here's our background copy
layer so that's what layers are think of
them almost like sheets of paper that
are stacked on top of each other that's
exactly the way Photoshop describes
layers so again that's sort of a key
concept to understand now we're going to
talk about layers in future videos we're
not going to get into them extensively
in this video now if you right-click
notice how it allows us to switch
between the layers really quickly that's
nice so you don't have to come over here
and keep bouncing around the layers you
can go ahead and we can switch to the
background layer right now well if you
want to switch back to the background
copy we can do that as well now you can
always undo everything in Photoshop and
that's really nice so if you go up to
edit you can hit undo move and there
look it's right back where it was now if
you need to go back even farther let's
say you need to undo five things that
you did
you can keep hitting step backward and
step backward and step backward as many
times as you want and it will take you
back almost to where you started from so
that's really useful if you need to undo
certain changes that you made that you
don't want anymore now you can always
delete layers as well so let's go ahead
and let's delete this original layer you
just right click on it hit delete and
now it's gone and now we just have our
copy so keep in mind you can always
delete layers add layers and again we're
going to get into this quite extensively
in future videos because layers are very
very important to editing your
photographs
now the other tool that we're going to
take a look at in this video is the
cropping tool and that's sort of a very
important to a lot of people we'll be
using in Photoshop you can see the
shortcut for that is C so I want you to
go ahead and select that now you'll
notice right away you get the whole
image selected and what you can do is
you can resize the image from the
corners or you can resize it from the
edges or you can actually simply pick
the image up and start moving around but
let's go ahead and resize it from this
corner
you can see how we're cropping it now
now take a look up here see how it says
unconstrained that means it's not
keeping the original aspect ratio of our
photograph and you see how I kind of
change the aspect ratio take a look at
that now the second thing I want you to
notice is see how we have a confirmation
up here a confirmation and a cancel
button that means nothing's been done
yet the crop has not been executed so
basically we have three options here one
is to confirm the crop another is to
cancel the current crop operation and
another is to reset the crop box so
let's go ahead and we'll say commit
current crop operation if you hit that
there you can see now we have our image
crop now let's go ahead and undo that
let's undo the crop we're back to where
we were now watch what happens if you go
down here and you select original ratio
and now go ahead and start dragging from
that corner notice how you can't change
the aspect ratio anymore it keeps the
original ratio so that's one way you can
keep the original ratio of the image if
you don't want to alter the ratio now
you can also just hit the shift button
when you're doing this and it will also
keep the original ratio as well now
you'll notice when you release the mouse
button here you get this shaded part and
what that's telling you is this is the
part that's going to be cropped off
everything that's highlighted will be
kept so that's a nice way to see what
exactly is going to be removed from this
image once you do the crop let's go
ahead and select this again there you
can see now we have our crop in it let's
go ahead and undo that again now one
very important tool that I want to show
you in this video is the straighten
option and this is very useful now take
a look at this road right here let's say
we wanted to straighten this road you
don't like the way this road is going
you want to actually straighten this you
can hit the straighten button and you'll
see how you get that little different
icon now where the cursor is you can go
down here and what you want to do is
draw a line on what you want
straightened out now that's the key to
understanding this you're not going to
draw a straight line you're just drawing
a line over what you want
straighten so let's draw a line over
this road and then we're going to get
our confirmation now you can see how
here and our highlighted image now this
is showing us what it's going to look
like after the crop is done and our road
is straight so let's go ahead and hit
the confirmation button and take a look
at that that road now is straightened
out and you can straighten anything you
want if you want
go ahead and straighten this barn out we
could draw a line right there and then
the barn would be straight so there's
all sorts of different things you can do
with the cropping tool and we will talk
about this in future videos as well okay
I think that's a good start for the
introductory video I will see you guys
in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
