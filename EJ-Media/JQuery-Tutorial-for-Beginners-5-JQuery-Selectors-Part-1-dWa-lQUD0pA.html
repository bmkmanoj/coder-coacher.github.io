this point but jQuery also provides its
own unique selectors that add some more
functionality and so that's what we're
going to review over the next several
videos the main jQuery selectors that
most people use so if we go up here in
our HTML page let's say we want to
target this first section which we've
given an ID selector of left so let's
say we want to select that to hide so
let's go back down to our jQuery code
and let's go ahead and get rid of this
pound right now a jQuery selector
usually starts out with a colon that's
what it usually starts out with and then
we just put in the keyword of first and
that will target the first element of a
particular type in this case is going to
be the div element type so we just put
in div here now notice this is still a
CSS selector right here this is a type
selector of course right here though is
where the jQuery part of it starts the
jQuery selector so again we use a colon
and then we use the keyword first and
then of course we'll select the very
first div element and then it will of
course use the hide method to hide that
section of course the first div section
is right here this with the ID of left
this should be hidden if this works
correctly so let's go ahead and launch
our page here and so again we're
targeting this first div section right
here so hopefully that is hidden and it
was so good now what if we want to hide
the last div section well we just use
the keyword of last pretty simple so
another jquery selector that we can use
so let's go ahead and relaunch our
webpage now watch what happens here I
want you to pay close attention to this
notice the button itself was hidden did
you see that that's because this is a
div element and yes it is the last div
element on our webpage so that's why
that was hidden so what if we want to
save our button and not hide this well
there's another jQuery selector that we
can use to accomplish that and that is
done with the not keyword so again it's
the not keyword we use so if we come
down here we just specify not and
we have to put in parentheses everything
that we do not want to be included in
our selection and in this case we don't
want this div element with our button
select it so we can just put in pound
test here right and use the CSS selector
so that this button will not be hidden
now if you take a look at this code
right here this should be the only
section now that isn't hidden because we
didn't put any other sections in here so
all the sections on our webpage except
for our button should be hidden right
okay so let's go ahead and reload our
page and if we get our button all the
sections now are hidden except for our
button which is what we want it now
let's say we wanted to save a section in
here let's save our center section so
let's go ahead and just put in a comma
and we just put in of course pound
Center for our center section and let's
go ahead and reload our page if we hit
our button now the center section is not
hidden as well as our button so that's
how the not jQuery selector works it's
very useful now let's refresh our page
now what if we wanted to just get rid of
this first paragraph right here well we
could go back and use the first jQuery
selector so let's type in first and then
of course if we go up to our code here
we're just going to use the P type
selector right so we'll put that in
right here but then keep in mind this
code right here would hide all the
paragraphs and we don't want to do that
we just want to hide this first
paragraph in this first section so we
can use a descendant selector let's do
that so we'll just specify pound left
down here and we'll just put it right
here and so now we've got our descendant
CSS selector which will specify a
paragraph in our left section which of
course is our first section and then
this jQuery selector right here will say
hey select the first paragraph to hide
and so let's go ahead and save this will
relaunch our web page and we'll see if
this works and we hit our button and it
did it got rid of the very first
paragraph so that's an initial look at
these jQuery selectors will continue on
with jQuery selectors in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
