tutorial on beginning Java today we're
going to look at the lifecycle of the
object and more specifically how the
object gets created from start to finish
so let's do this now so I've created
three classes here a child class that
extends middle class and just to point
out here some people get confused by
this but the superclass of this child
class is actually middle class and
that's what's exactly going on here it's
not actually the superclass or the base
classes some people like to call it and
then of course middle class's superclass
is super class Java and then everything
ends up here and then this is the
absolute base class so let's go ahead
and walk through this entire process
because this is really critical if
you're going to become a professional
object orientated programmer so we come
down here and the new keyword invokes
our constructor and then the child class
constructor kicks off and what's going
to happen here is he's going to get
executed and then he's going to see this
extends keyword and he's going to go
over to middle class and pass control
over to the middle class and we're going
to go over here and remember this is an
implicit call to the superclass that's
right in here actually so just keep that
in mind it's an implicit call because if
you remember in previous tutorials I
said that unless you type it out here
it's an implicit call so he's going to
go over here and then the middle class
constructor is going to get executed
he's going to do roughly the same thing
that the child class constructor did
he's going to go up here see this
extends keyword and then do his implicit
call to his super which of course is
superclass Java and then this
constructor is going to get executed to
go ahead and start everything off and
he's going to build the super classes
portion of the object and then all of
his variables and all of his methods are
going to be placed into there and then
when he's done it's going to go back to
middle class and then his constructor is
going to get executed and then he's
going to go ahead and include all his
variables and all of his methods into
the overall object and then finally we
end right back where we started at the
child class constructor and then he's
going to go ahead and do his work and
build all of his objects and methods
into the final object and here we of
course that x equals 50
so 50 is going to be assigned to the
variable X and as a result of him being
assigned to X he's also going to be
initialized and then all of the work is
done we have our final object over here
he's now in memory and then we can go
down to the main now and we can start
using them and this is kind of the way I
like to think of it our object can start
doing his work now he can start going to
work so you know now we can go ahead and
do a call to our object and we'll do our
favorite system dot out dot print and
we're going to go ahead and print the
contents of this method from our newly
created object you get the idea he's
going to go ahead and do his work now
and do the very things we want him to do
down here in the main so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial I hope you
found it helpful and in the next one
we're going to look at the life cycle of
the all-important method and we'll start
right from here and work our way into
the object to see what it's doing from
start all the way back to the finish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
