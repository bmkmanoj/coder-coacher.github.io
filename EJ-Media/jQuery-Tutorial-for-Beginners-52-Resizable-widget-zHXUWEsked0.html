at the resizable widget in the jQuery UI
now previously in the last couple of
videos we used the draggable widget and
of course we created this div section
and we put all of our images inside that
div section and then we made them
draggable now when you're using the
resizable widget a lot of times most
times you're going to use that to resize
an image and when I use it I like to
work directly against the image tag the
IMG tag right here so we don't really
need this div section anymore so we're
going to go ahead and just get rid of
that and let's just go ahead and work
against one image in this video so we're
just going to go ahead and work against
our Caesar dot PNG now since we're not
working against multiple images we're
only working against this single image
let's just create an ID right here and
we'll call this appropriately enough
resize there we go so let's go down to
our jQuery code and we'll just specify
the ID selector right here that we
created and we don't need these
arguments anymore let's go ahead and get
rid of those and now we call the
resizable function which is just
resizable it's that simple okay so let's
go ahead and save this let's go ahead
and fire this up and see if it works now
you'll notice this little marker we get
here that allows us to resize the image
and now I can resize this in any way I
want take a look at that isn't that nice
and again you're usually going to use
this against images now you could use
this against a section but that gets a
lot more complicated and we'll do that
in a future video but most of the time I
actually use this against images so this
will allow your user to resize images
within your web page ok in the next
video we will examine all the options
that you can use with the resizable
widget see you guys on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
