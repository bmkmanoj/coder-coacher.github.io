beginning CSS today we're going to look
at the line height property and that
basically allows you to add space
between your lines and so it makes your
text more readable so let's go ahead and
open up our website and and let's open
up the stylesheet first and let's go
ahead down to this third class here for
our paragraph three we're going to go
ahead and get rid of italic and we're
going to reduce the pixel size to 15
because it's easier to see how the line
height property works with a smaller
pixel size so let's go ahead and save
this and then I want to show you the
HTML two I added some text before the
video into the third paragraph so you
can go ahead and add some text if you
want I just got this off actually
Wikipedia what officiais so I wanted a
lot of text so it's easier to see how
the line height property works okay so
let's go ahead and close that out and
let's go ahead and open up the web page
and we'll just take a look at this and
so you can see this is kind of tight
here you see how tight that is between
the lines so we want to add some space
in between all these lines so let's go
ahead and do that let's close this out
and what we're going to do is when I go
down here and we're going to type in
line - height as usual we need a
semicolon now you can specify this in
pixels
eeehm or percentage and that's what we
talked about in the last video of course
so you should know what those are
we're going to actually scale this so
we'll use the e/m and we're going to go
ahead and make that 1.5 and let's go
ahead and save this now now let's go
ahead and open up our web page and you
can see we've got more space now that's
a lot more readable than it was without
the line height property okay that's
basically it it's pretty easy to use you
guys can go ahead and play around with
the percentage if you want or specify it
in pixels and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
