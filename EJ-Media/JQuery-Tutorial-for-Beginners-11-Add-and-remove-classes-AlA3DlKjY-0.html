two jQuery methods the add class method
and they remove class method and the
first one we're going to talk about is
the add class method and this does
exactly what you think it does it simply
adds a class to your element that you
want to add a class to and in this case
what we're going to do is we're gonna
select the last paragraph on our web
page and of course the last paragraph is
right here in our last section
this area will contain the right content
area right here so that's what we're
gonna add a class to so be no different
than typing the class right in here and
the class that we're going to call it is
para right here so that's what you put
in the double quotes whatever class you
want to call it now I want you to notice
you do not have to put the dot here and
remember in CSS you always have to put
the dot to specify the class you do not
have to do that in jQuery though you
just simply supply the name so again
we're calling it para now it's useful to
have the CSS code in your stylesheet
already created so that's what I did
right here I created the class over here
para and you can see if it works we'll
add a background color of yellow and
we'll change the text color to blue and
I've also created another CSS class of
para to which we'll deal with in a few
moments we'll actually use the remove
class to remove this class so if you
haven't downloaded the style sheet in a
few videos you might want to go ahead
and do that remember those links again
are in the description of this video
okay so let's go ahead and run this and
if we hit the button and there you can
see the para class was added to this
paragraph and then of course the CSS is
triggered and we get our yellow
background and our blue text now what we
want to do is remove the class from this
first paragraph so we can just switch
our selector remember these selectors we
can do first and last let's just switch
this to first and once again it will
select the first paragraph actually you
know what though let's actually save
this as an example so you have it I
forgot sorry about that I usually do
that so let's just switch this back to
last right here so you have this as an
example now what we'll do is we'll just
put in the keyword
move and there it is removeclass again
if we go up here in this case we already
had the class here para tu and this will
simply remove it and it will remove all
the formatting that we associated in CSS
with this class so let's go ahead and
save this will refresh our page and if
we hit the button it didn't work because
guess what this class was para too
the code will always get you okay so
let's go ahead and correct that will
refresh our page and if we hit the
button there it worked this time because
we had the correct class specified and
all the formatting is gone now you might
ask how do I use both of these together
and jQuery provides another method to do
that and we will talk about that in the
next video see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
