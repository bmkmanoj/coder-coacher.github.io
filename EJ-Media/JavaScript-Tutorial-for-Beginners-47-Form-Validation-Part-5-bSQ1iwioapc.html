asking why I didn't use the and logical
operator and I thought it was a good
question so I thought I'd do a video
about why I didn't use the and logical
operator now remember I've used this
diagram in the last several videos for
the or logical operator well I've added
another column here for the and logical
operator so we can see the differences
between the and and or now right away
you'll notice that three of these
outcomes are false as opposed to the or
logical operator where three of the
outcomes are true and that's because the
and operator needs to have both of these
conditions to be true in order for the
expression to be true if just one is
false then the overall expression is
false and we can see that right here in
these last three outcomes so it's very
different than the or operator and
you'll also notice that the first
outcome is the same and the last outcome
is the same for both the and and the or
if both are true or both are false but
where things start to get murky are in
this middle this is why we can't use the
and operator you'll notice that if one
of these is true the outcome is false
and remember that's going to be a
problem because one of the text boxes
was filled out incorrectly but the
expression will be false and you will
remember that if it's false our code
doesn't get executed and the form will
be submitted and that's not what we want
we want that to be true to stop the user
from submitting the form and but let's
go ahead and we'll walk through this
second one just to make sure and that's
another point I want to make it's always
good to test all these outcomes out with
these type of diagrams so that you get
the desired outcome that you want and it
actually makes it easier to understand
how if statements work when you put all
the conditions in a diagram like this
it's much easier to understand if
statements okay so let's go ahead and
again and we'll just go ahead and copy
and paste this and operator right over
here and we'll save this and let's go
ahead and submit this thing and let's go
ahead and test out again this second
outcome and again we're going to be
testing the and logical operator so
we'll flip back here to the actual
JavaScript code so the first one will be
true so we didn't fill out correctly so
we'll just do
three characters the second one will be
false so we did this one correctly we
put in more than five characters and
let's go ahead and hit submit and you
can see it went right through because
again both of these have to be true in
order for this outcome to be true and so
since this was false
again our form was submitted so that's
why we used the or operator because we
need this to be true since one of these
was filled out incorrectly so that it
stops the user from submitting this form
so let's go ahead and flip it back and
we'll run that outcome again so we'll
save this up again let's go ahead and
run it and let's do this again now so
we'll go ahead and put in three
characters and we'll put in five or six
characters we hit submit and it stopped
us that's exactly what we wanted so I
hope that clarifies this subject for you
and you can walk through all of these
outcomes if you want with both the and
logical operator and the or logical
operator to see how everything works
okay that's going to do it for this
