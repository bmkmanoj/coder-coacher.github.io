some properties that you can use with
the get context method and basically we
used three methods in the last video the
move to the line two and the stroke
method and again in this video we're
going to go ahead and use some
properties and the first one we're going
to take a look at is called stroke style
you can see I've typed that in right
here and what this allows you to do is
add color to your line and in this case
I'm gonna use a hex code so let's go
ahead and run this and see what we get
and actually I want to warn you this
isn't gonna work because this is a
common mistake a lot of people make so
let's go ahead and load this up and we
should not get any color and we didn't
and I expected that and that is because
all the properties and methods that you
use to alter our line have to come
before the stroke method the stroke
method is kind of the last method that
you want to use he will actually paint
the line so once the lines been painted
all the work is done so that's why we
need to go ahead and move this above the
stroke method so let's go ahead and do
that and we're just gonna place that
line right here there we go so let's go
ahead and get rid of this line
let's save everything up and let's go
ahead and reload the page and there you
can see the line is now colored alright
so there's two more properties that I
want to show you in this video that are
used quite a bit the next one is the
line width property and this basically
will do exactly what the property says
you can increase the width of the line
so let's go ahead and do that and of
course we need to call our object and
then we specify a line width and we're
gonna go ahead and let's set that to 12
pixels so let's go ahead and save this
and let's reload our page and there you
can see the line is now thicker now you
can also round off the end of the line
if you want and to do that we use the
line cap property and there are a couple
different values you can use you can use
one called square but the one that is
most commonly used is round and that
will just round off our line so let's go
ahead and do that and let's see if this
works
and it did see the line is now rounded
off okay so those are the three main
properties that you're initially going
to use with a basic line in HTML canvas
okay I will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
