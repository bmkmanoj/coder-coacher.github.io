exception handling in Java now I will
tell you right away this is very similar
to the type of error handling that you
would do in c-sharp because both
languages use what is called the try
catch now we'll talk about the try catch
in a few minutes but first I'm just
going to talk briefly about why we use
exception handling and the reason is
very simple you may have a very large
program and certain blocks of code
within that program are risky that is
you're not sure if it may cause a bug
but it possibly could perhaps you have
multiple Java processes going or there
could be a bug with a particular OS and
you're not sure this code will work and
so that's where the try catch comes into
play but before we get to the try catch
we're actually going to create an error
with this code I've set up right here
now you can see I've set up a very
simple array and here we declare it and
here we're allocating three elements and
here are the three elements and then
we're just doing a system dot out dot
print and we're just going to print out
the second element so let's go ahead and
do that and just make sure that part
works and it did it printed out the
integer three which is what we wanted
now the error that we're going to
simulate and this is a very common error
in programming we're gonna simulate an
out-of-bounds air so we're going to go
ahead and try to print out an element
that is not in here remember we set the
size here to three so let's go ahead and
specify a really large number like 99
obviously we don't have that element in
this array so let's go ahead and rerun
this and now you can see an exception
was created now this is a really nasty
message we want to actually create a
more readable message for the user if an
out of bounds exception occurs and
that's where the try catch comes into
play now the try catch is basically
referred to as blocked so you'll have
the try block and you'll have the catch
block that's what they call them and
basically all that means is that it's a
block of code that does something that's
really it and they go together
hand-in-hand so if you create a try
block you must have a catch block and
the other point is that the try block is
where we try to execute some code that's
all it really is it's basically the code
that's at risk so we insert all of that
code within the try block and
the code works that's fine nothing will
happen the catch block will not get
executed but if an exception occurs
that's where the catch block comes into
play it will catch or trap the exception
and then it allows you to do whatever it
is you want to do so you can do many
different things you could print out a
new message that's what we're gonna do
in this video print out a more readable
message or you could actually create
some logs some system trace logs that
would allow you to debug what happened
in your try block and we'll do that in a
future lecture but for now we're going
to go ahead and setup the try block so
basically all of this code we're going
to go ahead and insert into our try
block so essentially what we're doing is
we're wrapping all of this code within a
try block so now surprisingly we use the
try keyword so let's go ahead and do
that and then we need a squiggly bracket
now now surprisingly we need to close
this out so we'll close it out down here
and there we've got our try now you can
see some intellisense here and that's
where it says hey I need a catch then
that's what I was telling you earlier if
you have a try you need a catch and
optionally you can use the final block
and we'll talk about that in a future
lecture but for now we're just going to
do the try catch so right after this
closing squiggly bracket we want to go
ahead and put in our catch so let's go
ahead and do that so we just use the
catch keyword and this actually takes
two arguments and we'll talk about these
in a moment now of course we need our
squiggly brackets again
and then we need to go ahead and put in
the block of code that we want to be
executed if we catch our exception and
in this case we're just gonna create a
more readable message so let's just go
ahead and actually copy and paste this
line and we'll go ahead and throw that
in here and whoops that created too many
of these closing squiggly lines let's
get rid of that okay now we're all set
and what we're going to do is go ahead
and just put in some text here and we'll
say an out of bounds exception occurred
so we're rather specific in the message
and this is much more readable than that
nasty stuff we had before so let's go
ahead and run this down and see if we
trap the out of bounds exception so
we're gonna run exactly the same code we
had before except now we've got the
risky code wrapped within this nice
little try block and we've got the code
that we want to be executed in our nice
little catch block so let's go ahead and
run this and there you can see it worked
we got our message and of course this is
much more readable now the way the
arguments work within the catch it takes
two arguments this first one is a class
and this is actually something that Java
provides for us and there are all types
of exceptions there are I uh except
shion's you could put that in here there
are math exceptions and Java has been
nice enough again to create these
classes that we can just specify in our
argument for the particular type of
exception that we want to catch and in
this case we wanted to catch an out of
bounds exception so we use this index
out of bounds exception class that Java
provided for us and it worked it
actually caught it and this is actually
an object or variable of this class and
we could reuse this down in this catch
block if we wanted to now we're not
going to do that in this video we'll do
that in a later video and that's why
it's actually telling us that we're not
using this but we do want to actually
put it in here as a placeholder in case
we want to use it later on now you can
actually specify multiple catch blocks
and that's what we'll cover in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
