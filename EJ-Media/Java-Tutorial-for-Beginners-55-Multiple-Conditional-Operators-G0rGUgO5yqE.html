concepts we've learned in the last few
videos about conditionals and what we're
going to do is use multiple conditional
operators in our code and that's sort of
more realistic often Java programs will
have lots of conditionals and they'll
combine both of the conditional
operators the or and the end and so
that's what I've done here now if you
take a look at this I've got two or
conditions right here this is the first
and here's the second and then they are
embedded within the overall condition
which is an end condition so what we've
essentially done here is added an extra
layer now you look at the code from the
previous video if we start adding extra
layers we just need an extra set of
parentheses that's all we really need to
do so you can see this has three sets of
parentheses and the code from the
previous video has two so that's what
you do if you want to start layering
your conditionals now let's say we put
another conditional within these
parentheses then we would have four we
would need actually four parentheses now
you'll notice that the first or
conditional is going to test against
these first two variables a and B and
our second or conditional is going to
test against these two variables C and D
and depending on how these two or
conditionals test out it will affect the
overall condition which is an end
condition of course so let's walk
through some of these now we don't have
to walk through all of the outcomes
because you know how these resolve now
is pretty much the same thing now as you
can see everything is going to test out
to true so if we run this this should
turn out to be true and it is now let's
go ahead and make the first variable
test out to be false and we'll make the
C variable test out to be false as well
now we know that the or conditional from
the video we did a few videos ago both
conditions have to be false in order for
the or conditional to test out to be
false so these still should test out to
be truth both sides and that means the
and conditional which you'll remember
needs both sides to be true will still
turn out to be truth so let's go ahead
and run this and there you can see we
got the expected outcome which is true
now let's go ahead and make D false so
we'll make this 18 now this or
conditional now we'll test out to be
false so the an content
shall now should also test out to be
false so let's go ahead and run this and
there you can see we got the expected
outcome so now you can go ahead and play
around with all the different outcomes
and you can also switch some of these
operators so you could make this an and
operator why don't you do that and just
test the different outcomes and this
will get you more familiar with the
conditional operators which are very
very important in any language okay we
will move on to a new subject in the
next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
