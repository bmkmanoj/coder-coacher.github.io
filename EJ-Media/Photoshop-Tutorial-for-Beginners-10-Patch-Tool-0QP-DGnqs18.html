take a look at the patch tool in
Photoshop now the Spot Healing Brush
tool and the Healing Brush tool are good
if you're trying to fix minor blemishes
or defects in your photograph but if
you're gonna try to fix larger scale
items then really you want to use the
patch tool and the patch tool is really
excellent at removing objects animals
humans ex-husbands ex-wives
ex-boyfriends ex-girlfriends those kinds
of things
now the patch tool has two basic options
normal mode and content-aware mode
normal mode itself has two options
source and destination now first let's
talk about normal source this is mainly
used if you want to target and replace a
portion of your photograph the normal
source mode is better with human faces
because this gives you more of a blend
but if you have landscapes like we have
in this picture it's better to go ahead
and use the content-aware
because there is less blending involved
and again we don't really need a lot of
blending we just want to pretty much do
a pixel for pixel replacement of the
area that we target so we're first gonna
go ahead and start out with
content-aware so basically what we want
to do is remove this hiker from the
photograph now I chose this photograph
because this is a little bit more
complex than your average removal that's
because he's against two backgrounds you
can see he's against this sky but as you
can see his feet are against this rock
so really we have to do two passes at
this first we want to remove the portion
of his body from the sky and then we
want to do another pass and remove his
feet from this rock so first we're going
to deal with the sky now by default the
last is used with the patch tool and
you'll remember we use that a few videos
ago so let's go ahead and draw around
the portion of his body that's against
the sky so we're going to start right
here and what you want to do is try to
cut in as close as you can to the edge
of this rock just like that and then
we're gonna go around here and there now
we have the portion of his body that's
against the sky selected and then what
you can do is basically move this to the
area that you want to replace this part
with and obviously we want to replace
the sky because the sky is right here so
let's just move this a little bit to the
right and you can
see he's pretty much disappeared you'll
also notice that Photoshop gives you an
idea of how it'll look so you just drag
it over here and it'll give you again an
idea of how it's going to look and that
looks pretty good so once you let up on
the mouse it's gonna go ahead and blend
this in so hit control D to get rid of
the selection and you can see it took
him completely out of the photo now and
you'd be hard-pressed to see that he was
actually removed out of this and now
what we're gonna do is draw around his
feet at the top of this rock and we're
just gonna go right above his feet here
just like that that probably could have
been done better but you get the point
so let's go ahead and drag this down
below a little bit and you can see that
looks pretty good
let's go ahead and let that go hit ctrl
D to get rid of the selection and take a
look at that he is now completely
removed from this photograph and you'd
be hard-pressed to notice that anything
was done here and so again sometimes you
need to do two steps like we just did if
your subject is against multiple
backgrounds now keep in mind sometimes
you might need to play around with this
a while if you don't get the desired
effect that you're looking for and that
again means you might need to create
multiple layers always remember layers
are your best friend and I'm gonna
actually open up another photograph here
and I have this new zealand landscape
and let's say we wanted to get rid of
this whole line of trees well we can
just lasso right around this and like we
did in the last photo you just drag this
to the area that you want to show up in
our target area so we'll go ahead and do
that in this case we want grass we want
those trees to be replaced by a grass
and so go ahead and release the mouse
and we'll hit control D to get rid of
this selection and let's say we wanted
to get rid of this dirt well let's go
ahead and do that let's go ahead and
lasso that out of there as well and
we'll just drag this down a little bit
and put some grass in there and now the
dirts gone and we can even get rid of
this dirt pile
so you can see with just a few mouse
clicks you can start to drastically
alter photographs now let's flip back to
normal mode and we want to actually go
ahead and select destination now this
mode will actually let you duplicate an
object completely it'll actually make a
complete duplicate and I'll show you how
that works I'm going to go ahead and
open up another photograph here and
let's open up the emperor penguins
photograph and let's say we wanted to
completely duplicate this penguin let's
go ahead and do that we'll just lasso
around him and we're just gonna drag him
to the right and you can see we got a
complete duplicate and then I'm just
gonna try to align this here and take a
look at that that looks perfect now
there's also a transparent option I
think that speaks for itself it'll give
you kind of a transparent feel to
whatever you duplicate and we'll go
ahead and try that really quickly so
let's go ahead and select these two
penguins right here and we'll just drag
them to the left now we're running out
of room but we'll just drop them right
here and there you can see we have this
translucent effect okay that's gonna do
it for this video as always thanks for
