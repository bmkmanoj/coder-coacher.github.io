with HTML forms and we're going to look
at radio buttons now radio buttons are
those small circular buttons that you
see on websites and they are used to
take surveys or to ask the user their
preference for a particular subject now
the key to radio buttons is you only
want the user to be able to select one
choice that's all they get with a radio
button they get one choice now in this
video we're just going to set up a
simple yes-or-no choice and those will
be displayed as radio buttons that they
can select so you can see we've set up
our labels here and we're just using
normal text we use the input element
this time and we set the type to radio
so this is the type that we use for
radio buttons and you'll remember in
previous videos that we set this type to
different settings if we want a
different form so for instance for the
one line text box we set this to text
but for radio buttons it is radio now
the name has to be the same for all of
our radio buttons because these are all
considered one question so to tie them
together you have to use the same name
if you use a different name here you
will be able to select all the radio
buttons and we don't want that we only
want them to be able to select one radio
button now the value we're not going to
worry about that's what actually gets
submitted to the server and we'll deal
with that in a future video when we talk
about server-side code but just know the
value actually is sent as the answer so
for instance if I answered yes to this
question this is what would be sent to
the server where it would be processed
and again we'll talk about that in a
future video so let's go ahead and
refresh our page and there you see we
have our two radio buttons and we can
only select one of them now watch what
happens when we put in a different name
here I'll show you this and we'll
refresh the page and now you see I can
select both of these and again that's
why these names have to match if they
don't then you will be able to select
both radio buttons and again that's not
what we want we only want to be able to
select one so the two key things to
think about here again it is some sort
of preference or question or survey that
you're asking the user and again
and they only get one choice now what if
you want the user to be able to select
multiple items well that's where a
checkbox comes into play and we will
talk about the checkbox in the next
video see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
