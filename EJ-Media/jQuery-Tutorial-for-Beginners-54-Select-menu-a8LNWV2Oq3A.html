to use the Select menu in jQuery now
normally you will not add the select
menu to the main content panel you want
to add that to the sidebar so that's
where we're going to add it inside our
web page we're gonna add it right inside
this left sidebar now I've already added
some of the HTML that you need for the
Select menu and if you took my HTML
series and I hope you did you will
remember that before we had any type of
menu to our web page we need the form
element so I put that right here and for
a select menu we need the Select element
and so I've added that right here and
I've added an ID of files which we will
use below in our jQuery code but first
we need to go ahead and add the options
you'll remember that we had various
options that we want to use in our
select menu and we're gonna add
different states that's what we're
actually going to add so let's go ahead
and create some option elements and
you'll remember it's just option element
so we just specify option here and then
we add value and the value we're going
to give this is Michigan let's add will
add the great state of Michigan first
now this of course is behind the scenes
and now of course we need to add what
will actually appear in the menu itself
the text and in this case we're just
gonna add Michigan again pretty simple
and then of course we need to just close
out the tag like always and then let's
go ahead and add a few more States we'll
just copy and paste this whole thing
right here and let's go ahead and add
Alabama and we'll add one more just to
be a little bit thorough here and we'll
add the great state of Ohio don't want
to leave them out okay so we've got
Michigan Alabama and Ohio and if you
want to add more options here certainly
feel free to do that so let's go ahead
and save this and now let's go down to
our jQuery code and what we want to do
is go ahead and specify our selector
which of course was files we have that
right here let's go ahead and put that
in our jQuery code so of course we need
a hashtag and then we go ahead and
specify files and the function that we
call is select menu and that should give
us a nice select menu when we go ahead
and refresh our page and of course we've
got our nice select menu and of course I
forgot to update this area right here
sorry about that let's go ahead and do
that really quickly
ma'am you probably knows that I didn't
alright let's save this will refresh our
page and there we go now we've got our
three states now by default this with as
you can see is pretty short so let's go
ahead and we'll increase the width and
you can do that with the width property
so let's go ahead and add width property
and you'll remember we need squiggly
brackets and then we just specify the
width property and this is in pixels so
we'll make this a hundred and fifty
pixels and just eyeballing this I think
that's about fifty or seventy-five
something but anyways this will make our
menu longer so let's go ahead and save
this let's refresh our page and now look
Michigan appears nice and neat so we've
increased the width of our select menu
so that's one property that you can use
and is probably one of the most widely
used properties with the Select menu
function and you know what let's go
ahead and add a little margin around
this so it's not bumped up right against
the edges of our side menu so let's go
up to our form and we'll add an ID in
our form and the reason you have to do
this is you have to actually move the
entire form itself you don't want to
just move the select menu so we'll add
an ID here that we can grab ahold of in
our CSS stylesheet and we'll just give
this a name of test so let's switch over
to our stylesheet and we'll go ahead and
specify that down at the bottom of our
stylesheet and let's go ahead and give
this a margin of let's say 10 pixels
does that sound about right the margin
of 10 pixels okay so let's go ahead and
save this
and there you can see it looks much
better it's no longer bumping up against
the edges of our sidebar okay that's
gonna do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
