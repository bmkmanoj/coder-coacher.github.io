bootstrap I have had a lot of requests
to do a series on bootstrap and so I
have decided to do just that now what is
bootstrap bootstrap is an open source
framework that allows you to build
websites and the good thing is it's free
and open source so you can basically use
it to design your websites and your web
applications now what is a framework in
case you don't know it's a set of tools
that allows you to simply do something
very complex that's basically what a
framework is and usually what it does is
it extends the functionality of existing
software's so if you take a look at
JavaScript and jQuery jQuery is a
classic framework it extends the
functionality of JavaScript and that's
what bootstrap does it extends the
functionality of HTML CSS and JavaScript
now bootstrap was first developed by
Twitter and they were nice enough to
make it open source now what does it
offer quite a lot and these are just a
few of the points that I'm going to make
it's the CSS part of bootstrap the CSS
framework is very flexible and easy to
use and the good thing is it's already
been tested out a lot of the code that
they provide has already been tested so
you don't have to do any testing you can
make a reasonable assumption that the
code provided in bootstrap is going to
work very nicely the major thing that
bootstrap provides is a grid system for
your website layout and it usually comes
in a 12 column grid and it's very very
responsive that's the nice part about it
but you can also use a fixed grid so you
can either use the fixed grid or a
responsive grid and we'll talk about
that in the coming videos now I want to
point out that a lot of people think
that bootstrap is just a template or
just this grid system but it's not it
offers a lot more it has a lot of
components that you can use and we'll be
covering that it offers labels buttons
dropdowns navigation bars all sorts of
components that you can use even in an
existing website so again there's a
little bit of a misconception out there
that somehow this is just some sort of
grid system it is not it offers lots and
lots of components so the prerequisites
for this series are HTML and CSS if you
do not know anything about HTML or CSS
you need to go
my channel page and take those beginning
tutorials because we are not going to
cover the basics of HTML and CSS so once
again if you don't know anything about
HTML and CSS you need to go take those
series first before you start the
bootstrap series because this is really
an extension off of those series it will
also be helpful to know JavaScript now
javascript will not be the main focus of
this bootstrap series bootstrap provides
some nice JavaScript plugins so again
javascript is not necessarily a
prerequisite but it will be nice if you
know that as well okay that's going to
do it for this introductory video in the
next video we will download and setup
bootstrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
