Java this is going to be a short
tutorial we're just going to talk about
the main method here that we all know
and love and we've seen in several of
the other tutorials and just talk about
it briefly now the main method is a
built in method within Java and it
basically says to Java here's where the
main program starts so everything we do
all the classes we make funnel right
into here and of course that means this
is where we start referencing and using
them so the analogy I like to use is
think of it kind of like a football game
so we have one week to prepare for the
team that we're going to play and we
have to build a game plan and a playbook
to use when the football game starts so
we go to our classes here and we create
all of our code or planning what we're
going to use for our main program
whenever it gets executed so that's that
phase right we're in the planning stage
we're preparing for the football game
think of it almost as we have this
playbook now of all of our classes that
we created and now we're going to start
calling and using all their variables
and methods when we want them so this
main execution path that goes all the
way down here and all the things we're
doing I just like to think of that as
our playbook and we're calling what we
designed so the football game started we
pull out our playbook and now we're
using all of these classes here that we
use to prepare for the game so you know
let's go you know what I need a new
object of class a let's do that and then
I've got to print out the object from
new obj so we do that and then we're
going to go ahead and invoke one of his
methods oh and guess what now we got to
pull this class be out of our playbook
and we're going to go ahead and get him
going and so we got to create an object
of him
and then you know what we got to go
ahead and print out one of his variables
you guys get the idea so think of this
is kind of like the playbook and if we
go ahead and run this there we go we got
what we wanted
but that's the way you want to think of
it you'll have perhaps hundreds maybe
thousands of objects that you're going
to go ahead and run in here you're doing
all kinds of crazy things all of your
classes funnel into here ok I told you
guys this would be a short tutorial that
is it I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
