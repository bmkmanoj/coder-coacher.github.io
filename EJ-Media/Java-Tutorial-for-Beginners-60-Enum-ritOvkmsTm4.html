enums or enumeration in Java and I've
had numerous requests to do this so I've
decided to go ahead and put together
some sample code now essentially an enum
acts very similar to a class in Java
it's very very similar but it does a few
things differently and you can see here
I've already set up some code so I'll
explain all this now we have our class
here and and of course we always have to
give the class a name and we have to use
the keyword class here is the you know
now you're gonna see this is very
similar take a look at this it's very
similar but the big difference here is
instead of using class we specify enum
other than that they're very similar
again we have to give it a name which we
did and then you'll see these things
right here you'll be like what are these
these are constants so that's what an
enum does it's basically a bunch of
constants what are constants constants
are just that they do not change the
values are set in stone so that's what
an enum is it's acts like a class but it
just has a bunch of constants that will
not change and what constitute constants
well they are values that you know you
probably won't change much like we know
that there are seven days in the week
that's probably not going to change at
least in this world we know there are
two days on the weekend that's probably
not gonna change unless you live in a
country where you don't have to work a
lot and then you know there's five
working days you could also make this
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday Sunday you could just make that
the days of the week
that's probably not going to change so
again you want to use constants where
the values are not going to change
they're pretty much set in stone so
that's what an enum does it just
contains a bunch of values where you
know that those values will not change
you will not have to change them in the
future now you could have just used the
name as the value itself we could have
just said days week but I decided to go
ahead and give it a numeric value that
so that's why we use the parenthesis
here now let's say this was Monday and
this was Tuesday and this was Wednesday
I probably wouldn't have used a numeric
value here I probably would have just
used the name itself as the value now
after the last constant we go ahead and
use a semicolon and then I can go ahead
and create a variable here that will
hold one of our constants when we use
our ena
down here now we mark this final because
these values can't change so again
that's why we use the final keyword we
don't want these values to change and
that's what the final keyword does it
will prevent us from changing these
values and then here is the constructor
now remember every class has a
constructor and so do items the only
difference is you have to mark it
private we cannot mark this public or
even make it protected a Java enum must
be marked private now you might ask well
why why can't I mark this public and the
reason is a class we can create objects
off you cannot create objects off an
enum and the reason is is because we
don't want these values to change
remember with classes we create as many
different objects as we want off the
class and then we can go ahead and
manipulate the variables right we can
change the values but that's not the
case in an enum we do not want to change
these values that's the whole point of
having the enum so that's why this
constructor is marked private so that
you can't call it down here and try to
make an object out of it remember the
constructor creates the object so if you
mark this private all of a sudden you
can't get to it down here that's the way
that works you won't be able to call it
with the new keyword so again here is
the constructor and we're going to go
ahead and pass in whatever day we use up
here whatever value and of course you
know how the this keyword works I hope
you took that video early on so now we
want to go ahead and use our enum but
how to get to everything in here right
because of course we can't use the
constructor that's private so we need to
create another method that will go ahead
and get the value of our days variable
and we need to make that public so that
we can access it from the outside so
let's go ahead and do that and again
we'll mark this public int for the
datatype and we'll call this get value
really nice and simple
and let's go ahead and use the return
keyword because we're just gonna return
a value here and of course we're gonna
use the this keyword again because we
want to return the value up here
remember it's all about scope with the
this keyword and there we go
so now we can go ahead and access our
day's variable up here using this method
which is marked public so now let's go
ahead and use our enum down here so
let's go ahead and we'll create another
variable that we can use and let's just
call this value and here's where we'll
specify our enum which of course is enum
test and of course we have to use a dot
so in a way it acts like an object
remember it's like a class the only
thing is we didn't use the new keyword
here you notice that we did not use the
new keyword here because we can't create
an object off of this and let's go ahead
and we'll take days week let's use that
constant and now of course we need to
print it out and then we need to use our
variable up here and we can now call our
method which of course is get value okay
so let's go ahead and print this out and
let's see what we get hopefully we get
seven if this all works and it did now
remember what I said we can't create an
object off an enum you can't do that in
Java and again because these are all
fixed values we don't want to manipulate
the value but let's see what happens if
you try to do that so let's go ahead
down here and let's just go ahead and
copy and paste this line actually and
Java will complain because it wants a
different variable name that's fine
we'll give it value two and now let's go
ahead and do the new keyword
everything's fine now but watch what
happens when we try to create an object
off our enum it should throw an error
here and it did enum types may not be
instantiated and now you know why so
that's how in ohms work in Java thanks
and I will see you guys in the next
