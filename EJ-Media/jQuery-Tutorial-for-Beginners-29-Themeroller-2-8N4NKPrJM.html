widget but we're going to do that in the
next video
because I wanted to talk about another
subject and that is themes in the jQuery
UI now I want you to go out to jQuery UI
calm and go to the theme roller page and
I will provide the link to that in the
description of this video
now basically jQuery UI widgets all have
the same appearance they basically have
the same theme and look it doesn't
matter which widget you decide to go
with but that theme may not be what
you're looking for you may have a theme
that's tailor based for your website a
particular color scheme that you want to
use and that's where theme roller comes
into play it allows you to pick your own
theme now you can either develop your
own customized theme or you can click
from a gallery that the jQuery UI team
has been nice enough to provide so if
you'll take a look at the link here
you'll see there's two main tabs roll
your own and the gallery tab now the
roll your own tab allows you to
customize your own theme and you can
pick everything from font settings to
the hover State you can basically put
together your own custom theme so that's
one way and then the other way is this
second tab right here the gallery now
we're going to go ahead and select the
gallery tab in this video and once you
click on that you'll see all these
different themes you'll see the
lightness theme and that's actually one
of the default themes and you can pick
whatever theme you want out of here I'm
going to go ahead and pick the sunny
theme right down here
so you'll want to hit the download
button and once you do that you'll get
this download or build page and
basically this allows you to actually
pick the particular widgets that you
want to select now usually I just select
all them so you can scroll down all the
way to the end of the page and select
download now once you've done that
you'll get a jQuery UI folder now I've
renamed this to the sunny theme so I
suggest you should do that too so name
it jQuery UI - sunny theme and then move
that into our website folder now what I
want you to do is actually take the
original pack that we downloaded go
ahead and copy that and paste right back
into the folder and we're going to
rename that too and we're just going to
call this original theme
and that way you have a copy of both
themes an original copy that we're not
going to alter now if you open up the
sunny theme or whatever theme you
downloaded you'll notice it's the same
library basically all the same files
whether it's the CSS or jQuery files and
they all have the same naming convention
so what does that mean well it means we
can just go ahead and copy and paste all
of these into our jQuery folder our
original one and if we want to switch
back to our original theme later we can
so again go ahead and select and copy
all the files in whatever theme folder
you downloaded and then we're going to
right click and paste into our original
folder and then you're just going to
select this do this for all current
items you'll get another prompt here
just hit this and we're going to do a
copy and replace and now we've copied
all the files for our new theme and the
nice thing about this is we don't have
to do anything else right since these
files are all the same we don't have to
update our main index.html because they
already point to the same file names and
we have the same folder name so this
should be relatively easy so we don't
even really need to open up notepad plus
here we can just right click on our
index.html and let's go ahead and open
that with Google Chrome and let's go
ahead and maximize this and if we click
into our input box look at that we've
got this nice new theme isn't that
really cool so again the theme roller is
really an excellent utility and the nice
thing about it is it will generate all
of the files for you all the CSS files
all the jQuery library files that we
need everything that you need it will
automatically generate it for you
even if you decide to do a custom theme
where you put in your own colors that
match the look and theme of your own
website so that's why the theme roller
is really a cool utility so you can
continue on with whatever theme you want
throughout the rest of the series I'm
actually going to switch back to the
original theme but again you can
continue to use whatever theme you want
for the rest of the series okay I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
