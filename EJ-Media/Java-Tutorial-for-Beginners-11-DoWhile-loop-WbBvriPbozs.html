we're going to be looking at do-while
loops but before we do that I explained
how while loops work in the previous
tutorial which was tutorial 10 so if
you've not watched that you should go
watch that now because I will I
explained how all this code worked and
I'm not going to go over that again
because they are so similar so
essentially a while and a do-while loop
do the same thing the only difference
between a while and a do-while loop is
where the conditional test is performed
and what I mean is in a while loop the
conditional test is performed before the
statements are handled in a do-while
loop the conditional test is performed
after the statements are handled so we
will move that past the statements and
I'll show you that but let's first
execute the while loop and again a
do-while loop and a while loop will give
you the same results and I'll show you
that now so let's go ahead and run that
and you can see here that we got a this
is a loop this is a little bit's loop
and that's the same output that we got
in the last tutorial so let's go ahead
and close that out and now what we're
going to do is move this conditional
statement to beyond and we're going to
put a semicolon here so this is beyond
the statements now so the conditional
test will be done at the end and then
we'll put in the do keyword here and so
that's how that's going to work so let's
go ahead and run this and we should get
the same exact output and we did look
this is a loop this is a loop it's the
same exact output that we would get the
only difference like I said before is
that the condition is done after the
statements are handled now there are a
couple points I'd like to make before we
close out this tutorial the first point
is that for both a do-while and a while
loop we will define and declare our
variables before any of the work it's
done the second point that I'd like to
make is that you may ask the question
what happens if this conditional test on
the first run is false
what happens and it's a good question if
that happens these statements since they
are executed before the conditional test
you will get at least one line of output
so let's do that now
so let's make this a sixteen and now the
bottom number is greater than the top
number so this conditional test will
turn out to be false but since this is
executed last and after the statements
are handled we should expect to get at
least one line of output so let's go
ahead and do that now and we'll run this
there you can see we got one line of
this as a loop what I will show you now
is let's move the while loop to the
start here we'll get rid of the do
keyword whoops going the wrong way and
we will get rid of the semicolon and we
will rerun this and we received no
output and that is what we expected
because this conditional test turned out
false at the beginning and therefore the
system dot out dot print was not printed
the loop simply ended when this met the
false condition so that's it on while
and do-while loops and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
