last few tutorials we've been examining
the GUI and how to add components to our
jframe in this video we're going to take
an initial look at graphics and there
are three types of graphics there are
normal graphics there are 2d graphics
and of course there are 3d graphics in
this video we're just going to start out
with basic graphics but we cannot use
the jframe we have to use the J panel
and so that is why we are extending off
of J panel but we still need a J frame
right we need a window so we can create
a global variable right here called
frame and then I created this method
called fire up screen and I'm using the
same methods and parameters that we used
in the last several videos now this is
where I'm going to introduce the first
graphics method it is called paint
component and it is supplied by Java now
I'm also going to introduce a new
concept here you'll see here this
graphics and this G now what is going on
here well you can pass classes as
arguments now before we've been doing
the datatypes right we did int we did
string but you can also pass a class as
an argument and if you right click on
here you'll see that this is in fact a
abstract class now this is the instance
of it so we don't even need to use the
new keyword to create an instance it's
already there so we can go ahead and
just start using it right now we can do
G dot and then start calling its methods
but we're going to do that in a minute
so again paint component is the method
used to paint think of jpanel as our
canvas that's what we're going to use to
paint on and so again that's why we are
extending off of jpanel
and then of course we have to import a
WT in the swing library so you need to
put that there and then in our main we
are going to make a object just called
go and then we're going to call our
method that we made up here to fire up
our screen so we're doing a little bit
of a different thing than we did in the
last video we just fired it up in the
constructor but since we're extending
off jpanel we really shouldn't do that
so I just created this method that we
can call down here so that's the main
difference from the last video and so
now we need to fill in the paint
component method to do something and
what
going to do is create a simple rectangle
and so now we can go ahead and use the
instance that we passed in here and it's
called G dot and what we're looking for
here is set color and we're going to set
this to blue and there we go and then we
need to go ahead and draw our rectangle
and so we're going to look for fill rect
right here you can see it already has
all the parameters it will need now
we're not going to worry about these
first two so we're just going to put
zero and zero here I'll explain these
later and we're going to make this 200
by 100 and if we go ahead and run this
we get our rectangle now you can see
actually this 200 right here equates to
the width and this 100 is actually the
height even though it says with it's
actually the height okay so that is our
first look at graphics now we'll be
doing a lot more with this method and in
fact this has some 2d methods that we
can go ahead and use as well so we'll
look at those in the next series of
videos see you guys that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
