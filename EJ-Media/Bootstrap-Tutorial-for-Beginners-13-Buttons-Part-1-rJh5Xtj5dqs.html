first look at buttons in bootstrap and
of course buttons are very important to
your webpage they are what the user
usually sees when they need to click on
something so bootstrap provides very
nice classes that you can call to
display some very nice buttons so we're
going to examine those in this video
the first point I want to make is that
you can create buttons on three
different types of HTML tags the button
element the anchor element in the input
element we're going to go ahead and work
against the input element but again you
can use them with a button and anchor
tags so here you can see I've defined a
very basic button and of course we set
the type of button and here's the
bootstrap class that we're going to call
it's called BTN and that's pretty much
the format that you use for all
bootstrap buttons so this will give you
the most basic button now if you're
following along you may want to go ahead
and add this to your style sheet use the
type selector input and add a margin of
5 pixels and that way our buttons aren't
crunched right up in the corner so
that's what I added there but again
we're gonna go ahead and call this very
first bootstrap button so let's go ahead
and load up our page and there you can
see we've got a default button not much
to this just a very basic button so
let's go ahead and copy and paste this
line or we're going to do that several
times in this video because we're gonna
create several different buttons so the
first class that we want to call is the
default button and that's just going to
be simply BTN - default that's it so
this will give us the default but so
let's go ahead and refresh our page over
here and as you can see here is the
default button class and it adds a
little bit more you can see we've got a
border now we've got some shading and if
we put the cursor over the submit button
we get a gray background so it's
flipping the background so that's a lot
nicer as you can see now bootstrap also
provides a whole different number of
classes these ones I'm going to show you
next are basically color so if you want
a different color you can call that
class instead so I'm going to go ahead
and copy and paste this several times
over I think we need I think there's
seven of these so let's do this seven
times
so now what I'm going to do is go ahead
and fill all these different classes in
right here there is a primary button
that you can call and you'll see these
in a moment you'll see that they're just
really different colors so don't worry
so much about the name you just want to
pay attention to the color and maybe
that's the color you want for your
button there's a success one okay good
so let's go ahead and save this and
let's refresh our page over here
and there you can see we've got all
these different colors the primary
button is this navy blue the success
button is the green and actually later
on when we fool around with JavaScript
will actually flip the color of these
buttons so maybe what we'll do is we'll
have two different types so for instance
maybe we'll have the submit button this
gray and then when you hit it it'll turn
green so you can also use these buttons
with JavaScript but you could also just
use them on your webpage if you like the
color itself there are many different
ways you can use these bootstrap classes
okay so that's an initial look at the
buttons now let's take a look at some
different things you can do with some of
these bootstrap button classes and they
have a lot of cool features that you can
use now the first thing we're going to
do is talk about the size of the buttons
themselves there are four different
sizes there is extra large medium small
and extra small default is medium size
so that's what we have right here but as
I said you can change these as well so
let's go ahead and we'll create another
button here and let's do it for the
primary button so let's go ahead and
just copy and paste this down here let's
go ahead and we're going to create a
larger button so we'll create a larger
sized button and you can do that off the
first class that we call this BTN so you
just say - LG and that will create a
larger sized primary button now if you
wanted a smaller button you would just
put SM here instead of LG but we're
gonna go ahead and create a larger
button so let's see what we get here
let's refresh our page and there you can
see look we've got a larger primary but
now as you know buttons by default are
inline elements so you can see these are
all in line but what if you want the
button to stretch across the entire page
what if you want it to be a block level
element
well you can do that as well so let's go
ahead and copy and paste this let's go
right down here and we're just going to
go ahead and call another class you see
how bootstrap works you're just calling
classes that's why it's so nice and
that's why it's so popular a lot of
people like to use bootstrap because
it's very easy you're just calling
classes and in this case we're gonna
call the BTN - block class that's all we
do so let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page
and there you can see look at that this
stretch is now all the way across the
page so that's something you can do as
well now what if you want an active
button and a disabled button well let's
go ahead and first start with active and
we'll go ahead and just copy and paste
this last button we did and what we're
gonna do is type in the key word active
so we're gonna get rid of the block and
let's first go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page and there you can see
we've got an active button you know I
want you to notice the difference
between this primary button and this one
notice this is a little bit darker so
that's to signify that this is more of
an active button so again you can see
this a little bit darker other than that
it's pretty much the same other than
it's sort of giving you more of an
active feel I guess that's the way I
want to put it now what I really want to
show you is what a disabled button looks
like so let's go ahead and copy and
paste this line and what we're going to
do is just type in the word disabled and
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page now notice this when I
hover over this no effect take a look at
that this button is completely disabled
okay we're going to continue on with
buttons in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
