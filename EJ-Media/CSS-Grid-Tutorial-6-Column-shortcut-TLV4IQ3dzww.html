add rows automatically to our grid in
this video are actually going to focus
on columns and we're going to talk about
an easier way to add columns rather than
having to write out Auto each time so
let's go ahead and comment this out good
now what we're going to do is we're
actually going to use the same property
so we're going to continue using grid
template columns so let's go ahead and
copy this and we'll just go one line
below here and we'll paste this right
here good now the parameter that we add
is repeat and then what we need to do is
add some values so we're gonna go ahead
and create some parentheses here now the
first value we're gonna add is three and
that basically is the number of columns
you want to add so in this case we had
three columns so that's what we're gonna
do we're gonna go ahead and just specify
three so we're basically first gonna do
here is just keep the same amount of
columns because we want to make sure
everything works
okay so we'll specify three but again if
you wanted a twelve column grid you
would add twelve here and that's a lot
easier than having to write out Auto
twelve times so we're gonna stick with
our three column grid so that's the
first value then we add a comma and here
is the next value we add and that is one
f-r and i will explain what this means
the F bar is actually a fractional unit
and the one basically means hey divide
all of our three columns evenly which is
what we've been doing up here right with
this auto we didn't specify any sizes
here so our grid automatically
distributed the space evenly between the
three columns so that's what we're doing
right here we're basically saying with
this one right here hey divide all of
the space evenly between all the columns
that we specify right here and so you
can see this is a much easier way to add
columns so let's go ahead and save this
and let's go ahead and load our page and
again we just want to make sure
everything looks the same and it does
and again remember what that number one
F are we're basically distributing the
space evenly now you can go ahead and
specify different numbers here but we'll
deal with that in later videos for now
we just want to go ahead and distribute
all of the space evenly okay so
everything stayed the same now what
we're gonna do is actually add two more
columns so take a look how easy this is
gonna be now we can just go ahead and
specify five here and
now let's go ahead down here and add our
section I think this will be section 12
so we'll go right here and just copy and
paste this this will be section 12 and
so remember our grid our previous grid
ended at line 4 so now we're going to
take this to grid line 6 and then this
should encompass our two new columns
which are 4 and 5 remember we always
need an extra line for every extra
column that we act and then let's
actually create a massive section here
let's start from the first grid row and
then we'll go all the way to grid row
line E and let's go ahead and make this
color black and let's stay our style
sheet and we're not done yet of course
we need to go ahead and add an HTML
placeholder over here and we'll make
this section 12 and let's save our
stylesheet let's load this up and see if
this works and take a look at that it
worked great we have our two extra
columns here and we have our massive
section 12 okay that's gonna do it for
this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
