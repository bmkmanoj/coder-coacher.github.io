any website is the navigation bar and
bootstrap provides several classes to
construct really really awesome
navigation bars and you can do all sorts
of things you can add buttons logos
dropdowns and even search boxes so
that's what we're going to cover over
the next several videos so the first
thing we're going to do is construct a
basic navigation bar in bootstrap in
this video so the first thing we want to
do is create a div now for the first
element you can either use a div or you
can use the html5 nav element we're
going to go ahead and use the html5 nav
element now the first thing you need to
call is the nav bar class that's one of
the main classes and you guessed it that
actually just tells bootstrap we're
creating a navigation bar so let's go
ahead and put that in and again it is
nav bar now the next class we need to
call is nav bar again now a lot of
people have emailed me and asked me why
do I have to specify all these classes
in bootstrap why is there all this
repetition well first of all bootstrap
uses classes that's the main way you
construct whatever it is you want to
construct second of all they provide a
great deal of customization so I mean I
guess they could just provide one class
but really what they want to do is
provide a whole lot of different options
so that's why this can seem very
repetitive but again there is a method
to their madness okay so let's go ahead
and we're going to specify a nav bar
again and here is where we can use an
option and the first option we're going
to use is the default option and this
will just provide a default styling to
our navigation bar and it will actually
switch this a little bit later on but
for now we're going to use the default
option and let's go ahead and close out
our nav now we need to specify another
diff and another bootstrap class
actually it is our first if not our
second if so again we need to specify
another class and the class we're going
to specify here is container - fluid and
basically what this tells bootstrap to
do is to expand the navbar all the way
across the browser so basically this
will give us a responsive navbar
whatever size the browser window is that
it will expand out to the size of the
browser window so this is an important
one
okay now we need to go ahead and start
adding our menu items and in this video
we're going to add buttons and of course
that means we need a UL element along
with Li element so let's go ahead and
create our UL element and now we need to
call yet another bootstrap class and
that class is the nab class this is the
bootstrap class that you'll always call
inside your UL element so now and then
we need to call the navbar class again
and the option that we're going to use
here is map that's all we need so this
is the basic structure that you need
right here you need to first create the
navbar then you create the container
which in this case is going to be a
fluid container and then you need the UL
element and these to bootstrap classes
and now we're ready to go ahead and add
our buttons first let's go ahead and
actually close this out and there we go
now as I said we're ready to add our
buttons and what do we use for that we
use the li element of course so let's go
ahead and create our first button and
we're actually going to call another
bootstrap class and I'll explain what
this does in a second and that class is
active and basically what this does is
it highlights the button that is active
and in this case we're going to set this
to the home button and we only will
actually use this with our first button
because we only want one button active
at a time and then of course we need our
anchor link and we're just going to put
a pound sign in here for now but you can
put whatever link you wish to put in
here and as I said this is going to be
our home button and then we just need to
close out of course the anchor link and
of course now we need to close out the
li element and there we go we've got our
very first button now let's just go
ahead and put in a few more buttons here
and let's go ahead and just copy and
paste this now as I said we don't want
both of these buttons active at the same
time so we're going to get rid of the
bootstrap class for the second one this
is just going to be a regular li element
and let's say we need a news section so
let's go ahead and put that here and
let's go ahead and copy and paste this
again and we'll call this lifestyle how
about that
and let's create one more button and
we'll call this one entertainment how
about that okay good I think we're all
ready to go here let's go ahead and save
this and then let's launch this in
Chrome and let's see what we get here
there you can see look at that it worked
and take a look at that the home button
is active as you can see it's
highlighted now we can also change the
overall color of this and there are many
different styles that bootstrap will
provide so let's go back here and as I
said this is just sort of the default
look and you'll remember that's what we
specified let's go back to our HTML
though and let's go ahead and flip this
to inverse and you will see what this
does in a second so let's go ahead and
launch this in chrome and take a look at
that now our navigation bar is black so
some people like this style instead but
as I said there are different styles
that you can pick and choose and we'll
cover those in the upcoming videos okay
that's going to do it for this video we
will continue on with the navigation bar
in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
