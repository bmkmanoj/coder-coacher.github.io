how to make a simple logo in Inkscape so
let's go up to file and select document
properties and then we're going to
switch the width to 600 and the height
to 400 and you can just close out of
there and then over on the left let's go
ahead and zoom in a little bit and we'll
select the text button down here and
let's create some texts I'm just going
to call this simple and then let's go up
to text hit text and font going to
select this Microsoft ebuy T I think
that's how I don't know how it's
pronounced there you can see it hit
apply close and let's actually hit the
select button and let's actually create
this make this a little bit bigger and
then let's go ahead and make another
copy of this and then select the text
button again and let's change the second
word to logo okay so now we want to make
sure that both of these logos are at the
same height so if you haven't already
hit the select button and then let's
switch the first one to 250 and then
let's put the second one at 250 as well
and that was the y-coordinate by the way
which is the vertical coordinate and
then let's go ahead and select both of
those and you see the hand there that
will allow you to move both of them and
let's just Center this in the middle now
let's go ahead and work on the first
word here so you should have that
selected let's go up to object and
you're going to hit fill and Stroke and
then on the second tab you're going to
hit flat color go over to stroke style
and we're going to increase this to
seven and that looks pretty good okay
and now let's change the second word so
we'll select that and let's put this at
two and you again have to switch the
stroke paint to flat color and there you
go so we have a little bit of a contrast
here now let's go ahead and decrease
some of the spacing between the text in
the second word so let's go ahead and
select text and this second parameter
here up up here this double a you can
play around this it'll increase it if
you bump the number up if you bump it
down it'll decrease the space between
the text
so let's just give this a little bit of
their I think that looks or maybe a
little bit more there there we go
okay so let's scroll here to the right
so we can Center our logo and let's go
ahead and select everything we got here
and we'll just move this a little bit to
the right okay so we move that so now we
can go ahead and design our symbol to
the left here to give this some style so
let's go ahead and select the circle
here on the left and draw out a circle
now also you can also if you want doing
this as a square whatever you prefer and
then hit the select button and let's
drag that circle down here and then
let's go back to the fill and Stroke box
over here and let's select stroke paint
select the box all the way to the right
because we can play around with the
border and then select the color that
you want and that looks good now if you
go over to the fill box make sure that
you have flat color selected again and
then select a solid color that you're
looking for for the circle and that
looks pretty good for me and we're all
set okay so let's go ahead and copy and
paste the color from the circle into the
logos color so in order to do that make
sure you have the circle selected go to
the fill tab and let's copy the color
now select the logo and go to the stroke
paint tab and just copy and paste the
color into there and that gives us a
little bit of spice okay so let's go
ahead and hit select all and let's go
ahead and Center this you know wherever
you want it now we're pretty much done
here but we can also add some more
effects if you would like to we can go
ahead and add a gradient and so let's go
back to our stroke box and hit linear
gradient and then hit edit and you'll
hit this drop down box and you'll see
two colors here the first color we're
going to make white and then the second
color
make white as well but we're going to go
ahead and make this transparent and then
exit out of there now go ahead and hit
the linear tool over here and drag the
one on the left to the top and the one
on the right to the bottom good and
let's go ahead and reselect this and put
the opacity you can play around with the
opacity that you want this hat I'm going
to put this at around 33 but you can
play with it you may want that lower you
may just want I'm going to stick it
around like I said around 33 and so
that's a nice little effect one note
before we go you could actually resize
all this to where you want it once you
have these separated like this you can
go ahead and you know we could drag this
over here now you see how you can play
around with this stuff okay well that is
pretty much it please check out the rest
