websites and hovered over an HTML
element and then you see this very very
beautiful tooltip and you wonder how on
earth did they do that well it's very
likely they're using a combination of
CSS and JavaScript and jQuery and the
jQuery UI is nice enough to provide a
widget for the tooltip now you can see
here I've eliminated the date picker
method that we used in the last few
videos and in a minute we're going to
put in our tooltip method but before we
do that we actually have to add a tool
tip to our HTML structure so let's go
ahead and pick an element and why not
Julius himself so let's add a tool tip
first and you'll remember the HTML
attribute that we use is the title
attribute so let's type in title and
we'll just say something like Julius
himself very very original so let's go
ahead and save this let's refresh our
page and let's just make sure this works
and it did so we have our tooltip in
place but now we want to format it with
jQuery and the best thing as I said
before is to use the jQuery UI so let's
go ahead and use the type selector IMG
so we'll select our image element and
then we type in tool tip it's just that
simple and let's go ahead and refresh
our page let's hover over this now and
there you can see take a look at that we
got this really really nice tooltip
widget and that just looks a lot better
than the default one that HTML supplies
and again this is a combination of
JavaScript which of course makes up
jQuery as well as all those CSS files
that we specified up here so that's why
the jQuery UI is so nice to use it's
very very simple you can just call the
methods and with just one line of code
we have this very nice tool widget now
similar to the date picker widget there
are different options that we can use
with the tooltip widget and we'll get to
that in the next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
