at global and local variables and that
is determined where you define your
variables that is the scope and it all
has to do with functions now variables
that are defined outside a function are
called global variables and they are
available to everything within your
JavaScript program so all the functions
can see it and everything else local
variables are defined within the
function and so they are considered
locally scoped and that means a local
variable is visible only to the function
and that means only the function can
access the local variable that's defined
within it so everything outside the
function cannot see this local variable
only the function can see the local
variable and to prove that let's go
ahead and run this simple JavaScript
program which I've done here and we're
going to print out this global variable
name and we should get Henry so let's go
ahead and run that and as expected we
get the name Henry now let's go ahead
and try to write out the local variable
inside the function and so we'll switch
this to name two let's save it and we'll
go run it and there you can see we get
nothing as I expected because the
document dot write cannot see this local
variable now let's go ahead and move
this inside the function and we'll just
comment this out we'll save this and
there you can see now we get the name
Sara because of course this document dot
write is now part of the functions
instructions and so it can see the local
variable name too now let's get rid of
this line and we'll uncomment this out
now there are a couple nuances to this
which I'd like to discuss first is you
will remember that when I did the video
on variables I said that you declare a
variable with the keyword var but that
is not necessary you will remember that
I said if you don't declare it as a
variable JavaScript will see it as a
variable anyways now what does this have
to do with global and local variables
well if you get rid of this var key
word this will still be treated as a
variable but it will be treated as a
global variable and so that's the key
point if you want a local variable
inside a function you must put that var
keyword in front of it and now we should
be able to see the name to keyword
because it's global because we don't
have the VAR keyword in front of it so
let's go ahead and save this and we'll
run this and there you can see we get
Sarah now let's go ahead and put the var
keyword in front of it and now this is a
local true local variable that is let's
go ahead and run this and we should get
nothing and we don't so that's one
little caveat to this so again don't
forget to put that var keyword in front
of your local variable now there's one
other nuance I'd like to state and that
is global variables will stay alive as
long as the page is loaded local
variables however will disappear when
the function is done whatever it's doing
so again as long as the page is loaded
Global variables hang around but as soon
as you reload it or close it out they go
away and are reloaded each time you
reload the page okay that's it for this
video I will see you guys in the next
