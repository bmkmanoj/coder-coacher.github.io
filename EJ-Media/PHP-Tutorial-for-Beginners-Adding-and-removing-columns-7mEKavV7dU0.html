created a database we've added a table
we've added columns to our table and
we've inserted data into our columns
creating rows now there may come a time
that you need to add an extra column
perhaps something unforeseen came up and
your boss wants you to add a new column
to your table and we can accomplish that
with the alter table command so you can
see we use the keywords alter and table
and then we just specify the table that
we want to update in this case it's user
data and then we have to use the add
keyword and then we specify the new
column that we want to create and in
this case we're going to add an email
column and you'll remember that we use
this data type the variable character
data type for our column and that won't
change here and we set this to not null
so let's go ahead and copy and paste
this in here and we'll paste it let's go
ahead and execute it and there you can
see we got our favorite message query
okay now it's always a good idea to go
ahead and make sure that the column was
in fact added so let's go ahead and do
that we'll just use that described
command we've been using and there you
can see our new column is in fact there
now what if you want to go ahead and
remove that com what if you changed your
mind well everything is pretty much the
same we use the alter table command we
have to specify the table and instead of
using add keyword we use the drop
keyword and I think that speaks for
itself it will remove the column that
you want to remove in this case it's
going to be email the one we just added
so let's go ahead and execute that and
you can see we got query okay and let's
just go ahead and make sure that in fact
was removed and it was now let's go
ahead and add it back really quick
because we're gonna insert some data
into our new column
and of course we're gonna use the insert
command again and we talked about this
in the last lecture the insert into
command and of course we have to specify
our table and here is our new column
that we've added and in this case we're
going to add the email address right
here in this position test at test comm
really original I know well not very
original anyways let's go ahead and make
sure that we can insert data into our
new column and let's hit enter
and there you can see we've got our
favorite message query okay now let's go
ahead and use the Select command and
you'll remember that will retrieve the
rows and we're just going to make sure
the data in fact was inserted and of
course we need our table let's hit enter
and look at that there we go we've got
our new column and we've got the email
address that we just inserted into this
new row now you might be wondering how
do I update rows if we can update a
column how do we update rows and we'll
talk about that in the next lecture so
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
