on the this keyword now the this keyword
has about ten or eleven different ways
to use it but in this example we're
going to use constructors because that's
probably the most common way to use this
keyword so in this example we set up our
constructor right here and we're going
to pass this value right here 79 on to
our instance variable and of course
we're going to have the constructor do
that so let's go ahead and run this and
we got 79 so what happened here was we
invoked the new keyword and it went out
there to construct an object of this
class and so let's follow the lifetime
of this so the value starts off here 79
and it gets passed into here 79 again
right here and then it gets assigned to
this instance variable now keep in mind
that this is a placeholder for the value
you'll notice it's not numeric that's
because it's a placeholder it's only
object is to pass it here and this is
also a placeholder by the way right here
this X is also a placeholder that's why
these two have to match because Java
recognizes oh these are both
placeholders yeah I have to assign it to
this instance variable now if we put a
number in here and make this 12 and run
this again yeah we got 12 because we
assigned the value right here so this is
basically canceled out so let's put the
X back there and of course it will work
again now developer me comes along later
on and decides you know what I'm a
little confused here I want to actually
make this one because this is just too
confusing to me and let's hypothetically
save like 15 different values within
these parentheses and yeah I'm having a
difficult time matching all these things
up so let's go ahead and change this to
one change it to one and let's run it
again and we get a wait a minute where's
my 79 this is null that wasn't supposed
to happen
and after cussing out Java for a while I
come back and look at the code and I
decide you know what what happened in
here what is going on here and let's
take a system dot out dot print up here
and let's print out this variable and I
want to point out the system dot out
print is your best friend in the whole
old Java world because if you don't know
what the value is of something you go
ahead and print it out and see what the
code is doing so it's a really helpful
tool so let's go ahead and run this and
we got 79 here and then I'm thinking
wait a minute it was supposed to pass it
to this how come that didn't happen so I
kind of stepped through here again I go
70 I had 79 right here we come here and
then we go one equals one one equals one
think about that for a minute guys one
equals one remember I told you this was
a placeholder for the value right well I
just head here one equals one one equals
itself and I'm expecting Java to go
ahead and pass that along well in this
world when I say something equals
something it doesn't equal something
else that's why we're not getting any
intellisense here by the way so yeah
Java is going to go ahead and assign the
value to here that's what we told it to
do believe it or not we said one equals
one so it's only doing what I told it to
do so if I want to get it back out to
this instance variable we have to use
this keyword right here now you'll
notice this turned green by the way and
I like to think of that as a
communications are back up between these
two we're all good to go but what we're
doing here is we're basically saying to
Java hey you know this one equals one I
did here yeah that's not really the case
so don't assign the value in here and
stop your work pass it on to this pass
it on to here and then assign it to this
instance variable and actually this
means instance that's what it means it
means the instance it means an instance
of something of course this is a
instance variable so if we go ahead and
get rid of this system dot out print we
don't need that anymore and we go ahead
and run this we get our 79 like we
expected now if you don't want to use
this keyword you could actually take a
little bit different strategy instead of
using an X like we were you could say
one underscore one or something and then
we go ahead and copy and paste this down
here and then go ahead and run this and
you can see we got 79 and this is you
know this kind of matches this now right
we can kind of read this so and
so that's kind of a strategy you can
take not to have to use the this keyword
and not have these to equal each other
okay I hope this tutorial helps and I
will see you guys in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
