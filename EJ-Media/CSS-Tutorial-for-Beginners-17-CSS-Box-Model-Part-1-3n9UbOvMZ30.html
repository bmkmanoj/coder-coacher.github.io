beginning CSS today we're going to look
at the box model and this is where we
really start to have some fun because
you can really start to style your
website using the CSS box model now what
is the CSS box model well if you take a
look at this diagram over here on the
right there are four boxes there's the
content box there is the padding box
there is the border box and there is the
margin box and we're going to talk about
each one of these in this video now the
first box of course is the content box
and we've been using that right that's
where everything goes and we put our
text in there images videos any content
goes within the content box and if we
open up our web page here you can see
that this is in an actual box all of
this text and this paragraph element
would be in a box pretty simple it's
also important to note that every single
element on our web page has these four
boxes around it now these three are
invisible unless we specify them we
haven't yet but the padding is invisible
the border is invisible and the margin
is invisible because we haven't
specified them yet but they are there
they're just transparent think of it
like that but again every single element
will have four boxes around it and the
content is the one we're using right now
so now in order to see the content box
let's go ahead first and specify a
background color and we're going to go
ahead and use a hex code here
it's be 5 e 4 d 7 I actually like that
color for my content boxes so let's go
ahead and save this and we'll open this
up now and there you can see everything
that's inside that color that color that
we just specified is our content box and
yeah it looks like kind of a box isn't
it now you'll notice how close the text
is to the edge of the content box so in
order to increase that and give that a
little space to make it look a little
bit better let's go ahead and add some
padding so we're actually going to add
the second box now so let's close this
out and we do that with the padding
property you guessed it
and let's give that 20 pixels let's go
ahead and save this and let's open this
up and there you can see we've got more
space now look at that and that looks a
little bit better in my opinion now
let's add a border so let's close this
out again and that will of course be the
third box on this diagram and to add a
border there are three properties for
that and I actually already typed these
out so I'm just going to copy and paste
these in here there is border - color
and we're going to make that black
that's pretty obvious the border with
which we're going to make 2px and
there's the border style which we're
going to make solid and in a future
video I'll actually go over all the
different parameters and values we can
use for the border but for now let's go
ahead and save this and let's open this
up and you can see we've got a black
border so we've got our content box
right here the padding which is
everything in between the content box
and the border and then we have the
border so we have all three boxes now
you might be asking what is the margin
the margin is this space right here if
you take a look on this left that's the
space between the side of the page and
the border now you might be asking
yourself wait a minute we didn't specify
a margin so how come there's some margin
here and the answer to that is that the
browser automatically adds some margin
between the elements and so that's what
the margin is it's space between the
elements and the space between the edge
of the page and your border and so we
can actually play around with the margin
sizes and so we'll get to that in the
next video
