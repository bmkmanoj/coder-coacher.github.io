to set up a drop-down list in HTML now
this is a little bit different from the
checkbox we did a few videos ago a
checkbox allows the user to select as
many options as they want in a drop-down
list you only want them to select one
option so again that's what we're going
to setup in this video so it is the
Select element that we use to create
this drop-down list and you can see it
right here so we need an opening tag and
we need a closing tag and then we have
to use the option element and we embed
that inside of our select element and we
can put as many of these as we want as
many options as you want to present to
the user so again these go inside of our
select element and again the option tags
will allow us to define all the
available options in this drop-down list
so let's go ahead and create some
options we'll just put some States in
here so let's say we had some sort of
travel website and let's just pretend
that we have three States that we are
allowing them to pick from and they can
only go to one of them so the first one
let's say is Michigan now this value we
don't really have to worry about right
now we will deal with this later on when
we get to PHP and ASP but for now let's
just go ahead and put in Michigan now
here's where we put in the content this
is what will be displayed in our
drop-down list so we want to display of
course Michigan and it's very
appropriate to keep the value and the
name the same you can do that or you can
make them different so let's just go
ahead and copy and paste a new item in
here and let's pick another state and
we'll go with Alabama about that and to
complete the process let's do one more
state so we'll give them three options
to choose from and we'll make this North
Dakota so those are the three options
they get and we'll just copy and paste
this in here again and let's go ahead
and save this and we'll refresh our HTML
page and if we hit our drop-down box
here you can see these are the three
options that they get in our drop-down
list and again they can only choose one
so let's say we choose Alabama and there
you can see only Alabama now shows up in
the
dropdownlist now again in a future video
probably in the PHP or ASP series will
develop a script that will actually take
this and process it on a server and
we'll talk about that again in a future
