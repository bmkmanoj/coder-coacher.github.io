how to use icons in the jQuery UI
library and the icons in the jQuery UI
can basically be used against any of the
widgets that have icons and since the
accordion has icons this is a good place
to introduce this subject now you'll
notice the default icons are these
arrows we have this down arrow for the
tab that's currently opened and we have
this side arrow for the ones that are
closed those are the default icons but
we can go ahead and change those and all
you have to do is put the name of the
icon that you want to specify down in
these two properties and we'll talk
about this in a moment and where do you
get the name of these icons well the
jQuery UI website itself provides all
the names and you can see them right
here now I will provide you the link to
this webpage and you can see some of the
names here so I'm going to be using some
of these names in this lecture at least
some of my favorite ones now to use
icons from the jQuery UI library we need
to first use the icons property and
actually we don't really need that space
there okay now the icons property takes
two properties itself the header
property and the active header property
now the header property equates to these
closed panels it probably should have
said something like closed header but
that's what that equates to the active
header equates to the panel that's open
so let's go ahead and place in some new
icons and like I said I'm just gonna use
some of the names from that webpage we
were just at so let's go ahead and I'll
put a value in here and the first one
we're gonna use are the plus and minus
icons so we're gonna specify UI - icon -
plus and we can just go ahead and copy
and paste this down here and we'll put
in the minus for the active header so
let's go ahead and hit save let's
refresh our page and there you can see
we've got the minus icon now for the
section that's open and we've got the
plus for the tabs that are closed now
you can arrange these the way you want
for these I'd like to have the plus icon
for the sections that are closed because
this tells a user hey if you want to
open this hit this plus icon now another
icon set I like are the zoom in and zoom
out icons so we just put in zoom in here
and then we put in this
out so let's go ahead and save this will
refresh her page and there you can see
what the icons look like and once again
you can range these the way you want to
another nice one is the mail closed in
the mail open and I think we need
another - for that mail closed I believe
yes and then there's also the mail open
and let's take a look and see what this
looks like and there you can see what
the icons look like for the mail closed
and mail open and then the final one
that I like are the folder collapsed and
folder open and so let's take a look and
see what these look like
and there you can see these are quite
nice as well so you can go ahead and
play around with these but take a look
at that link that I provided in the
description of the video and put some
other icons in here and see which ones
you like and want to use for your
webpage okay that's gonna do it for this
video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
