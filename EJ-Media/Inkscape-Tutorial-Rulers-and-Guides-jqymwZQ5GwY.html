the ruler so at the top you have the
horizontal ruler and on the side you
have the vertical ruler now the ruler is
going to be used if you want to line
things properly or if you're going to do
things to scale now to toggle the ruler
on and off you hit control R and it will
bring it back as well
optionally you can go up to view and go
to show/hide and then you can turn it
off there as well now let's go to
document properties and select document
properties under document properties you
can turn off the page border and I
actually do that for a lot of my
drawings now if we put the cursor over
the ruler you'll notice the tooltip is
in pixels if you want to change the unit
of measurement you go to default units
and you could switch this to anything
you want we could switch this to inches
and you'll notice we put the tooltip
over the ruler now it's in inches now
you can also create guides by clicking
on the ruler if you click on the
horizontal ruler that will create a
horizontal guide and if you click on the
vertical ruler and drag it out that will
create a vertical guide you can also
change the colors of the guide right
here if you want to make it black or
whatever color you want to use you can
do that you can also change the
highlight color we're not going to do
that so let's close out document
properties you can also create angle
guides if you click close to the corner
up here you can drag those in and create
angle guides as well now let's create a
square object now over here on the right
if you select snap bounding box corners
you'll notice we dragged it it'll
automatically place it where the guide
lines meet you can also get a complete
grid by hitting view and selecting grid
and that will give you a complete grid
view you can also toggle guides on and
off by selecting guides now if you want
to get rid of an individual guide you
can just pick up the guide and drag it
back to the ruler and it's gone so
that's pretty much it for the ruler I
hope you found this useful and please
