of the options that you can use with the
tabs widget now some of these will look
very familiar
in fact we've used these in previous
videos especially with the accordion
widget now as I indicated in the last
video the first tab is always the
default tab that is opened in this case
it's ancient Greece now what if we want
ancient Rome to be the default tab that
gets open when a visitor first visits
our web page we can do that of course
with the active property and I actually
already have it typed out so I'll just
go ahead and copy and paste it right in
here and this is the same property you
will remember that we use in the
accordion remember we were changing the
default panels around well that's what
we're gonna do here now remember
computers like to start with zero so
this first spot this ancient Greece tab
that's actually zero so if we specify
one here when we reload this page
ancient Rome should be the panel that's
opened by default so let's go ahead and
see if that works and it did the ancient
Rome panel by default is now the first
panel that's opened and if we wanted
ancient Egypt it would be two and so on
and so on and so on okay so let's go
ahead and take a look at another option
now what if you want the user to be able
to collapse these different panels you
can do that with the collapsible
property so let's go ahead and set that
and we just go ahead and set that to
true so let's go ahead and see if this
works and it does all I have to do is
click on the tab again and it is
minimized and let's just make sure it
works for all of the tabs and it does so
that's kind of a neat little option that
you can use and let's go ahead and take
a look at yet another option and
actually let's go ahead and expand one
of these out again now one thing you can
do is you can have all of the content
fill up the entire page if you want so
by default it automatically sizes the
panel to the available content but you
can override that and no matter how much
content you have the panel will fill up
the entire page and you do that with the
height style property
and we just set that to fill for this we
actually have to use quotes so let's go
ahead and see if this works and it
didn't so I did something wrong maybe
this is lowercase let's try this again
yep it probably is that will get you
every time and it should work this time
let's see and it did now you see how
this fills up the entire page now that's
what the fill property does now the
default is content let's go ahead and
put that in here even though this is the
default and will refresh the page again
and there you can see it now sizes the
content panel - how much content is
actually in the section now by default
we have to click on each of these tabs
the click event is the default but what
if you want to use the mouse over event
well we can do that and we can do that
of course with the event property and we
just set this to mouse over so let's go
ahead and see if this works and it does
look I'm Mouse ting over each one of
these and the panels are changing okay
and there's one more option I would like
to show you and let's expand this out a
little bit here now what if we want to
disable some of these panels let's say
we want to disable the second and third
panel well we can do that and we do that
with the disabled property I've actually
already got this typed out so I'm just
gonna go ahead and copy and paste this
right in here and you can see here's the
disabled property and then we use square
brackets and then you just put the index
number of the panel that you want
disabled and remember ancient rome is 1
and ancient Egypt is 2 so let's go ahead
and make sure this works let's refresh
our page and there you can see those
panels now are disabled we can't click
on ancient Rome or ancient Egypt but we
can click on ancient Egypt - and that
works we can click on the open panels ok
that's going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
