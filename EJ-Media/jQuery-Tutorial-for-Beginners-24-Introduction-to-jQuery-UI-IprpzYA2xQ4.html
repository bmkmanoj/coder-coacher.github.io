the jQuery UI which is sort of a massive
subject in jQuery now first we'll answer
what is the jQuery UI now of course
jQuery is the core library that we've
been using
but the jQuery UI is basically built on
top of that library if you use the
jQuery UI you must also include jQuery
but essentially the jQuery UI is just an
extra Java Script library
similar to the way the jQuery core
library is also just another JavaScript
library so over the next several videos
we'll be using an additional library for
the jQuery UI but it also does something
very different it provides the CSS files
and images that are also needed now what
does it provide well at a simple level
it allows you to make awesome interfaces
you can use widgets effects animation
utilities different types of menu and
navigation bars and the main concept
here is that you can use these almost
like plugins so that's what the jQuery
UI is it's just a large collection of
plugins that you can plug in to your
website and they're really good to go
that's the nice thing about them
sometimes you can accomplish a very
complex widget with just a few lines of
code and so it's very convenient to use
the jQuery UI now I've provided a couple
samples here and these are just a few of
the widgets that you can add into your
website and we'll actually be using some
of these in a few videos this is the
accordion and this is the date picker so
you can just add these right into your
website and start using them and again
these are just a few things that the
jQuery UI offers now where do we get
this library well there are many
different sites we are going to use the
main website which is jQuery UI com and
that is the oldest one and probably the
most respected one but there are other
libraries out there you can do a google
search and you'll find many other
different libraries but we're gonna
start out using jQuery UI dot-com so
again the nice thing about these jQuery
plugins is that they're generally very
easy to use they offer a lot of
complexity but many times they only
require a few lines of code so in the
next video we will setup the jQuery UI
on our web page see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
