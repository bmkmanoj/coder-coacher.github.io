at some new html5 elements that we have
not covered yet the first one we're
going to take a look at is the mark
element and that allows you to quickly
highlight text you don't even need to
have any CSS you can just plug that
right in and your text will be
immediately highlighted so let's go
ahead and we'll pick up right where we
left off in the last video and we had
this paragraph right here that said this
is an interesting sentence you might or
might not want to read let's go ahead
and we'll highlight the words
interesting sentence so again we use the
mark element and then we just need to
close it out okay so let's go ahead and
save this and we'll open up our page and
let's go ahead and expand this out and
there you can see the words interesting
sentence are now highlighted so again
this is very useful if you just want to
quickly highlight something very very
useful tag now the next tag we're going
to use is the big one this is the big
addition to html5 it is called the
canvas element tag and basically to give
you a little background on that you used
to have to do all of your animations on
a web page with flash or Silverlight
well new with html5 is the canvas
element and they basically offer you the
same functionality so get used to this
canvas element tag we are gonna spend a
lot of time in this course using that
because again that was the big big
addition to html5 so you can now do your
animations using the canvas tag you can
draw lines you can do all sorts of
animations so that's what we're going to
be doing over the next several videos so
I'm going to introduce it in this video
now what we're gonna do in this video is
set up canvas we're gonna get that set
up and think of that just like a canvas
what do you do with a canvas when you're
painting on it you need a canvas first
right before you can do any painting and
then you go ahead and do your painting
or drawing or whatever you want to do
and that's the same thing here we want
to go ahead and set up our canvas and
then in the next video we'll begin to
start to draw lines and let's go up here
we'll stay within our article and we're
going to go ahead and create our canvas
element so you just type in canvas now
at its most basic level the canvas
element takes a width and a height and
that's what we can use to set up our
first can
so let's put in the width and as always
you specify this in pixels so let's make
this 400 pixels there we go and then
let's just go ahead and copy and paste
this you guys know how lazy I am I don't
like to type and this will be the hype
and we'll just make this 300 pixels and
then we just need to close it and we
don't need to put any content in here
yeah so there you go we've got our
canvas set up now you will need to add
some CSS and I've already added that
actually let's save this first and let's
flip over to the stylesheet and here's
what you want to create for the CSS I've
already typed this out we're just gonna
specify the type selector for the canvas
element and then you need to put in a
border right it won't appear without a
border because we need to show something
because we have no content and go ahead
and add whatever type of border you want
I'm just going to add a two pixel solid
black border and give it a margin of 5
pixels all right so let's flip back to
the site 1 HTML and let's go ahead and
load this up in chrome and there we go
we've got our canvas which is this
rectangle right here and we can draw on
that in the next video so that is the
canvas element and like I said get used
to this we're going to be using this a
lot throughout the series I'll probably
dedicate nine or ten videos maybe more
this is one of the most important
element tags that was added to html5 and
again it allows you to do all kinds of
wonderful animations ok I will see you
guys in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
