at the options that you can use with the
draggable widget and the first one we're
going to look at is the grid option and
this creates sort of an invisible grid
in the background you can't actually see
it but you'll notice that when I start
dragging around the images now you pass
in two parameters here a first value and
a second value and this equates to the
height and it's in pixels by the way and
this equates to the width so let's go
ahead and launch our browser and let's
see what we get so if I drag these
around see how these are dragging around
like they're on a grid you see that and
basically this allows your user to
easily line up the elements so take a
look that's much easier to sort of line
these up see that they just kind of snap
into place so that's one thing that's
nice about the grid okay so let's take a
look at another option and actually
let's open up the browser again I wanted
to show you something really quickly
you'll notice that I can drag these off
of the main element it doesn't prevent
me but you can prevent that by using the
containment option so let's go take a
look at that now so all you do is write
in containment right here and then
there's a couple values but the only one
I ever really use is parent and actually
we put that in quotes and basically what
this does is it won't allow the user to
drag the elements outside of its parent
element and in this case the main is the
parent element so we shouldn't be able
to drag it outside of that space so
let's save this and let's see what we
get
and take a look at that I can't drag
this now outside the parent element it
won't let me oh that's strange
it allows me to take it off the top
that's strange that might be a bug I'll
have to take a look at that well at
least it's stopping me from pulling it
across the sides but apparently I can
take it over the top that's interesting
but anyways you can see how that works
now you can also use the cursor option
and that basically will change the
cursor to whatever cursor you want to
use when the user drags the element in
this case of course it's an image so
let's just change this to crosshair you
can use different I think there's a move
you can go take a look at the jQuery UI
library and see all the different
cursors they provide but let's just use
crosshair and let's see what we get
so take a look at that when I drag the
image I now get a crosshair for the
cursor so that's how that works now you
can also set a delay and what that'll do
is it'll basically delay the user from
dragging the element and let's just set
this to 350 milliseconds you can play
around with different settings so let's
see what we get
all right so I'm going to go ahead and
drag it now see how there was a delay
see that another delay so that's
basically what that option does now the
final one I'm going to show you is the
revert option and basically that will
send the element back to where it came
from and you'll see how that works in a
second so let's go ahead and drag this
third image and see it goes back to its
original position that's actually kind
of cool so that's how that works and
actually there's one more property I
want to show you and that is the axis
property and basically what you can do
here is only allow the user to drag it
on a particular axis and the two values
are X and y those are the two values so
let's go ahead and set this to Y
basically what this will do is only
allow the user to drag the element on a
vertical path so that's what Y is for an
x is for horizontal if you wanted to
restrict it only two horizontal dragging
so let's go ahead and run this and let's
see what we get and there I can only
drag this up and down now on the y axis
I can't move it side to side so if you
want to go ahead and flip that to X go
ahead and try that but in any event
we're done with this video thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
