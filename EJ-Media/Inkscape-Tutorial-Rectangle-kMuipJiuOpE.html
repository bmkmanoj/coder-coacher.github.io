rectangle and square tool the rectangle
and square tool is one of the most
widely used tools in Inkscape the
shortcut key to access that is f4 okay
so let's go ahead and create some
rectangles here and as you can see this
has elliptical corners because Inkscape
remembers the last shape you made so if
I make more of these that's what you'll
get
now if I go ahead and sharpen the
corners and make it back into a
rectangle click onto another tool and
then go back to the rectangle tool you
can see I get rectangles now so again we
remember the shape that you last made
and that can be very useful if you're
creating multiple shapes of the same
type if we hold down the shift key the
rectangle will expand from the center if
we hold down the control key we will
create squares now let's go ahead and
hit the edit path by nodes tool over
here and let's pull down this first node
on the right and this will allow you to
create a rectangle with circular corners
now if we go up to this other node and
start pulling this left you can create
elliptical corners and to get back to
the rectangle you just select this up
here and that will get you back to the
original rectangle now you can be more
accurate by adjusting the values up here
the RX and the ry affect the corners so
if we start changing this value you can
see we can make it circular and the same
over here you can also be more specific
with the width you can give specific
width amounts so you can see we're
decreasing the width here
so again that allows you to be highly
specific you can also change the unit of
measurement if you want so if you wanted
to switch this to centimeters you could
do that now you can quickly change the
color down here if you want to switch
this to red or yellow dark green or you
can go up to object hit fill and stroke
and you can do that here now if you want
to add a border you just have to
increase the border size and there you
can see we're getting a border so that's
it for this tutorial I hope you found
this useful if you did please check out
my other Inkscape tutorials on my
youtube channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
