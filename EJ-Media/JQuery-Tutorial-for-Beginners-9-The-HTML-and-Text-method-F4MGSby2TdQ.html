jQuery methods the HTML method and the
text method as you can see here the HTML
method treats content as HTML and the
text method treats the content as text
actually they do something very similar
but there is a big difference and again
it's the HTML method treating the
content as HTML so both of these methods
update content they just do it a little
bit differently and I'll explain that in
this video okay so I'm going to go ahead
and copy and paste the first line of
code here and as you can see we're going
to use the HTML method we've got the P
selector so we're going to select all
the paragraph tags and then we're going
to go ahead and change the text to tabby
cats and you'll see here because this is
HTML this is an HTML method we have to
use the paragraph tag and so that's what
we'll be submitting not just the text
but also the paragraph tag and that is
the HTML portion of this method so all
of these paragraph tags in here should
have their text change to tabby cats so
let's go ahead and save this and we'll
go ahead and run this in chrome and
we'll hit our submit button and there
you can see all the paragraphs now have
tabby cats now let's go ahead and switch
this to the text method now again this
text now will not be treated as HTML so
we have to get rid of the paragraph tags
and so we'll do that and let's hit save
and actually let's go ahead and just
relaunch our page here and if we hit the
submit button everything's changed tabby
cats now again you might be confused as
to what's the difference between the
text method in the HTML method well
let's go ahead and switch this back to
HTML but before we do that let's
actually keep this as an example for you
so we'll just put a comment down here so
let's go ahead and switch this back to
HTML now instead of submitting a
paragraph tag let's submit an h2 tag and
now hopefully this will be a lot clearer
so let's go ahead and save this well
refresh our page and if we hit the
submit button look these are now H
two elements see how that works this
submits whatever HTML tag you want to
submit so we selected all the paragraph
tags basically converted them to h2
element tags with of course the text
tabby cats so that's the big difference
between the HTML method and the text
method and let's go ahead and save this
as an example for you so I'll put this
as a comment down here now let's
actually switch these back to paragraphs
so we'll just use the text method and
we'll get rid of the h2 element tags
here well go ahead and save this will
refresh our page and now these are back
to paragraph elements and we've just
changed the text that's all we've done
now you'll notice up here I've added
this empty h2 element you can actually
use these methods to deliver text as
well so we can actually deliver text to
this h2 element and let's do that using
the text method so let's go ahead and
put in h2 here so we're going to select
our empty h2 element and let's put some
different text in here so we'll say
something like give the h2 some text and
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page of course this is back
now to the original text we'll go ahead
and hit our button and there look our h2
element now has some text take a look at
that so that's how these two methods
work see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
