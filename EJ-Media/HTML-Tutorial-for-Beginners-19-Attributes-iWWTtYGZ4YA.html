break from coding and talk about HTML
attributes and we've been looking at
those in previous videos but I'm going
to explain more about those in this
video now before we do that let's do a
little bit of a rehash on elements and
tags now as we know elements are made up
of two tags an opening tag and a closing
tag and what do these elements do they
tell the browser something about the
information that is between these two
tags the paragraph element will tell the
browser that there's some text here the
heading element will tell the browser
that there's a heading here and the body
will tell the browser that everything
that's inside the body will make up the
actual web page so at a basic level
that's what elements do and now you
might ask the question well what's the
difference between tags and elements and
the answer to that is not a lot
they're almost one and the same in fact
you'll hear a lot of people refer to
this as an element you'll hear some
people refer to it as a tag some people
refer to it as element tags other people
will call it tag elements so they are
very very close and they essentially do
the same thing now if you wanted to get
really specific you would say that these
angle brackets here are an element and
until we put this P in here that tells
it what type of element it is it's
tagged as a paragraph element now what
are attributes what we've been looking
at those this right here is a class
attribute and all an attribute really
does is it gives more information about
a particular element it allows you to do
a little bit more and in this case this
is a CSS class and we're turning this
text blue and so it not only provides
extra information it gives us some more
functionality and the key here is this
attribute is specific to this element
this P element and only that so if we
had another paragraph element down here
it could have a different attribute or
no attribute at all so just keep that in
mind it's specific to the actual element
that it's inside you'll also notice that
always goes in the opening tag you never
put it in the closing tag so attributes
are always in the opening tag inside
these angle brackets now attributes
always have three items first we need to
put the attribute name
and these are standardized of course
then we need to use the equal sign and
then we assign it a value the equal sign
of course assigns it a value so those
are the three parts to almost every
attribute now you'll remember in
previous videos with the label element
we use the for attribute and the reason
I put this example here is that some
attributes only go with a particular
element so for instance the for
attribute is only available for the
label element you wouldn't put that in a
paragraph element whereas the class
attribute you can put in almost every
type of element there is so just be
aware that in some attributes you can
put in almost every element and other
attributes are very specific to a
specific type of element now attributes
are going to become more important when
we get to the CSS tutorials and
JavaScript tutorials ASB tutorials those
kind of subjects but I just wanted you
to understand how they work in HTML
before we get to those series okay
that's going to do it for this video I
will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
