preliminary look at functions and
actually we're going to spend the next
several videos examining functions
because they really are the key to
understanding JavaScript and so we've
got our J s file open here in notepad as
well as our webpage dot HTML that we've
been working on so let's flip back to
our javascript file and as I said
functions really are an important part
of JavaScript along with variables they
form the basic blocks of JavaScript now
functions are simply a set of statements
that we group together that perform a
particular task or function and really
it's a way of organizing your JavaScript
code you wouldn't want to have hundreds
of statements all over the place because
it would become unreadable functions are
not only a way to organize your code but
also reuse your code over and over again
because it makes sense that if you do
one particular function on one part of
your webpage you may need to use that
function over and over again so that's
really what it's all about reusing your
code and so you can put one statement in
a function or multiple statements and in
this video we're just going to do a very
simple function to get us started now to
identify a function we simply type in
the JavaScript keyword function and that
identifies it as a function to
JavaScript so let's do that and then you
can name the function whatever you want
so that's similar to a variable you can
call it whatever you want now like a
variable I recommend that you name it
something relevant in other words
whatever that function does so we're
simply going to call this function say
something now I should point out that
the naming convention for functions is
very similar to variables you can pretty
much use any naming convention you want
but you cannot put numbers in front of
the function so if we put an 88 in front
of this it will not work and you can see
the intellisense it turns our name to
red that will not work so that's really
the main caveat about naming functions
so let's get rid of that 88 now after
the name we need an opening and closing
parenthesis and this is where we pass
data into our function
and we're going to talk about that in
the next video but for now we're just
going to leave this empty but again if
we want to pass
data into our function we use the
parentheses and again we'll talk about
that in the next video okay so after the
parentheses we need curly braces and
this is where everything gets going in
terms of the function all of the
statements that we create will go inside
these curly braces and so let's put a
comment in there all statements go
inside curly braces okay
now let's create a statement for this
function and we're just going to do a
simple alert and we need our parentheses
and then we're just going to send a
string and we'll say this is a function
nice short sweet and simple and then of
course as always we need to close the
statement out with a semicolon now the
key point here and what differentiates a
function from just a normal statement is
that the function by itself will do
nothing we actually have to call this
function in order for it to run so again
if we don't call this nothing happens on
our webpage so in order to call this we
simply have to go outside the function
and type in the function name and we
just put in parentheses here semicolon
and let's save this and let's go over
our webpage and let's run this and there
we get the alert this is a function now
I will say JavaScript is all about tying
functions to events we will get to
events much later on but at a basic
level that's what you're doing in
JavaScript you're tying a function to a
particular event so it could be a mouse
click
it could be a keyboard stroke it could
be playing a video on a website anything
and everything is open game to make your
site interactive so as I said that's
really the key the basic key to
understanding JavaScript you're simply
tying functions to events and as I said
we will get to that much later on but I
just wanted to make that point early on
now in the next video we're going to
talk about these parentheses and passing
data through here so I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
