content aware move tool in Photoshop and
there are two basic options to this the
move and the extent and we're going to
talk about both of those in this video
the move allows you to select and move a
part of a picture and basically
Photoshop will recompose the image that
you move and it will also fill in the
hole that you leave behind and the nice
thing about it is you really don't have
to do a lot of complex editing this tool
is very very useful
if you're trying to do some quick moves
and altering of your images now the
other part is the extend the extend
allows you to expand objects and it
works very well against trees or
architectural objects objects such as
columns or buildings and we'll talk
about this option in a few minutes so
let's go ahead and open up an image that
we can work against and we're gonna work
against this image of this baby turtle
and what we want to do is essentially
here is select our baby turtle and then
move it to the bottom right of this
pitcher but before we do that let's go
ahead and create an empty layer because
as always we want to be non-destructive
so make sure that you have the mode set
to move make sure under the healing
brushes you have the content aware move
tool selected we're gonna leave these
options at for the color I rarely change
I almost always leave that at 4 but the
structure option you might want to play
around with a little bit and I'll
explain this basically this has to do
with the type of background that you're
working against in terms of the object
that you're moving now if you take a
look at this background this isn't very
precise so you probably could bump the
number down a little bit now if you had
a very precise background for instance
if you had a building with a lot of
sharp angles in straight lines you
wouldn't want to bump this up because
basically it will retain the pixels
almost as they are the higher you bump
this up but again we're just gonna leave
both of these options at for now since
we created a layer we want to sample
against all layers if we didn't have
this selected we would just be working
against our empty layer and we would
have really nothing to move so we want
to work against all of our layers and
that's what the sample all layers
accomplishes transform and drop I almost
always keep this selected we may talk
about this in a later video but for now
we can just keep this selected again I
rarely deselect this now with the
content aware move tool the default
selection tool that it uses is the lasso
tool right here now for objects such as
buildings you may want to use the
polygonal lasso tool
that allows you to draw straight lines
and we'll talk about this in a future
video the political Lasell tool but for
now we're just gonna go ahead and use
the default lasso tool so let's go ahead
and draw around our baby turtle and you
can just move right around the outside
of the turtle you don't have to cut this
in too closely there we go now let's go
ahead and pick up the baby turtle and
move it to the bottom right of the
photograph and then once we release the
mouse you notice we get this box here
and I'll talk about this in a few
minutes but let's go ahead and hit
accept and you'll notice now that
Photoshop filled in the hole that we
left behind and it moved our turtle now
if we go ahead and turn off the
visibility for our background layer you
can see here now we're just looking at
our empty layer and it'll actually show
you the hole that was left behind and
filled in as well as what we moved so
that's useful if you want to see the
edits that you did to your photo let's
go ahead and turn the visibility back on
and we'll now go ahead and open up a new
photo and we don't need to actually save
anything here and I'm gonna go ahead and
open up this image of the hot-air
balloon now what we want to do with this
hot-air balloon is we're gonna go ahead
and use the move option again but what
we want to do here actually is scale
down the size of this balloon and then
rotate it so let's go ahead and lasso
around our hot-air balloon and you don't
need to cut this in too closely as I
mentioned before now let's go ahead and
move it to the bottom right here right
down here and then what you see is we
get this box now if you hover over the
left corner here you're gonna get this
corner handle now if you hold down the
shift button and then start minimizing
the image it will actually retain the
aspect ratio of the balloon as we
decrease the size so let's go ahead and
hit the shift button and you can see
it's keeping the proper aspect ratio so
take a look at that so now we've reduced
the size of the image and let's move
this up a little bit
now there's another handle that we get
as well and that's the arc arrow so
let's go over here to the right and move
a little bit farther out and you'll
notice now we get this arc handle and
this allows us to rotate the balloon so
let's go ahead and rotate it a little
bit here and now let's go ahead and hit
the accept button and take a look at
that Photoshop did a great job and again
we really don't have to do a lot of
editing here with just a few simple
mouse clicks we drastically altered this
balloon okay so now let's move on and
take a look at the extend option
the second option right here so let's go
ahead and select that and actually we're
going to go ahead and open up a new
photo and as I mentioned before the
extend option works really well against
architectural objects and it works even
better when objects are not at a severe
angle and these kind of are right in
front of us and are somewhat parallel to
us now if this column was at a severe
angle the extend again doesn't work
quite as well so let's go ahead and
we're just gonna lasso right around the
edges here now I found in working with
this tool the shorter the movements the
better you don't really do long
exaggerated movements because that tends
to distort the extent so what we're
gonna do here is just move this up a
little bit we'll hit accept and take a
look at that you would be hard-pressed
to notice that we extended that column
Photoshop did a really great job so go
ahead and play around with this maybe
work against some of these other columns
so you can get a sense of how the Xtend
works okay that's going to do it for
this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
