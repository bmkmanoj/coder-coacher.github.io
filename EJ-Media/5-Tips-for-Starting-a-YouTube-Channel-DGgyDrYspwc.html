to start their YouTube channel what type
of tips can I give them so I thought I
would share some of my thoughts with you
on some of the some of the key points I
see to having a successful YouTube
channel the first one and it's a really
big one is passion you have to have
passion for the subject that you want to
cover in your YouTube video so if you
love cooking you shouldn't start a
YouTube channel on gardening you should
stick to cooking and share all of your
knowledge with that subject because if
you're passionate about it it's gonna
come across in your videos and people
are gonna notice that you have a great
amount of enthusiasm for the particular
subject so really the most important
point is be passionate about the subject
matter that really will take you a long
ways in this world the second point I
want to make and it's almost as
important as the first point is
persistence this is really huge when
you're first starting out so don't worry
necessarily about the views and how many
subscribers you have if you are
passionate about the subject material
and you make high quality videos people
will undoubtedly like your videos and
eventually you'll attract a much larger
audience and your channel will start to
grow but in the beginning you sort of
have to ignore views and subscriber
counts and I can tell you early on I
almost quit I was very close to quitting
because the channel wasn't bringing in a
lot of views and then one of my videos
started getting a lot of views and a lot
of likes and then all of a sudden all of
my playlists were being watched quite a
bit so it can also take off very quickly
the key is don't quit and that's almost
the key to any aspect in life the third
part is organization I make an extreme
effort to keep my entire youtube channel
very well organized I think about how I
want to organize the playlists I think
about how I want to organize a subject
matter what type of titles I use what
type of thumbnails I use the more
organized you are the more successful
your YouTube channel will be so this is
really another very important item to
think about people like certainty in
this world they like organization so if
your channel is disorganized people
probably aren't going to come back I can
tell you that I get a lot of compliments
from people that are very happy that I
get to the point if you linger on and
you don't get to the point you will lose
subscribers and people will tune out and
go to another video that probably hit
that back button and take the second
video
the list so it's very important that you
get to the point unless you're doing
some video log on your life one of those
V logs but other than that you want to
get to the point as soon as possible
you might have noticed that in some
videos I've noticed this before people
will say well he really got to the point
at the two-minute mark and they'll put a
link to the two-minute mark or the
3-minute mark and that really is a knock
the person who created that YouTube
content what that person is basically
saying there is hey you didn't get to
the point and the first two minutes are
pretty much irrelevant well you don't
want to be one of those people so get to
the point don't talk about things that
have nothing to do with the subject
matter very very important again to get
to the point and I probably get more
compliments on this tip than any other
tip and the fifth one and this may seem
very obvious but it really isn't you'd
be surprised
don't worry about making a video just
for the sake of making a video I keep
asking myself constantly how can I
improve what I do if you make high
quality videos you are going to be very
successful in YouTube but you don't want
to kick out a video just to keep posting
out there and actually other YouTube
creators have said well you got to keep
posting as much as possible keep posting
videos actually I think it's the
opposite I think actually you have to
worry about making high quality videos
so those are the five tips that I would
give you if you're starting out in
YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
