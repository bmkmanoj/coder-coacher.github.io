coding it's important to have a good
tool and one of the most widely used
tools is no pad plus plus it's the one I
primarily use when I'm working on code
and I've been using that throughout many
of my series now there is a plugin which
you can download which will greatly
assist you in it's one I used the most
so I thought it would let you know about
it and it's the compare plug-in so if
you want to use that go ahead and
download that now now I have put the
link to the download page in the
description of this video so if you get
that go ahead and download it and then
what you want to do is open up the zip
and then what you're gonna do is browse
to the directory
wherever notepad plus plus is installed
and it's right here and then what you do
is simply copy that DLL right here the
compare plug-in DLL into the plugins
folder right in here and you can see
I've already done that and let's go
ahead and open up notepad plus plus and
you can see here I've got two style
sheets and these are basically identical
style sheets and I removed some code
from the first style sheet so you can
see how the compare plug-in works so
basically I remove the column for class
that was in style sheet 1 but I kept it
in style sheet 2 so again you'll see how
this plug-in works so you go to plugins
you hit compare and then you hit compare
again and you can see right here it
identified that column for that is in
style sheet 2 but is not in style sheet
1 so yeah nice that is in red it
identifies hey this is the difference
between these two style sheets this
style sheet has column 4 and it's
missing in this style sheet and
basically it even tells you where it
should be in gray right here
so again if you're using notepad plus
plus and doing a lot of coding I highly
recommend that you download and use the
compare plugin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
