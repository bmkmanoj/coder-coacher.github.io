about the clear property and how to use
that as you can see here I've just
created a very simple HTML page we have
an image that we're displaying and then
I've created some text and an h2 element
which I put inside a div and I gave that
div an ID of test which we're actually
going to use to specify the clear
property and then you can see over here
I've got a style sheet and I'm just
floating our image to the left and if
you want to follow along you'll need an
image that you can use in this case I'm
using this Caesar image if you follow my
other videos you'll know that I've used
this many times so you want to copy your
image to your web folder so let's go
ahead and first load this up and there
you can see our images flow to the left
and here is our div that contains the
heading and the text and remember if you
took my CSS tutorial for beginner series
and I certainly hope you did you'll
remember that when you float an image or
an element it pins it to the left and
that basically means that this space is
essentially unused and any elements that
the browser can fit into here it will so
that's why this div is going into here
so again what if you don't want this
text here what if you wanted it below
the image you didn't want to the side
you wanted it below this floated image
that is where the clear property comes
into play so the clear property is
directly related to the float property
they go hand-in-hand
so again if you're not floating an
element whatever that element is you are
not going to use the clear property
there is no need in fact it will not
even work because basically the clear
property allows you to tell the browser
how you want to treat this unused space
do you want elements in here or do you
not if you don't want this text to wrap
around the image if you want it below
the image then you want to use the clear
property so basically again you're
specifying whether other elements will
be side by side to the floated element
or whether they will go below the
element now some people want those
elements to fill in here other people do
not they want those elements to appear
below there floated elements and again
that's where the clear property comes
into play and so let's go ahead and
specify the clear property and again I
created an ID here a test so that we can
use the clear property against this div
so let's go over to our stylesheet and
let's just copy this right here and
we'll just paste this down here
and we're just going to specify clear
and of course we're not working against
our image we're working against the div
so basically what we're saying here is
work against all floated elements that
are floated to the left and move any
elements that are right next to it below
it in this case this div so we're
basically saying here take this div and
move it below any elements that are
floated to the left of this div that's
what we're saying so let's save this and
let's go over and open up our web page
again and take a look at that it worked
basically the browser read in that clear
property and it moved this element below
our floated element which is what we
wanted now let's say this image was over
here to the right we would simply
specify right instead of left right here
but most of the time and I would say
about 95% of the time you're going to
want to use the value of both that will
basically cover any elements that are
floated to the left and the right
because chances are if you want to move
elements below a floated element on the
Left you're probably going to want to do
the same to any elements that are
floated on the right so that's usually
what you're going to specify here is
both so let's save this and just make
sure this works again and it did okay
that's going to do it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
