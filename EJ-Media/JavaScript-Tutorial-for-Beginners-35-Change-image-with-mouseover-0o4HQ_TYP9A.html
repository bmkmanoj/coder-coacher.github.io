at the onmouseover event and the
onmouseout event once again but we're
going to switch it up we're going to
actually swap pictures when the user
hovers over a picture and that's
actually one of the most common uses for
the onmouseover and onmouseout event
that's one of the most common uses
you've probably been to a website where
when you hover it over a particular
image another image was swapped out in
its place so it's kind of a neat effect
now I'm going to use the same images
that I used from a couple of videos ago
I'm going to use this Lenin image and
the Stalin image but you can use
whatever images you want you just need
two images and they need to be in our
folder the same folder as our JavaScript
file and our web page so here's our IMG
element and of course this is the source
attribute which points to the stalin
image and this will be the first image
that gets loaded on our web page and
we're going to create an idea of image
because we want to use our get element
by ID to get this and then we're going
to use the same two events we did from
the last video the onmouseover and the
on mouse out and I've created two
functions one for the new picture and
one for the old picture the new picture
which will be of course Lenin will get
triggered when the user Mouse's over
Stalin and then when they mouse off of
the new picture the old picture will be
loaded with the onmouseout event so
let's first create our new picture
function so we'll go right here of
course we need the function keyword and
we just put in new picture and of course
it is case sensitive and then of course
we need to specify our document object
and then of course our get element by ID
method and then of course we need to
grab the ID which in this case of course
is image and then you will remember we
need to use the source property that we
get from our document object and you
will remember that is dot SRC and that
of course relates to the source
attribute in the HTML element so that's
what we're altering and then of course
we want this new picture to be Lenon so
we will specify the lennon dot jpg and
we'll close it out good and whoops okay
let's fix that okay so that looks good
now if
course we need a function for old
picture and we can just copy and paste
all of this and we'll go over here and
we'll switch this to old picture and of
course we want the old picture to return
back to Stalin so we'll just switch this
to Stalin and then we'll save everything
up here and we'll just go ahead and load
this up and now it's over over Stalin
and hopefully we get Lenin and we did
and now if we mouse off of Lenin we
should get styling back and we did and
again this is one of the main reasons
that the onmouseover event is used to
swap images just like this okay that is
going to do it for this video I will see
you guys in the next video where we will
introduce a new event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
