channel out there in all these great
videos and no one is watching well don't
get frustrated because this is more of a
discovery problem than a Content problem
so how can you get your channel
jump-started how can you get more
subscribers and higher view counts well
let me give you a real world example of
one of my channels my history den
channel quite a while ago was sort of
lingering around 300 subscribers and so
I wanted to jump start it and so what I
did was I went out to message boards and
started posting links to my videos in my
channel engaging with people and in just
one week I was able to double my
subscriber count from 300 subscribers to
600 subscribers so message boards are
your best friend that's really a good
way to engage people and put out some
free advertising to your channel now
another way is to do it the
old-fashioned way and that is make
bumper stickers hats and t-shirts for
your YouTube channel
and I made actually a bumper sticker for
my history done YouTube channel and you
would be surprised how many people you
pass on the road each day thousands and
thousands of potential subscribers that
might have an interest in what you are
doing on YouTube and several people have
emailed me and told me that they
subscribe to my channel because they saw
that bumper sticker and several times
when I parked in a commercial parking
lot and was coming back to my car people
would stop me and go hey what's that
channel all about I'm very interested in
history so bumper stickers hats and
t-shirts are a great way to get your
channel noticed another thing you can
use is Google Adwords if you have a
small budget you can get thousands of
views and so Google AdWords is really
becoming the default online advertising
service of choice you can use this to
get noticed very quickly I do recommend
that you watch some tutorials on YouTube
on how to use AdWords before you go
ahead and create your campaign probably
the single most important tip I can give
you is you have to determine where the
demand is you need to determine where is
the demand for a particular topic what
videos are getting the highest view
counts and you can actually do a little
bit of research for instance let's say
you were starting a channel on gardening
and you had two topics you wanted to
cover planting flowers and planting
trees so you go out to YouTube and you
do a search on planting flowers and
those have millions of hits then you go
out and do a search on planting trees
and you notice those only have a few
thousand views well you probably want to
start with planting flowers because
those are generating all the interest
and as a result you're probably going to
get higher subscriber counts and higher
view counts so that's one way you can do
a little research yourself before you
even start your channel another way is
to examine your existing videos and see
which ones are the most popular and I
can give you a real world example of
this on my History den channel I have
about 8 or 9 playlists and I noticed
after about six months that two of the
playlists were generating all the views
that is the playlist on ancient Greece
and the playlist on ancient Rome and so
as a result I spend most of my energy on
those two playlists about 80% of my
efforts because you want to go where the
demand is determine where the demand is
and your channel will be much more
successful respond to subscribers this
is a big one that doesn't get emphasized
enough but you really want to make a
concerted effort to respond to your
subscribers if you do they're gonna like
your channel even more they're gonna
feel like they're engaged with the
channel and they're probably gonna stay
around because subscribers are really
the key to your channel success because
they are sort of the first line of
defense or the first line of offense if
you want to think of it in that manner
because every new video that you post
will be first watched by them so that's
how your video is gonna get ranked
faster by having all those subscribers
watch your video when it is initially
released so those are the five tips that
I would give you for growing your
YouTube channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
