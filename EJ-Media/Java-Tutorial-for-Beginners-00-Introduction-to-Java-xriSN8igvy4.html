beginning Java so if this is your first
time coding you've come to a good place
I put together a series of videos that
will hopefully explain everything you
want to learn about Java from beginning
to end now a couple things I want to
talk to you about before we get going in
the next video this is what you call
source code everything that we type in
here will be source code and while we're
creating our source code it goes through
what's called the compiler now the
compilers main job is to check for
errors and while we're typing things in
the compiler will actually check for
errors you can see there we got an error
can't find this and so that will help us
out too now once the compiler is done
checking for errors and you compile your
program the compiler creates a new
document and that's called Java bytecode
and Java bytecode is essentially the
output document and so what happens is
the java virtual machine which actually
resides on several devices like
computers mobile phones
it's the java virtual machine that takes
that bytecode document and reads and
runs it and that's short for JVM by the
way java virtual machine
so the java virtual machine reads and
runs the bytecode document and any
compiled Java bytecode is considered
platform-independent that's because the
java virtual machine can run on almost
any type of device so what's nice about
that is if you create some code for a
computer application it could also be
run on other devices such as a mobile
app as well so that's something that's
really nice about Java
it's platform-independent now there are
a couple of points I'd like to make
first is don't worry necessarily about
the JDK version you're using so much for
these videos they will support any JDK
that you're on and the current JDK I
always make sure that the code used in
these videos works on the very current
version of JDK and if it doesn't I'll
actually re-edit the video so whatever
the current JDK is you can just download
that and I'll show you how to do that in
the next video what software you need to
use and what software you need to
download the other thing is I'm going to
be using NetBeans but you can also
follow these videos with Eclipse or
notepad plus plus it doesn't matter this
is Java and it works on both of those
IDs as well the other point I'd like to
make is
patient you're not going to learn
everything in the first couple videos so
you just have to be patient
go slowly go through each video and
understand the concepts and eventually
it'll all start coming together okay
that's going to do it for this
introductory video we will get going in
the next video where you will create
your first program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
