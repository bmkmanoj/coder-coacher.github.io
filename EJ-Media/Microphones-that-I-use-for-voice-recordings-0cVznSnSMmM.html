microphones I use when I actually record
these videos and there are two
microphones that I primarily use that is
the blue snowball and the Yeti and I'm
going to talk about both of these
microphones in this video and also I
will put the links to these microphones
in the description of this video in case
you're interested in buying one of these
microphones now the first one I'm going
to talk about is the blue snowball and
that's the one I'm talking into right
now now this is probably one of the best
microphones that you can get for under
$100 and it really really offers a lot
of bang for the buck a lot of full range
quality that you would expect from
perhaps a much more expensive microphone
and the nice thing about it is its
plug-and-play
you can literally just plug this right
into your USB port on your computer and
it's good to go now the other microphone
that I use is the Yeti now like the
snowball the Yeti is also another plug
and play USB microphone you can plug
this right in and you're good to go you
can start doing voice recordings and
again this is solidly constructed like
the snowball now this is a little bit
more expensive I paid a hundred and
twenty dollars for mine I think for the
snowball I paid around seventy dollars
something like that but it does offer a
very very important feature and that is
if you live in a noisy house or a noisy
apartment you probably will want to go
with the Yeti because it has the ability
to filter out background noise whereas
the snowball will pick up pretty much
any noise that comes in so again if you
live near an airport or some very noisy
area you'll probably want to go with the
Yeti and the sound recording quality on
the Yeti is excellent in fact the
quality is excellent on both microphones
and again they both are plug and play so
again these are the two microphones that
I use and again I've put the links to
these products in the description of
this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
