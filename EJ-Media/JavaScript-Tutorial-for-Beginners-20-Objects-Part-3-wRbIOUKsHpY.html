objects now in the last two videos we've
explored the concept of an object in
this video we're actually going to
execute some code now we're going to use
the same orc object that we've been
talking about and we're going to create
three properties the first is we're
going to make the orcs hair green his
age is going to be 26 and his stomach
right now is full so those are the three
properties that we're dealing with and
we'll insert a function in a little bit
but first we want to write out one of
these properties so this is a rather
simple procedure
so we'll do a document that write and as
we always have to do we always specify
the object name and then the property
that we want to print out in this case
we want to print out the age so that's
what we'll do now and we'll run this in
chrome and we get an age of 26
but properties in an object rarely stay
the same and in a program you will be
constantly changing some of the values
of these properties and so that's what
we're going to do now so one way we can
do that is to create a new variable so
we're going to create a new variable
called new age and so we're going to
reference the current property which of
course is 26 and again we do that
through object name and the property and
we're going to add 2 to that so we
should get 28 so we've got this new
variable that we've defined to create a
new age for our orc and then down here
of course now we just need to specify
our new variable that's holding our new
age and so let's do that and we'll run
this and we should get 28 and we do so
again the point I want to make about
objects is that the is that some of
these values will constantly be changing
depending on the circumstance so again
that's one way you can change the value
now we don't have to create a new
variable to alter the value we can just
alter the property itself directly by
specifying orc age and then setting it
to 28 and again that would directly
update the property within the object
but a lot of times you actually will be
creating new variables to hold
particular values or to do different
things now let's add a behavior to our
orc and what we want to add is eating
and you'll remember it's called a method
once we're inside the object so this is
a method now even though it
as a function and we're just going to
write out yum-yum so let's get rid of
all of this and whoops I forgot the
closing bracket for the function there
we go and now you can see how those turn
to read now to call the method of course
we need the object name dot and then we
specify of course our function and so
let's go ahead and run this and we
should get this text yom-yom and we do
so now let's go ahead and work against
our stomach-full property that we set up
here inside of our object and I'm going
to go ahead and copy and paste some code
in here so we're going to set up a
little if statement so what we're going
to do is first specify the course the
object dot property in this case which
of course is stomach-full
and we're saying if this is equal to
true then go ahead and execute our eat
method and remember this is a logical
operator we're not setting this to true
so we're just saying if this condition
is true then go ahead and execute our
eat method so let's go ahead and do that
and we get yum yum so the orc was able
to eat now what if we want to set this
to false what if this actually was false
and again we can switch the value of the
stomach-full property so again we
specify the object name dot property and
just set it to false and so now this
isn't true but we need to set up an else
condition so that we can print out
another statement because we know now
that this condition will actually test
out to be false so let's put an else
right below that and now since this
condition will turn out to be false it
will go down to our else statement and
it will do a document that write that
the orc is not going to eat so let's go
ahead and run this and we got the
expected result not eating so you can
see the whole point of this particular
lesson is we can constantly change the
values of the properties within our
object and so it is a dynamic object in
every sense now up to this point we have
been talking about custom objects
objects that we have created but Java
Script provides numerous objects that we
can already use that are already
predefined for us and so we can use
those objects methods and properties and
so we're going to talk about that in the
next video see you guys in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
