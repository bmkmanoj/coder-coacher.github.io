at the sortable widget in the jQuery UI
and of course in the last video we took
a look at the draggable widget and
actually they're very similar the only
difference is with the sortable widget
we're just sort of rearranging the order
of the elements with draggable we can
drag them wherever we want with the
sortable widget again we're just
rearranging the elements in a particular
order and with that they actually have
to be within the same section and that's
why we can put all of our images in one
div we only want them in one section
because again we're just rearranging the
elements we're not treating these as
individual sections anymore because we
can't drag these wherever we want that's
why we put a div around each image when
we use the draggable widget but again we
don't need a div around each image now
because again they all need to be in the
same section because again we're just
rearranging the order that's what the
sortable widget does so let's go ahead
and we're just gonna remove these divs
let's go ahead we can keep this div but
let's go ahead and get rid of this one
we don't need this anymore we don't need
this anymore or this one or this one but
we'll keep this top-level div here
because this is the div that will
contain all of our elements in this case
they are images and I guess we can keep
the class name draggable that doesn't
really matter let's flip over to our
stylesheet we don't need this rule
anymore so we can go ahead and get rid
of that because now the images will be
inline right by default they're in line
because these are no longer contained in
their own div sections so they should
automatically display as inline so we
should still get that gallery view so
now that we've got that let's go ahead
and we'll just call the sortable
function to use the sortable widget
and let's expand this out so let's go
ahead and see if this works and you can
see right here look I can rearrange the
order of these images now in any way
that I want and that's the difference
again between the drag alone the sort of
a widget I can't drag these now to
individual areas within our content pane
it just allows us to sort the images in
any way we see fit okay that was just a
quick little video on the sort of a
widget it's very easy to use as you can
see in the next video we will take a
look at the options that you can use
with the sortable widget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
