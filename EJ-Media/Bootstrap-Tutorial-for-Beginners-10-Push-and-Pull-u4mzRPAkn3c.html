pushing and pulling columns in bootstrap
and this is sort of useful if you want
to be more and more responsive with your
website and this has to do with multiple
devices now this will be apparent in a
few minutes now to make this example
more real-world I've moved our main
column to the first position so this
should appear on the left and our
sidebar will now appear in the center so
let's go ahead and launch this in chrome
and let's see what we get and that's
exactly what we wanted so our main
column now is on the left and our
sidebar is now in the center now let's
go ahead and minimize this and let's see
what this looks like on small devices
and that's exactly what we wanted now
the reason a lot of people do this is
they want their main content on small
devices to appear first that's usually
good operating procedure to put your
main column at the very beginning
because as you know this is a small
device and you want that content right
at the top and then all the rest of the
smaller content can go on the bottom but
of course if your user is on the desktop
it is standard operating procedure to
put the main column in the center so how
do we get the best of both worlds
how do we get this main column appear in
the center now if we move it back that
will drop the main column down on small
devices so that's where pushing and
pulling comes to the rescue and what we
can do is push this column to the right
and that's what pushing means it means
pushing to the right and then we can
pull this column back to the left so
once again pushing pushes it to the
right and pulling pulls it to the left
so let's go ahead and do that so we're
first going to go right here and we're
gonna type in call - MD - and here is
where we use the keyword push because
remember we want to push our main column
to the right and we're gonna push it
three columns and that's what this means
we're gonna push this three columns to
the right and we're only going to be
doing this on medium sized devices and
larger so the large and medium sized
devices will only push this column this
will not occur on small devices because
remember we want our main column to
appear first on small devices such as
cell phones so that's what we use now if
you're going to push you also have to
pull the other column otherwise you're
going to get some weird results so
that's what we need to do we need to now
pull this column to the left and all we
do here is switch this to the keyword
pull but we have to pull this six
columns because remember this is six
columns away because this large column
here our MD six column is in the left
position so we need to pull this back
six and we need to push this three now
you may get confused by this but really
what we're doing is we're just swapping
right we're swapping columns and if
you're not sure about the size I have
this little trick I use you'll notice
here that this is MD six well you want
to match it down here so this column
needs to be pulled back six spaces and
you'll notice that we determined three
columns here because this is three
columns in size so we only need to push
this three so you notice this kind of
diagonal little relationship this is six
and six and this is three and three so
that's kind of a good way you can
actually calculate how far you have to
pull or push you can just kind of use
that little magic that I just did so
let's go ahead and save this and let's
go ahead and load up our page and take a
look at that that worked perfectly it
pushed our main column to the right and
we pushed our left column to the left so
everything looks great on the
medium-sized device now what we need to
make sure is that this didn't take
effect on the smaller devices so let's
minimize this and take a look at that we
get exactly what we needed we wanted our
main column to appear first on cell
phones and small devices so that's how
pushing and pulling works and remember
it starts right here we said hey push
this only on medium-sized devices and
bigger and same thing for the pull so
again that's how pushing and pulling
works and it's very useful if you want
to have a very responsive web page and
you want to reorder your columns
depending on the device that is being
used for your web site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
