from scratches to blemishes and even
particular objects or people that you
want to remove out of your photographs
so Photoshop will assist you in all
these healing tools to correct a lot of
these types of issues
now the first type of tool that we're
gonna look at in this video is the Spot
Healing Brush now the Spot Healing Brush
is completely automated meaning it will
choose the areas to blend in and it is
also your first line of defense if you
have a very simple fix
then the Spot Healing Brush will work
wonders it really does it can fix
something very quickly if you're
targeting very easy blemishes or spots
that you want to fix now if you have a
more complicated healing area you're
going to need to use a different type of
brush and we'll get to those in the next
several videos okay so as you can see
here we have this photo of this 18th
century painting of this Chinese emperor
and as you can see here we have a few
blemishes that we can attempt to fix now
to select the healing tools you can use
the keyboard shortcut J and that will
automatically select the healing tools
now if you right click over here you can
see that we have five types and again
we're gonna cover this first type right
here the Spot Healing Brush tool now the
Spot Healing Brush has three different
main options that we're going to cover
in this video
content-aware create texture and
proximity match don't worry about the
mode for now I almost always use normal
this covers about 95% of the types of
problems that you'll need to fix so we
want to keep this at normal now if you
want to change the size of your brush
you can just go right here and you can
select a size don't worry about these
other options we'll cover these in
future videos but for now if you want to
alter the size of your brush you can do
it right here
so the first type of option we're going
to cover is the proximity match now the
proximity match works just as it states
it's basically going to take the
surrounding pixels around the area that
you target to heal it will take those
surrounding pixels and use those as the
sample and again it does it
automatically so for instance when we
come down here and paint over this it's
going to take these surrounding pixels
and use these to replace the targeted
area so the proximity match is really
your first line of defense this is the
first option you want to try if you have
a relatively easy fix and it works very
well if you have a very consistent
background in other words pixels that
are very similar that surround your
target area and as you can see we have
this beige color so this is probably
gonna work very well so let's go ahead
and paint over this now and then let's
see what happens and take a look at that
that worked perfectly so again the
proximity match works very well if you
have a very consistent background where
it does not work well is if you have a
lot of variance so if we moved over the
face here and tried it watch what
happens when we try to remove this line
or wrinkle here let's go ahead and try
this and you'll see what happens and
take a look at that that is very
distorted and remember the reason is
it's gonna try to take the surrounding
pixels and use that as the sample so
it's actually working as designed but
it's just not the right option for what
we're trying to do here so let's go
ahead and step backward and now let's
switch over to create texture now create
texture works a little bit differently
it is actually only going to use the
pixels inside the area you target that's
the key difference it's not going to go
outside it's actually just going to use
the pixels inside the target area as its
sampled so let's go ahead and try this
again now with this option and you can
see that worked a lot better so again if
you have a little bit of variance that
create texture is probably your better
option now if you have a lot of variants
the option you want to use is
content-aware and let's say we wanted to
remove part of this beard right here and
you can see this is very complicated we
have these lines and we have a lot of
variants here so let's say we just
wanted to remove part of this so let's
go ahead and just sort of select some of
this and you can see that did a pretty
good job look at that so again you want
to use content where if you have a lot
of variants in your background now there
are a couple of points I want to make
before we close out this lecture first
as I said the Spot Healing tool is
pretty much automated in terms of the
sample that's being used you do not
select the sample the algorithm does and
what does that mean well a lot of times
you might find that the spot healer
doesn't work and so the best thing to do
is just simply to step backward and try
to paint over it again and sometimes
you'll get it where it's perfect now
that's a very complicated fix then you
have to move on to some of these other
tools which we're going to talk about in
the next several videos now let's switch
back to the proximity match here I want
to show you
one more thing there's this diffusion
option over here and basically the way
this works is the lower the number
you're going to use with grainier images
the higher the number is worked with
smoother images so that's basically the
way that works and the default is 5 as
you can see and I want to make one final
point before we go and that is you
always want to create an empty layer
when you start healing your photographs
we didn't do it in this tutorial because
this is just a tutorial but if you're
gonna go ahead and start fixing things
it's best to go ahead and create an
empty layer and then go ahead and start
healing that way you can always just
delete the layer and start over and not
have to worry about stepping backward ok
that's going to do it for this video in
the next video we will take a look at
the Healing Brush tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
