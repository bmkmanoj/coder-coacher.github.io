the soup and sub elements in HTML the
soup element stands for superscript and
the sub element stands for subscript the
soup element allows you to display text
above the main body of text and you can
see an example how that works in normal
typography these characters right here
are above the main body of text now
subscript is the exact opposite we place
the text below the main text okay so
let's go ahead and use these two
elements in our HTML page so what we
want to do first is raise the Ardi here
for August 23rd we want to put this Rd
above the 23 and that's something you'll
see in normal typography so first let's
go ahead and put in the opening tag of
the soup element so we'll just put su P
here and then we'll go ahead and close
it out and let's go ahead and save this
will refresh our page and there you can
see the Rd now is above the main body of
text which is what we want it now let's
take a look at this second paragraph now
usually in terms of chemical notation
for h2o the two is usually below the h
and the up so what we want to do is
actually put this below the H and we do
that of course with the sub element so
let's go ahead and put that in here and
we'll go ahead and close it out now
let's go ahead and save this let's
refresh our page and there you can see
this looks more accurate on our HTML
page now looks like an actual chemical
notation so these aren't widely used
elements but they're good to know it it
can add a little bit more
professionalism and pizzazz to your web
page okay that's going to do it for this
video see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
