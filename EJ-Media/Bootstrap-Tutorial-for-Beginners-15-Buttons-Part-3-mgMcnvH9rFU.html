at how to create toolbars in bootstrap
now in the last video of course we
created these button groups and
basically what a toolbar is that it
allows you to combine multiple groups
together into one unified toolbar so
again that is what we're going to do in
this video so let's go ahead and we're
going to go ahead and take this group
right here that we created in the last
video we're just going to copy this
we're going to go down here and we're
going to go ahead and paste that right
here and so this will be our first
button group then what we're going to do
is all of our buttons are actually going
to be primary buttons and this works
better if you have a bunch of buttons
that are similar in this case we're just
going to number the buttons and you'll
see how this looks in the end so we're
going to make these all primary buttons
and then what we're going to do is we're
just going to call this one the first
one and we're going to call this one two
and we're going to call this one three
and for good measure let's add two more
buttons to our toolbar and those will be
four and five so let's just go ahead and
copy and paste this here and then we'll
add these other numbers good now what we
want to do is take this remember I said
you're actually combining multiple
groups to create your toolbar so we're
going to create a second group here so
we'll copy and paste the one we just did
and let's just copy and paste this right
below so there we go now let's go ahead
and we'll call this button six because
remember this is all part of the same
toolbar this will be seven this will be
eight and this will be nine let's not
worry about a tenth button we'll just go
with nine buttons that's good there we
go so now we've got our two groups right
there now what we need to do is unify
all these into our toolbar and so what
we're going to do is create another div
to wrap both of these groups inside that
div so let's go ahead and do that and of
course we just specify div here and the
class that we're going to call is
another bootstrap class and you won't be
surprised by what the name is it is the
toolbar class and so we just specify BTN
- toolbar that's what we do and so there
we go we've got our toolbar class now in
this case we set the role to toolbar you
remember in the button groups
that's a group but in this case we'll
set the role now to toolbar to identify
this as a toolbar there we go now let's
go ahead and we're going to give this an
ID because we want to create some margin
for this because we've been doing that
in the previous videos we've been given
everything a margin of five pixels so
we'll give our toolbar also a margin of
five pixels and we're just going to give
this an ID and let's just call this test
one there we go and then let's go ahead
and close our div out down here and now
we've got both of our groups now wrapped
with inside of our toolbar and this
should create a nice toolbar effect but
before we do that let's go over to our
style sheet and let's go ahead and add
that ID that we created just copy and
paste this div one here and we're just
going to say pound test one for the ID
that we created good all right so let's
save this and let's go back to our HTML
document let's save that and let's go
ahead now and open this up in chrome and
see what we get there you can see we've
got this nice toolbar take a look at how
nice that looks and again this works
well if you're using very similar
buttons as you can see here so again
this is how you can combine multiple
button groups into one toolbar okay
we'll move on to drop-down menus in the
next lecture see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
