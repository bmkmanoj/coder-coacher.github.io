discussion about options in the
accordion widget we last left off with
the active property now I want to make a
very important point about how the
sizing of panels works in the accordion
widget the way it works is that the
default panel that we set will size
according to the amount of content that
we have in that default panel so if you
take a look here we of course with the
active property set the second panel as
the default panel and the size of the
panel was adjusted perfectly to the
content now the way this works is the
size of the default panel will be the
size for all of the rest of the panels
that is the size of the content area for
the second panel is applied to the first
and third panels so if we take a look at
this first panel that is why we need a
scroll bar the first panel size is taken
from the second panel which of course is
now the default panel now if you
remember in the last video when the
first panel was the default panel the
content was sized appropriately and we
didn't even need a scroll bar but now
since this first panels content area is
based off the second panels content area
that is why the jQuery UI needs to put
in the scroll bar now let's go ahead and
switch the default back to the first
panel and in this case it would be zero
and I want you to pay attention to what
happens here keep an eye on the first
and second panel and now take a look at
the first panel now since the first
panel is the default panel the content
is now sized appropriately and let's
take a look at the second panel now take
a look at that we now have more space
because the second panel is now based
off the size of the content area in the
first panel okay and let's go ahead and
make the second panel the default again
let's go ahead and save this we'll hit
refresh
and there you can see it's now sized
appropriately we got rid of that extra
space but now our first panel is smaller
and we need the scroll bar now what if
you want each panel on an individual
basis to size according to the amount of
content it contains that is really all
the panels are on their own they're not
based off the default panel they get the
size of
appropriately - how much content is in
the panel and that is where the height
style property really helps so let's go
ahead and add that property and we're
gonna keep our active property so we can
keep this second panel as the default so
let's go ahead and we'll just copy and
paste this actually and remember to add
multiple properties we just need a comma
after the first property and then the
property we use is height style and the
value we want to set that to is content
and that means each panel again like I
said is on its own it'll size
appropriately to how much content is in
that panel and there is the value
content so keep an eye on all the panels
now so let's save this let's refresh our
page now of course the default panel as
we know will size appropriately but
let's take a look at the first panel
take a look at that that now sizes
appropriately so that's how the height
style property works
okay thanks as always for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
