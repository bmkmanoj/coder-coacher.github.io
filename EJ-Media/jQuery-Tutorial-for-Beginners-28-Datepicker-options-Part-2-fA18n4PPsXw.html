left off in the last video and we were
discussing the options that you can use
with the date picker widget and one
thing you may want to do is you may not
want to allow your users to go as far
back as they want in the past obviously
we don't want them moving back to Roman
times so you can prevent that by using
the minimum date property and you can
see that's what we put here just min
date remember it's case sensitive so you
need a capital D here then we use the
new date that we want to specify by
using the new keyword and actually this
is the format that we have to use we put
the Year first then the month and then
the day and and it has to go inside
parentheses now you may think that this
actually equates to November it actually
does not because as we know most
computers start with 0 so this 11
actually equates to December and 10
would equate to November and so on and
so on so hopefully now this will prevent
the user from going any further back
then December 25th 2014 so let's go
ahead and refresh our page and let's
start moving back in time and look we
can go back no further we can only
select December 25th which is what we
want it now if you want to do the
opposite of this you can as well you
just use the max date property so let's
go ahead and just switch this to max and
let's actually put this way out in the
future we'll say 2019 so let's go ahead
and save this will refresh our page and
let's start moving ahead and hopefully
it stops us in 2019 December 2019 and it
did so everything is working perfectly
now we can also add a nice button panel
to the bottom of the calendar and the
property is the show button panel which
is right here and we just set that to
true so let's go ahead and refresh our
page and there you can see we've got
these nice buttons now now what if you
want to alter the text of these well
let's go ahead and alter the text of the
done button so the property we use for
that is close text and then we just put
the text that we want for that button
and let's just do something like close
count
so we'll see what we get here and there
you can see we've got our own customized
text now you can also change the text
for the today button and the property
for that is current text and we'll
change the text to something more
relevant and whoops guy get rid of this
okay so let's go ahead and see what we
get here and there you can see we change
the text of the first button so that's
how that works now what if you wanted to
add a suffix on to here for instance
maybe you wanted to add C E or you can
add B C let's add B C actually so to do
that we add the years suffix property
which is right here and then we can go
ahead and add a suffix and we do that in
quotes again now you'll want to put a
space here because if we don't it'll
appear right next to the six and we
don't want that and let's just put in BC
here so maybe you were making a calendar
that people could go back in time to
select an event in ancient times so
let's go ahead and see what we get and
there you can see we've got our suffix
and you can put any type of suffix you
want you could make this PC ECE AD
whatever you want okay that's going to
do it for this video in the next video
we'll take a look at the tooltip widget
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
