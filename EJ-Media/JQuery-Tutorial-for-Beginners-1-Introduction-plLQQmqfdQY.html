jQuery in this video we're going to talk
about what jQuery is why we use it and
we'll talk about some basic syntax and
then in the next video we'll talk about
downloading jQuery and create some of
our very first jQuery code now the first
thing you will need to know for this
series is beginning JavaScript because
jQuery is JavaScript if you look in the
jQuery library it's all JavaScript
behind the scenes so you will need to
know beginning JavaScript if you do not
know beginning JavaScript I suggest you
go to my main channel page and there is
a tutorial on beginning JavaScript
so again jQuery is JavaScript but it's
actually a framework or library of
JavaScript common JavaScript code that
you can reuse and reuse again and the
good news is it's all free that's right
jQuery is an open source library that
also means anybody can contribute to
jQuery so that's actually good because
if someone creates a really cool feature
they can go ahead and add it to the
library so that you can use it the other
point I want to make about jQuery is
it's easy to use you use less lines of
jQuery than you do ordinary JavaScript
so again everything that you do in
JavaScript you can do in jQuery jQuery
is also feature-rich you can build
websites using jQuery so there is a lot
of functionality that you can use and
there's also a lot of cool effects that
you can do you can do animation you can
do sliding fading hiding and all sorts
of complex event handling and we'll go
through all of that in this series
another nice item about jQuery is cross
browser compatibility you do not have to
worry about which browser version you're
coding for one line of jQuery will be
compatible on all the different types of
browsers now jQuery uses CSS selector
methodology and isn't that great CSS in
my opinion is one of the best designed
languages and so they basically took one
of the best parts of CSS and implemented
that into jQuery so selecting Dom
elements is much easier in jQuery and
that also means if you already know CSS
it will be very easy for you to start
picking up
because it uses that CSS selector
methodology so if you take a look at
this basics index right here this is
some of the most basic syntax you can
get for jQuery it always starts with a
dollar sign and that actually represents
the jQuery library and then we have open
parentheses and then you just put the
selector in quotes and that's it that's
all it takes to select a Dom element so
jQuery is really really easy for
selecting Dom elements and you can see
here we can use a class selector we can
use an ID selector a type selector a
descendant selector and many other
different types of selectors so that's
one of the reasons that jQuery is so
popular it's a lot easier to select
elements we don't have to use the get
element by ID
you took my JavaScript series you'll
remember that one very well that's done
for us in the background when we use the
ID selector so that's really a nice nice
thing about jQuery okay so in the next
video we're going to get started with
our first jQuery code and I will also
show you where to download the jQuery
library see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
