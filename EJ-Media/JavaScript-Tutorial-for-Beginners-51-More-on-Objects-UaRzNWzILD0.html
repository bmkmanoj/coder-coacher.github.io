in this entire series and in this video
I'm going to talk about object classes
and why you would use them now at the
most basic level everything in
JavaScript is pretty much an object even
the most simple variable even a variable
with a single value that is in fact an
object you will remember that we put a
dot after this and you could actually
access some system properties but in
reality when we think of objects we
think of more complex objects objects
that have multiple values and here we're
defining a variable that has three
different name value pairs and you will
remember that we talked about those
several videos ago now here is why I'm
doing this lecture because what if you
want to create many objects off the same
generic object that is you have a bunch
of code that you want to reuse again and
again this is where a class comes into
play and you want to think of a class as
a template it's a piece of code that
you're going to be reusing over and over
and over again so to set up an object
class we make it a function and then we
define the name of that function and
then we put in the different properties
that we want to pass in in this case we
want to pass in the type the color in
the miles is the same thing that we're
doing up here only down here we're not
giving this values and that's the whole
point of a class you don't want to
define values because that you want them
to be specific
when you create your new object and then
we use the this keyword and all this is
is a placeholder for each object that we
build and you know what actually I
didn't want this comment down here I
wanted to end it right here so again we
use this keyword that is basically a
placeholder for the object that we're
going to build off of our generic object
or our class and here is where we create
our object right down here and it all
starts with the new keyword basically
you're telling JavaScript hey I want to
build a new object based off a class in
this case it's our car class which
JavaScript will find right here so we're
saying hey there will be a new object
based off of this code and then pass in
these three values and these correspond
of course to our placeholders up here so
our type of car is in the first slot the
color is in the second slot and the
number of miles is in the third slot so
all of the
these get passed into our function and
are built into our new car one object
that is based off of this template so
you can see how useful this is you don't
have to retype all this code out you can
just simply pass in the values that you
need and the object will be built based
off of our class so that's why this is
very very useful and then we can create
as many different objects as we want and
we may have a truck that we need we may
have an SUV that we need we can go ahead
now and create as many different objects
that will have unique characteristics
and that's really the fundamental reason
why you want to use objects because you
can make things unique that's the power
of classes now of course we need to
actually execute some code here so if we
go back to our index.html you you can
see we're going to go ahead and call our
change style function which we've put
right here we've done this before and
we're just going to use the get element
by ID method and we're going to use the
inner HTML property to go ahead and
place all of this text on our page when
we hit our button and what we're going
to do now of course is call the object
that we created up here that's it so
we're going to go ahead and actually we
can't use car we didn't create a car
object we created a car one you could
also use the car two you could use the
car three whatever you want to do but in
this case we're going to call the car
one and you'll remember this is what
we've done many times right we use the
dot to access the property in this case
it's the type of car for this one it's
of course miles and for here it is the
color and then you can see we're just
adding on some text to the property so
this should all work very nicely so
let's go ahead and save this let's go
ahead now and run this and let's see
what we get and if we hit our button
look it worked we got our type of car we
got the amount of miles and we got the
color of the car everything worked fine
so that's how classes work in JavaScript
they are very very powerful and very
useful okay I will see you guys in the
next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
