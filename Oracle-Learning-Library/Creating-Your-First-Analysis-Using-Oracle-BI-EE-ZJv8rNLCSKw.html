Oracle bi I'm a sales manager and I need
to create a new analysis for my sales
team the sales team needs to know how
much revenue is being generated for our
brands I click create an analysis I need
to find and add the correct columns for
the analysis I want to add region brand
line of business and revenue in the
sample app subject area in the subject
areas pane I expand the geography folder
I drag region to the selected columns
area I expand the products folder
and then I double-click brand to add it
to the selected columns area
i double-click line-of-business as well
i expand the revenue metrics folder and
double-click revenue i just realized
that it would be more effective to
include products in the analysis as well
I double click product in the products
folder I want to sort this analysis by
region and then by line-of-business I
click the options button for region and
then I select sort and sort ascending I
noticed the upward pointing arrow added
to region this indicates that region
will be sorted in ascending sequence I
click the options button for
line-of-business and then I select sort
and a descending sort I noticed that
both sorts have been annotated with
numbers 1 &amp;amp; 2 respectively indicating
the sorting preference next I want to
add a filter to revenue to limit the
results of my analysis to only the top
10 products by revenue I click the
options button for revenue and then I
select filter
in the new filter dialog I select is in
top as the operator because I want the
top 10
I accept 10 as the default value I click
OK the new filter is added to the
filters pane I want to add a second
filter that will limit the results of
the analysis to the Americas and amia
regions these are the regions of
responsibility for my team I click the
options button for region and then I
select filter in the new filter dialog I
accept the default value for operator is
equal to is in I select the list for
value and click the checkboxes for
Americas and amia I click OK
the new filter is added to the filters
pane I click the results tab to see my
analysis I decide that I want to see
this analysis sorted by the highest
revenue products first I know that a
sort added in the results tab overrides
the sort from the criteria tab I can use
the caret icons on the revenue label to
change the sort sequence or I can right
click the revenue label and select the
sort column sort descending sequence
option I right click the revenue column
label and select sort column I note that
I can use this option to clear the sorts
as well I select sort descending the
analysis is sorted by revenue and
descending sequence I want to add
another view to help my team better
visualize this information I select the
new View button on the toolbar I know
that best visualization automatically
recommends the best view based on the
data in the analysis it gathers
information about my dimensions and so
on and then determines the optimal
layout to present
I select best visualization
a vertical bar chart is added to my
analysis I know that the bar chart will
help me better visualize the product
revenue between regions for the brands
and lines of business I want to save my
analysis I click the save as button I
ensure that the analysis is saved in the
default company shared revenue folder in
the name field I enter top 10 products
and then I click OK now that I've
created this new analysis top 10
products I can share it with my team
from this analysis they can see the most
successful top 10 products for their
regions the most successful region is
America's pocket fun es for the fun pod
and is the most successful overall in
the games line of business this analysis
will allow us to collaborate and develop
a strategy to increase revenue for less
successful products thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
