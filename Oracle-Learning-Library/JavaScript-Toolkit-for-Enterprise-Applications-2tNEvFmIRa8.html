welcome today about JavaScript for
enterprise applications my name is
Andrea and I'm working as Itre tech
developer and enabling teams for modern
technologies and yes keeping up with the
recent activities and the development
space and I want to thank Janos who
helped to do most of the coding samples
so I'm going to guy to use in this
presentation to some great coding
samples and get if you have any
questions and you have our contact
details don't hesitate to reach out and
ask questions so just sort of short
slides about our company you're a small
team of yes because the neighbors who
help were helping teams to get up to
speed and you technology and yes this is
pretty exciting so but today our agenda
is to go through some yes Enterprise
requirements for JavaScript application
development and those typical
requirements are of course having two
new kids to start visualization
visualizing data and build great
applications we have requirements for
internationalization great requirement
is to these components which you can
reuse across applications or cross
screens and of course it's very
important to have some good code quality
tools and testing tools you can
integrate with and in the end I'm going
to talk a little bit about the builds
deployment and release phase
of application development and giving a
small breath up of takeaways so I hope
you are going to enjoy this presentation
so let's start with traditional web
application architecture so we see many
things just happened on the server and
the client just rendered other views and
this is changing all this has changed in
the recent years and so the client on
the browser side is very powerful so we
are moving towards applications which
are heavily developed on the client side
and just talking with an API on the
backend so and for the client side there
is an inflation of frame rates and
libraries so just name some some of
those so it's pretty difficult you want
to start developing today so there's
lots of opportunities as we react
angular there's a lot of other cool
stuff like XJS meeting or and our and
great to have a toolkit which which
encapsulates most of important things
for enterprise development and this is
what we are focusing today so just to
mention some of those
yes libraries and just take a look so
there's a lot of stuff and for module
system is required lis as we have
browserify we a lot of doing systems and
you want to start together all these
things then it becomes pretty
complicated enterprise applications
don't need all this fancy stuff so the
requirements are to the stable the
protein to set which you can
just pick and you are ready to start and
of course there are some common
requirements nowadays to be responsive
in the design to have a lot of
visualization capabilities accessibility
and internationalization are important
topics especially in the public and
government areas so the focus here is to
empower business users not doing a lot
of fancy stuff so should guess the
conformance to emerging standards of
course there should be any security
leaks and guess.well documentation and
support so this is very important and
the typical architecture of nowadays
modern applications as it is a little
bit different now so the client side we
have a lot of stuff going on so we have
model which talks with typically REST
API so yes by HTTP or WebSocket or
server side events and on the client
side you can use the local storage or
you can update your view model and which
is bound to the view so there's a lot of
stuff happening beyond the client side
and Oracle jet helps you to manage all
this so it's a modular Enterprise
toolkit and there's a lot of ready to
use UI components so you don't need to
set up anything just put your
dependencies in three or just one
package JSON and then start by the way
so simplifies the development of course
you need to have JavaScript knowledge to
start with jet development and is based
on the collection of open source
libraries it supports both web and
mobile hybrid development so you can
have one source of your application
I can build web and hybrid applications
for Android or iOS and windows and of
course you have an extensive
documentation and what what we great
about is that you have great coding
samples and a cookbook so here's a short
summary what's in it so the important
part here is that the Alta UI is on
board
so all these components you can use they
yet they have their skin with the I'll
tell you I and you have these
accessibility features implemented
components like date picker is localized
tangiers this side with mobile features
so this is very great and you you can
see a lot of open source technology
under the hood so this is an eye catcher
for Oracle jet and as you can see from
the photos previous slide so on the back
end we just talked with some REST API
and this is typical conforms to nowadays
standards to have a layer of REST API on
your back-end and on the front end yes
we have this common model which is
optional and which is an integral part
of Jeb's knockout binding and then we
have to see why components um yes you
can find you in the styling assess its
technology project through UI components
area focus molarity resource management
require je s which is not the most
popular but it's pretty pretty great
once you get used to it it works very
well so here just to give you a some
examples of this cookbook so it's very
good you have a lot of come
in a lot of variations and your code
sampling can just change change codes
and you get life life reload right in
the browser with mobile preview included
so this is pretty great stuff okay so
this was just a short introduction to
Oracle jet development and yes the
architecture how things are going on so
with you want to learn more to getting
started well you can view to Oracle jet
then I recommend this online course so
just follow this link and you will see a
nice course from Oracle development
product team so next let's go on and do
some more comprehensive stuff and code
examples or Alive will show you some
some cool demos so the data
visualization tools and risks is kind of
lots of comprehensive set of charts
included just out of the box you can
take those components and copy the codes
and use it in your jet application so
this is pretty nice and it is very
impressive and and nice limits its
mobile ready you can have tax support
the responsive layout is included and
and those things are accessible so this
is pretty pretty difficult to do on your
own so if you try to build those charts
charts on your own with these Vijay
asked for example then this is very
difficult and all these things are
included in the step component so this
is very very very cool so next we are
going into coding demo so this demo is
based on an open source so yes it's on
github so we use this simple application
for training on Oracle Jets
and this is called the jet Spotify
Explorer app and let's go and take a
look inside the jet cookbook first so
their depression and then we are going
through some files and some coding how
to do this kind of visualization so
first this is a sample application we
are going through and this is just based
on the Spotify REST API which is
publicly available so everyone can use
it
and we used it to build this nice demo
application so we have a simple search
and list and we search now for nachos or
for band and we pick it and now we would
like to show the album's and so below
this title gear would have nice charts
where we have all albums along with the
popularity and for this we went to the
gap cookbook and we took a look what
kind of charts we we can use and for
example this bar chart so this could be
pretty much used for for all the album's
of nachos and the popularity we could we
could display on the y-axis so the
sample here we have just yes object
component which is yes oh this is a
knockout find in here and of course we
need the view part and it is a view and
on the other side you need the view
model and of course uniquely serious and
the groups and this we're going to do
now here from this simple application so
let's take a look
on to the coat so you can see here this
is just a basic structure of
objectification so as I said if your
YouTube jet then take a look into basic
tutorials so we have here with you and
what we are going to do here below this
title we like to have this chart so I
taught this charting component here ok
so you make some adjustments for the ad
for example you can change orientation
and then these are the most important
properties so we want to bow the series
property to our albums which we're going
to define which is defined in review
model and we have this group's property
where we measure which book we have and
we have only one group and we want to
show to display the popularity of each
album so all the others with just some
fine tuning so it's not that important
of course you need election times useful
but I'm not going to focus on this right
now so I love the view model as I said
the album's series system of the
observable array and we are set we are
using the Spotify API so we wrapped some
of these calls and yes the separate
model here which is just based on jQuery
and this procedure he uses Spotify API
and we have we are fetching the album by
artist so it's pretty basic rest call or
on the side and we are fetching the
details and those yes functions were
exposing here happy spotify noggin so
this is what we are using here on the
new model site as you can see here and
we get an album found an album then we
are calling this album function and in
the end this array is filled up with the
album's and what the popularity of
yourself so so this is where the model
is created and we save all these and
with life reloading of changes and go
back to the application call this is the
reload here the router does not work in
by default so I'm going to start from
the beginning but in the end you see now
always a nice-looking chart and we had
not much to do so every everyone setup
is just they see jet set up is top in
your application you have all these
skins and seem set up and this is all
nest from the business perspective to
give you the also set up the view model
and the view charting component and you
get this nice looking chart so it was
pretty cool so next let's move on on and
I would like to show you some best
practices on craft operation so so this
is the typical requirements for
enterprise applications so we have kind
of three where we have a list of items
and then we want to create new items or
upgrade items or delete items and of
course for the create and update the
deform is almost the same so it'd be
nice to have one kind of reusability and
this is you can see on the left side and
and on the right side the red boxes
are the Associated view models so we
made typical operations from the from
the list of items we want to pick one
and delete we want to create the create
form and update on the update form and
all these want to do on the view model
and if you model use the same service
which is in the mannequin arm yes and
its own module so we can reuse it so
this is our scenario and let's go on and
take a look how this works in code so
for this we are taking a look at this
application for expense reporting so
this is our list of trips so to just
simple item which with the name and the
cost and from to add some dates so and
now we can modify or create or same
similar entry and here you can modify or
we can calculate in you entry and of
course whatever use can form for those
typical activities of Yuda so let's
check out how we do it so first let's
take a look on this service it's called
request the requests module on this
application
so this is just as before we have simple
functions where we are calling our API
so nothing special here and are we
exposing those for posting a trip
putting we are using for update and
delete and get latest trip to get this
list so this is a basic service and then
this is travel
form which we created once so if all
these input components this is just just
an input text we have another input text
and so on
and then we have this input number input
a time 33 well having some different
components or the input form and of
course this form has its own view model
so we will put all this data together in
terms of validation logic and so on and
then of course we have the Edit entry
for for for creation of a new item you
can create entry template and we take a
look at this then you can see that we
are reviewing these defines our form and
we are extending it for some buttons so
because the buttons to save or to cancel
should be different so and Tocco edits
we have of course to call the from this
special function to make it's the call
for the service and this is of course
different when creating new item so the
one important thing I forgot to show is
this one you so in this form template we
put is knockout expression which
actually shows that everything we put in
the body here this would be it would
appear here and this reusable template
so this way it can reduce is formed on
different models and 1/4 then we have
two corresponding view model for this
edit entry
and then we implement the actual methods
for saving the changes as you can see
here we are using our service and call
it with the modified entry data now this
is basically how everything works so
just as you can see here you have modify
from not from Faribault to Frankfurt dr.
Munich save them the person works as
expected and so so this is actually how
we are doing cross operation so pretty
basic okay so next let's focus on how to
look lies and an application and how
easy this was check so there is a
special order how localization is done
in our cadet so we have course via
default setting on the require TS config
so this is one this is how it works so
and if this is not set then it's the
language attribute of your HTML document
and if this language attribute is not
set then
the toolkits tries to read the navigate
your language property and then starts
yet use this language setting to
localize your application so the nice
thing also is Chet accept it support a
lot of locals and especially on it is
also supports languages from right to
left so this is pretty nice so if your
requirements for these kinds of
languages then jet is a very good fit
for you
so yes I think we should go right into
the coat and some some option will be
more clearer how anything works together
and it's now the time to go into the
coat again so for this a demo we're
going back to our Spotify app and as you
already can see here it is default
defaulting to English and we're just
focusing now on this button here so it's
called create account and we're changing
to German to dodge then some translation
is active view and also if I switch to
Arabic then we see that it is has
changed from right to left
and for example could we open this form
here than you actually you can see which
change is happening here and also to
take this date picker everything has
changed here so this is very nice and if
I go back to English for example then
everything's yes as you would expect in
English so okay let's go into the codes
and to take a look at the main parts how
to set all these things together so
here's my index.html file so actually
I'm using these attributes you to
specify in my default language so see if
I change this one to French for example
when I go back to the application that
you would see that's now in French the
default
so switch the back and what else needs
to be done to set up things up so the
main configuration where you set up all
these require J's configuration so this
is the most important part here the
configuration where you define this part
here so all the other part is pre
predefined or this one to say the two
kids where to find your translations so
this example it's under resources and LS
translates Qin CAS so this one here so
the main entry point for our
translations you can see here under the
roots I'm defining now piece with the
corresponding translation so this is
just an example so via ps3 three keys
which we are translating so for examples
create a count for example and then we
speak apply which other locals are
supporting so this specific example it's
de de French and Arabic and yes and in
those files here and subfolders is PC fi
the corresponding translations yep so
but of course in the header
I filled this select box where we allow
the user to choose the language and
without it to the head of you model
where are we we are the functional
impairments that for the option change
event so
let's take a look here and see the
language well you changed function our
Weber meets the local with the sets well
movies and then we call this Oh J
conflicts at local function which is
chosen language and then callback
function is called and we're changing
this new language on this HTML element
and this root element and we are setting
for example for specific language we are
changing the direction and yes so this
is pretty everything about it and then
you can see that we are within such an
Oda translation can translate its string
we are referencing the key of the of the
translation and then update example lady
here so label create account we are
referencing it here on the button here
this yeah and this is actually how
everything is set up and this is what
set up your to go out to translate or to
have your application in different
locates so yes this is everything is
built-in so you don't have any extra
libraries to set up so to just start
with yet it's all there and you can
start building yes internationalization
in your application so I think it's
pretty cool okay so now let's focus on
complex components this is which is a
great way to reuse components across
your enterprise applications and things
are this is a great I guess great
feature
which is very useful so instead of
writing a lot of code and it's cloning
it and copying it across the application
you can good custom composite components
and then you can use those components on
different different applications or
different screens so not only possible
to use it inside a single application
but across different applications and
share this repository so this is very
very cool and we are going to Deep Diver
into this feature and guess typically
this component as binds to the custom
Dom element as you can see and this
component exists off the metadata web
scribe which fields which methods and
which events and component tests and the
scorpius to define the HTML view the
view model and you can style your
component so there's great article
series by diagonals so you should
definitely take a look at this but next
we are going to see these things in the
code right now and because the time
moves on we're going right into the
codes and this one for those who just go
through the slides so let's go to the
demo and as you can see here Yanis has
pushed the address form component and we
get a nice read me here how to use it
and well we have already 35 downloads
this is great and as you can see in the
code so we have the address for you so
there's nothing special you just use the
scat components here of HTML you can
tile it here and we define the view
model so it's a pretty easy set up here
for this use case and we can dispatch
custom events on this part we have a
submit button in here and we are calling
and when we submit our function and we
are attaching event so the consuming
application can react on this event
so this metadata really straightforward
of course if you look into the
documentation for more details but I
think you get the idea and one important
piece is here to register these
components through this oj composite
function so this is very important as it
exposes it into your jet application so
yes slowly read all this get HTML the
view model the meta data and so on and
register it here so now let's take a
look into the year consuming application
so of course you have to define the
dependency so address format eject
give it a version and this will make to
pull this from the registry onto
workspace and then there's one thing to
do it is here in these scripts from
conflict orca jet built Jas so we have
to make sure that the downloaded files
that they are copied to the destination
folder and then of course we have to
register it in our require Jas
configuration so this is reading you in
the main GS and then we can use it in
our modules so when this creates account
module so we are referencing here as the
dependency and let's make it possible to
use it in our view so as you can see
here so and now if we take a look at the
application you can see if I go here
create an account and put some name in
here and submit then we get here an
output and so that's also an example
where I react with a simple lock all
these events and as you can see this
works pretty good and this way can build
on get more comprehensive component and
reviews across your enterprise
application and so this is the great
feature we should take a look more into
this a very important aspect in
enterprise application development is
also of course testing and code quality
so one now take a deeper look into this
so for code analysis for code quality
of course there are of course again a
lot of options to use about weird
we have kids experience with es limp and
for example if you're using Adam there
are good plug-ins which helps you to to
show errors and warnings right in the
editor and this is pretty helpful
so for using it just create your own
configuration or what what we are using
is to extend an existing and then you
can dequeue the rules for your needs and
if you want you can publish it as a
reusable with configuration and just
then just use it in your project so for
example we have created our own and it's
also publicly available so you can just
use that and you're good to go this is
pretty easy so let's take a look in the
code how everything is working so first
let me show you this configuration so
actually this is a pretty easy module
where we are extending the configuration
from Eastlands configuration from google
and so say you're expanding it and
overwrite or put some additional rules
you want and then we are using it in our
application just just that so here we
are importing it for that dependencies
and then of course you have to configure
this grant configuration
this year's Linz RC yes so you say that
we are just extending this module so we
don't overwrite anything here because we
want to have our enterprise for the
light coding standards and then let's
take a look we can start this one so the
travel you say round Flint and then it's
run said of course this you can see here
we have some warnings but no errors so
let me do some error here so if I go
here and for example this doesn't
correspond to our coding rules now we
get an error seeing you write for we
developer and we would run this on a
continuous integration environment then
we have an error and it would be aborted
so we can great way to define our rules
and make sure we have a good code
quality so the next part based on
testing so there this something again
where there's a lot of opportunities so
for example you can use Q units caramel
mocha or just mine so far we have good
experiences karma and makan so we just
going to show you how this is working
and we are using it in our CI build
pipeline and using a headless browser
phantom vs course is yes I think
everyone is doing JavaScript development
note that this great way to have a
headless browser and you're the results
of the console and let's see how this is
working so of course we have these
dependencies here and all that
dependencies for Karla
and maca and then we ever seen setting
up here in this configuration file
Comicon and we are using the maca
framework yes and yes you just have to
set the files up here and then we are
configuring the plugins considering it's
inside of requirejs so this is very
important and then this PC file browser
is here and then let us focus on the
test so this is our test names or an
entry point where everything is set up
and you can see that we are just as for
the main application we are setting up
the configuration this is pretty all
those dependencies you need for your
application and then we start the test
right here as you could see we have
starting the Karma test suite and then
we define your our tests and yes so this
is pretty straightforward
I think yes I have not to say much more
about that so if you want to go deeper
into this and of course there are there
are documentation for karma from Wacha
and just to have a look all this is
working so we are around this test and
watch note so listening setup right now
so now we have defined 26 tests here in
our application and let's say
we are making we are in some error in
our test or in our function so just for
demo purposes and in the background the
test suite runs and I'm getting notified
very soon so I can fix it again and see
the great way we're using to make sure
you have a good code quality and
functional correct code running so this
yeah
what setup you are very productive of
the code yeah
so let's move on to the last point and
this is release and deployment and as
you will see as your engine is
continuous integration so of course we
are not releasing and deploying manually
so this is very important nowadays to
have continuous and automated pipeline
with integration of tests and your cold
qualities etc and then you are building
a release and deployed it so of course
this something where a lot of
opportunities exist you can use the
developer cloud service from Oracle we
started some time ago was cultured left
good experience
so once setup you connect your
repository and then all you to do you
have to make sure on your built
environment so you have to write note
version and you have the the right
command line tools and this is how we
are doing it for example on culture and
then you have to install your
dependencies one check out your code
we are still using Jack's version - you
still have to use Bower and grunt power
copy on Version three everything is a
lot easier and then of course you should
always run your tests on your limping
and yes we have good experience with
this and it just make more fun and you
can you can do more you can really
release cycles and so don't forget to
integrate these two things in your build
pipeline another point is that William
check box for our build pipeline so it's
a great way to be notified what's going
on the project and you can see a sample
from slack go into great with cold ship
and also using the bit bucket
box check so every developer is in the
loop and knows what happens so it makes
a lot of fun to develop that way so for
deployment if you're doing a release
there's a special release command and
let's make sure that you are you don't
put debug statements in your final
release and another thing is that of
course you should have different
branches for your development versions
and this is how we we are doing it for
different sprints or we have different
branches and even for different features
and then we could check and put it on
different areas so your stakeholders can
always see the latest versions and
compare for new features and this is
very important too
have stable build and release pipeline
so for deployment we recommend to use
for example just the simple docker image
so on this example we are using engine X
and we are putting it just on this guess
of its web server and exposing it and
yes as you can see this just a couple of
lines of code and then you set up and
can run your web line so this become
really easy now
to compare to application service this
is very easy to deploy your client-side
application let's break up so it's a
great way of building enterprise
application so there's a lot of extra
functionality out of the box you don't
have to to look at every detail there's
in the Scavo script community space so
take Jack and you can start building
great applications so your this
component catalog of the scope book and
this is great way to get the happen so
it's appropriate so you can expose rest
api's from inside your database logic so
puts ores or view our ADF you can expose
those business components as REST API
and this is also a great way to
modernize your applications or if you if
you need some sort of newer applications
which are more like that you can use
these technology and use your existing
logic on the back end you can plot it as
a docker image for your own registry or
somewhere in the cloud or you can use
the Oracle application container cloud
service which is a predefined
environment where can easily create
deployment form where can run your gem
applications and you should definitely
check out the application builder cloud
so so this is very exciting now you get
a real development environment it's the
everything with jet base so via the
development environment itself and
everything you've seen which we are
doing right now in the code you can do
visually by drag-and-drop and this is
very very exciting and you definitely
should take a look on this a BTS thanks
