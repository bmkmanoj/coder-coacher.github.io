this is the talk on resource management
in Java so I hope you all have the right
room this is the standard IBM disclaimer
and one day I'll get to read it all as
well short introduction about me my
name's Neil Richards I work in IBM I
have a couple of email addresses one for
IBM related conversations and one for
correspondence under the terms of
working in OpenJDK I've been developing
and deploying Java SDKs for about 15
years now with no time off for good
behavior and previously have been the
IBM technical component lead amongst
other things for the i/o component
networking and for the orb supporting
core band are my over iop I currently
work for IBM in OpenJDK on a number of
different openjdk projects and over the
course of the work and my time I've
obviously seen fair number of resource
management related issues and worked on
their solution so what should we talk
about this evening well first of all I'd
like to define what what resources I'm
going to be talking about and what
resources need managing then just lay
out a couple of definitions and explore
some approaches that there are in Java
for for dealing with native resource
management passive active in hybrid and
I'll define those things how to use them
potential problems or traps to avoid
when using them and we'll look at some
worked examples now the worked examples
of tried my best to to get the code
player on the screen it's really nice of
that I've got one nice large screen and
it's nice and high up so hopefully
everyone will be able to see clearly if
if you can't then you know just are
additionally move forward and that's
that's great we're all friends here
we'll also talk about limitations to
each type of approach and we'll end up
with some recommendations that we draw
out of out of wandering through these
things together so what kind of
resources need managing it's a good to
compare and contrast the the world of
how things are in Java compared to how
they were before Java particularly in C
and C++ to start with you have you have
artifacts which are allocated using
stack memory as you make method calls as
you have local parameters which are
allocated out of the stack and you'll
see that it both in C and C++ and in
Java they're handled automatically and
they'll come back to the star in Java in
just a moment the major advance when we
came to Java was that was that memory
allocated from the heap is is now
automatically handled by the garbage
collector in the JVM and that helps to
reduce you know a very frequent source
of problems and errors when when writing
C code but for other other artifacts
which are in the system such as file
descriptors network sockets database
connections and lots of other things
kind of anything you can really imagine
then then there needs to be some extra
intervention both in c / based in the
c++ world but more in
singley for us in the Java world now the
the notes beneath here that means in the
Java case it or rather in the cips and
c++ case you can as well as kind of
primitive variables allocated on the
stack you can also have allocate
structures on the stack whereas in Java
that basically doesn't happen if you
want to have new objects then then they
get allocated on the heap and the only
time when that doesn't happen is when is
when the JIT in the vm is smart enough
to work out that actually it can get
away with allocating things on the on
the stack instead and the other note
here is that although we say that heap
memory is automatically allocated
automatically your handled bringing
bringing it up is automatically handled
by the GC in Java that still doesn't
apply to to memory that you've allocated
for native methods and native resources
where you still have to worry about
freeing them up yourself so some
definitions basically there are two i'm
going to i'm using the term passive
management to to talk about those places
where no requirements are laid upon the
end user in order to in order that the
resources are or the cleanup of the
resources are are handled whereas in
opposition active management are those
techniques where there is some
requirement on the end user to kind of
comply in some way use the code in some
particular way in order that resources
are properly handled so on to our first
approach and we're going to look at the
passive approaches first so we'll look
at finalization finalization according
to the
the Java language specification provides
a chance to free up resources it can be
freed automatically by an automatic
storage manager where automatic storage
manager means GC and it also says before
the storage of an object is reclaimed by
GC the Java Virtual Machine will invoke
the finalizer on that object so this is
this is good this means that that you
get a chance to get a chance to do some
cleanup of any native resources
associated with the Java object and you
do that before the Java object itself
gets cleaned up how do you implement it
well you override the finalize method
that is defined on java.lang.object
that's method is a protected method so
that any subclass which means any type
of java class can can override it and it
throws throwable so that seems kind of
fairly fairly simple however there are a
number of different traps a lot of which
are also hinted at in the Java language
specification first of all the java
programming language doesn't impose any
ordering on on on the order in which
finalizes called on objects so finalizes
can be called on objects in any order or
even concurrently so what does that mean
well it means that basically you can't
if you're if you're if a finalize method
is called upon an object you can't
really rely upon the state of any of any
in any other object for that object
refers to so you have say you're to be
safe you have to kind of limit yourself
to just looking after cleaning up the
resources which are really directly
related to to the to the object that
you're dealing with stack
Lee it says that if an uncaught
exception is thrown during finalization
the exception is ignored and
finalization of that object tone aids
that's kind of really scary so that
means that if you if you have any kind
of exception or error that comes out
from trying to from trying to free off
the native resource and you don't do
anything special about capturing it and
printing out that so that exception then
it will be silently eaten by the system
and you'll never get to find out about
it until sometime later your application
will fall over because it's run out of
the native resources thirdly unlike
constructors finalizes don't
automatically invite the finalizer for
the superclass such an invocation must
be coded explicitly and I've rearranged
the word the wedding the order of the
words in jelly in the language
specification but the e but I've
preserved the meaning within there and
it says this should always be done it
actually goes on to say they should
always be done unless there's some
really amazingly good reason why you you
know you're absolutely confident that it
shouldn't it shouldn't be but that's
that's really interesting that has so so
a that's easy to to omit for a developer
to omit which is which is not good
secondly unless you're the class that
you're implementing is declared as final
so that so that other people can can sub
class from it then it means that your
implementation of the finalized method
needs to be protected it can be private
or anything more restrictive because
you've got to allow the subclass to be
able to call back to you and it also has
implications as we'll see in the in the
coding example about the complexity of
actually properly handling
exception handling during during the
finalized method and finally it also
says a finalizar may be invoked
explicitly just like any other method so
any place that can have that has access
through the protected accessor on the
finalized method which means anything in
the same package as as the class in
question as well as any subclass
anywhere else could call finalized prior
to finalization and so you need to have
extra guarding code in there too to
handle that and then there's some other
traps as well beyond those which you can
pick out from the from the language
specification or that lead on from it so
because the because finalize is
protected that means that when you use
finalization and when you implement
finalized on your on your class it's
part of that classes API so even if at a
later point you decide that that
actually you want to use an alternate
technique and you don't want to use
finalize anymore you're kind of stuck
with with having the finalizer method
still there so if you look at the code
in the MV SDK for places that i use
finalized you'll find an awful lot of
the of the java sdk code uses finalize
finalization as its mechanism for
cleaning up native resources and the
reason for that is simple finalization
was one of the first things that first
ways of implementing these things that
that that came along and a lot of the
lot of the java classes associated with
native resources such as file
descriptors and sockets and so forth
were also implement you know were there
in early versions of java so they all
implemented stuff on finalized and now
even if they wanted to move off to you
something else they're still stuck with
having finalized as
to their clutter parts of their classes
API oh so more traps it's fairly obvious
but only the divinely the implementer of
the of the resource class itself can
define a finalize method so if you don't
like the way that that a that a
particular class has implemented
finalized then there's no way that you
can replace it with your own or or or
augment augment the behavior using
finalization the one the kind of most
scary bits is in finalization the
developer still because it's a an
instance method that's being called you
still have access to the reference to
the object itself and therefore you have
all references to all other things that
that object refers to as I've already
mentioned those other objects may have
already been finalized they may be in
the midst of being finalized you know in
the midst of actually running they're
fine they're finalized methods or they
may have yet to be yet to actually have
their finalize method call at called but
be queued up be scheduled to be
finalized in which case they will have
their finalization finalize method
called even though that it hasn't
already happened and that's basically
that's all kind of quite dangerous
because there's lots of temptation there
too and possibility to reach out and use
bits of data and use the states of
objects that are actually kind of stale
and on their way to being finalized and
being garbage collected and kind of
falsely use them as though they're live
and even worse you might be tempted to
to to grab hold of some of those objects
or the object or the object this object
itself and try to resurrect them now
resurrecting them doesn't
usually work as well as huge huge hope
because although finalized can be called
might be called on an object multiple
times it's only called once from
finalization so once an object has been
called from final it has had their
finalize method called from finalization
then if you resurrect it and move it
back to be a live object then the next
time it gets next time it loses its last
strong reference then then finalize
won't be called again by the
finalization mechanism it remembers that
it has been called and it moves off
silently which is maybe not what you
want so here is our first our first
example code so just to just to go
through this a bit so it's my first
resource things as my resource one we're
going to have so we have a with storing
an opaque handle to our native resource
in a long which is what you normally do
because you want to cater for for being
or maybe on 32-bit system maybe on a
64-bit system so along is large enough
to hold hold the native handle we have
some couple of native methods to
allocate and free the native resource
and in here we also are using an atomic
billion to to do the to do the
synchronization necessary to make sure
that we were only going to try and call
free native resource wants so in this
case in a constructor is where we're
going to call allocate native resource
and notice that where that where we'll
throw out any exception that we that we
get as a result you know if that goes
awry and then we've implemented our
final method finalize method here and we
are this is the main line which is
saying
okay we're going to try and try and
change the value of closed from false to
true in an atomic way using compare and
set and if that worked then that means
it was false before and now it's true so
we'll call free native resource in all
subsequent times when you're calling
this it will already be set to true and
so therefore this this if block will win
go inside the if block and say it won't
call that now so that's that's the
simple thing of what's what's going on
and of course three native resource can
itself throw an exception but we also do
to what we saw before we need to call
finalized on us on our super class them
to to be to be safe and that also may
throw a throwable so we need to deal
with the with the exception handling we
need to deal with that such that the
call super light super finalized doesn't
prevent us doesn't prevent us from
closing off our native resource and
closing off our native resource doesn't
present it doesn't prevent calling super
finalized and an exception popping out
from either from either one of those
doesn't stop us from making the call to
the other and that we need to gather up
the exceptions in such a way that we
report it back consistently to up the
stack and because because we know that
actually when we throw the exception up
the stack it's just going to eat it and
ignore it we are going to capture it and
and print it out to standard error down
here so as you can see the logic for
doing that is pretty hairy and yeah so
that's that's incredibly easy to get
wrong so basically you call each of
these things you save away on the first
call you save wave
the the throwable that what that might
be thrown or the exception that might be
thrown you then always call the call the
second call in the finally block of the
first try block you find out whether
anything is thrown from that call and
then you can nip things up together
using in this case I'm using the add
suppress feature which actually came in
in in Java 72 to help with that so
that's kind of what seems like it should
be really simple is actually you know
even in the trivial case really complex
notice also just that just a point that
in these examples the classes which I'm
showing the operations on on actually
doing things with the handle once you've
got it I'm leave leaving up to to the to
the reader so we're only concentrating
on the allocation and de-allocation of
the resource and how that's handled so
that is finalization we'll move on to
the second approach still passive
approach and this is using java.lang ref
phantom references so now this is from
the java 7 api javadoc where it says
phantom reference of objects are in
queued after the collector determines
the collector being GC determines that
their reference may otherwise be
reclaimed and it says well it gives the
suggestion that they're most often used
for scheduling pre-mortem cleanup
actions in a more flexible way than is
possible with java finalization so i
believe that phantom references came in
in about java 1.4 so how do you use them
well as well as the refere as well as
the resource class that we saw before
we're going to define a second class a
reference class which sub supplies
phantom references
and we're going to use objects from of
that class type to track the main
resource objects we also need to create
a statically held reference Q object
that is a java.lang ref reference Q
object and basically the GC will place
will place the instances of our
reference class on to the reference
queue at the point at which the resource
objects are our only referred to by the
ref by the Phantom reference objects or
by the reference class objects so the
the reference Q is effectively a source
of the stale of stale reference objects
which need to be processed in some way
and the stale references can be removed
from the queue in one of two ways either
by calling poll which is a kind which
will return return a a reference from
the stale reference from the reference
queue if one is available but won't
block if one isn't available and using
that technique using that approach you
usually cause poll to be called prior to
each operation that you're doing using
using the handle or the other approach
to doing this is to is to make use of
the remove call on the reference queue
and the difference is the removed call
will block so in that case you set up a
dedicated background demon type thread
to to sit on a call to the reference Q
remove method and then when it returns
its it gives you back you know a
reference object that has been that has
been queued up a stale reference object
that's been queued up for processing so
there are some traps
associated with using phantom references
to again from the Java dog it says if
the garbage collector determines at a
certain point in time that the referent
of a phantom references Phantom
reachable then at that time or at some
later time that's my emphasis it will in
cue the reference so that suggests with
with a certain amount of surety that
there is that there is some delay in in
actually seeing references being placed
on the on the reference queue so it's at
some point after GC has has identified
that the resource object is otherwise
eligible for garbage collection that it
accused it up the second thing is it
says the get method of a phantom
reference always returns null now most
most references or all the other types
of references that there are they have
this get method and the object that is
associated with the reference object
when their reference object is is is it
created is instantiated the get method
is designed to it will would normally
return their reference to that object
but it's a very purposeful that the
Phantom reference phantom references
never return always return null from the
get method the whole point is this is
this is there in order to in order to in
order to prevent you from from accessing
otherwise dale resources which are in
the object so when I was talking about
finalization I said it's dangerous that
you get a reference back to this so this
is the thing that effectively prevents
you from getting the equivalent because
you can't get a reference back to the to
the real reference object the
implication of that is that anything
that you actually need to do that you
want to do as part of processing this
dale referent this dale reference is any
information that you need you need to
store upon the the reference object
itself and not upon the resource object
so we'll see that when we get to the
code example and thirdly an object
that's reachable by phantom references
will remain so until all such references
are cleared or themselves become
unreachable so this is really uh this
really interesting and a little bit odd
because although you can't at you
there's no way of getting a reference to
the original the object that the
reference object is tracking back from
the from the Phantom reference
nevertheless that object is still still
remains phantom reachable until such
point as you've dealt with and thrown
away all the Phantom references and
whilst that object is phantom reachable
the garbage collector won't actually
free up the memory associated with it
with that object even though you can't
get at it anymore and I can only assume
that there's some you know deep
fundamental reason you know from a VMs
point of view why that's that's a really
good idea furthermore you must make sure
that when you're using phantom
references that a strong reference hat
must needs to be maintained to the
Phantom reference object itself if if
you don't do this then then the then the
fanta if the Phantom reference becomes
eligible for garbage collection then it
will be garbage collected and it and it
won't get posted on to thee on on to the
reference q so just because you created
a phantom reference object saying I want
you to I want it to be posted on to a
queue
onto this reference queue when the when
the associated object that it's
referring to becomes eligible for
garbage collection nevertheless if the
Phantom reference object itself gets
garbage collected then you don't get any
notification at all so you have to keep
a reference for that strongly and
obviously once you've actually once
you've seen it come out of the reference
queue and it's Dale that and you've done
the processing to do what I've clean up
it is then you need to free off this
strong reference because otherwise
you'll have a memory leak of ever
increasing number of phantom reference
objects around however there are
benefits of using phantom references /
finalisation I've mentioned it I've
already talked about this but the
benefit as well as the pain is that you
can't get back a reference to the to the
resource object from the reference
object using the get method and that
makes the code safer and therefore
easier to understand there's no
interference between finalization and
phantom reference uses in super classes
so because you're an object could be
tracked in a number of different places
by a number of phantom reference objects
all with their own particular purposes
and so therefore the kind of interaction
remembering that you have to call method
on on your superclass and dealing with
any exceptions which might happen in the
finalization in the cleanup associated
with your superclass is is something
that doesn't interfere with with your
your coding of the using the Phantom
reference so it avoids all that
complicated coding for exception
handling and the and because you can you
can also
the the implementation of the Phantom
reference is can be external to the
resource class that you are that you are
dealing with this means that you can
also use it to track you can track
resources that that you haven't actually
had a hand in in writing you don't need
to be modifying those classes at all but
you can use phantom references to to
track them and to to deal with them so
I'll examine that's a little bit more
lately later here's the example code for
phantom references so so you'll notice
that now the handle is now within the
reference object which is extending
phantom reference we have within here we
have a static set of active references
so when we allocate when we allocate
things we synchronize on that set and we
add the new reference object into that
set that's what maintains the strong
reference so that it is going to get
queued out at the end and then
deactivate is method which will return
be in the first time that the first time
that it's will effectively look to look
and try and remove remove the reference
from the set of active references and
the first time that it's this is called
it will succeed and subsequent times it
will fail and when it succeeds it
returns true so that then in clothes
instead of using the atomic boolean we
call the activate and if the activate
returns true then we call free native
resource so so this is also using this
is using our first approach which is
going to be using poll to to look at the
at the reference queue which is also
held statically up here as I said so we
have a process q method here and some
more stuff which we'll look at in the
next slide so process q expanded is just
going to sit in a in a do-while loop
whilst whilst we actually get something
back from from call to pole on the
reference q if we get back a null then
we break out of break out of the
do-while loop and return and and we're
still capturing the exception and
printing out there the stack trace of it
if things go wrong and basically for
each operation to do with the resource
then you have to remember that there's a
two to make a call to the process q
method so that you're going to clear out
and process any stale references so that
is that also notice here that I'm only
synchronizing on the stale references
here during the poll call so I'm
allowing the possibility that this call
to close may take a long time as as it
may well do and so I'm not holding onto
the not holding on to the monster for
the stair references q whilst I'm making
the call to close so the alternative is
to use a thread to so here we have a
Reaper thread that's when we create it
we say it's a daemon thread we started
up and then instead of calling poll
we're calling remove and the run block
is just a do-while loop which just keeps
on going until the end of the java
process itself and then that that
eliminates need for having a process q
method and also eliminates that call
there needs to be made on each operation
so those are the two passive approaches
the general limitations here they can
only be resources can only be found as
stale once GC has happened and GC might
be conservative so there's actually no
guarantee that sterile resources are
found even after GC has happened
GC is generally triggered by a
constraint of Java heap memory which is
a different type of resource so
perversely if you have a larger Java
heap then it can be longer before other
it's spotted that other resources or
objects associated with other native
resources are are ready to be closed and
so you can run the greater risk of
getting an outer memory error due to the
exhaustion of other native resources and
that's a really weird thing when you
when you see it it's completely
counterintuitive to think that by
reducing the size of the Java heap you
might actually lessen the chance of
getting out of memory so GC so the other
thing is that GC that that through
finalization or phantom references the
objects themselves are delayed from
delay GC from actually being able to
free up the memory associated with those
resource objects so finalizer fine Eliza
ballabh jects are processed on the
finalisation threads so they'd have to
actually get through that and have the
finalized method call and then another
GC cycle happen in order to spot and to
free up the memory and references need
to be removed from the reference q and
and whatever processing done for them
before they before their memory gets
freed up so the result is that you
actually get more constraint on the Java
heap and more time is spent performing
GC so on to active approaches now the
first approach are here I'll I'll I
described as management by Fiat which is
not what you think but I'm using the
definition of Fiat arbitrary order or
decree so this is basically we've we've
already actually done this in the
previous in our previous example but
providing a method or resource on an
object to release the underlying
resource and then generally called
something like clothes
and then telling your the users of the
class that they need to call that method
in order to free the resource this is
effectively exactly what happens when
when when you're dealing with resources
and see it's helpful if the function
that you're defining is is idempotent
and I'm going to skip through that but I
temp agency basically means that it
behaves precisely the same way the
subsequent times to how it behaves the
first time that you call it so it
doesn't complain that you've if you call
close the second time it doesn't
complain that the resources already
closed off it just says yeah though just
just returns normally in says yes it's
been cleared off so the obvious traps
are it relies upon the user actually
calling the close method it's tricky
it's sometimes tricky for the user to to
know exactly when the correct time to
call close is but use of tri finally
blocks will help there and again if
you're closing off number of resources
you get to the same type of complexity
in exception handling that we saw in our
first case so that the exceptions are
handled properly here but so so here we
are we're back to using atomic boolean
here we're specifying this close method
and it's all you know it's pretty
straightforward in this simple case but
as I say the exception handling if
you're dealing with it in more than once
so up here basically the pattern is that
you create you on you create your new
resource object you then immediately
after start the try block do whatever it
is that you want to do with the resource
within that try block and then the
finally block you call the call close to
make sure that close is is called
correctly the second approach is using a
thing called automatic resource
management or trying with resources this
came in in Java 7
and it's possibly the best language
feature ever in my in my humble
estimation you implement it by by having
your resource implement Auto closable
which has one method which needs to be
implemented which coincidentally is also
called close and throws exception as we
had before and basically autoclavable
objects which are assigned within so
parentheses were introduced in Java 7
for tri blocks and auto closable objects
which are assigned to two variables
within those within those parentheses
are automatically closed at the end of
that try block so it implicitly
generates all the nasty complex so
finally logic and exception handling
code for you so you don't have to which
is why it's the best feature ever it
allows you to do support multiple
assignments in the same try block and
it's really fab there are a few traps
with it first of all the user still
needs to comply with using using it with
the tri tri with the resources type
syntax though they might choose to call
closed directly because hey it's just a
method and if they call close directly
then they lose all the all the magic
exception handling code that gets
generated or let's get created if you
use the tray with resources approach
also the other the other slang catch is
just to emphasize that it's the auto
closable objects which are assigned to
variables in the parenthesis of the try
block that are that are handled and not
those that are allocated so for instance
if you are creating a print writer which
a new streamwriter to put into a new
printwriter and it's best to to have
them both be closed at the same time you
actually need to have two statements you
need to have a statement which
string the string writer assign it to a
variable and then a second statement but
still within the parentheses of the of
the tribe block which creates the
printwriter object and assigns it to a
second variable and then everything will
will work up happily and their final
thing is it you need to be running on
Java 7 which we all want to and
sometimes you know corporate edict oh
what a dict or whatever means that that
can be more problematic so here we are
we have this is a try with resources
we've got two resources here we do stuff
with my res 1-2 inside this blog and
then when we come out of the try block
or the finalization all the exception
handling gets handled for us we we then
this comment has expanded to say hey we
can use trail with resource we've got
employment adoro closeable this is our
public close method other than that it's
all the same so general limitations to
the active approaches because the
because the objects are still a strongly
referenced at the point at which their
methods are called so user code may be
able to see that see resource objects
that have actually been closed out so
you need to have some guard checking in
the operations on your resources to
check whether it's still active whether
it's still live or not whether it's been
closed off on up and there's no
guarantees that the user will actually
follow instructions to call the methods
or use trail with resources and that's a
point that's you know worth emphasizing
you gain so if so there are these
problems with both for both approaches
but by using hybrid approach you can get
the best of both worlds use the active
approach to allow the user to be able to
type free off the resources in a timely
fashion and you use a passive approach
to verify that the user has freed of the
resources and if they if they haven't
read off the resources to print out
an error saying that saying that that's
happened so there's an example with with
the combined approach that we have here
in this case so we're using auto
closeable and we're also using phantom
references so the auto closable is the
active approach and the Phantom
reference phantom reference is tracking
that that things have things have
happened correctly and what we're doing
is when we create the phantom reference
we're going to create an exception
object which contains the call stack of
the at the point of construction and
then later on in the reaper thread if we
find out when we when we remove the
stale reference that the that the that
the stair reference we've removed is
still in the in the set of active
references so back here so here this is
a closed method so this will this all
free off the native resource the first
time that the first time that we called
the activate so here if we call the
activate and it's telling us this is the
first time it's been called then that
means that the user hasn't done their
job and hasn't hasn't called clothes
either with a try resources or directly
and so at that point we can now print
out an error message saying that the
user hasn't done their job and we can
use the call stack that we captured in
the exception at creation time to give a
good clue to the to the user about where
it is that they're going wrong because
at the point of which you detect this
it's your you're in some completely
different well you're on the completely
different thread because you're on the
reaper thread when you're seeing that so
the recommendations are to use the
active approach to allow the user to
freely swiftly free resources implement
oughta closable so that they can use all
the try with resources magic use a
passive approach to monitor to make sure
that the user has
made has free things off and you can you
can use that approach even to monitor
that that kind of standard java
resources that a particularly key to
your application have been handled
correctly by the user it's preferable to
use phantom references / finalisation
because of the ease of doing correct
implementation and the flexibility to to
to track into possibly track standard
resources and to fail fast if you detect
that resource lee that that resources is
leaking it's best to tell the developer
early on at the first instance where you
detected that's that they're not doing
something right rather than trying to
kind of soldier on monthly and to use
both approaches in combination so the
user can free things off in a timely
manner and so that you can monitor and
report for resources leakages in due to
that had that not happening and there's
another bit of IBM boilerplate just to
finish off the presentation thank you
