about the director user interface and
how it works there are two main user
interfaces for enterprise data quality
this is one of them directorates used
for configuration and testing the other
one is called the server console and
that's used for operations in production
environments
and we'll talk more about that one later
on but we'll start with the director
user interface so let me tell you about
how that works
there are four main areas of the
director user interface on the Left we
have the project browser in the middle
we have the protest canvas which is
sometimes just known as the canvas on
the right we have the tool palette and
at the bottom you can see the results
browser
I'd like to give you a to of the
director user interface now then so how
do we launch director first of all well
we go to a webpage called the launch pad
is the launch pad and the address that
you'll put in will be slightly different
depending upon which environment you're
using the port number for example here
is nine thousand and two on the training
virtual machine it's nine thousand and
twelve on another VM supplied by EDG
product product product management it'll
be nine 102 so there are some
differences but each edq instance will
have a launch pad and from the launch
pad we can launch the edq user
interfaces so here is the link for
director so it's a launch director I
just hit that link and director will
download itself via Java Web Start you
can see that happening now and in a
little while it will start up so it's
just wait for that to happen you can see
the splash screen coming up now and here
we are and I put in my credentials now
the DN admin user I'm logging on as DN
admin this is a super user created
install and we use that user for their
training so just while that's loading
your Knoll just reposition and resize
the interface a little bit there we go
that's better okay and you can see the
project browser on the left of the
screen the other three main areas the
canvas the tool palette the results
browser they're not active yet because
to make them active we have to create a
project now that leads us to a key
concept the concepts of projects in edq
we divide our data quality work into
projects and typically for each
different kind of data we're dealing
with we're going to have a different
project so let's say we're dealing with
employee data and also product data and
also customer data we probably have
three different projects one for each
kind of data let's create a new project
now to do that we're going to right
click on the project's node and select
new project from the menu and then we
get into it
you project wizard now both of those
things are general features of edq if
you want to create a new object Norman
you right-click and normally that will
take you into a wizard to make it easy
to create that new object so let's go
through the wizard the project we're
going to create more just called
training project there we go
we just hit next in the wizard and we
get into a project permission screen now
I could limit which edq user groups can
access this new project I could select a
group so if this was our employee data
project and I had a group for my HR
users I could limit access to just that
group but because this is a training
project we'll say anyone can access its
find training we'll hit finish and our
new project appears in the left in the
project browser and if I expand it by
clicking the little plus to its left
hand side you can see the objects within
the project and we're going to be
looking at each of these objects in some
detail during the training data store
stage data data interfaces processes
will go through many of these for now
let me show you some of the basics so
let's say I create a thing called a data
store now we're dealing with data
quality and we need to have the data to
deal with so the first thing we need to
do is we need to tell Edie Q where that
data is and what format it's in is it in
a database is it in a file of some kind
if so what kind of database what kind of
file where is it what's the name of the
file what are the connection details of
the database and so on and we do those
things by creating a data store that
tells edq where the data is let's do
that now right click on data stores and
hit new data store again we get into a
wizard now for example I could say what
the data is on my client and it's in a
text file and hit next and next I could
say well the separator is not a comma
it's a pipe symbol and there's a header
row as well and I could go off and I
could look for that text file but in my
case let me just go back
I'm going to say actually the data is on
the server and it's in a database and
you can see here we can choose what kind
of data is basic could be an Oracle
database
Postgres sequel in our case it's going
to be a my sequel database so our data
is held in a my sequel database on the
server
let's hit next and here I put in the
connection details what what's the name
of the host
well it's localhost or this could
obviously be an IP address but sir it's
on the local host which porch we access
it on will will leave the standard one
3306
what what's the name of the database
it's called service management this is
the same database that you'll access in
the labs notice there's a big s and a
big m if you're using the my sequel
version of this and the user name is
served man all in lowercase s ERV ma n
and the password is also served man
again all in lowercase and we can then
hit test ok
and so they didn't work and that's
because there was I think one extra
character an M I've just deleted in the
in the name so let's hit test again and
this time we've successfully connected
to the service management database so if
you do experience a problem there it's
probably a typo that's exactly what I
did so that's it ok and we'll help next
and we can give our connection a
datastore a name and I'll call this just
connection to service management
database and I can put a description in
I won't do that now but it was quite
good practice hit finish and now we have
a data store so edq now knows where the
data is now in order to actually work
the data we need to have it at our
fingertips if you like and there's a few
ways that we have of connecting of
bringing the data into edq we can use
web services you can see the web
services know down here we'll explore
that a bit later on in
in this course we can stream the data in
have a look at the help there's a topic
called performance tuning which tells
you how to do that in the help what
we're going to do is we're going to
snapshot the data we're going to stage
it
so under stage data right click new
snapshot so what this will actually do
is take a copy of the data and copy it
into edy cues repository into edy cues
results database okay so it takes a copy
freida key to work with so we're going
to use our connection to the service
measure database that's where the data
is in that my sequel database on the
localhost it next and edq will go and
look in that database and it says right
well I found the number of tables which
ones you want we want the customers
table it next again and it goes off and
says here all the fields in the
customers table and we could say we just
want some of them but we'll leave them
all selected we want to take in all of
the data from all of the fields hit next
we've got some options around filtering
and sampling there's a module on
sampling later so we won't do that now
we'll hit next again next again and we
can give this a name either keep the the
suggestion or I'm going to call this
customers table and hit finish and at
that point
edie queue then takes a copy of that
data that's what a snapshot is it's
taking a copy in at a moment in time and
it brings it into the edq repository and
then our results browser becomes active
and in the results browser at the bottom
of the screen here you can see the data
from that customers table from the my
sequel database there it is ok fairly
typical customer data customer number a
name gender business name address
details their post codes zip codes in
other words email addresses all that
kind of stuff
ok so so far we've said where our data
is and we've staged it we've taken a
snapshot of it that's what you'll do
shortly in the in the labs and now what
we can do is we can begin to process it
so we can start doing things to it to
understand it to
ultimately improve it and so on so under
processes or we can now right-click and
choose you process again we get into a
wizard what data do we want to work with
well the data from our customers table
that we just snapshot it we just took a
copy of by the way the fact we've taken
a copy is often a good thing because if
our service management database was a
production database we don't necessarily
want to keep on going back to it and
putting demands on it better take a copy
and work with a copy it next we'll leave
this add profiling for now we'll talk
about that later
it next again and give this process a
name and we can call it a customer data
it's to call it customer data process
for now it finished and now in a second
our process canvas in the middle of the
screen is going to become active and so
does the tool palette on the right so
let's think about these two parts of the
screen now the process canvas and the
tool palette now at the moment that
process canvas has something called a
redrawing and all that's doing is just
reading in the data from the customers
table if we just run the processor by
clicking that little green icon there
it's just going to shows the data again
in the results browser that's all but
what we can start to do is to build a
process now we'll do a module on
profiling in a manipulator
our tools in the tool pallet our tools
for doing things with data are divided
into families now each tool is called a
processor so what you see in the list
here are a list of processes and the
family we're looking at the moment is
the profiling family so this tool icon
of the graph this is the profiling
family and we talk more about profiling
later but we use profilers to understand
our data before we start making changes
to it we need to understand what the
problems and the challenges are and we
do that using the profiling family of
profiler processes the next family along
with the green tick let's click there
this is the audit family so here we see
all of the audit
these allow us to create checks they're
all they will end with word check we
could check the email addresses are they
in the right format for example we could
check whether there's data in a
particular field we could do a regex
check to see if the contents of a field
conforms to a particular pattern in all
cases and so on the next family long is
called transformation in this family we
can start to actually change and improve
our data in various different ways we
might go through that now then we have a
matching family then we have a text
analysis family here's the third party
family that includes address
verification and so on
okay and here's the the read and write
family so this is how we get data in we
all by Deva have a reader on our process
when we create it there's a writer which
allows us to stage data that we've
changed in some way so really in the
tool palette we have our tools if we
want to search for a particular
processor we can use the search box here
so for example if I want to search for
processes that do things with dates that
I can put the word date in you can see
all of these have dates somewhere in the
name ok convert status data string
consolidate alright add current date etc
so you can search for processes or you
can go to a family so let's go to the
profiling family and I'll just pull on
one of the profiling process is the one
called quick stats profiler often a good
place to start profiling allows us to
understand our data quick stats is a
quick way to start doing that so all I
did was just drag that processor onto
the canvas and dropped it I'll delete my
second copy here because I don't need
both let's just delete that and there it
is on the canvas and now I can hook it
up to the reader so I just simply drag
and drop a line from the output of the
reader to the input of the quick stats
processor quick stats profiler sorry and
then a dialog opens to allow me to
configure the quick stats profiler so I
can choose which of the fields from the
customers table
I want to profile
and I could just choose one or two or
three or I could choose all of them by
hitting the big blue arrow at the top
and we'll do that now some processors
have options this one doesn't but but
many do okay so we just hit OK now and
having joined them up we have a green
circular arrow on the quick stats
profiler meaning that it's ready to run
and it needs updating so we'll run our
process we do that with the green play
button at the top and we'll see what
happens so let's hit run you can see the
process canvas goes blue while the
process is running and a bar goes along
the bottom here a blue bar showing us
how complete the processes it will take
a few seconds to run not particularly
powerful machine that I'm using here so
it's nearly dining seeing the tasks
window bottom left we can see progress
there let's just try and make that a bit
bigger not that is showing us very much
and then a second or two this will
finish the Nets finished ok the the
process canvas is wide again the tasks
window is empty to see the results from
our quick stats profiler we click the
processor and then its results appear in
the results browser at the bottom ok
now let's just have a think about this
so what we're seeing here then is each
field in the customers table down the
side see you number see you account
title name gender business address 1 2 3
postcode area code telephone number etc
and then we're seeing the results for
each here from the quick stats profiler
so it's showing us for each field how
many of the rows have data nail in this
data I just click the reader again there
are actually 2001 records we can see
that here in the record count go back to
the quick stats profiler results so in
the Cu number field 2000 of those rows
have data in them one is empty has no
data and there are three duplicate
entries if we want to see what those
three duplicate entries are we can drill
down by clicking on the number through
anything in blue you can drill down on
let's do that now we drill down one more
level the duplicate number is nine nine
nine nine nine nine or whatever and
drill down again and then we can see the
three rows of data which have duplicate
customer numbers
these look like test records let's go
back so hit the back button here and the
results browser to go back a level just
like a web browser really similar kind
of idea if you want to look at the the
gender field let's take a look at that
one so there we've got 148 record
without data in them and again we click
on that 148 it's in blue and drill down
and look at them and here are the 148
records without agenda okay if you look
at these most of them have a title so
perhaps we could derive the gender from
the title or the title in the first name
let's hit back again okay so I'm not
gonna go through profiling in detail
there's a separate module on that and
we'll look at the other process of
families in the tool palette later on
but I hope that gives you an idea of how
the director user interface works now
one or two other points that we will
just quickly note if you want to and
this isn't a kind of a full-blown export
from edq it's just a quick and dirty
method of of transferring the results
somewhere else there's a little Excel
icon here and you can export what you
see in the results browser to an Excel
spreadsheet that can be quite useful if
you want to mail it to a friend for
example or a colleague so remember that
that's there and the exercises I think
okay to do that either now a little bit
later on one other point that's worth
mentioning on the subjects the results
browser is results books so to get a
results book we click this little icon
here
now why would we do that well it's let's
have a look at it let's say that we're
interested in this fact there's 148 rows
without agenda click on there go and
look on them here they are and let's add
these 148 rows without agenda to a
results book okay so we'll create a new
results but we don't have one already
we call this rows with empty gender
sorry
no we won't be call the results book
just interesting results I think from
profiling I might finish and we'll hit
next and the page will call records and
customer data about a gender okay and we
get this result to pick on the left here
you can see in the project browser
interesting results from profiling and
so far we've got one tab records from
customer data without a gender and there
are if we look at that our 148 records
without agenda if I go back to the quick
stats profiler let's find something else
that's interesting let's look at those
three duplicate customer numbers again
drill down on the number three there
here are the three records with a
duplicate customer number let's save
those to our results because well we'll
hit the results book icon in the results
browser's toolbar there we go we're
going to put it in the same results book
but this time we call the page duplicate
customer numbers
we finish and can you see if we look at
our results book here let's just click
on to something else that so the data
store for a minute go back to our
results book and there it is it appears
in the results browser and you can see
the two tabs records from customer data
without agenda these are the ones
without agenda and the three duplicate
customer numbers here so we're just
collecting interesting results from
profiling into this thing called a
results books just a nice kind of
scratch pad for collecting interesting
stuff that we come across when we're
looking at data or changing it or
whatever and of course we could combine
that hit the export to excel tab here
button here sorry not SAP and that would
then export this results books to excel
we get a difference in excel tab
worksheet for each of the tabs we see
here in the results bro in the results
book alright so that's a nice little
thing as well okay before we stop one
more key piece of functionality in the
training there is enough time to show
you every single process so you can see
it's quite a few of them even in the the
profiling family and there's more
families but you can find out about them
yourself and you can do that by looking
at the online help to get to the online
help select a process from the canvas
and on your keyboard hit the f1 key I'm
not sure if I can do that here because
I'm working in a virtual machine and I'm
not sure what my f1 key is I'm afraid
but you can try anyway and that will
bring up online help for you in a
browser and it will tell you all about
the quick stats profiler and what it
does I do try that on your on your own
accord unfortunately I can't show you
here but you can try it when you're
doing the exercises so that's the direct
user interface remember the key areas
the project browser on the left the
process canvas where we build data
quality processes in the middle the tool
palette where we have the process ors
divided
families from which we can construct our
processes and the results browser where
we can see the results of our processes
at the bottom
okay let's just quickly recap some what
I told you about in the demo starting
with the project browser remember that's
the area of the screen on the left and
as we said we have a number of projects
typically in an e DQ instance one for
each kind of data usually that that
we're dealing with or for everything we
want to do for each thing we want to do
with that data and each project can have
data stores these are just connectors to
the data so as I said that tells a DQ
where the data is is it held in a
database is it held in a file where is
that final database
what's its precise format and so on now
one thing that I'll mention here is I
showed you that we create data stores to
allow edq to connect to import targets
if you like data we want to get hold of
to use in a project but we also you
create data stores for export as well so
basically a data store can be for an
import target and/or for a file or a
database that we want to export data to
when we finished working with it in edq
they work both ways
at stage data so stage data is data from
one of those sources of data a database
or a table in database oror a file or
whatever which has been copied into the
edq repository and that's known as
creating a snapshot so your snapshot is
just a copy of the data from your final
database now again we can snapshot data
when we want to import it we have to do
that often but also we can create stage
data in order to export it so when we've
changed a to any DQ we staged it again
in order to export that data
so again stage data like data stores are
for bringing data into edq and also for
exporting it out of edq processes when a
process does something to data allows
you to understand the data or to improve
its quality or deduplicate it only one
of the
we can do with edq or in fact a number
of them at once because a process can
start with profiling move through
auditing and transforming and go into
matching and parsing and so on I didn't
mention a reference data we'll come back
to this later this is data which helps
us to understand or work with data okay
so let's say that we have a list of
account managers in our data and we want
to know whether all of the entries are
valid what we create we can create a
reference data list of valid account
managers and then we can understand
whether our working data as it's known
is valid by comparing it to the
reference data we'll come back to
reference later it's important we'll
cover it in more detail a bit later and
then finally jobs we haven't been
through these yet there's a separate
module on automated processing where we
look at jobs and jobs allow us to string
together snapshots imports of data and
processes that do things to with data
and exports and then actually to
automate them and to schedule them to
run regularly if we want to do that okay
let's think about the tool palette on
the right hand side of the screen that I
showed you in the demo and that's where
the processes live the tools allow you
to do things with your data manipulate
it understand it change it and so on and
remember the processes are divided into
processor families I showed you the
profiling family and the audit family in
the transformation family the matching
family and there's various other ones as
well you just drag and drop protesters
from the tool palette onto the protest
canvas and that's how you create your
etq processes and we'll do much more of
that as we go through the training
remember there is a search box at the
bottom of the tool palette which allows
you to search for processes rather than
look through the families if you'd like
to do that
let's think about the process canvas I
showed you this but I would like to
mention some other features first of all
you can rename the processes on the
canvas now that's very very useful if
you build a complex edq process and you
come back to it a year after you built
it it can be quite difficult to
understand what's going on why did you
construct it in the way that you did
what exactly is it doing for anyone else
coming to it from fresh it's very
difficult to understand as well as it's
complex and annotating your process
obviously makes it much easier for
anybody else to understand it one of the
ways you can do that is just simply by
renaming in the instance of a processor
on the canvas you just double click its
name no data check for example and you
rename it is there data in the gender
field then it's really obvious what it's
doing you can also create canvas notes
just right-click on the canvas and
create a canvas note and you just type
free text into that to annotate your
process as well you can also group
processes and you'll see that a little
bit later on
let's look at the results browser then I
showed you this in the demo just
remember that any text in blue in the
results browser is hyperlinked so you
can drill down on it you can get as far
as the underlying records which is
really nice functionality remember you
also have the export to excel buttons
icons on the results browser's toolbar
which you can use to obviously export
the results to excel which is just a
quick dirty way of getting results out
of edq perhaps to email to a colleague
or something like that
let's think about results books then
these are quick ways of collecting
interesting data which you can then look
at later perhaps and deal with later on
so just a good way of collating
interesting data problems that you find
in the data to deal with later on
and lastly let's think about the
interactive help I couldn't show you
this in the demo but if you just select
a processor once you've dragged it onto
the canvas and then you hit the f1 key
on your keyboard that will bring up
context-sensitive help about that
processor and it will tell you what the
processor does any options it takes how
it works and so on and that's a really
good resource for you to use in the
training we can't go through every
processor so just do some discovery
yourself really by using the interactive
help if you're not sure which processor
to use or what a processor does explore
using the help and that will tell you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
