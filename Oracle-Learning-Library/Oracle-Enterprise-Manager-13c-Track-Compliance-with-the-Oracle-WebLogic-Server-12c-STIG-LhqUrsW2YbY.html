cloud control 13c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how you
can use cloud control to track
compliance of your WebLogic server
environments to the published security
technical implementation guide for
Oracle WebLogic server 12c the Security
technical implementation guide more
commonly referred to as stig contains
technical guidance to lock down
information systems and software that
might otherwise be vulnerable to
malicious computer attack originally
published by the Defense Information
Systems agency otherwise known as DISA
the sting for Oracle WebLogic server 12c
can be used by administrators from both
public and private sectors to ensure
that their WebLogic server environments
are sufficiently secure and not
vulnerable to attack beginning with
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13c release one and the Fusion
Middleware plug-in released 13 1 1 0 0 a
predefined compliance standard named
security technical implementation guide
stick version 1.1 for akoa logic server
12c is available from the cloud control
console administrators can associate
this compliance standard with their 12c
WebLogic domains to ensure that those
domains adhere to strict security
guidelines to access this out of box
compliance standard we can navigate to
the enterprise menu compliance submenu
and then library on the compliance
library page we click on the compliance
standards tab on the compliance
standards page we see a list of all
compliance standards to which we have
access let's filter this long list to
just the stig related compliance
standards we can search on stig in the
compliance standard name here we see a
shorter list only those compliance
standards that are based on disciplines
we see some sting based compliance
standards for database related targets
as well as the newest standard for
oracle weblogic server 12c let's take a
closer look at the predefined stig for
oracle weblogic server 12c
DISA has 90 rules published in its
WebLogic server 12c stig consequently
the compliance standard based on the
stick has 90 compliance standard rules
in it these rules Spann guidelines for
WebLogic server configuration for
auditing logging passwords
authentication just to name a few
let's take a closer look at one of these
compliance standard rules let's look at
the rule for configuring WebLogic
passwords to be a minimum character
length this is rule named WB LC - 0 5 -
0 0 0 1 6 0 for this selected rule we
can see the definition of the rule on
the right-hand side of the page we are
given a description of the rule its
version the URL toward DISA has the rule
published as well as the rule check
definition the rule check definition is
how Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud
Control checks for the specific rule in
this case we run a sequel command
against WebLogic server configuration
data collected and stored in the
management repository we check this
collected configuration data to ensure
that the minimum character length for
passwords is set to a value of 15 if the
value is 15 the rule is deemed in
compliance if the value is under 15 then
it is flagged as a compliance violation
if notifications have been setup on call
administrators within receive console
alerts and email notifications for any
such violations now that we have seen
the compliance standard let's associate
the standard with domain targets with
the compliance standards selected in the
table we can click the associate targets
icon and add domains to be associated to
the standard
after associating the five domains to
the WebLogic server Stig we can track
progress of the Association by clicking
on the association count link it's
important to know that this stick is
applicable to WebLogic server version 12
one three so in the compliance standard
target association table you can see
that the first domains evaluation status
is disabled and that is because the
domain is not version 12 one three it's
version twelve to one however the
remaining version 12 one three domains
have been associated with the compliance
standard and the initial stage
evaluation against all WebLogic server
configurations across those domains has
been done subsequent evaluations against
the same set of domains will be done
automatically on a regular basis now
that we have associated multiple domains
with the stake we can view the results
of the evaluation to do so we navigate
to the enterprise menu compliant submenu
results page on the compliance standards
evaluation results page we can see the
results from the just evaluated stick
for Oracle WebLogic server 12c
compliance standard here we have an
average compliance score of 32% this
means that only 32% of our domains are
in compliance with the stig this isn't
an acceptable score in fact we can see
that across the four domains there are
372 compliant standard rules that have
been violated let's drill down to see
which rules are being violated by
clicking on the compliance standard name
we can see more details on the
violations we can see the breakdown of
how many violations have occurred per
domain or a breakdown of how many
violations have occurred per compliance
standard rule in the left-hand side of
the page we can also see which
compliance standard rules have been
violated earlier we looked at the
compliance standard rule from minimum
password length let's look for that rule
here to see if it has been violated and
indeed it has there is a warning icon
next to the rule name if we select the
rule we can see on the left-hand side
that
across all four domains this rule has
been violated to get more details let's
click on the violation events tab here
we can see the actual values for the
minimum password length across the
domains they are all set to 8:00 when
they should be set to 15 hence they are
all in violation if we select one target
in the table additional details on the
violation appear below the table here a
message concerning the violation is
displayed as well as a recommended
resolution to the violation that is
Oracle Enterprise Manager not only
notifies you of non-compliance but also
tells you exactly what you need to do in
order to get back into compliance in
this violation we outline the steps to
perform to change the minimum password
length field for WebLogic if you follow
these steps and make the necessary
configuration change WebLogic then when
Enterprise Manager evaluates the
compliance standard again this violation
will not be triggered and your overall
compliance score will improve so that
concludes this demonstration thanks for
watching how to use Oracle Enterprise
Manager of cloud control 13c to track
compliance of your WebLogic server
environments to the published security
technical implementation guide for
oracle weblogic server 12c
