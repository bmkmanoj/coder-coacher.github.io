affect a project the first type of risk
is activity uncertainty this is the
general variability that makes it
impossible to predict how long any
activity will take to complete think of
something you do on a regular basis your
commute to work for instance some days
it may take twenty minutes and other
days it may take 40 you could estimate
how long it will take within a range of
uncertainty but you can never predict
how long it will take exactly prime risk
Andals activity uncertainty by enabling
you to specify a range of values for
each activities duration the second type
of project risk consists of risk events
external events that can disrupt or
impact a project bad weather or road
construction for example could make your
work commute take hours prime handles
risk events with a risk register the
register uses probability and risk
impact thresholds to quantify the
potential effects of a risk on the
project for example a risk might have a
probability of 40 to 60% a scheduled
impact of 20 to 35 days and a cost
impact of 50 to 75,000 dollars when a
risk analysis is run prime simulates the
project thousands of times using random
Monte Carlo sampling of the activity
uncertainty and risk impact values
activity uncertainty values are selected
on every simulation while schedule and
cost impact values are selected for the
percentage of simulations specified by
each risks probability threshold
once the simulations are completed prime
subjects the results to statistical
analysis the distribution histogram
displays a statistical breakdown for
project and activity cost duration and
start and finish dates the statistics
table displays the probability of
meeting the project's calculated finish
dates in this case the calculated finish
date was achieved in only 4% of the
simulation outcomes the table also
displays a more realistic finish date
one achieved on 90% of the simulation
outcomes main impact tornado charts
ranked the activities and risks that
have the greatest average impact on the
project's duration and cost activity
charts also provide a breakdown of the
contribution made by each risk to
duration or cost risk removal impact
tornado charts ranked the risks that
have the greatest impact on project cost
and finished 8 these along with the mean
impact tornado charts help you focus
your risk management efforts on the
risks and activities that have the
greatest impact on the project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
