overview this video showcases various
areas of identity governance and
corresponding Oracle products the
contemporary goal of any growing
organization is to manage the employees
in different roles their entitlements
and distinct access needs securely
hence effective identity management
solutions are needed so what is identity
lifecycle management
it is processes and strategies to manage
the security lifecycle of user
identities their entitlements and
applications the security life cycle
starts with initial onboarding and ends
with final deep provisioning of an
identity Oracle categorizes identity
management into three buckets identity
governance access management and
directory services all of them work in
parallel to achieve a robust identity
management solution identity governance
enables management of user role and
organizational identities and their
associated attributes and entitlements
access management facilitates
authentication of resource related
accounts for users and organizations and
authorizes them to access their accounts
directory services provide efficient
services such as storage lookup
synchronization replication and
virtualization of identity management
data across identity directories in this
video we'll be talking about identity
governance so what is Oracle identity
governance - it provides tools for
identity provisioning role management
reconciliation monitoring logging
auditing certification D provisioning
and managing highly privileged accounts
to understand how Oracle Identity
governance works meet Tina and Jim new
employees of ABC corporation as every
new hire would Tina and Jim get
provisioned with an access batch to gain
entry into the facilities access to
email server Corinne chills four remote
login and privileges to access certain
self-service applications and other
applications role management is one of
the areas of identity governance when
Jim gets promoted the access privileges
of Jim would be different from those of
Tina's meaning that Jim might have
access to resources that Tina might not
have access to there are different
approaches to role management first one
is top-down approach where there is an
existing role and we add people to that
role
the next is bottom-up approach there we
select people having certain common
privileges and then create a role for
them next let's talk about
reconciliation as Jim got promoted his
access privileges or entitlements change
along with access policies enforced on
him Jim updates his details in the
trusted source through the mechanism of
reconciliation the changes and updates
in Jim's profile are reflected in the
target resources which have his details
as well
another area of identity governance is
monitoring if ABC corporation wants to
know for example the servers are up and
running or health of the environment is
fine it can be done through monitoring
let's talk about logging if there is any
issue we can always go back to the time
where the system was working fine and
try to determine the issue and try to
fix the issue logging is helpful in that
aspect when we want to cross check the
access privileges determined who has
access to wit system when and why we can
take the help of auditing mechanism next
area of identity governance is
certification this mechanism helps in
evaluating if the employees are rightly
provided access to the privileges
they're entitled to when Tina or Jim
leave the organization all the
privileges need to be deep provisioned
to perform all these tasks efficiently
at enterprise level we have Oracle
Identity Manager that takes care of
entire you
identity lifecycle from initial
onboarding to final de provisioning of
an identity another Oracle product that
implements bottom-up approach strategy
of role management which we saw earlier
is Oracle Identity analytics let's talk
about managing highly privileged
accounts there are certain accounts that
are share accounts which have highly
sensitive data tina is assigned a role
of administrator for a share account the
problem that tina and others face is
that they do not know who has accessed
the account when did the access and what
did the modify oracle privileged Account
Manager comes to rescue for example if
Tina wants to access the account she
uses Oracle privileged account manager
to check it out by doing so should
receive a password for the account this
password is generated randomly by Oracle
privileged account manager she uses this
password to access the account as an
administrator and perform some
operations within the account and when
she is done she checks the account back
in so that others can use the account
this way problem is solved besides that
another unique feature of privileged
Account Manager is selective
availability we can define time
constraints for example Tina can be
granted access to the account only on
weekends let's see how all the three
Oracle identity governance products work
together when Tina and Jim joined the
organization they needed to be given
certain privileges by Oracle Identity
Manager according to their role in the
organization but their job
responsibilities do not seem to match
with the existing roads Oracle Identity
analytics comes into picture by creating
a role for Tina and Jim through
reconciliation this role is then pushed
into Oracle Identity Manager Oracle
Identity Manager then takes care of all
provisioning tasks for Tina and Jim as
we saw earlier when Tina is assigned to
the role of administrator of a
privileged account
Tina realizes that she hasn't yet been
given that privilege
so she logs into Oracle Identity Manager
and request for a privilege the Identity
Manager
initiates the request level and
operational level workflows and assigns
the workflows to an Oracle Identity
Manager approver after the request is
approved
Tina can log into privileged Account
Manager to access the privileged account
this is the overview of identity
governance and hope you enjoyed watching
