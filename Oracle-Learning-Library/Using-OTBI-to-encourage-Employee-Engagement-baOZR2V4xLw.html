is just to get you thinking about using
ad hoc reporting as a way of maybe
introducing some gamification when you
first go live with HCM cloud or maybe
when you're rolling out some new
capability so I'm logged in as Brian
here I'm an employee we've saved just
gone live with HCM cloud if I go into
the about me personal information then I
have access to all of my information but
I also have this extra tab at the bottom
here which is my employee dashboard and
what we decided to do is to give Brian
access to some simple information he
can't easily see in other places some
help contacts I've also got this thing
here because we're the sort of
organization where a lot of our
employees like to earn a bit of extra
money so he's able to come in here say
that he wants to earn for example an
extra hundred pounds and then it will
show him how many hours he needs to work
either at standard time and a half or
double time and he can play around with
that so for coming up to Christmas and
he needs a bit more money then he can do
that and it'll update he's also given
instant access to his holiday so how
many days has been given for the year
how many days has he taken and so on and
down here is the employee engagement bit
where it shows him whether or not he's
being given award so what we're trying
to do is encourage your employees when
we first go live to go in have a go try
entering a day's holiday maybe updating
their emergency contacts or updating
their personal details and as when they
do that they'll immediately get awarded
sort of badge to show that they've done
that so as Brian if I come in I'm quite
keen to get my award so I'm going to go
into my personal details I can come in
here I can edit them now for the
purposes of this i'm just going to make
a quick change so for example on my
biographical information I'm just going
to update my blood type now the change
could be anything as long as it triggers
a change to the worker information in
the ad hoc reporting so if I just save
and close that really straightforward
for brian has come in it's been really
quick really intuitive but if he knows
goes back to his employee dashboard and
then you'll see here that he's now being
given immediately that badge to tell him
that he's updated his personal details
and he could then go through and do the
other ones as well so entering a day's
holiday or updating his emergency
contacts
now from a manager point of view what
then happens is if I login as Richard
McIntyre as Richard McIntyre I'm the
team manager so I can come in and have a
look at my team I can go to overview of
my team's details so the nice easy to
use cue cards where I can see everything
about my team but what I've also got now
is my additional tab which is my
managers views of whether or not
employees are logging in and whether
there are not they're engaged so here we
can see even though it's only the first
morning of going live from my 22 people
I've already had Emma and Rosa who are
very keen they've gone in and then
things i entered absence updating their
emergency contacts but there's brian
james as well so immediately for
managers point of view i can see what my
team are doing and I can introduce as I
say that simple element of gamification
to encourage employees to go in and give
things a try so that shows you how the
content can work it's not intended that
you would deploy this exactly the way
that it's built for your customer
connect the idea really is just to
generate some ideas for you get you
thinking about how and whether you might
like to utilize this approach to
encourage your employees to get in and
get involved when you roll out new
capabilities the next part of the video
is going to briefly take you through
setting this up but what I would
recommend is once you set it up is you
have a good look at the reports and how
they're built so that you understand
exactly what's going on the one thing
that this video won't cover is the
security access you'll need so if you
are going to roll this out to your
employees you'll need to think about how
you give them access to the appropriate
information within the OTB I've subject
areas all of the employee reports do
have conditions on them which mean it
only return your own record but you do
need to think through how you would
deploy that for your organization so
let's move on now to looking at how the
content is set up so in terms of setting
this content up it's very
straightforward the first thing you need
to do is bring in the content into the
BI catalog so you can see here that I'm
within the BI catalog and you need to
utilize the files that are on customer
connect so the first archive file needs
to go into custom dashboards so if I
highlight that folder and on archive the
one called HCMC we tab stop catalog
say okay to that and it will bring you
in a new set dashboards called HTM sweet
abs and then what you also have to do is
highlight the custom folder and an
archive the other catalog which is the
report so that's called engagement
catalogue now because the reports use
some icons you also need to bring in the
images so make sure you've got show the
hidden items checked on and then
highlight the images folder and this
time rather than archive you need to
upload so click on upload and then bring
in three different images obviously you
could define your own images and just
update the reports to use your own
images as well that's not a problem at
all so I've just got one for address
changes one for emergency and then the
one for holidays okay so i brought my
three extra images in and that's the
full extent of what i need to do on the
bi side if you'd used to do just want to
check that the dashboards actually
display then you can always open them so
HCMC we tabs when you open them up then
you should get a tab for the employee
awards and then the tab for the manager
awards as well and it should show all
the icons so that all appears to be
working fine so I've done the stuff on
the bi side the next bit is I just need
to find a home for them within the self
service interface so where I put them as
the employee was on the about me so if I
come up here as you can see I'm already
in a sandbox so if I come up to the
navigator and for me it's under the more
option then here I can go for tools and
structure and what I need to do is to
scroll down and find that about me area
so there it is you can see here if I
open it up then within there is the
personal information so I'm going to
choose that button okay so you can see
in here the personal information and
we've got all of the standard tabs and I
down at the bottom here there is an
empty tab so we can add information to
that so I'm going to call it reads or
something like that I can choose any of
the icons I want to from the list that's
available
okay so i'm going to go from my metal
platform so the one two three click on
OK and then you can say whether or not
it's visible if it's visible to everyone
if you want to put some expression
language in there so I'm for simplicity
stakes I'm just going to say it's
available to everyone and then I'm going
to save and close that ok i also need to
find a home for the managers dashboards
as well so i'm going to put that in my
team so you can see there under my team
now I've already got the extra tab
enabled in my environments for my team
so just need to go through and on your
environment just do the same thing so
once you've done both of those then
customize the work area pages for those
two areas so if i come into about me and
then choose personal information you can
see now that within this i've got the
extra tab with the icon that i
identified and it's very straightforward
now to add the dashboard to it i simply
go up and choose to customize or
personalize the work area pages i'm
going to do it at site level and then i
simply add content
navigate to the dashboards and then pick
the employee dashboard from within hmc
tabs so here we go employee awards click
on add and then close that down now once
you've done this you probably just want
to resize the screen a little bit so
make sure that that is sized accordingly
so you can drag and drop you can also
then configure the headings on the
section so I don't really want to show
employee awards on this so I'm just
going to hide that away go to display
options and then I'm not going to
display the header and I maybe not going
to Lowry size as I say it's up to you
how you configure these and then
basically once you've clicked on okay
that screen will now have that content
displayed and because I made it visible
to everyone that would be for all people
I need to go through and do exactly the
same on the team one so if I come back
to the home if I then go to my team now
at the moment as I say we've already got
this tab enabled in our demo environment
has already got some content in there so
what I'd need to do is to go through and
replace the content that's already there
with the manager dashboard in exactly
the same way you've just seen for the
employee once you've done that when you
then publish the sandboxes that gives
you the content you need to be able to
utilize the employee awards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
