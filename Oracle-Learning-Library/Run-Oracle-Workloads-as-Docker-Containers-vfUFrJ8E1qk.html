on Oracle services like Oracle database
WebLogic server coherence and Java JRE
as docker containers these Oracle
containers are available on docker store
and you can run them using all core
container cloud service let me demo that
to you by pulling a wls image and
running it as a container and then
launching the WS admin console once I've
logged into container cloud service
first thing to do is to define the new
registry definition for the docker store
you only have to do this the first time
once it's defined you don't have to do
it again I set the URL to index dot Java
dot IO sir store and then use my docker
credentials for the username and
password and we'll have docker store as
the description
there's even a validate button here to
test the connection once I've saved the
new registry definition for the docker
store I'm done now let's create a new
service and contain a cloud service for
the wls image I'm going to pull from the
dollar store let's call it awls service
all the other defaults are fine here now
I can go to the dollar store and find
the wls image that I want to pull down
and deploy a search for Oracle WebLogic
server AHA there it is now to click the
get content button agree to the Terms of
Service and click the get content button
again
handily the command to run the wls
container is shown in the description
there's copy the one that explicitly
specifies the host port at 7001 and
paste that back into the container cloud
service user on the docker run tab and
save the service now I can deploy the
wls image as a running container just by
clicking the deploy button next to the
service on the services page and click
deploy again and there is running to
prove it's running let's login to the
wls article admin console to do that I
need to find out the IP address if the
VM is running on I can find that on the
deployments page by clicking on the host
name now let's copy the public IP
address into a browser along with a port
number and the word console start the
admin console and there it is web server
is running so to prove that let's login
and to do that I need to get the
username and password let's go back to
container cloud service to find those
they're in the containers log file
okay so here's the username that's easy
enough to remember WebLogic and here's
the password so I'll copy and paste that
that's a bit more tricky back in the wls
console window let's plug in those
credentials WebLogic and the password I
just copied login and here's the admin
console we've now got WS running as a
docker container how easy was that
we've deployed the WS docker image from
the docker store directly into my Oracle
cloud platform account through the
container cloud service if you don't
have an account yet go to
cloud.oracle.com - try it and get one
with free credits to try it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
