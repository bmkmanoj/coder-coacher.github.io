provide a great way to export and import
your cloud database right from the
service console this feature enables
seamless migration up to exadata Express
from predecessor schema service
instances note this process creates
export zip files in Oracle storage cloud
service classic so you must have a valid
account there before you begin get
started by clicking on manage in the
schema service console notice the button
that says export to cloud storage click
on export to cloud storage then on
create export
now enter required information about the
target cloud storage container starting
with its full URL this URL can be found
on your cloud storage service console as
a convenience if you haven't already set
up a cloud storage container you can
choose to create one automatically the
name of your new container will be
whatever is specified at the end of the
URL continue by entering your cloud
storage username and password
enter a name for the export zip file
choose whether to export only data
structures or include both structures
and stored data lastly click on create
export to finish this will export your
entire schema back in the initial export
dialog this export now appears in the
export job log with the status of
requested it may take a while for the
export to finish depending on how much
data is included refresh the current
status by closing and reopening this
dialog
and there we are the export has
completed successfully next suppose we
want to copy this schema export into an
Exadata Express cloud database this
involves importing it from the cloud
storage container into Exadata Express
start by switching to the exadata
Express service console
navigate to the manage tab click on
import from cloud storage then create
import
once again enter required information
about the cloud storage container
including URL username and password
here we see a list of export zip files
that were found in the cloud storage
container select the export zip file we
generated previously note if schemas
with the same name already exists in
exadata Express then conflicting
imported scheme as will be renamed with
a timestamp at the end we can make
further naming adjustments from the
sequel command line later lastly click
on create import to finish back in the
initial dialog this import now appears
in the import job log with a status of
requested refresh the current status by
closing and reopening this dialog all
done the import job has completed
successfully
now we can connect to the imported
schema in exadata Express as normal and
immediately begin running queries on it
note if you have defined custom database
roles and privileges you included apex
apps and the exported and imported
schema or you have rest services running
on the cloud database then there may be
some post import steps you need to
complete please refer to the end-user
documentation for more information about
post import steps
thank you and enjoy using schema service
to Exadata Express migration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
