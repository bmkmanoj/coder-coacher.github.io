the esti curriculum group at Oracle here
I'm going to show you how to configure a
dribbling data source in WebLogic server
12c such data source will access an
Oracle RAC server using a single client
access name or scan configuration
initially we will make sure that the
rack server being accessed is available
invisible over the network through its
scan name we must use the svr CTL or
server control tool to configure and
verify the status of both staff the scan
listener and scan the ultimate test
however is using the tennis ping utility
providing the scan name which identifies
the rack server to make sure that it is
accessible over the network once you are
satisfied with the preliminary checks
and you are sure that the rack server is
available accessible you can use the
WebLogic administration console to
create the good link data source so
let's get started first will access the
a DBMS Enterprise Manager utility to
verify that the rack server is running
and to check its name
the Oracle Enterprise Manager shows an
overview of the RAC instance which we
want to accessed from what logic its
name is iraq dot local domain and the
cluster name is OS 6 - 1 1 2 - can we
use Patti to connect to to one of the
servers hosting the rocky instance
we will be using five commands to
perform all the necessary checks to make
sure that WebLogic Gridlink can access
the iraq instance first we will be using
server control config scan listener
which displays the configuration of the
scan listeners available to the cluster
secondly we will be using server control
status scan listener which shows the
status of the scan listener we want to
make sure that the scan listeners are
both enabled and running we will be
using them a server control config scan
which displays the scan name and the
virtual IP addresses associated to it
the fourth command is a server control
status scan which shows the status of
the scan we want to verify that all
nodes participating to the cluster have
the virtual IPS
enabled and running finally the TNS ping
command will make sure that the rack
instance named rack is a resolved by the
TNS the last check that we will perform
is to use sequel plus to connect
remotely to the rack instance here
server control shows three configured
listeners which are reported to be
enabled and running server control also
displays the scan name or in six - one
one two - scan Tina's pin shows the rack
instances reachable finally a connection
attempt is made through simple plus once
connected a sequel queries issue to find
out the instance name server host and
service name
after having made sure that the Rockies
this is accessible we use the WebLogic
administrative console to configure the
Gridlink datasource
we start by locking the administration
panel to prevent concurrent changes then
we expand the services node of our
domain structure and select data sources
a set of forms will appear guiding us
through the configuration steps we will
have to briefly resume our pattie
session to find out the oracle
notification services tips tcp/ip port
which is a parameter required for a
griddling data source configuration
finally we will taste both listeners and
RNs notes to make sure that Gridlink
can contact them the last step is to
save the configuration and release the
lock first we connect to the WebLogic
administration console then we expand
the services link in the domain
structure selecting data sources before
making any change we click the lock and
edit button we create a new data source
choosing grid link data source from the
pop down menu a new form appears there
is a database driver we select the JDBC
driver for grid link application
continually in the new form we select
one phase commit and click Next
then we choose to enter the complete
JDBC URL when the connection properties
form appears on-screen first we erase
the full database user name and we
replace it with our specific database
user Oracle the JDBC URL for a scan
configuration must follow the convention
shown in the grey caption before leaving
the floor we must provide a password
twice the next form allows for the
testing of the listeners just defined
upon a successful test a feedback string
is displayed in the messages window
stating the connection succeeded we must
now find out the Oracle notification of
service remote pool number so we resume
our para session
connected to one of the servers of the
cluster we must display the content of
the RNAs dot config file located in
Oracle home slash OPM n slash conf in
this truck installation the remote port
number is 6200 we go back to the
WebLogic admin console and in the RNA
sky configuration form we enter all
nodes participating in the cluster
suffixing the oil export the specific
graph consists of two nodes so we add
two entries rock one and iraq to a new
panel is displayed in the form allowing
for the testing of all oil nest nodes we
click on the test button and after a few
seconds we'll receive the feedback from
the system informing us that the onus
nodes were contacted successfully we
have now the option to deploy the newly
created release data source on the
entire web logic cluster or on a
selected node we choose to deploy it on
the entire cluster the last remaining
step is to save the new configuration
and activate all changes this last
operation completes our demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
