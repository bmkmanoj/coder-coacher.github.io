gonna look at the M beam browser for
Mission Control so this is the mbeans
tab group I have pulled up here and you
have an M being browser tab and a
triggers tab the triggers tab we'll talk
about in a separate demo but the ambient
browser tab shows all that attribute
information it allows us to do various
things with that that we saw earlier so
if I click on let's say operating system
here you'll see all sorts of information
displayed and I can mouse over that and
I get detailed information about what
that attribute does etc so you see at
the top of the page here I've have an
attributes tab and operations tab
notifications and metadata so we'll look
at each one of those in turn but first
here while we're in attributes let's
let's see what we can do with that and
I'm gonna go here to the Eden space and
we looked at that earlier in a previous
demo I'm gonna go ahead and look at that
used attribute let's say I wanted to to
graph that if I right-click it notice I
can visualize so if I click that look at
that those are the default charts that
are on the general tab so if I click on
add it adds a chart I click OK
and now if we switch back to the general
tab and I scroll down I've just added an
Eden spaced chart like I did in a
previous demo so you can do that you can
update your your interface for the for
the general tab they are from the mbeans
tab group which is pretty cool so I'm
going to go ahead and I reset this
and then let's go back to the mbeans tab
so that's what you can do with
attributes you can look at them see what
the information is about that and you
know graph it if you wish or whatever
the operations tabs allows you to
perform operations on certain attributes
so in this case I want to gonna go ahead
and close up the memory pool there and
let me open up hotspot diagnostic and
this has a couple attributes where I can
query the virtual machine so I'm gonna
go ahead and choose get VM and with that
I can actually do queries on the virtual
machine so this is one parameter it
takes a value so let's try let's find
out what the max tenuring is set to on
this virtual machine so if I say max
entering threshold then click execute
then I can see that that is set to the
default value of 15 so we can do that we
can we can do queries against certain
attributes and get data back and another
thing we can do some values is we can
actually go in here and set them so so
for example I've got a well this this
has a set vm option so I can actually
set VM values from here so let's say I
wanted to turn on the GC details output
for the program I'm running so I can do
print GC details and I'm gonna set that
so true and if I hit execute I don't get
an error message so that executed so if
I jump back to my virtual machine
I should see right here my garbage
collection details be printing up
printing out to the console so that's
what I would expect
so it's pretty cool so if you want to
change your experiment stuff you can do
it right from the mission control
interface so if I want to turn that off
I simply go back here set this to false
execute again
once again no error message so I think
that worked and if I jump back I should
see that I'm no longer getting the
output so cool stuff we can also look at
notifications the notifications tabs
allows us to get any sort of information
that we want to be notified about so if
I go to the garbage collection
aggregator here that particular
attribute I can ask to be notified when
a garbage collection takes place so I'm
gonna go ahead and select that and I'm
gonna click Subscribe now every time
there's a garbage collection as there
was one just there I'm gonna get a
message about that in this log here
below so let's go ahead and let it
accumulate a few there we go that's good
and then I'm just going to turn that
back off and you can see here that you
can go in and look at the details of
what that message was about so I had a
garbage collection and I can dig deeper
into there find out what kind it was it
was a minor it looks like and as I dig
in
I have things like time before time
after the thread count memory usage
before so you can find out there's lots
of detailed information here you can
drill into about garbage collection but
anyway that gives you an idea what the
three tabs are for metadata is basically
just metadata about a particular
attribute so if I highlight that
attribute then you'll see just metadata
that's related to that so that's
basically what the mbeans browser does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
