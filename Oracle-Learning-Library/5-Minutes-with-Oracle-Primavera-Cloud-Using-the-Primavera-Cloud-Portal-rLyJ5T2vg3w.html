hi this is Matt with the Oracle
Primavera curriculum team in this video
we'll look at some basics to help you
get started with Primavera cloud you can
access Primavera cloud applications by
using a web browser to login to the
Primavera cloud portal administrators in
your organization set up your user
account and grant you access to
Primavera cloud applications when this
process is complete you'll receive an
email with your username and a temporary
password follow the instructions to
reset your password you'll also set up
challenge questions which will be used
if you have a problem with your password
and need to reset it after completing
these steps log into the Primavera cloud
portal in the portal tiles are present
for Primavera cloud applications any
applications your organization is not
licensed for will be grayed out with
links available for more information on
those applications you can launch an
application you've been granted access
to by clicking its icon or the first
link within its tile the applications
are web-based launching one opens a new
browser tab with an active session for
that application Primavera p6 has some
additional application links if you're
using p6 team member this is also a
web-based application and will launch in
a new browser tab the p6 professional
client is not web-based if you need to
use this application your first option
is to click the link to install it
follow the instructions to perform a
click once installation this installs
and configures the client on your local
workstation note that the database where
the p6 data is stored is still located
on a Primavera cloud server your second
option is to access the client through
Primavera virtual desktop this allows
you to run p6 professional using a
remote connection to a server where it
is installed negating the need to
install it locally
both Primavera p6 and Primavera unifier
have links for Web Services instructions
web services
is an advanced integration tool used for
purposes such as programming the import
and export of data between Primavera
applications and other systems
if you require access to web services
note the link in the instructions is not
active and you must copy and paste it
into a browser we'll wrap up by quickly
looking at the additional links at the
bottom of the page Primavera gateway is
another integration tool with a simple
user interface for integrating Primavera
applications the Primavera cloud
administration application is used for
managing cloud users while the users are
actually stored an Oracle Identity
Manager there is a link for
documentation on managing cloud users
the Oracle business intelligence
products offer solutions for analytics
and reporting while bpm is used for
managing business processes thank you
