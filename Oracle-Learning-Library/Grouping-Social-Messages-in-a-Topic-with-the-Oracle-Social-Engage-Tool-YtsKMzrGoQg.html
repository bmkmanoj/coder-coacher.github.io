engagement and monitoring presents
creating a topic topics can capture
conversations that are relevant to your
product and they can help you make
business decisions so to get started go
to the topics page and choose create a
new topic I want to capture relevant
conversations about Oracle's Java
product so I will name my topic Java and
create a new group called Oracle that
will group similar topics together you
can enter some search terms or phrases
so here I'll enter Java and then click
Add
note that it's not necessary to enter a
hashtag because the tool will search for
Java as well as hashtag Java in addition
the query will use the database or
function which returns social media
content that contains Java the
programming language notice that each
time I add a term it appears here under
topic properties so let's click preview
to see the results on the messages page
you see all the social media messages
retrieved for the topic the themes page
groups messages by their contextual
meaning so here you see that the Java
search term is used in the context of
software and programming as well as
other items that relate to the Java
Island and Java coffee it's really easy
to exclude the themes that you don't
want so to exclude City I will click
less like this and to exclude items that
are related to the island I will click
less like this for the theme west spicy
is for coffee and that's another theme
to exclude there are some items that I
want to include so I will choose
scripting and click more like this
and choose install and click more like
this so looking back at the topic
properties the semantic filters that I
have applied are listed here click
preview to see the new results so there
is another theme that I would like to
exclude so I will do that now but you
should note that you don't have to
exclude or include everything it's only
the themes that are clearly desirable or
undesirable so clicking preview again I
can see that I might want to get rid of
the term island but otherwise it looks
good on the media types page you can see
the social media sources most of the
sources for our topic are from message
boards blog posts and then tweets if you
want you can further filter your search
using Advanced Options so here I will
enter the keyword Oracle so I'm done I
can choose save and my results will be
displayed on the dashboard so that's how
easy it is to create a topic in social
engagement and monitoring please see our
documentation at the URL listed and see
more demos at the Oracle Learning
Library thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
