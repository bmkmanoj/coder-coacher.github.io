to show you what is new with the same
builder you've seen previously another
video where I presented all the features
that scene builder has but in that video
would happen was there wasn't really
connection between the same builder and
NetBeans so pretty much we have both of
them open and we have to go back and
forth to be able to work with them now
is different now there is a very
integration so I'm gonna show you what
are the new features that you could have
in NetBeans 7.2 working together with
the same builder in the previous
exercise also some people ask me where
they can find exercises so the issue
tracking light demo all the code for the
controller and everything can be found
in the samples seed path that comes with
the same builder so if you go to the
download website for the scene builder
you will see also that there is a sample
file so download r1 unzip it and then
you will find the issue tracking light
that is the project we're gonna be using
so so far I have same building style
installed on my machine and I have
NetBeans 7.2 we can go ahead and open
the issue tracking light so depends
where you unzip the file you will find
this particular project and so there's a
few things that has been already created
for you so for example we already have a
Java controller so we have an issue
light controller and if we open up is
it's not really rocket science there is
a bunch of imports that we have
available and we have some of the
components UI components that are gonna
be created on F XML file so we're gonna
create them using same builder you can
see that we have here the annotations so
this is meaning that this particular
bottom for example will be injected from
F XML file okay we have some resources
we have a CSS file we already have a F
XML file we can actually double click
and what it's gonna do is actually gonna
open up the same builder for me
so this is already a creating file I'm
not going to spend a lot of time in in
the same builder
I mean we're gonna spend some time but I
don't want to go into every single
detail because this has been covering
the previous recordings what I want to
really focus on is in the integration
with NetBeans so here you can actually
see the window the screen that we're
gonna be creating here so let let me
just close this one so what we're gonna
do we're gonna rename this particular
file and we're gonna create a new one
okay I'm just gonna rename this as ol
and we can come and create a new file
either from the icon here or you can
come to file new file
okay so we have JavaFX and we're gonna
create an empty F XML file okay we want
to name it the same we shoot talking
light and what I want to do is I do want
to use the Java controller we do not
want to create a new one because we
already have one so we want to use an
existing one so we dig into here just
make sure we are in the great directory
now we pick that Java controller and
then it's also asking for their style
sheet that we are using so yes we do
have a CSS file we just need to use the
existing one and make sure you select
that one okay finished so what is gonna
happen it's just an empty F XML file has
been created so if you double click
again we're gonna get the same builder
okay with this new issue tracking light
but so few things so because we create
this F XML from mappings it already
knows about the controller so we go here
inside the code you already see them we
do have the controller class is there
and also we can pay attention to the CSS
files so if we go to properties we can
see also that the stylesheet is being
already is it already there so a few
things that change from the previous
video that I recorded so before we get
any further I just want to go and change
the dimensions so we have a little bit
more space to work with and as we seen
previously in the previous recording for
the same builder this is pretty much
dragging and dropping components so we
have a split panel we drag it and drop
it and we have the tool to modify to be
able to fit that a whole container ok we
resize ok doesn't really matter how much
and then we need a straight panel so
again we drag it and drop it we feed the
parent and then we resize one more time
okay another thing that goes different
so right now we want to bring is we want
to print unless you so we drag it and
drop it and we ask the tool to fit the
part
so in the properties if you remember
correctly we need to set the ID
previously in the other video we
actually needed to type the ID manually
so no anymore because it already knows
that this file already have the pointer
for the controller so already knows the
names of the components are gonna be
injected so we can actually just expand
the list and we can see that list is one
of them I disabled so this is the one I
want to use for the list then we're
gonna bring a table so there is a table
view we track drop and modify to fit the
parent again we need an ID for the table
very nicely
we can actually nose and take the table
from the available list of ID's okay
something also new before we didn't
manipulate that comes from the table we
can actually select the columns and pick
also the ID so we are gonna modify we
said it's gonna be the color name ID and
it's gonna be name for the text to be
displayed
we'll pick up the second one for the
second one we have the status and we
need a third one a new one so we can
actually come here table column drag it
and drop it again ID we have Sigma axis
sign OPS's and then the text to be this
play is the same okay
look it and now for this and continue
well here I also wanna do set the ID so
there will be details okay and we start
populating this area here so very simple
we need a label you just drag it and
drop it in the properties again we
select the name display issue label okay
then we're gonna bring a text field and
drag and drop you see the guidelines
that is helping us make sure things are
aligned properly for the ID see that
because we have been assigning the IDS
already so the lists are getting smaller
so that means she cannot assign the same
ID twice which is actually very
convenient so for this one will be sign
OPS's the prompt s local sign offices
and there's no text so
okay then we need another label we'll
just drag it and drop it this is gonna
be just the description and I think this
one doesn't really need an ID so I'm
gonna just leave it like that and I need
a text area just drag it and drop it
which is the resize you need to resize
again we do have the guideline so I know
exactly where to place it and we need an
ID and this gonna be description file so
pretty easy now again the IDs are there
it for you available rather than type in
and you know it could actually lead to
mistakes if you miss type any of the ID
that doesn't really match with your file
so it's very very convenient that these
ideas are already providers rather than
you have to type them okay another thing
that we want to see is how we set the
layout so if we go back here to the
anchor panel we can actually group
components so I can actually go ahead
and select project ID with project ID
and this M text field so we can actually
arrange wrap them into an horizontal box
okay and I can make sure in the layout
that these box actually resize properly
so I want to do that this horizontal box
is gonna be our course to the right and
left borders of the containers will
always grow horizontally for the text
field itself
I wanted to always fight for a space
available horizontally as I always
wanted to grow so I can come here to
horizontal grow and select always for
the string I do not want a shrink to
disappear
so you know when you start shrinking
your windows you will get dot-dot-dot
I don't want that to happen so I want
the minimum width to be pretty far
inside prefer size
okay and the text area I want to anchor
to all the different top bottom right
and left so we'll be just anchored to
the container itself we can always view
the sample data so I know how things are
kind of looking and I can actually
preview my application so this is just
the preview remember this is no real
data but allows allows to make sure that
everything is working properly if I
resize the components they do resize
properly
okay now CSS files so we know that we
are using the very set up the CSS file
for the project so for example I can
select the main container and I can just
go to properties and say that the start
calls that we're gonna be using is thing
for example now I'm going to resize
things a bit so I have a space for the
bottoms at the top so we just resize the
screen a little bit we'd better save the
file I forgot to save it and now we're
gonna bring some air image and image so
I'm gonna import from media and then
we're gonna go to my directory so you go
wherever you unzip your project okay
there it is go to source is your
tracking light and then you will have
your image okay
just reorganize things update will bring
two buttons three buttons and then we
can actually do copy and paste so I need
three of them we just go a little bit
the left so I can actually organize
things
on three I can actually group them and
again arrange them into an inch box and
then just reason we organize things a
bit so make sure it's alone and then I
can go to layout and I can set the
constraints to be anchored to the top
aren't white and also in the properties
I can set that the spacing between them
is gonna be 15 now for each bottom I
need an ID so in half the lid issue and
the text to be displayed it's gonna be
delete we have the second one it's gonna
be safe issue and the first one it's
gonna be me with you so you saw how we
use all the IDS available okay so what
what we're missing right now is just the
action start to be that is that going to
take place whenever you click one of
these bottoms so if we go back to
NetBeans to the controller we can see
that we have few methods here so we can
see initialization we have new issue
fire we receive an actual event and it's
actually void method it doesn't return
anything we have to leave issue fire
again actual event
void and it doesn't return anything and
the last one save issue file so these
are the method that actually could be
used for the bottoms so again we can
actually go to the code we have own
action and we can see that the list has
are being already populated for me so we
know the tool will be able to bring for
you those methods are available for
actions in this case mouse click and
stuff like that so we have new issue
fire that will be the method that is
gonna be called whenever the new button
get hit
select that one for it's safe we have
safe issue fire and for the delete we
have delete issue file see that the
method in different with the IDs to not
disappear because more than one places
he can be calling the same method so
they are not just just one so in
different places of your code could be
invoked in the same method okay
so delete finally we save it and now
let's go back to NetBeans and let's run
the code just to make sure that
everything is working properly
okay so we have the projects here you
select a project it gets the information
here you create a new one so you can see
that down here a new one got created we
can actually type some information and
we can save it okay cut safe and you can
also delete it and it goes away so
pretty much everything is working one
last piece let's bring our because the
CSS file has been specified let's see
how you can actually use it in the code
so the going back to scene builder we
can select the list we can go to
properties we can set this style class
will be dark list so you will see that
it totally changed let's save it let's
run it one more time so we can see now
the wheel using the definitions in them
the week we have in their CSS form okay
so now you can see the dark list and
again everything is working properly so
thank you so much again this was a
little update about sim builder how we
do have a better integration with
NetBeans in this case NetBeans 7.1 and
again staying tuned for new demos and
new updates in the tools thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
