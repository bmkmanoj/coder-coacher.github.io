infrastructure tagging consider this
scenario you have multiple cloud
resources for example compute instances
load balancers and block volumes across
multiple compartments in your tenancy
it is becoming increasingly hard for you
to track resources use for specific
purposes report on them or take bulk
actions on them does this sound familiar
say for example you tagged the instances
in a compartment it will be easier for
you to track those instances
absolutely in fact sometimes I add PHX
project for two rck to one Fe D to a
title of a compute instance to remind
myself of its purpose is there a way to
organize resources more efficiently
certainly the Oracle cloud
infrastructure tagging system allows our
customers to tag resources in any
organizational scheme that they choose
which allows them to more richly
organize control manage and report on
their cloud resources the service
enables users to filter control access
and perform bulk actions on a set of
resources based on the tag
tagging allows you to define keys and
values and then associate them with
resources to make it easier for you to
organize these resources based on your
business needs by creating and applying
tags you can filter lists of resources
tagged with specific tags from any
service that supports tagging
interesting what exactly is a tag
a tag is a key and a value let's
consider an instance
we're environment is the key and
production is the value in the Oracle
cloud infrastructure tagging system the
key and value are strings without any
constraints which is supported with
freeform tags but we also support
defined tags where the key and value
have a schema
freeform tag a basic metadata
Association that consists of a key and a
value only freeform tags have limited
functionality freeform tags do not have
any constraints or defined schema anyone
who has access to a resource can use
freeform tags you can filter lists on
freeform tags but you cannot use
freeform tags for policy or access
control
define tag these tags have a defined
schema which constrained the values you
can apply to a tag you can also restrict
access to define tags a defined tag is
the instance of a key definition that is
applied to a resource it is comprised of
a namespace a key and a value
the term tag is used generically to
refer to defined tags
freeform tags are a great introduction
to tagging but we recommend defined tags
for enterprise scenarios before you
create a defined tag key you first setup
a namespace for it
I see what is a namespace
the namespace is like a container for a
set of defined tags
unlike freeform tags defined tag support
policies the namespace is the entity to
which you can apply policies
namespace consists of a name and zero or
more tag key definitions tag namespaces
are not case-sensitive and must be
unique across the tenancy
let me explain with an example in the
example Human Resources is the namespace
environment is the tag key and
production is the tag value tag key
definition a tank key definition defines
the schema of a tag and includes a
namespace and tankey tag value the tag
value specifies the value for the key
Tagg he is the name you use to refer to
the tag tag keys are case-insensitive
printable ASCII tag keys for define keys
must be created in a namespace a tag key
must be unique within a namespace
can I tag all my resources
we do support most resources we believe
the power of tags are unleashed when
most resources are taggable let me
provide you a list on which resources do
support tagging under the block volume
service volumes and volume backups
support tagging under the compute
service instance instance image console
histories and volume attachments support
tagging under the database service DB
systems and databases support tagging
under the iam service groups
compartments tenancy policies and
identity providers support tagging under
the load balancing service load
balancers support tagging under the
object storage service buckets support
tagging we are always working to add the
ability to tag more resource types
detail list thank you how can I set up
tagging for my tenancy and tag my
resources
tagging is a platform service and
available to all tenants by default
you can tag resources by using the
console you can use the command-line
interface to apply tags to resources or
you can use SDK to automate the
management of tags tags can also be
applied when creating resources
can all users modify or remove a tag
that has been applied to a resource
not all users can manage tags tagging
integrates with Oracle cloud
infrastructure authorization system only
if you have used or managed access to
the tag namespace and the resource can
you add or remove or edit the tag on
that resource tagging integrates with
our authorization system giving you
policy controls to enable delegation or
restriction of tag manipulation
permissions to apply update and delete
freeform tags to a resource are included
in the use permission for the resource
for example users who can use instances
in compartment testing can also apply
update or delete freeform tags on
instances in compartment testing
permissions to apply update or delete
defined tags for a resource means users
must be granted the use permission for
the defined tag and must also have the
use permission for the resource
permissions to view freeform tags or
defined tags for a resource are included
in the inspect permission for the
resource so users who can view instances
in compartment testing can also view any
freeform tags or defined tags applied to
the instance based on the permissions
specified by an IAM policy you can
update only that specific tag or a tag
namespace
as mentioned earlier you can only retire
at AG key definition if you retire at AG
key definition then the tag key and
definition may not be used on new
resources
however if you have current resources
with those tags they will continue to
retain the same tags you will have to
individually remove the tags from all
existing resources
are there any specifications for
creating tags
yes only specific characters are allowed
for tag namespaces and keys allowed
character set printable ASCII letters
not allowed character set dot and space
tag value allowed character set Unicode
not allowed character set none and name
spaces name must be unique in the
tenancy here's the table that shows
minimum and maximum limits
the maximum size of all the tags on a
resource may be five kilobytes
thanks for the exhaustive overview
tagging makes managing resources simple
I can filter tagged resources using the
status equal to critical and the project
equal to 51 tags to find which resources
are essential to that project and take
action only on those resources
very well said by using defined tags you
can prevent the accidental sprawl of
many similar but misspelled tags in
total Oracle cloud infrastructure
provides a robust way to control and
govern the use of tags tagging is a
powerful foundational service for Oracle
cloud infrastructure because when all
instances and services can be tagged
that allows administrators to write
comprehensive management scripts and
policies based on their own
organizational structure that they
define by tags please go to the Oracle
