with Java ME for 10 or 12 years now and
today we're gonna talk Andre and I are
gonna talk about adding some new
features to Java ME to enable service
delivery on Java ME just a quick note
for the legal folks they have some
interest to make sure that we don't over
commit to the things that we're talking
about today these are proposals for our
new technologies you know potentially to
be made available on the on the Java ME
platform so services are pretty pretty
common term shows up nearly everywhere
today from smartphones to backends it's
sort of the term itself is probably
pretty well overused but so we asked in
the mobile in the feature phone into the
spectrum what can we do with services
for for Java and me because they're
everywhere else it seems like there's a
real need to make them available on
feature phones or to have a service
framework a service concept in ecosystem
Java has products from servers to small
phones and they all support at different
in different ways services that are used
by one from one client to or provide it
to another client so today we're just
going to talk about how to make Java
applications be able to provide services
to other Java applications
so in we're drawing a bunch of
functionality out of Java SE down to
Java ME and in the Java SE there's this
concept of services a service interface
and a service provider the service
interface defines sort of what the
service does what its arguments are and
since it's expressed in terms of a Java
Java interface it's pretty clear pretty
straightforward and a good match for the
Java Runtime services that both provide
and consume are consumed by applications
and they're provided by bits of Java
code in various places including in
shared libraries so as I said the
service itself is defined
the Java interface and that makes it
very clear very crisp definition so in
Java and me we sort of looking back a
little bit I noticed that the first Java
ME specification for silly C was done
finished in in 2000 and since then we've
had several other specifications in the
mobile world the the primary
specification for the profile which
provided most of the application
functionality was in in mid P there have
been three versions mid p1 mid p2 and
mid p3 in mid p2 mid p1 was very simple
sandbox type application mid p2 added
quite a lot more functionality at the
platform but you still packaged your
entire application as a single jar file
so it was sort of a monolithic runtime
application runtime do you configured
the developer basically completely put
all of every bit of functionality they
wanted to be in the application into a
single jar file and that you know and
that's the way they shipped it but it
made it so that all that work was very
early bound into the app there wasn't
any way to do it later on so there
wasn't any way to make you know these
are sort of isolated single applications
in mid p3 the concept of shared
libraries was introduced in the
specification that allowed an
application to be built out of sort of
the core application and then individual
pieces of code that were packaged
together at the time that the
application was distributed and put on
the device
they also beefed up the support for
multi-threading in Java ME and feature
phones and the ability to run things in
the background and defined and
inter-process communication mechanism so
the two applications could talk to each
other over essentially a pipe or a
socket and that was those capabilities
together made it possible to create a
library which had a very nice Java
interface to some service communicate to
another process using the unit process
communication facility which would then
actually provide the service so there's
sort of sort of a complete cycle there
of how develop service libraries and
distribu
computation the with that model you get
to decouple the you know the consumer of
the service from the provider of the
surface but you still have a fairly
static arrangement of the libraries that
get linked into a application and
distributed onto the device so you guess
yourself sort of is that enough you can
build a lot of things with that model
but you it's still early bound at the
time you install the application in the
device that's all the functionality you
get out of that application you know
whatever the developer put into the jar
files to begin with so there's no way to
at some later state late stage add new
functionality or even re-implement a
service that the application is using
and there's always the one
implementation in the library that was
shipped by the development by the
developer and packaged and so we kind of
asked ourselves like well can we do
better can we extend the model one step
further and we came to this idea of
building on that with a bit broader of a
service framework and Andre petition
cough is going to go through the aspects
of how how we made brought that to
fruition
okay so here's here's that what we
proposed to to to implements to think
this to have the missing capabilities so
basically we code service framework and
it's based on existing Java technology
and serves the needs to fill the fill
the gap between Java C and Java me to
bring the two well two separate
currently separate worlds worlds closer
together it introduces a new level of
flexibility and capabilities for Java ME
applications and solutions it enables
new ways for monetization for the
developers well by actually allowing the
applications to copyright more
efficiently and to to be more in tight
communications
and another thing is that it allows a
later stage like a customization of
application or the solution so it's
performed not in a moment when the
developer has actually designed the
applications but after the applications
has been deployed so how we how we do
that actually our service framework
proposal consists of the following
pieces the service loader API you might
have seen this API in Java see it exists
for there for years it allows to
discover and narrate and instantiate the
instances of services of course the
essential part of the of the service is
the interface roger has been talked
about so there should be Java interface
defined which actually defines the
capability of the of the service and we
are making no no any restrictions on
that interface aside of the fact that
this interface should be the same for
the service provider and the service
consumer the service provider and
service consumer Java entities of course
that is Java applications shared
libraries or even the Java Runtime by
itself and last but not least is the
extensions to the application management
systems in order to allow to assemble
all these pieces together to function
properly so let's see how it works and I
will I will show it using a simple
example actually so the simplest example
we do have to me the suit ok so if you
see this mini suit one with one simple
midlet and me the c2 which is more
sophisticated a bit it contains a midlet
and lieblick bound with typical maybe
three liberal dependency and we want to
make available the functionality from
Lib Lib
to to be available to midlet one so how
would we do that using the service
framework we actually have to write the
following information into the into the
manifest and add files of these
applications Jeremy as you know is the
environment for resource constraint
devices so which is different to Java C
and we are putting more stuff to to be
done in a most static way other than the
dynamic as in Java C so that's why we
required to define some new attributes
to these applications so for midlet one
so here in green are new keywords
this is dependency we declare on a
service so I needed in p3 we do have two
types of dependencies on on the
functionality from Java Runtime other
standard to proprietary or dependency on
a little bit so we are introducing the
third one on the service and in the red
these are the names which allows at the
MS to bind these applications as needed
so here we give a name of the service
which is actually a Java class name
fully qualified name of the interface of
the service so here is calm example
codec set let's imagine our example is
actually a factory of some coders and
decoders so 4 meters u2 in manifest file
we define that for Libya - actually we
define that it takes exports a service
with the same name and in accordance
with service loader Java C API we have
to define they declared the names of the
implementation of that service of the
circle of that API so here is calm
example import standard collects in the
name which actually
the same as the name of the service
interface and here is the code of course
the interface the codec set we have
referred so in this example we do have
two functions get in polar by name and
get decoded by name their actual
implementation of the service provider
so you can see that this is a class of
course not an abstract one which
implements that interface and it has
public public it's this public class and
has public access constructor with no
arguments we should allow the service
framework to instantiate this this class
and to provide it to the consumer and on
the consumer consumer side with a call
in accordance to service loader
API we do have actually yeah we do have
this kind this kind of construct in
order to instantiate the service loader
capable of loading instances of that
interface and the simple function which
traverses the instances of loaders to
find out if there is anyone suitable so
well that's basically everything which
should be done in order to to allow
these this middle suits to copy rate so
once once all of this in place and if
you start middle suit one the AMS
and once you execute this this code EMS
would instantiate the instance of
service provider and provide that
instance to actual service consumer code
so what's under the hood or what's the
functionality and a side of the one
provided by the application developer of
course the big chunk of work is done by
the MS by tracking the dependencies
between service providers and summer
service consumer
as you kind of could have understood
from the the previous slide the service
loader API actually includes the service
provider into the execution context of
the service consumer so they are both
loaded into the same same space same
class loaders Joni doesn't have concept
of class loaders so everything is in one
one task and everything is working in
one gel heap and I directly accessible
with no need for inter-process
communication of any anyway and one more
task of the AMS is actually to provide
necessary actions on binding the service
providers and service consumers together
so that there are a number of you know
requirements with 4c in order to to make
consistent and doubles rules of making
providers as accessible to the consumers
so that's it the user if it's in Java
mobile device or system administrator is
if it's job embedded device would
understand what providers are available
and what are not
and we'll talk a little bit more about
this later on and one more thing to note
is that the service provider could be
exported only by the Lib lot and there's
a reason for that historically
joenie specification didn't allow
multiple instances of the midlet to be
executed in the one execution context
and we have no means of external of like
change in that instead with me p3 there
is a shared library context as she
shared a library concept and such we are
using that in the same manner so we are
actually loading that shared
library with a service provider into
their context of : application so that
is why only Libya can export the service
however we make no restrictions on
actually implementing service provider
within a midlet with this way just will
be available to that midlet and nobody
else so as we said the service could be
consumed by the label --it by the midlet
or even the Java Runtime by itself and
the important very important thing is
there is there security of course as we
are making some code actually available
to the application and probably the
application developer was not aware of
that code before that so of course it
opens the you know huge possibility for
the any security breaches attacks and
stuff like that
so we should be careful with given
proper security privileges for for the
service provider code in order not to
allow the untrusted service provider to
execute in the trusted context of the
application that is why we impose some
security constraints on service
providers both in terms of internals in
terms of security
you know domains of that so we basically
think to require that service providers
are always should belong to operate or
manufacture security domain or
alternatively they could be signed for
the same certificate as their consumer
so that if one person actually at one
developer creates both service provider
and service consumer and sense with the
same certificate of course that person
understands how they would work together
so that is a game and also we allow the
users to control what service providers
are available for
because service consumers if the user
doesn't trust some application it can
disallow service providers from debt
applications from that application to be
available for other applications and
well as I said typical service provider
would be a label it and we don't well as
you probably aware an mp3 it's not
possible to provision the live led by
itself label it was only provisioned
with together with a midlet which makes
a direct dependency on that limit and we
don't have any need to extend or to
change that in our proposal so basically
that we end up in heaven service
provider to be distributed as a
mid-latitude with with the midlet and
the limit and that's actually not not a
problem to have additional midlet to
accompany the service provider a little
bit because that milit can serve
multiple very various
proposes it provides a user visible
entity so as you probably aware it's not
possible or meet P doesn't you know make
any requirements on showing their limits
to the user once we have midlet its
shown in the AMS screen or you know in
small embedded in the list of installed
applications so the user or
administrator is aware about the fact
that service provider installed and also
this midlet can provide resistant
context so it is shared between all of
the service consumers as well as
additional disick yueshen context if
it's required so that mean it could be
started in separate process and do
whatever background task is needed a
couple of examples as I said this think
one of the goals of this thing is to
provide additional monetization
capabilities so what's the idea behind
that is that we allow
by using service framework to to define
the payment api's around payment
interfaces so that some payment systems
can make their engines accessible for
the users so that some for example store
clients or any other client applications
could make use of that payment system so
we end up in having this three pieces
three components solution the engine the
client and actually the user who decides
who who signs up with some payment
systems downloads the engine the
particular one belonging to the system
which the user has been signed for and
making the attention available for the
client application so before service
framework well we would require the the
client application to actually you know
think about what what payment system
user would like to use and that's that's
not convenient and that restricts the
number of markets or would require the
application developer to actually
compile and build different versions of
the application for different markets
with service framework it's not needed
the only thing which is needed is for
client and for payment system to agree
on the service interface and that's it a
couple of other examples the allocation
for example that would allow the
allocation GSR for example in Java me to
use additional location data providers
in form of of the service providers so
that's an example of having Java me
runtime make use of this framework to
extend its functionality and one more
example is social networking so that
service framework would allow the user
to
combine different pieces of the users
choice into a single solution which
would allow two to communicate in a way
which is you know convenient for that
particular user so that okay
this is one one example of mashup
experience and actually I have a team on
my mobile phone unfortunately I cannot
show it on the big screen if you're
curious I can show it after the session
so basically that's similar to what's
here not not exactly but just to give
you an overview of how that would work
in real world for example if there is a
Facebook client see and there is it you
know you can look to the Facebook data
and see their comments and pictures and
you'd like to post their photo but that
Facebook client is not designed well to
you know to take the photos out of your
camera but there could be a camera
application that's a different one which
would use service framework to actually
plug in into that Facebook client and to
provide the photo data to the Facebook
client which would in turn upload this
it to the Facebook so the full
application could be you know well
thought photo applications with
additional effects and stuff like that
which is and and the developer wouldn't
need to bother with all this Facebook
integration
I mean developer for application and
developer of Facebook client wouldn't
bother to to making nice photo effects
and data processing stuff like that but
using the serious avram service
framework these applications could
cooperate to provide an additional well
important experience to the user to
combine these things and to allow to
actually export a photo from the from
the camera from the camera or mobile
phone to
users Facebook page and one more thing
you probably get an idea from this gel
one you know agenda that Oracle puts
stresses that Java me is not only as the
solution for the mobile phones but which
is very important the solution for small
embedded devices for m2m market for HMI
communication HMI devices and like also
lots of examples of small at better
devices where Jeremy could benefit the
industry so service framework is
important for us boneheaded as well as
it would allow multiple teams to work
together on a single solution and
actually provoking the well-thought
interfaces between the components of the
system so that different teams could
work together and combine on the later
stages combine their work into a single
solution it also minimizes the
requirements on update of a software
because it would allow to update only
individual pieces of a solution only
individual libraries without me to
download everything at once which is
important for embedded so that's mostly
summary as you understood we have
proposed to make is service framework as
a core component of top of Jeremy eight
platform as we said service and service
providers are defined by the application
developers for application developers
for the applications not by them I show
Java ME standards or runtime it uses the
same API is as in Java scene it binds
service provider to the consumers at
runtime as opposed to compile time it
enables to design complex solutions
comprised from multiple pieces
and to allow us to to have anyway so to
compose and distribute and deploy the
applications
so here the list of sessions which might
be interesting to you with the same
context so you can see today we have a
session which talks about the new
proposed features to the SCO DC cotc GSR
as well as couple of our review sessions
later on for different aspects of Jame
Java mean so thank you any questions and
if you'd like to see the demo please
come by I can show you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
