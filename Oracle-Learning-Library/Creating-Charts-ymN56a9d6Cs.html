of project and portfolio data to a
dashboard for example this chart shows a
projects remaining labor units by work
breakdown structure this gives us a
quick indication of which areas of the
WBS have the most work to be completed
let's take a look at how to create this
chart all of your charts are displayed
on the charts page in the dashboards app
add new charts and use the context menu
to edit duplicate or delete type a name
and ID note that the chart ID is
auto-generated but can be edited next
choose a chart type such as pie bar and
bubble graphs for graphical
representations of data a status meter
to measure fields against thresholds and
a table to display data in a simple grid
for this example let's select pie chart
to show the distribution of labor units
next choose a subject area to determine
if the chart is based on activities
projects or scope items for this chart
we will report against activities select
a project to preview your chart against
use grouping to organize data for
example rather than displaying
individual activities let's group them
by WB s history range is available for
some chart types this is useful for
evaluating data over time
enable trending and then set a time
range to be analyzed use filters to
limit the data displayed in a chart for
this example we only want to view data
for critical activities select a field
to filter by in this case critical and
then set the operator and value
lastly set the data to display in the
chart select data types or use the
search feature for this example we want
slices for each WBS element the slice
size will be determined by the remaining
labor units there are several options to
configure the style of the chart for
example the position of the legend as
well as labels and titles click apply to
generate a preview of the chart save
when you are finished labor units is
displayed on the charts page and is
available to add to dashboards hover
over a slice to see its values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
