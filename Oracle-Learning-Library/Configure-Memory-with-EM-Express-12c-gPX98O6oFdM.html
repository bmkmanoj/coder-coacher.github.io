is Maria Billings I work for Oracle
server technologies curriculum in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
configure memory with iam Express 12c
well first view the memory settings and
look at the sge advisor and then for
learning purposes I will attempt to
configure the SGA to large so that you
can view the resulting error then I'll
configure the STA with a correct value
and in the whole process you can notice
how the memory and initialization
parameter pages are integrated to view
memory settings select configuration
than memory this page gives you
information about the memory settings
the SGA target the PG aid some
statistics here about the allocation
breakdown about the allocation history
that there was a change at 11:25 s
visible the top sessions that consumed
memory and an interesting part what I
want to particularly look at it's the
SGA advisor you see the current setting
here and you see that by improving the
memory there could be an improvement
over the overall performance so of
course you need to decide if for example
for gigabyte is possible within the
context of your maximum memory so let me
show you how this works
I click configure memory select the
memory target and click set and I'm
taking a high value that will produce an
error message of 8 and I click OK you
see here is the error because I exceeded
the the SGA target may not be greater
than the sgem exercise so having learned
that we are going back to a more modest
volume and I click OK
the parameter was updated successfully
what you saw from this brief
demonstration is that from the memory
page by clicking configure I immediately
moved to the initialization parameters
page if you look under configuration of
course when you click initialization
parameters you see all of them and you
have some the entry here to some other
interesting pages the database feature
usage in the current database properties
the slide gives you a summary of what I
just covered and it also shows this
video in the context of the mini-series
on AM Express 12c thanks for watching
