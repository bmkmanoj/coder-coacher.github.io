with server technologies curriculum
development I'm going to show you the
latest version of the Oracle Learning
Library and the new features and
functionalities that we added for this
latest update this is the Oracle
Learning Library or Oh L l for short
you can asset through the o TN or
directly by going to the URL shown here
the o ll is an external facing
application that anyone can use to
search for and access free training
content on Oracle products it contains
many different types of content created
by server technologies curriculum
development as well as other groups at
Oracle the home page is very intuitive
and straightforward designed to make it
easy to search for and find content and
as you'll see there's a variety of
different ways to search you can search
for content directly using this Google
like search area or you might choose to
browse through the featured content a
new promoted content area we added in
this latest revision or you might click
on any of the tags in the tag cloud to
see related content or you might
investigate the product family most
popular and latest editions shown down
here or you can perform an advanced
search from here specifying the exact
criteria for searching so let's start by
looking at these different ways of
searching and then we'll look at the new
features so let's begin with the
google-like search let's say I'm
interested in finding Java content I
type Java and I immediately see a list
of drop-down content related to this
topic I click enter and I presented with
a list of links of content related to
Java so I can scroll up and down and
look at this list or I can use the
content filter to specify the exact type
of content I'm looking for
you can also search from the featured
content area let's say I'm a sequel
developer interested in data modeler I
click this getting started link and I'm
presented with all the relevant content
items related to this series on data
modeler 3.0
you can also use tags to search for
content the number of a site each tag
and the tag cloud indicates the amount
of content tagged with that descriptor
so you can see here that the tag
application development has one hundred
and fifty three content items that have
that tag if I click the tag will see
those content items in the list so here
you see the list of all the different
content items tagged with the tag
application development and you might
have noticed that now we're on the
Advanced Search tab and we can use these
title product type description or any
other fields to search with and then one
final way to search is by using the
display groups shown down here you can
search by product family by most popular
and by latest edition and the links
listed under most popular in the latest
edition will take you directly to that
content so if I click this first link it
takes me directly to the content details
page for this tutorial so as you've seen
there are several different ways to
search for content as shown here now
let's look at what happens when you find
the content you're looking for the
content details page provides all the
details associated with this content
item
the release date the duration and so
forth this is the page where you launch
your content from it opens a separate
browser tab with the content if you want
to return to the learning library
simply click the originating tab if you
like the content and you want to return
to it later you can bookmark it so first
you need to login to your OTN account
and then once you've signed in you'll
notice that this bookmark link becomes
available
we click that and you can see the
bookmarks been added then we go to the
bookmarks tab you'll see the content
bookmarked here you may have noticed
this provide feedback link if you click
that link a new browser window opens
where you can provide feedback in the
comment field maybe on a link that
doesn't work or a suggestion or question
you have about content you can also
provide reviews and ratings on the
content you find in the o ll reviews are
made available to other people who
access this content if you add a review
a new browser window opens where you can
provide a rating as well as your review
here in the comment field you can see
all of the reviews you've made by
clicking under here my reviews tab this
review will also appear here along with
your rating in the reviews section you
may have also noticed the Facebook and
Twitter icons which allow you to like or
tweet about the content you find when
you click either these buttons a link
back to this content will be created on
your Facebook page and tweet it to
people who follow you on twitter you
might have also noticed the RSS feed
icon subscribe to this feed to stay up
to date on content added to Bo ll the
last feature I want to show you is the
About tab where you can get general
information about the Learning Library

general feedback click contact us and

user interface missing content or other
issues this feedback is emailed to a
