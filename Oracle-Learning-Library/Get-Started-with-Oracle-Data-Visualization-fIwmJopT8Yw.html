and easily explore your data.
You create new projects on the Home page.
When you create a project, the first thing
you need to do is add data.
You can connect to an Oracle application data
source or you can upload a Microsfoft excel
file with a xlsx entention.
The first row of your spreadsheet must contain
column headers.
You can change the name of the data source
to make it more meaningful.
Verify that the aggregation method for the
units and revenue measures is set to sum.
You can add additional data sources to this
project at any time.
Start by using the Control key to add multiple
data elements to the canvas.
It looks like 2 geographical areas have a
much higher number of depot deliveries.
Sort the units to view the highest values
first.
You want to focus on these specific values,
so drag the cursor over an area on the canvas
to create a marquee selection, and then keep
only those selected values.
To further explore the increase in depot deliveries
for these 2 cities, replace units with revenue.
After you add revenue, it appears that the
category named internal for both cities have
the highest revenue amounts.
Continue looking at the data by swapping item
type for category.
It looks like smart phone adds to the increase
in San Diego and a large number of modem sales are responsible for the increase in both cities
Add retail price to the canvas.
Data visualization suggest the best location in which to place the measure.
You can see that smart phone sales are responsible for the largest portion of depot allocations.
Add units back to the canvas
and then change the visualization type to a scatter chart to
to examine any potential outliers.
San Diego and New York have both the highest retail sales
and number of units sold
for both smart phones and modems.
Now, examine which store types are driving these sales.
It looks like computer and electronics stores
are selling the most units and generating the most sales.
Save the project.
Based on this exploration you now have a better understanding of the depot allocations
in these 2 regions.
In this video I showed you how to create a new
project using Data Visualization
and explore your data by adding additional columns,
limiting the data displayed and changing the visualization type.
