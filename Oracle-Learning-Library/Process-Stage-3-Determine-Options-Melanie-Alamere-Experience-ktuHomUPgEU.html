okay let's summarize what we saw we saw
Jane using the on premise complaints
application the Oracle cloud platform
was used to extend the complaints
application with additional digital
capability Java cloud service and
database cloud service used to implement
a single customer view composite service
social data was used to enhance the
single customer view documents were
shared between departments and with
customer big data was used to find a new
marketing opportunity mobile was used to
improve the customers experience
integration cloud service was used to
synchronize service cloud and the
on-premise application the result is
that melanie has a full omni-channel
access to her bank with its
demonstration we've seen digital
technologies used to extend an existing
application improving the customers
experience and lowering the operational
costs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
