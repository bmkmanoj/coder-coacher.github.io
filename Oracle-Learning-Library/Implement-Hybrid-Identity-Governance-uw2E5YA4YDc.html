with Oracle Identity Manager to create
hybrid solutions that extend the
advanced features of Oracle Identity
Manager to the cloud. In this video I'll
show you how to integrate the Oracle
Identity Cloud Service with Oracle
Identity Manager. Once integrated I'll
use Oracle Identity Manager, or OIM
for short, to implement segregation of
duties, user certification and hybrid
reporting. In this example I'll use
segregation of duties in OIM to restrict
access to an Oracle Identity Cloud
Service administrative group. The policy
will ensure that users can only be in
the Java Cloud Service administrators
group if they're also in the IT
department. Next I'll configure
certification in OIM to implement a
cloud access review process that allows
us to certify or revoke access to the
cloud. Lastly I'll view certification and
segregation of duties reports in the OIM
self-service console. Let's get started!
Before the hybrid scenarios can be done
I need to integrate OIM with Oracle
Identity Cloud Service. I'll complete the
integration by configuring the Oracle
Identity Cloud Service connector in OIM.
The connector is used automatically and
continuously provision and reconcile
users and groups between OIM and Oracle
Identity Cloud Service. After I install
and configure the Oracle Identity Cloud
Service connector I configure OIM as
an application in Oracle Identity Cloud
Service. The application configuration
provides access to the Oracle Identity
Cloud Service administrative API's. Next
I configure the Oracle Identity Cloud
Service IT resource. The IT resource is
configured with OAuth authorization
details to allow access to Oracle
Identity Cloud Service for OIM. The
Oracle Identity Cloud Service and OIM
integration relies on the HTTPS protocol.
I need to configure the certificates
used for the encryption to be in the OIM
trust store. Once the integration is
complete I can then reconcile Oracle
Identity Cloud Service groups and
managers. In OIM the
reconciliation process results in the
generation of events that are applied to
OIM based on changes in the target
system, which in this case is Oracle Identity
Cloud Service. The events in this
scenario will contain information about
Oracle Identity Cloud Service user
accounts and group membership. Next I
expose Oracle Identity Cloud Service in
the OIM catalog. I create a new OIM
sandbox with a new form for Oracle
Identity Cloud Service users. Next I
enable the new form by publishing the
sandbox.
After the sandbox is published I need to
run the catalog synchronization job.
Synchronizing the access request catalog
allows users to search for and request
access to the Oracle Identity Cloud
Service in the OIM self-service console.
After completing the OIM and Oracle
Identity Cloud Service integration I
test it by requesting Oracle Identity
Cloud Service access for OIM users. I
do this by requesting access to Oracle
Identity Cloud Service in the OIM
self-service console and activating the
account in the confirmation email. I'm
now able to login to Oracle Identity
Cloud Service as the provisioned user.
Next I'll configure a hybrid segregation
of duties scenario. This scenario
illustrates the use of specific OIM
policy enforcement in Oracle Identity
Cloud Service. First I create a rule to
start the policy configuration. In this
case the rule requires that only members
of the IT department can be members of
the Java Cloud Service administrators
group.
Next I add the rule to a new audit
policy. The identity audit feature of OIM
detects segregation of duties violations
in two ways. One way is by scanning all
users in detective mode to detect
violations. The other way is by
preventing users from requesting access
that would violate the policies. I
perform a scan with the new policy to
check for segregation of duties policy
violations with the detective mode
feature of identity audit. The results of
the scan are that the Kenney Westerdal
user from finance is in the JCS
administrators group in violation of the
policy. The policy also proactively
prevents a policy violation. In
preventive mode the user can't gain
access to both groups from Oracle
Identity Cloud Service. Next I'll show
the configuration of the OIM
certification
feature in our hybrid scenario. The OIM
certification feature allows the users
manager and also the owners of roles,
applications and entitlements to either
approve or deny requested access. In our
integrated environment we can extend
this OIM feature to Oracle Identity
Cloud Service users. Certification is
configured by assigning risk levels to
catalog resources in OIM. In this case we
assign a level of high to JCS
administrators, medium to marketing cloud
users and low to the Oracle Identity
Cloud Service application. Next i create
a certification definition. Identity
certification is the process of
reviewing user entitlements and access
privileges. Managers use this feature to
either certify that the user can have
the access or revoke the access if the
user isn't authorized. For our scenario I
create a policy called Cloud Access
Review to allow for managers to review
all access to the Oracle Identity Cloud
Service instance. With the certification
policy in place we can now perform
certification. The results of the
certification show all users with Oracle
Identity Cloud Service access. I certify
all the users with the exception of one
user who I'm revoking. This user isn't
authorized for cloud access. Now let's
review the results of the certification
actions in the dashboard. The OIM
certification dashboard displays the
result of completed certifications. The
users we approved as well as the one
revoked user are shown. Next I'll show
how the OIM and Oracle Identity Cloud
Service integration allows for various
hybrid reporting scenarios. With the
Oracle Identity Cloud Service user
entitlement configured in OIM, we can now
produce a report of all Oracle Identity
Cloud Service users. The report shows the
users name, user ID, status, organization,
manager and date of last change. A
separate report also shows deleted users.
The user resource access report contains
an individual users access. This report
shows all provisioned resources for a
particular user. Per the report this user
has access to the Oracle Identity Cloud
Service.
Since I configured identity
certification and identity audit
policies, I can also access reports
showing the results of the policy
enforcement. This is an example
certification report. The report shows
that a user had requested access but was
denied by the approver per the
certification policy. This report shows a
policy violation for the segregation of
duties policy I implemented earlier. The
user in this report violated the
segregation of duties policy for the JCS
administrators group. Only members of the
IT department can be members of the JCS
administrators group. In this video I've
shown you how the Oracle Identity Cloud
service could be integrated with Oracle
Identity Manager.
After completing the Oracle Identity
Cloud Service connector configuration
in Oracle Identity Manager, I extended
several OIM features to the Oracle
Identity Cloud Service environment. These
features are segregation of duties, user
certification and hybrid reporting. This
video is based on Oracle By Example
tutorials in the Oracle Learning Library.
