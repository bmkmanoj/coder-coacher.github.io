configure an enterprise manager account
for training purposes the demo is really
just intended to show you how to
navigate through the enterprise manager
screens you will need to determine for
yourself or which accounts are
appropriate for your organization the
steps that we show include to create an
e/m at when user with the e/m or
administrator role then next we create
and assign the NC Oregon name
credentials to this user and finally we
test access we are logged into
enterprise manager is the super user
because we are about to perform a
security task which is to create our
training user so we click a set up
security in the administrative on the
administrators pledge click create and
here we are on the create administrator
properties page as you see on top we are
in a wizard who will guide us through
the steps that we need to take so first
we are providing a name EMF min then we
specify a password for training purposes
we use Oracle for you and of course we
have to repeat the password we also
provide an email address and optionally
you can provide a description note that
we are not selecting super administrator
because this user account will be used
for regular EMF ministration work so we
click Next on the roles page we give our
training user the e/m all administrator
role move it among the selected roles
and then click Next
if you hit the task to set up an
administrator for some targets and not
for others with specific privileges this
is the page where you would do so we do
not have that need we have our training
user who will get all privileges from
their role and so we just click Next the
same is true for this page and slowly
scrolling down to display the different
types of resource privileges but again
all will come from the role however to
show you how to edit a privilege and
clicking the Edit icon and here you
could select the ones that you would
need for your role you could click
select all or select specific ones and
of course if you prove if you really set
up an administrator you would continue
since I just wanted to show you the
navigation I click cancel here so to
summarize we expect that all resource
privileges will come from the role and
we do not specify anything explicitly so
we click next here and here we are on
the review page review the
specifications for your EMF main
training user and then click finish
third fourth our new user has been
created we continue by performing
another security task so we go to set up
security named credentials on the name
credentials page we want to specify a
credential for the Oracle host OS user
on the create credentialed page we
specify the name of the credential the
description optionally as authenticating
targettype wiki post because we are
specifying host credentials and in this
training environment we want to specify
it for all targets we specify here the
property
the host username is Oroku the password
0 Oracle for this user we do not specify
any specific run privileges if you would
need it or you can see you could do so
here our last task is to provide the
ground for the e/m admin user we select
the user from the list and click select
and now it's time to test the user so we
click test and see if specify a target
type we are selecting the database the
host via via a repository itself is
installed and click test and see if
again success so now the one task to do
is to test access we log out and we log
in this the new user the first time you
login is in you using the Select
Enterprise Manager home page is
displayed and you can select your own
home page which you can also change
later on we are selecting summary as the
home page success we are locked into
enterprise manager is the new EMF main
user
