in this demonstration I'll show you how
to create end points using Oracle solar
suite for healthcare integration end
points are essentially communication
channels from where messages are sent or
received here will create two endpoints
one inbound to the healthcare engine and
one outbound here in the healthcare
console were on the designer
configuration tab we'll right-click this
endpoint folder and we'll create a new
endpoint let's give it a name
outpatient admission and here are all
the transport protocols we can choose
for receiving the message we're going to
go with the default of mllp one for
connection mode since this is an inbound
endpoint will leave it as server because
we want healthcare integration to listen
on the port and wait for a client to
connect to it we'll leave the hostname
as localhost and enter a listening port
number click OK and now you see the
newly created endpoint here
now we'll specify the document that this
endpoint will receive in this case
generic ADT documents so we'll click
this plus icon in the document to
receive section and now we'll choose the
document protocol we're using hl7
version 231 and we want a generic ADT
document so we'll select this document
definition click OK and finally we need
to turn on the endpoint by checking this
enabled box and apply
let's close this window and if we go to
the endpoint folder you can now see the
new endpoint now we'll create an
outbound endpoint you can also do this
by clicking this Add button we'll give
it a name
outpatient laboratory the transport
protocol again is mllp one for the
connection mode since this is an
outbound endpoint we'll select client
and for the hostname for this demo we're
using localhost but typically this would
be a remote host will enter the port
number and click OK and now you see the
newly created endpoint now we'll specify
the document that this endpoint will
send so we'll click this plus icon in
the document to send section and the
game will choose a document protocol hl7
2 3 1 ADT and select the document
definition will enable the endpoint and
apply and now you can see both the new
endpoints and that both have enabled set
to true so that's it for creating
endpoints in the next demo in this
series these two endpoints will be used
to create a symbol end-to-end hl7 mllp
