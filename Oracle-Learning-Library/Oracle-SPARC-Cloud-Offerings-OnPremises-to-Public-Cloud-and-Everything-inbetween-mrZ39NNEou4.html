of spark enterprise cloud on and off
premises this is going to be about our
spark cloud offerings both on print and
off premise which is our public cloud
today's speakers are Chris baki
and Peter Wilson both spark cloud
managers welcome to the presentation
what we'd like to cover today include
about six topics first off we'll talk
about Oracle's cloud solutions overall
and how SPARC is positioned within those
cloud offerings secondly we'll try to
explain why we believe clouds and spark
are better secure private enterprise
cloud infrastructure is the next topic
that's our on premise cloud and we have
a new offering there which is a
subscription offering flora will cover
dedicated compute services in Oracle's
cloud this is our public cloud offering
based on the model 300 Peter Wilson will
cover this topic item number five covers
our service offerings for cloud that are
offered by ACS advanced customer service
OC oracle consulting and om cs oracle
managed cloud services so all of these
will cover the various offerings we have
both on-premise and public cloud and
then we'll wrap it up so here's our
overall cloud offerings portfolio so we
bucket I'd these into three areas public
cloud on the Left private cloud on the
right and manage cloud services in the
middle so our public cloud offerings
have been available for a couple of
years now SPARC join the middle of last
year in our public cloud offerings on
the right hand side we've got our
private cloud offerings which we've been
doing for about five years now we've
started in basically 2012 and we started
with t5 based Sparta servers and then we
moved to T sevens over the last couple
of years managed cloud offerings you can
either get public cloud or private cloud
managed clouds and that can be managed
on premises or we can manage it in the
public cloud so om CS and ACS both offer
managed cloud services as well and in
some sense you could say they offer a
hybrid managed cloud service if you
would like
so there's a slide or two here we'd like
to cover on the competition and this
basically puts our competition and
Oracle into three basic buckets one
bucket is the private cloud only bucket
the second one is no private cloud which
would be public cloud only and then
third one on the right is the
combination private and public cloud so
let's just start off real quickly on the
left this is the bucket where it's
private cloud only and none of these
companies have been tchard into the
public cloud space Cisco as you can see
on the left was moving towards public
cloud had invested about a billion
dollars into the public cloud but then
stopped their development so EMC Hitachi
NetApp hewlett-packard enterprise Dell
and Cisco do not have any significant
public cloud offering today in the
middle are the public cloud vendors
which include Amazon Google and
Microsoft Azure none of them have really
jumped in to the private cloud space to
any degree although they started talking
about I think Amazon's talking about it
Microsoft Azure has talked about some
ventures with Dell but really haven't
put anything out in public so I'm in the
private cloud space so they're strictly
public cloud only at this point and on
the right hand side you've got the
private and public cloud combo Oracle is
very prominent there and IBM reason they
have an asterisk next to their name
there it's limited in the amount that
they've deployed there they're on Prem
offering as well as their public cloud
offering to much less degree than Oracle
has Oracle has been very focused on
public cloud over the last few years and
our on Prem solutions both x86 and SPARC
are very prominent as I said so Oracle
offers the best of both worlds private
and public but in addition to that we
offer all the various layers of cloud
which include infrastructure as a
service platform as a service and
software as a service very deep and all
of those and Oracle's now growing
rapidly in the infrastructure as a
service space
this slide shows why we believe a spark
is better in the cloud I'll just click
these through these various elements
here but basically the advantages we
feel we have over our competition and
basically we identified the public cloud
competition here in particular the
Amazon Web Services IBM SoftLayer as
well as Microsoft Azure but they do not
have the SPARC m7 processor which gives
us our software in silicon it gives us a
lot of security functionality along with
encryption capabilities a software in
silicon and I'll go through a lot of
these various functions here in a few
minutes but it also gives us great
performance running both Oracle
databases as well as Java based
applications and some non Oracle
applications Apache spark is an example
of that
along with Hadoop both run very well and
perform very well on the SPARC m7
processor fastest processor in the world
today I'll talk about that more in a
minute part of the software in silicon
includes on-chip analytics acceleration
and this is where we can accelerate SQL
queries and it typically adds four to
six maybe eight eight times faster
performance when doing analytics and
data warehousing and then next we've got
silicon secured memory this is where we
provide keys for usage with the memory
that prevent heartbleed and other types
of venom attacks that are buffer
overload attacks and it's the the
preeminent buffer and memory protection
offering in the marketplace today next
we have already touched upon the fact
that SPARC Solaris applications all are
supported with the m7 processor and one
better and lastly we in addition to all
the performance and security
enhancements we've talked about offer
software and platform as a service
capabilities with this platform as well
and lastly we offer at a lower cost so
we've done total cost of ownership
analysis against both Microsoft Azure
and Amazon Web Services AWS and
and we typically are 10 to 20% lower
cost than they are our spark platform is
priced identically as our x86 platform
so you can get a core of x86 at the same
price you can get a core of SPARC as
well so we're very aggressive and very
competitive from a pricing perspective
this goes into a little bit deeper dive
on some of the benefits that you get
with SPARC so we believe we provide a
lot of efficiency a great deal of
security more so than our competition
and make it simpler and easier to use so
the top three banners show the top three
benefits that we've got higher per core
efficiency typically it's almost about a
2 X Factor better core efficiency than
Intel x86 secondly job on database
performance as I mentioned typically
about two times or greater performance
benefits than x86 and thirdly a very
efficient virtualization so our
virtualization overhead is typically
about one percent whereas the x86 VMware
virtualization typically has overhead 15
to 28 even higher than 20 percent so
those are kind of three high levels
higher per core efficiency making that
process are very efficient you can do
more with fewer servers a better
performance and better virtualization
down below here we have kind of a deeper
dive on some of the m7 processor benefit
silicon secure memory the fact that we
prevent a buffer overload attacks
secondly encryption accelerators each
core has a crypto engine associated with
it and typically we provide near
wireline speeds with our crypto engines
with encryption turned on so all the
world record benchmarks that we set
typically encryption is turned on access
control read-only VMs for greater
security and compliance reporting as
well if you want to do audits to
understand how well your system is doing
from a compliance perspective so these
are all the benefits that spark provide
making it by far and away the best a
server best platform for the public
cloud and private club
here's
a couple of examples that a little bit
deeper dive you can see x86 servers on
the left and this is with running Red
Hat Enterprise Linux and VMware 223
servers on the left this is for a
demonstration of doing provisioning of a
thousand VMs so it basically took 23
servers 828 cores and 1656 threads on
the right hand side you can see with a
spark t71 running on the spark go with a
spark m7 processor we could do that with
10 servers 320 cores and 2560 threads 4
virtual CPUs plus all the benefits of
the silicon secure memory low encryption
overhead and very strong performance so
we had 61 percent fewer cores and the
cost was about half of what it was to
run x86 about 1268 per VM on the left
hand side with x86 and about 750 bucks
approximately for per VM on the right so
you can see that's about a at least a
two to one ratio that requires two times
more x86 servers to be able to provision
up to a thousand VMs here is just a
couple examples of some of the
benchmarks that we've done in memory
database Big Data and data mining secure
cloud applications and databases or just
general apps and databases you can see
the various performance that we have
over and the benchmarks that we've drawn
here and the the factors that we have
over x86 as you can see there in the
second line we have 2x - 4 x times
faster per chip performance in all of
these various areas then leading x86 5
version 3 processors from Intel so from
a performance perspective I think we set
over 20 world record benchmarks with the
m7 processor so absolutely positively
the best performing processor in the
world and lastly just touching upon the
virtualization as I said if you're
running Red Hat Enterprise Linux on x86
and using VMware typically you can see
virtualization overhead in excess 20%
we're on the right-hand side running
Oracle spark and Solaris virtualization
you typically see virtualization
overhead less than 1% which gives you
greater much greater usage of your
processor for other jobs and activities
than spending a quarter of your
processors compute capabilities on
virtualization so now I'm going to
switch gears those are some of the
benefits that you get with spark and the
m7 processor and the software in silicon
technology that Oracle brings to the
cloud either private or public now I'm
going to start talking about secure
private cloud on-premise solutions and
this one is known as enterprise cloud
infrastructure or secure enterprise
cloud infrastructure some people call it
ECI for short is the acronym but this
shows two racks on the Left this is our
private on-premise cloud solution and
the racks on the left are made up of
storage compute and networking so the
rack on the left-hand side is based on
t7 servers on the bottom half or the
bottom quarter there you can see the
storage on the bottom portion of both
racks
that's the GS 3-2 storage appliance and
we typically provide to just shell
small configuration to start with but
you can scale that up and then you've
got t7 servers on the left and you've
got s 7-2 L servers on the right and
then you've got networking which are 10
Gigabit Ethernet switches so the list on
the right hand side here goes through
the management tools so that first
bullet talks about Oracle Enterprise
Manager 13.1 and off center 12.3 or you
can use OpenStack or other tools you can
do command line and scripting if you so
so prefer once again this is the
on-premise solution what you'll find is
the on-premise management tools are
pretty much the same on the public cloud
side which gives you very easy ability
to move from on-prem to public cloud
you'll probably hear me say that a
couple of times this is based on Oracle
Solaris 11.3 you can use Solaris 10 and
you can also use branded zones 8 and 9
on the on-premise solution ZFS storage
appliance as I mentioned and we're using
10 Gigabit Ethernet switch
for this to connect everything inside
the rack is connected via 10 Gigabit
Ethernet switches as well as it would
connects up to the customer network via
ethernet switching as well so that's the
on-premise version we've been selling
this as I said since 2012 and I'll get
into the customers that have been using
this here in a few minutes this just
highlights some of the different flavors
of our on-premise version so we've got
various ways you can take a path to get
to the cloud on the left is what I just
walked through the secure enterprise
cloud infrastructure or ECI
of the three racks on the left-hand side
there the central rack is the core rack
if you want to use a compute only rack
as well to add on to that for adding
additional compute you could add the
right on a rack on the right hand side
and then the rack on the left is all
storage so you can continue to mix racks
with compute storage if you prefer or
you can have individual racks that add
compute and storage individually so
that's how you expand this the bottom
line about enterprise cloud
infrastructure or ECI is that it's very
flexible and allows you to scale up to
compute the storage and the networking
as you need to and we've got numbers of
customers who have over ten racks and
I'll talk about those in a few minutes
up to 2025 racks it's very easy to
implement and manage using Oracle's best
practices on the right hand side we have
the model 300 as I said Peter Wilson
will talk to that in just a few minutes
here we are kin Oracle's public cloud
and you can see that the racks look
pretty similar so we're using the exact
same compute in this case we're using T
seven ones exact same storage as well as
the same networking as well so it's
dedicated public compute and Peter will
go into that in a few minutes in the
center area here we have a new rack that
we've recent released as of last
December 2016 and that is where we're
offering a subscription model or a lease
right to use model now called secure
enterprise cloud infrastructure as a
service or IaaS so this is where you can
do a subscription model and pay for it
on a monthly basis over a
two three four year term the terms are
selectable most customers typically go
with a three year term so it's a monthly
/ 3 year term and it includes Oracle
services coming in installing and
ramping the service up ramping the
system up until it's ready to go and
hand it off to the customer and there
are additional services wrapped around
this such as monitoring you can see
under that second bullet or a bullet
there that you can do monitoring by ACS
and I'll talk a little bit more about
that but basically it's a subscription
some people know this as operating
expense or effects model versus a capex
model so there seems to be a quite a bit
of interest in this on-premise version
which is a subscription model right to
use a model that you pay for monthly and
it's same configuration as the
on-premise ECI on the left
except that one is a capex model on the
left hand side that's where the customer
buys it and puts out and they own it and
they manage it or we can manage it for
them if they prefer as I said with our
managed services the one in the middle
Oracle continues to own that
configuration and the customer leases or
has right to use that rack configuration
for some period of time so hopefully
that makes that clear and then Peter
arrow will discuss the model 300 here in
a few minutes so those are all the
offerings that we have of the SPARC
cloud portfolio today this just gives a
little more technical detail on the
subscription version known as EC IAS or
enterprise cloud infrastructure as a
service so it's using Oracle Enterprise
Manager 13.1 and/or off-centre 12.3
that's a common theme across all of
these products those are standard Oracle
tools that you can use it use use a
Solaris 11 and you either get a whole
rack configuration which is based on 10
compute nodes in one management node and
you can see the number of cores and
threads there and you get about 482
gigabytes of usable memory per compute
node then you can see the detail on the
ZFS storage appliance
yes 3-2 typically you get somewhere in
the neighborhood of about 41 terabytes
of usable storage there are a couple of
disk drives also included in the each
compute node if you'd like to use those
as boot devices so those are included
this is the once again the on-premise
infrastructure as a service solution
that's a subscription model and then you
can see the Ethernet switches down below
that last bullet there which we've
talked about so that's the basically the
hardware configuration for
infrastructure-as-a-service
this goes into a little bit of the
detail we've worked out a scenario with
acs that they can offer an additional
service to do advanced monitoring and
advanced problem resolution so you can
see this is a seven by 24 by 365 service
it costs approximately five thousand
dollars a month
additional over the base prices for the
solution so it's an additional feature a
gateway is included in that price that
they'll put a gateway into the customers
data center so that they can get access
to the ECI as a service and then they
provide the filtering of event alerts
what's going on from an event management
performance and availability perspective
and so forth and they can also do
analysis of service level agreement
response times and so forth so that's
the monitoring portion and then included
with that would also be advanced problem
resolution so if something happens
something is is not operating correctly
we have a dim strip failure we have a
drive failure something of that effect
they will do root cause and corrective
action problem management and make sure
that was response time SLA zorbing that
as well so that's in addition to the
advanced monitoring all for the
approximately $5,000 month fee that they
provide to do advanced monitoring and
resolution so that's provided by
advanced customer services this just
goes into the installation process that
ACS provides so you can see the HS logo
there in the lower right hand side so
this is the services they provide
comprehensive standard standard system
installation they do setup of the
hardware the networking the operating
system and make sure everything is
functioning appropriately and then once
they complete all their installation
they provide a summary report and
indicate kind of everything's green
statuses are all good and where the
configuration is from a configuration
perspective that they hand off to the
customer so as I mentioned earlier
standard installation is included as
part of the overall annual price so this
just touches a little bit on the
management tools in particular this is
Oracle Enterprise Manager 13 which is
the version that we're using today is
13.1 there is a new version coming which
is 13.2 that we haven't fully tested yet
but we'll probably get that done in the
next view coming weeks and so that then
not only will 13.1 be certified but 13.2
should be certified over the next month
or so so it's a single pane of glass for
monitoring the hardware and software
gives a centralized communication
collaboration point for diagnostics and
troubleshooting it's designed to share
critical information maintaining
separate sandboxes if the customer
desires but at the same time RIA
maintains a consistent
infrastructure message from one sandbox
to another and has integrated naming
credentials and auditing capabilities as
well but it's a unified tool that does
the monitoring and management of the
hardware the database the middleware the
web server along with packaged
applications as well one last point on
Enterprise Manager you can see these
pdbs dropping in this is another
offering that Enterprise Manager makes
available on all of the on-premise
offerings that we give today or have
available today on the ECI whether it's
the standard version on Prem or the
subscription version you can do database
as a service using
enterprise manager so that allows you to
use container databases single instance
david databases and/or pluggable
databases as a database as a service and
that's all enabled with Enterprise
Manager 13.1 and 13.2 so it gives you a
lot of the benefits of the software and
silicon can be used relative to the
database as a service very efficient
very fast and very secure so these are
some of the benefits you can get with
database as a service as well running on
on Prem or it also works in the public
cloud as well now I'm going to switch
gears and talk about the customers a
little bit you can see a lot of big
names here of different customers that
we've one with enterprise cloud
infrastructure or ECI a lot of banks
which are typically areas that spark has
been used in the past
along with telcos such as Turkcell MPNs
in Africa US Cellular titi net is once
again in Turkey China Mobile Toshiba
over in Japan and then we have a lot of
Latin America customers such as
telephone because telcel and awk so
Banco de la république over on the
right hand side so just give some of the
ideas of some of the customers that
we're working with with enterprise cloud
infrastructure I'll talk about three of
these customers here in a minute so here
is the customer number one this is a
North American telco that accelerated
their application deployments in ECI
basically they were looking for an agile
development platform that allowed them
to be very flexible scale it as they
needed to and be able to quickly deploy
applications and they found that once
they move to ECI they could deploy their
applications five times faster than they
had in the past and had a great
consolidation from older generation
servers to this this was based on T
fives originally you can see these look
a little bit different and now they're
using both p7 1s and t-72s and probably
upwards of 15 to 20 different racks
spread across three or four different
data centers so it's a very large telco
in North America here is a customer that
spoke with us at Oracle OpenWorld last
year in 2016 the exelon
it's a power company in the eastern half
of the United States I think it's one of
the larger power companies in the United
States they wanted a cloud ready
platform not only for on-prem but also
to be able to move from on-prem to
public cloud and that's exactly what
they're working on now so once again
they started with t5 they've moved to
t7s now t7 once and t-72s they've got
these across three different data
centers in Illinois as well as in
Maryland they wanted to reduce their
operating expenses and reduce them
through doing consolidation on these
platforms which is one of the ideal use
cases for enterprise cloud
infrastructure something very easy to
manage with the tools associated with it
so they're using op center 12 3.2 I
believes the latest version that they're
using and they use that to use proxies
across the data centers to use one
version of ops center to manage systems
spread across three different data
centers and drive their cost down
through consolidations so forth as I
mentioned and lastly one more customer
this customer is also known as Landis
and gear and they're based in Kansas
they are a smart metering company and we
wanted to show this customer that
they're doing a primary with a fellow
oversight a secondary site so they
filled these racks up the once again
started with t5 s moved to t7s they're
running two three node Oracle RAC
clusters primarily using this for
database they filled these racks up as I
said the primary rack is in Overland
Kansas and the second rack is in
Alpharetta Georgia as a secondary
failover site they wanted to be able to
run Oracle database extremely well which
they are able to do so you can see over
four times faster deployment times of
Oracle databases there and be able to
reallocate resources very quickly they
were able to do that with a ten times
faster capability than they add with
older generation servers so that was
landing gear they do smart metering in
the power industry so those were just a
couple of key customer wins and examples
that we've had over the last couple of
years but you can see this has been a
very popular on-premise
Ellucian and so that does it for the
section I'm going to cover for now I'll
come back a little bit later to talk
about the services and now I'm going to
hand it off to Peter Wilson Peter is a
product cloud manager as well you can
see here that one of the let me finish
one final thought before I hand it off
to Peter which is we've got the
on-premise version on the left and then
we have the public cloud version on the
right and what's illustrated here is
that you can do test dev production
internet disaster recovery and either
start on Prem and then move to the
public cloud and move back and forth
between the two sites so we feel as we
mentioned earlier when we started Oracle
is absolutely well-positioned to offer
both on Prem and public cloud and now
Peters going to go into our public cloud
offering Peter
all right thanks Chris I'm going to talk
a little bit more about model 300 really
just reinforcing what Chris is said
about the availability of the SPARC m7
processor in the public cloud and the
benefits that we we draw from having
that capability over for customers to
take advantage of I'm not going to go
and duplicate a lot of the content that
you've already seen about the SPARC m7
processor but suffice to say it's our
goal to provide that functionality at
the same price with better performance
than the the x86 competition that we
have available out there in the
marketplace today I'm going to dig a
little deeper into what we actually
provide is part of the SPARC model 300
system so we'll dive into the full
capability of the offering we have 300 o
CPUs oracle CPUs which are divided
across ten systems which we rack up for
customers to take access to in the model
300 in the cloud these are divided into
ten customer domains or Dom users that
terminology is used for OPC Oracle
public cloud each of these domains has
30 cause of compute each of those cause
has eight threads of capability and the
domains that we provide those domains
are available with 442 gigs of ram
available for customers to deploy their
workloads into but customer domain will
run a Solaris 11.3 operating system we
regularly update these operating systems
and currently wherever an SI you are
supported to a release version of 30
those domains support Oracle
virtualization using Solaris zones
we support both Oracle native zones
Oracle kernel Oracle Solaris 11 kernel
zones and solaris 10 non-branded nonlin
global zones we don't support Solaris 89
at this time the domains are actually
booted from local mirrored internal
disks so these are kind of self
contained within the rack and we also as
part of the rack providers of an
integrated ZFS storage appliance this is
provided with up to 60 terabytes of
usable usable capacity after fault
tolerance and mirroring has been carried
out on the ZFS essay we have clustered
controllers so in Lingle no single point
of failure and figuration plan active
active head configuration that allows us
to draw maximum capacity and capability
in terms of performance from the
integrated ZFS essay what the customer
effectively sees is a cloud which
contains ten instances of 30 Oracle CPUs
each of which is equipped with 442 bigs
of RAM they're connected together with a
rapid multiple 10 gig connection
interconnect to a ZFS SAR to each other
the ZFS si is connected with up to 80
gigabits of bandwidth toward visit all
the Donahue's that are provided and then
that cloud is connected typically by
default to a customer via a VPN
connection across a public Internet and
there are other additional options which
you'll go into later for how the
customer can actually connect to this
cloud of compute resources that they
provide as part of model 300 a little
bit of terminology essentially we're
sticking to the same terminal
terminology standards that are applied
to Oracle public cloud and we're just
applying those to the SPARC model 300 in
the same kind of fashions we have add on
you or a customer domain this is a
system partition which owns a PCI bus
and a dedicated for port 10 Gigabit
Ethernet card it's managed by and
maintained by the customer Oracle public
cloud personnel don't have any access to
this so the customer is completely able
to modify and maintain this system to
their own standards with no interference
from Oracle it does contain the majority
of the CPU and memory resources that are
allocated or available inside of a spark
p7 platform Oracle does retain a small
slice of the system and that's called
domme 0 this is the Oracle control
domain it's really there for hardware
administration and
monitoring it's managed and maintained
purely by Oracle public to our personnel
and the customer does have doesn't have
any access to this domain it's a very
small demand it contains only two cores
and 32 gigs of ram and is purely there
for us to maintain and manage the
platform itself a little bit more and
more than OCP us it's a spark processor
core this is each m7 processor has 32
cores each of those pores has eight
threads of execution
in its t71 server we have a single m7
processor and up to 512 gigs of ram
installed
whereas for the OC for you spam adorable
licenses apply so this is this is a
spark core and a single horrible license
typically covers up to two of these LCP
use in terms excuse me in terms of
pricing this the same cost as an x86
dedicated computer service so $100 per
OCP you per month and end for storage
again we maintain the same pricing as
the x86 dedicated compute options so $50
per terabyte per month looking again in
a little more detail of what the
customer sees what's visible to the
customer we mentioned we have 10 spark
dummies which are available to the
customer these each contain 30 OCP use a
little less than half a terabyte of
memory 442 gigs this is because we have
some dims bearing and the dom0 takes and
some memory from the available platform
capability we have a 600 gigabyte
virtual boot disk which is provided to
the dom you from the dama 0 by oracle
and then the Don you has access to
native performance 2 for 10 gigabit
network devices Oracle there's a little
bit of work to prevent to pre install
the Dom you we provide the Solaris 11.3
operating system with the current
revision of the latest release of
Solaris we do a little bit of
configuration of the initial Network
parameters we typically provide a
default 20 gigabit la CP aggregate
device which provides both high
performance and some high availability
an Oracle in turn supports Oracle RAC
database in Oracle Solaris cluster
across these networking configurations
that we put in place which does
differentiate us from some of the
offerings from example for example from
AWS and some of the other cloud
providers out there
we provide a default connection to the
customers network of IRA VPN essentially
extending the network which is
implemented inside the model 300 into
the customers data center via that VPN
we provide a very high bandwidth
connection from each of the dom used to
the ZFS sa storage and we also should
point out that the customer is purely
responsible for the Dom you maintenance
and operation a little bit more about da
me of storage options as I mentioned
each dom you has a 30th has a 600
gigabyte virtual disk which is mirrored
by the dom 0 this provides decent
performance as that maximum capacity of
600 gigabytes and really we discourage
the use of it for much more than just
booting the dom you it's possible to run
ZFS file systems for zones from here but
the capacity is probably going to limit
you before performance this becomes a
problem so in turn what we actually
recommend is that the ZFS sa storage is
used to provide storage for any
additional virtual machines which
customer to decides to create in terms
of Solaris zones these provide access to
I scuzzy loans and volumes which are
extremely high bandwidth up to 80
gigabits per second of storage capacity
in bandwidth this has already provided
by our high availability configuration
of the ZFS sa in an active active
cluster with automatic failover for
networking and storage devices this
provides a total usable capacity of in
excess of 60 terabytes of storage today
and it's provided in essentially two
pools one of 30 terabytes per head along
creation and backup is why are the web
UI of the ZFS sa which can be automated
with various scripts the customer can
develop against a restful api for the
ZFS sa backups can be carried out on the
ZFS sa using again the web UI or through
CL is to carry out things like ZFS
snapshots and cloning and allow the
creation of very effective use of golden
images for VM creation and backup
connecting to the model 300 is where we
start to write into questions of
customers often have the typical default
connection from the customers data
center to the model 300 is via Hardware
implemented IPSec VPN gateway
this is the default connection we don't
charge anything additional for this at
the for connection but it is potentially
a little bit vulnerable to the whims of
the Internet
of course the leap yen connection does
go with a large Internet and as a result
we can't guarantee bandwidth and we
can't guarantee connectivity often we
find the problem especially if you're a
North American customer with good
internet service providers but for some
of the more remote areas of the world
this might not be a suitable option
because of bandwidth constraints or
unreliability of the larger Internet the
second option which is a postive option
it does cost more to implement is that
the customer can implement a leased line
of some description MPLS typically from
their data center to our data center our
current terminology for this is pass
connect but essentially there are many
providers out there who provide leased
lines which guarantee bandwidth and
uptime to connect to our data centers
again this essentially also implements a
VPN and over that connection so it's
secure but it also guarantees bandwidth
and latency for a particular quality of
service a fourth connector or a third
option is to directly provide the model
300 with public internet IP addresses
and this allows the model 300 to
actually support publicly accessible
services such as you know most obvious
case would be a web service where the
web server is actually providing service
to third-party applications out there an
Internet appliance who are connecting
through a web browser the one option
that we don't support is a software VPN
connection from a model 300 cloud
administrator who's remotely out on the
Internet where they just would normally
connect a wire a software VPN to a to a
VPN that would terminate at the model
304 typically administration purposes we
don't support that what would be the
option there is for the remote
administrator to connect into the
customers data center using their own
software VPN and then from the customers
Dev Center through the either MPLS
leased line or the hardware implemented
VPN they can gain access to the model
300 ability
so a little bit more about what we
implement in terms of the networking
inside the model 300 essentially each
model 300 exists on its own subnets
which are provided from the customers
data center and the administrators over
customers network we provide what we
require to Institute we require two
subnets from the customer wonderful
stand above all the hardware and then
another one in which the customer can
deploy all the virtual machines as
necessary when they start to actually
deploy and use the service all inbound
and outbound traffic to and from the
rack uses VLAN 100 although those wheel
and tags are printed on exit from the
rack so essentially when the customer
connects to the rack they just need to
address the traffic to and from this
particular IP addresses that they've
allocated to the model 300 VLANs 101 to
199 are available within the rack and
are actually used for internode
communication for special special
application purposes such as application
isolation rack DB private interconnects
for the rack clusters application
cluster can interconnects in the case of
things like web logic or Solaris cluster
and then again just general traffic
separation multiple services are
provided within the same model 300
sports data traffic is typically
accessible only within the rack itself
so the CF SSA is only providing storage
capacity to the nodes within the rack
this is to prevent quality of services
use if that storage was trying to boost
mr. B access from a customer's data
center across a low quality VPN
connection the management traffic in
your hand for the storage is available
to both the customers data center answer
the nodes within the rack so
administration store which can be
carried out from the customers data
center or within locally to the rack
other high capacity core Oracle cloud
services are available via special
arrangement in terms of the routing and
presuming that those services are also
provided within the same data center OPC
data center that the model 300 lives in
this gives us the ability to have high
bandwidth typically 10 gigabit and low
latency connections to for example an
exudate a cloud service to the model 304
high bandwidth high performance database
type applications and this isn't limited
just to excavator in the cloud so it's
also covering all the other OPC cloud
services that happen to be available in
the site OPC data center but the model
300 is deployed in two
we also provide public IP addresses
which can be activated on each of the
internal IP addresses that are allocated
to the model 300 essentially you have
two classes of public IPs
there's an outbound version for
accessing public services such as you
know our package repositories Google
search services and so on which are
really outbound initiative initialized
connections from the model 300 to a
service which exists on the internet and
then there are also inbound our public
IPS which are allowed which are there to
allow the model 300 to actually provide
a publicly accessible web service of
some description because I mentioned
typically a web page or perhaps an
application server API these typically
require more security and again since
the customer is responsible for all the
management and maintenance of the
services within the model 300 this is
something which we just recommend but
it's up to the customer to implement
these additional security stages if they
judge them requiring it if their
documents are necessary for their
application now that we're talking about
the public internet let's just highlight
some areas which we see problems with
customers who've kind of assumed a few
things that aren't actually true with
the public Internet the actual public
internet is generally quite slow
especially if you're comparing it to a
local data center where you have 10
gigabit network deployed and used to
seeing very low latency between
very high bandwidth compared to the
public Internet this really slow it's
also quite expensive to get to the kind
of bandwidth and performance that you'd
like to public Internet tends to be more
unreliable at the same time the Internet
itself is quite reliable at a large
scale but for particular connections you
can see issues so what we find is that
things tend to be unpredictable in the
public Internet and if your application
isn't written to accommodate that kind
of unreliability unpredictability you
can run into problems unfortunately a
lot of customers have the experience of
YouTube and Netflix which are very good
at providing what looks to be or seems
to be a very high availability very high
performance kind of interface to the
public Internet what's her what enables
that though is that these applications
have been written very cleverly with
lots of new technology to try and hide
the problems of the internet with
bothering multiple points of presence
and so on but really give kind of the
wrong impression of the capability of
the public Internet unfortunately when
you start placing enterprise
applications in the cloud you will
probably run into issues which are
normally masked by the applications like
YouTube Netflix essentially these were
not written these enterprise
applications were not written with
deployments based across the public
Internet in mind and you often run into
issues so we have to be very careful
with what applications are deployed on
the public Internet or the public cloud
and how they're written in together
typically we'd like to see all the stack
with database the middleware and the
presentation layer all provided within
the cloud or on-premise
with no splitting of this back across
both wan promise and across to the cloud
this is where problems tend to arise so
be very careful about what you deploy
into the public cloud and also go in
with wide eyes wide open about the
potential issues of the slower less
predictable that's reliable internet
just as a highlight the fact that the
internet although it's um running you
know at ten gigabit speed it actually
doesn't run at the speed of light so
there are delays and the further you're
going away from your data set it to talk
to a data center which contains your
model 300 the more likely you are to run
into problems with things like latency
and bandwidth because of the the
intervening switches signal amplifiers
or a poop repeaters
passing consistencies switches and so on
that will get in the way because of the
the implementation of the public
internet so be aware of that and don't
have too high of an expectation or if
this is going to be a challenge for you
then moving to a plain VPN moving from
the plain VPN to a leased line it's
likely to give significant improvements
in the experience that you have from
running a data center that's based on
both on-premise servers and the public
internet but done right the dedicated
spark cloud can deploy a wide variety of
applications typically we see customers
looking at development of testing as
their first foray to the public cloud
these it can be typically nicely
self-contained they provide very fast
local self-service VMs they have the
ability to optimize their applications
using the the benefits of the SPARC m7
processor and the Oracle Solaris to do
compile C suite that works in
conjunction with that processor so they
can really do fine-tuning of the
applications themselves in the public
cloud we actually see movement of those
applications into production in the
public home as well so we tend to find
the customers who are looking for an
always-on low overhead system that can
be scaled fairly rapidly or looking at
the public cloud as a means to do this
again and also take full advantage of
water m7 goodness ly the built-in
encryption the salt and secured memory
and it's necessary also data analytics
acceleration customers often look at the
public Internet as a means for
implementing disaster recovery with
access to a second data center that they
don't necessarily need to maintain from
a responsibility point of view in terms
of maintenance this is a challenge
sometimes in terms of the amount of data
that's necessary to transfer back and
forth for disaster recovery purposes but
again done right it can be very
effective and then of course there's
just general testing environments so
user acceptance testing pre prod
environments which provide the means to
rapidly spin up and deploy multiple
applications for testing purposes so
these again are some of the typical
applications that we see people deploy
into the cloud environments the real
benefit of course is it allows you to
focus as a customer on making your
company grow making your services the
most effective they can be while Oracle
concerns itself with keeping the lights
on keeping the data center working
properly
you to get on with actually very little
business so this provides a complete
platform for your workloads and Barone
maintained by Oracle where you can be as
inventive as necessary to make the best
for your business
we have those virtual machines deploying
workloads and that are able to arrest
and enjoy all the benefits we talked
about over at the m7 processor for both
security and performance get the most
from your software as we mentioned
earlier on the licensing scheme that's
required for the model 300 allows you to
take any existing licenses you have and
just apply them into the cloud so
there's no additional cost for licenses
unless you want to start deploying you
and your applications out there and
essentially run any software you have
using your existing licenses and you're
good to go so a little bit more about
some of the accessible resources that we
have out there for the model 300 we have
obviously a product web page which we
directory direct you to and then there
are emails for both myself and Chris
backe who would be happy to take your
calls if you want to learn more or have
additional presentations and details for
the model 300 with that I'm going to
hand you back to Chris and he'll carry
on there the services portion of the
presentation well thank you Peter that
was really good and so just to reiterate
where we're at in the agenda we've
covered both the private cloud
on-premise cloud as well as Peter went
through the public cloud
notice the SPARC dedicated model 300 so
just to reiterate before we get into the
services here that you can use a
combination and generate a hybrid cloud
with the on-prem public cloud or what at
the on-prem private cloud along with the
model 300 public cloud and move
applications back and forth between
on-prem and public cloud which is a
distinct advantage we have over our
competitors so now it's just touch upon
this is basically item 5 on the agenda
which is some of the services we wrap
around both on print and public cloud so
you can see here on this slide this is
Oracle advanced customer service
offerings or support offerings and
you've got private cloud you've got
public cloud and you can also do a
hybrid cloud in between the two of those
so self so your service meter get
capacity on the Left
newer existing applications and database
workloads on your right and variety of
offerings there so
and then they provide the hybrid cloud
there in the middle scale infrastructure
up and down move from on prim to the
public cloud and basically use
Enterprise Manager as we talked about to
manage hybrid cloud advanced customer
support or services can manage across
that entire environment and set that up
for you and this just gets into a little
bit more of some of the services that
ACS provides this could be either for
on-prem or public but basically a read
readiness package for the on-premise
solution on the left hand side they do
standard system installation can do
workshops around that installation to
make sure that the customer is ready
from the initial pre-production stage
into readiness that they actually do the
go live and hand the configuration off
to the customer or they can also do once
the customers into production that they
can optimize the configuration over time
to improve it for the customer while
it's in production itself so they do
configuration reviews performance
reviews review the production
diagnostics that they're receiving over
a period of time they can review and do
patch installation if necessary but
these are all additional services that
are available from ACS once the customer
goes into production so these are just a
few more of the services that ACS
provides om CS as I mentioned earlier
stands for Oracle managed cloud services
and this is where they can manage the
entire configuration whether it's
private cloud or public cloud they can
manage it for the customer so that's
there in bullet number one bullet number
two they do service catalogs which are
pretty sophisticated implementations of
cloud services and I'll give an example
of that in a minute where they can
establish multiple level service level
agreements multiple level security
models and so forth and do that as a
Service Catalog
so these are some of the services that
oh my ghin it could be either they'll
manage an on-prem deployment for a
customer or they can manage the public
cloud deployment for the customer as
well so
so just one last statement here and then
we'll wrap it up
we do offer demos and proofs have come
concept or POCs and in our Oracle
solution Center so this is based in
Santa Clara California and we have a
couple of racks dedicated to and
displaying these kind of functionality
and capabilities that we've been talking
about so far so we typically give an
introduction to the enterprise cloud
infrastructure based on SPARC we show
how it's managed how you do management
of the virtual machines dynamic scaling
of resources such as memory or storage
or compute along with how you
provisioned the VMS from on-premise into
a public cloud if you would like as well
as doing database or middleware as a
service so any or all of these can be
done in a single hour multiple hour kind
of demos if you like and both peter
wilson and i can help make that happen
it's necessary so peter showed a couple
of links earlier as you wrapped up as
model 300 discussion also a couple more
here the enterprise cloud infrastructure
webpage is listed there and we've got a
couple links for some presentations
along with the model 300 links as well
so this is just going to give you some
additional places you could go to for
more information so just to summarize
thank you for joining us today both
Peter and I and we enjoyed giving you
some information on both our on-prem
offerings along with our public cloud
model 300 offerings all based on SPARC
and then you can combine those two into
a hybrid cloud offering if you like as
well so thank you for spending some time
with us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
