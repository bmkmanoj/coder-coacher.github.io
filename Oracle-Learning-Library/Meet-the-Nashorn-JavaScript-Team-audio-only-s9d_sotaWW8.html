so this is a birds of a feather on mass
horn for you to ask questions and meet
the team my name is Michelle Trudeau I
work at Oracle on NASA horn I'm the
manager and I we have a few team members
of the team here so what you guys want
to present yourself sure I'm Marcus Lori
ring I work for are currently in
Stockholm some of you might have been to
my talk about a dynamic language
optimization on the vm yesterday morning
when I did some introduction of NASA one
as well so I've been mostly responsible
about getting efficient code through the
code pipeline and having the vm do
something good with it in a VOC dynamic
being the world's biggest invoke dynamic
user in consumer is is like this is
bleeding edge stuff is kind of hard at
the beginning so most of the time I
spent interacting with with Christian
hear about cogeneration issues in the vm
and similar things I'm Jim Leske I'm the
team lead for multi languages which
would include nass horn node I guess
Dinah link as well and probably a couple
other things in there the two to three
guesses sort of manage in our group as
well so my start with this project
actually was at the beginning about two
years ago and that's word was sort of
started as a small project to see if we
could actually implement JavaScript on
the JVM all right hi I'm till a Sega d
and i'm with oracle in the same team as
the other gentlemen are I'm as far as
NASA phone is concerned I mostly are
working on the the non-standard
javascript stuff namely the integration
of Java and JavaScript ensuring that you
can that you can seamlessly invoke any
Java libraries and use any java objects
from your javascript as such this is
mostly manifested through NASA ones use
of a open source library that I maintain
dino link which is generally useful for
implementation of any dynamic language
on the JVM and that you know we hope
that going forward it will it will have
wider use right now NAS horn is pretty
much the biggest user for the library so
as such it's it's a it's a really good
proving ground for the design of its API
and so on so I guess what we can do now
is field any questions that people might
have and if there are a few questions
we'll probably ramble along with long
answers and let's try to keep this
interactive so we don't yeah for each
other so sorry gotta Christmas like a
keel which one is the stable that's the
question was which which never version
are you running yes rejection of note
are we targeting
usually how much what's the diff between
okay so me currently using 082 version
of the note what is the what is the most
current version out there right now
so what too obvious a yeah 0 12
with this number these people know reach
one point oh so so on sunday night we
officially announced that we would open
source nassau very soon but we don't
have any plans product plans for safe
for now for note note is just something
internal experimental that we're
building on top of Nashua and 44 as a
proof of concept and things like that we
don't have anything we don't have any
official product product plans for this
you know just wanted to know this is I
mean it's helped us an insulative
throughout the like the national
development it's our largest real world
left but we working with then and then
like this little stuff like the
benchmarks ship would note we've used
them to tune performance so I would
really like to see our knowledge our
project getting out there but as
Michelle said is currently on file so it
just needs to be a search stamp this
product you know because the thing was
that akhil was originally on well he's
still on the nest foreign team but was
originally his intent was just to come
up with a test bed he said well there's
all this coated therefore nodejs why
don't we just use that and see if next
one can handle it and just sort of
evolved and evolved involved and that's
sort of people started saying all this
could be actually be useful and so it's
matter of figuring what kind of how it's
going to be packaged in with other
things obviously is a it might be in
Oracle's interest to tie it in with some
EE you know activity right so we have to
figure out how that's going to work
Oh
are separate things that we
what
hmm again kill would be qualified to
respond here you need a microphone I
kill ya you have to come up here and
join us bring a chair whatever I know
this is the first question that people
have might have the same questions an
hour after this but it's actually none
of our worries
and so my understanding of it is that
there's really two parts note note is
really two parts there's this core part
which you would think of as being like
the the runtime environment and then
there's these modules that can go over
top of it now those modules can also
access native stuff too but typically
they don't they rely on the core stuff
so and we're primarily focusing on
getting that core done that so then once
that's out there then people can bring a
modules for mother from other things
but
we're probably going to end up with two
different module formats I I don't see
how we can avoid it because I think the
thing is that the node world is going to
go one way and javascript is going to go
the other way right and so but you know
for us I don't think it's a stretch to
do both it's you know it's doesn't as
long as as long as we're talking about
module systems for a while we had this
design idea that we might might ship
nass worn with standard common J's
module implementation in it I used to
work on Mozilla Rhino before and I
implemented a common Reyes module system
for that other gardening today 170 that
figured you know and I already know how
to do that why don't I do the same thing
for an asshole and after a while it
turned out to not be such a good idea
because it turns out that note jas
module system is well it's not exactly
compatible with the actual common J's
specification it has a all kinds of
special cases and exceptions related to
handling of modules that are loaded from
files and so on so on we then felt that
actually shipping a any module system as
part of an asshole would actually
probably negatively interfere with
people trying to use frameworks that
have their own implementation of it so
in the end just just to not enforce any
any particular implementation just
decided to okay nice one will not have a
module system we do have a script
caching system based on a URI but that's
an entirely different beast right is
just avoiding recompilation of things
that were already being parsed once
again can be identified as the same
thing but yeah so you know as nASA as
far as NASA phone is considered you can
use any framework that implements any
flavor of a mutual system on it because
we don't have our own as we shouldn't
you have to think everything at Norton
s1 is being sort of a coral language
right and and then everything else is
what what you know people it tends to be
religion
top of that that part of it and
everybody has their own idea what's the
right way to doing things especially in
the JavaScript world it's just like it's
very fragmented and you know everybody
has a different approach about doing
things with their favorite library so
it's best that we do not get involved in
that now or Oracle as a company when we
actually go off and work with it
ourselves internally we may have a
framework that we we prefer and maybe at
some point that framework would become
the air Oracle framework that you know
preference and become public but in the
short term we're just focusing on
getting javascript in people's hands
right
right now there's some some things that
you know look so there's modules there's
multi-threading and then security those
are the sort of the big three things we
have to think about and obviously in EE
world those things are you know very
important so we'll probably do what
Oracle needs as opposed to what's the
right thing to do because you know in
each of those areas is very specific
needs you know with within the company
but that doesn't stop other people going
off and doing their own thing because
it's a programming language you have
access to all the Java code that's
sitting out there you can do whatever
you want you know you can add J&amp;amp;I and to
do special case things and it's it's
very flexible that way but the NASA one
is a runtime is completely neutral which
we got to that
yeah I'm interested too yeah you know
right now it's like virgin soil there's
so much stuff that's fairly
self-contained that people can
contribute and one of the examples I had
was a an NGO original expressions and
there are several around it's sort of
fit or white with a few tweaks I hope
there's several several examples of what
with which people can help out with
another is just to go through all our
Java code that's implemented for like
conforming to the spec and tweaking its
it runs faster so it's like plenty of
stuff to do with the stage and I mature
Michelle she can give us an idea of how
the open sourcing project process works
i I don't know myself well uh sorry if
that's not I was going to say that the
thing is that it we really haven't
nailed down what the process will be for
an open source but the thing is that
there will be it won't will not be a
free-for-all because the thing is that
we want to make sure that that's why
this couldn't solve it so there'll be a
process of some sort to make sure that
the right thing gets done as we go along
but I'm thinking when I was more
arresting when will the public look at
the have a look at the source code it
won't be too old won't be too far it's
not that far from the Future II actually
so last year we've announced that we
were with open source last one in 2012
and we're still announcing in in 2012 so
we haven't no actually we said 2012 q
four yeah 25 yards of a school year in
could be q400 2012
calendar your calendar yet so we can
talk about how we cannot talk about yeah
yeah so but anyway I was thinking that
my Marcus made the remark that we're
sort of in a situation where you know
when the tsunami is coming with where
the water is sort of pulling away you
know and i think that when it gets out
there that we're going to get hit with a
big wave and we're going to flop around
a little bit at the beginning i think i
try to to get it settle down but i think
there'll be clear leaders in the
community that will step up and say okay
you know these are the type of people we
want to participate and and they will
contribute well and everybody everybody
benefits that's that's the big thing a
lot of people with JavaScript experience
out there and I like that didn't j/s
people they are working hard on their in
both dynamic based JavaScript runtime so
maybe we can absorb them or like have
them help out or whatever in elimination
I think the words you were looking for
is a simile assimilated no because again
those are sort of things about jQuery
yeah so we have to make it clear the
NASA one is just a pure JavaScript ring
it's not integrated into a browser so
that means by default it doesn't
necessarily come with a Dom right so so
a lot of the jquery stuff roll eyes on
the existence of it on and a lot of
those others like though Joe and whatnot
they all so that doesn't mean we ignore
them because sometimes we run them
through NASA forum to see if they
compile and see if some of the code runs
and all its first I checked it we check
you know we're checking on the but until
until nass horn is integrated in
something like WebKit that's not likely
going to happen
so before testing we have a large zoo of
a like real world javascript application
that we run on a lawn check-in test so
like a lot of third-party stuff that's
very common every time we add one of
those have to spend my Friday and I
talking to a lawyer in Texas so they're
like but I do that because we need that
test suite let's go say something else
oh yeah but so I think the thing is that
it's it's a we don't have a clear
statement on what we're going to do
about client but we're pushing the FX
solution fairly hard because because
it's available now and you can do it you
know we've proven that it's fairly easy
to do and also that we're finding that
since we're targeting client and and
embedded systems that FX is a lot
lighter than any web solution would be
because what like WebKit is huge and I
know the FX team avoided doing anything
with WebKit directly because of the fact
that it was it took up a lot of memory
not sure familiar with the web views it
in gel FX but their other quite
impressed actually the way you can you
mess with Java and Java effects and
JavaScript and and as it sort of
seamlessly works really well with very
little code so so I was positively
impressed by that mm-hmm was a really
cool talk today about working Gunners on
a per Seco but like stuff they done with
the web use combining different
technologies javafx and JavaScript cool
demos yeah it's so that demo how many
here were here yesterday at the last one
talk at three okay so we did a demo of
the fireworks fireworks application from
from FX and I pointed out that that
originally that demo was written in
JavaScript and it was part of the Google
library and and then the FX people
converted into Java and then then we
converted it from Java back to
JavaScript so it was originally written
for Dom but then when it went to FX then
came back and still written in FX
written in JavaScript ah nobody on my
team yeah yeah no we pretty it sort of
said fairly early on that we don't paint
herself with anybody else's stuff right
so we I avoided looking at rhino code
originally some people on my team
actually worked in Rhino code but when I
did the original coding I didn't look at
it not anything in the right now because
I just wanted to avoid dating painting
it so we have actually have three people
in our team that were Rhino people it's
i tella huntersville an offer who was
just come on recently he was the sort of
the last maintainer of rhino code and
somebody who's been a long-term oracle
member cinder who's who did a lot of
work on the 223 javax script and so
they've all worked in right now so
there's they have some familiarity with
that with that so it's been it's been
good to actually have them on the team
because they know the standards fairly
well and if you if you ever looked at
the specification for javascript it's
just that it's a nightmare to figure it
and it's a sort of jojo's given in
general when you use like a limited
subset can be fairly elegant I'm saying
that like take that with large grain of
salt but still like fairly for some
definition of fairly but but for someone
who's read the compilers most of his
professional career this is the worst
yeah just not the voice it's a challenge
javascript is one of the most
challenging compiler
r n times we've ever had to do yes no
challenge is only opportunities yes yes
like they can get around them up or
something yeah yeah there's always the
slight quirk that you just can't believe
I don't know how many people have seen
the the the wat video yeah my life every
day yeah it's like this guy did this
talk about you know what does JavaScript
do with this expression and you know
it's like you're trying to figure out
what it what it is it's just so
something as simple as like X in
JavaScript that can be anything that
could be a getter with global side
effects you have no idea yes
turns off some respect for opposition
a problem probably not in the near
future so we have we have two basic
modes which is basically strict in a
non-stretch right so this you know
basically both bullets were fully
compliant right to the spec there's some
other things that that are there
somebody pointed out in a Twitter their
vote for each like what's out for each
and example and say oh that's not part
of the specification level I think if
you look in some of the harmony stuff
it's it's there ready to go in and we
added stuff for scripting we added like
here strings and edit strings and pound
comments so you can do shebang style
scripting with that print line load but
these are all pluggable sort of plugins
type things that they're not they're by
they're all Anton's we also have a
compatibility script so that if you have
rhino code you can run add this
compatibility script and it will bring
forward than your code to stand or so so
as an example under under proto does not
exist in this one because it's bad thing
you have to you should be using create
object great instead but if you if you
use the compatibility layer from 44 I
know it will give you under under porter
if you want so
anybody on the side
yep
yes yes yes we support
yes well two degrees earn um handling of
Java classes in javascript is every Java
class is considered formal a
specification point of view to be a host
object and as such it doesn't
necessarily behave as a as a as an
internal JavaScript object so just as
you can in Dom you can have window and
document be basically magical objects
with unpredictable properties from the
JavaScript semantics they allowed to be
host objects are allowed to be in the
same vein java objects that that
manifest themselves within a JavaScript
program are all host objects so
JavaScript subclass superclass relation
it does not translate to to prototype
javascript java objects don't want don't
even have a prototype as such because
they don't have to Rhino had this whole
approach of having a 90 representation
for java class and then your native
objects would be represented as
javascript objects that have a prototype
to the object that represents the class
i found that not terribly useful fairly
calm trees and you cannot really match
the java i cannot really manage to java
semantics to the javascript semantics
consider for example that in JavaScript
you can take a function from one object
right and you can reassign it to a
different object in when it's invoke
there it will be invoked with a with
that object now you cannot really do
that for a job object because even if
you could extract the java method from
the object which as a matter of fact we
we are trying to support and probably
will you cannot just arbitrarily bind it
into some javascript object because
because then when you invoke it that
java method expected that if it came
from class named person it would expect
that it's this is typed as java class
person
and there's no way i called a vm won't
let you to invoke that with a generic
Script object right so that's why it's
it's much better to make it explicit
that this is a java object to have api's
to handle the java object within
javascript instead of trying to create
sort a transparency between Java and
JavaScript tours because you can never
go to 100% transparency and there would
be education that would get you so the
programmer is much better often and
anyway even in your program if you need
to handle them a little bit specifically
at least your program is explicit about
the fact that it's using a Java API and
it's not a pure JavaScript program
second part of your question can we
subclass java classes from javascript
the answer is yes this is a typical
example when you have a rhino allowed
for interfaces right typical example is
you have a single abstract method
interface that you want to use as a call
back and you just need to define a
function that will be invoked and you
can pass it as this we did with the
implement mass one in such a way we
needed it for some use cases in node
where you can actually use the same
syntax to to subclass java class in Java
Script so you can provide definitions
for abstract methods that in in
JavaScript and they're an appropriate
proxy object gets created that when on
the Java side the method is invoked then
the appropriate JavaScript functions
will be involved so yeah it works so
it's going to say so the thing is that
it the point here was there's a proxy
object that's constructed it which is a
pure Java object which passes it on to
your JavaScript object so you can't
subclass from the proxy which is what
you'd have to do in order to create the
sub progress okay but but I think the
thing is that you still you could use
that JavaScript object is as a prototype
to another other things if it wasn't
being using a callback would be fine it
was so called three way we would need to
try this I don't see a conceptual
problem with the Java object serving as
a prototype for some JavaScript object
because it's just all about the
delegation righty of the identifier
lookups oh man this shitty erratically
or not I haven't got a chance talk to
you but tell me about the question
yesterday about when you're doing java
subclassing how do you handle
overloading so it seems me that we need
to add the parentheses notation within I
don't think we need to hear again the
soldering the 12 this is a this is again
a clear mismatch between between the
Java type system and the JavaScript's
well excuse for a type system the the
way this currently works is that if you
have a named function in the object that
serves as the source for the functions
for for the implementation of a Java
subclass then since JavaScript functions
don't have overloading because by
definition they can't have overloading
by tight because parameters don't have
type in JavaScript and all functions in
JavaScript are by definition have
infinite arity because if you pass more
arguments that they define you can still
get them through the arguments array so
there is no the concept of overloading
you cannot overload by everything you
cannot cannot overload by type so there
is no such thing as overloading in Java
Script so what my implementation works
by if you specify a function by a name
that function is used as the
implementation for all all the overloads
and if you as the brighter you are aware
that the class that you are subclassing
might have several overloads with that
name then you will actually need to do a
manual dispatch within your metal body
that's all you can do go
yes
no well I wish I had a whiteboard your
JavaScript function that is used to
extend the that's used as an
implementation of a java method it does
not have any intrinsic access to to the
job at dis of the proxy object that it's
being routed through you can actually
access that this quite simply you just
have to assign it to a variable in the
scope where you define that so say VAR r
equals new java lund runnable whatever
that's an interface but you can say time
and task that's a class right and in
Europe then you specify an object
literal with the function run and you
can actually refer to our and that our
will actually be that that one now
obviously this doesn't really work in
polymorph in the situation and so on but
again there is really no clear-cut way
to to make this work so right now if you
if you refer to this in the function you
actually get the JavaScript literal
object or whatever object that you use
which is actually a valid thing because
you might actually have some other
members in it you actually can store
state in it by having variables in it so
this in the invoked function will refer
to be to the object literal where the
function was defined for the proxy and
not to the Java this the Java this is
such is not explicitly exposed at all
therefore you cannot and there's no for
the same reason there's no super super
invocation either so
if you need to have more in that sense
much more complex logic in in your
implementation while sort of out of luck
I guess the whole thing is really just
meant for you it's usually meant just
really for implementing things that will
be serving as lightweight callbacks and
so on I'm not saying that we are
intentional limiting to this scope I
think that by the fact that at first I
was actually really happy i coded this
whole thing fairly quickly and but I was
only supporting an abstract classes and
only supporting implementation of
abstract methods on the class and then I
was happily going to a kill telling him
that because you needed that in node is
no the implementation here you are using
be merry it's like yeah can I also
override an existing method no you
cannot yeah but can I subclass a non
abstract class you can say you need that
and then turns out he needed that so I
went back to the drawing board and did
all the all the rest then it is quite a
lot of work but so in the end we have a
situation where you can subclass
anything that's not final and its public
you can override methods in addition to
implementing abstract once the class
doesn't even need to be abstract so you
can override metals and so on but these
things that require Java access rules as
an invocation of a super which might be
protected or this dot something that
might be protected now the best work
and nor constructively it's lubricant
sure super constructors all constructors
are separate because when oh yeah that's
that's actually one of the funny things
when you start work on out subclassing
of a java class as opposed to
implementing an interface is that you
might have non-trivial constructors
right so what we did is that when you
are subclassing a java class you end up
with a proxy that that just had exposes
all the public and protected
constructors that the superclass had and
is just pretty much passing through the
parameters to the to the original
constructor
right that's why you needed the
overriding methods and sub classical
collapse the classes too because we just
ran into the real world ap is where we
needed those as in javafx and so I
suppose we say bottom line is is that
sometimes you have to write some Java
code in order to fit it all right I
could make it work but well not I mean
no absolutely necessarily there could
exist I mean technically of course we
could get those functions and make sure
that they exist within a scope that also
exposes another identifier named super
that actually allows you an invocation
through to the to the Super methods but
protected access would get us with a
security manager still because it's just
not coming from because the call is
ultimately not coming from a Java class
it's coming from because the the
subclass is actually just the little
proxy that delegates to JavaScript and
then the actual invocation is in
JavaScript so if you try to invoke a
protective method you're protected
invocation is not coming from the
subclassed class but rather from
something that it delegates to so just
it's yeah it's a again so transparency
with your host platform you can only
take it so far
cases Alexa get into GTA stop that once
you have those expression
enjoy
javascript
should I expect it should be different
also means
the other question
I'm sorry I candidly yes is this a
the whole chess are scripting
22 z yes yeah that's what yeah so yeah
that's that's what we're primarily
driving off of okay and it's actually
the most painless wait between buoys on
runtime right now right and actually the
shelves that we provide for Nassau are
all it doesn't is really goes off and
calls two to three and then does it so
it's it's it's extremely painless
interface to use it gives you the
ability to to go off and get whatever
scripting language you want in our case
you can either well with jdk a that well
you can either specify JavaScript or
NASA horn and it will go off and get it
currently if you specify JavaScript
it'll go off and get Rhino in seven but
in eight it will go actually go off and
get ass horn and then once you create an
invocation of that sauron engine you can
bind global values and you know retrieve
global values and access properties and
it's you know it's a very slick
interface to work with and it works this
works the same with Ruby and any other
the other the scripting languages
John
you know you mean to put in demos well
we have a set of demos it ya know if you
came to talk me at all kinds of those
yesterdays I kill you probably I mean oh
yes you shall we saw that we were fall
yeah you could actually if it comes the
follow-up talk kiehl's gonna do some
demos you can show a couple shells just
is given idea yep general it is Java
eggs don't script script engine manager
dot get engine by type applications like
JavaScript or or Nashville or get an
issue by name Nass horn you get back a
script engine tell it to load the script
tell it to evaluate it we also support
the in vocal and compile able interfaces
so it's a if you if you just look at the
documentation for java x script package
well yeah that's all you need that's all
you need it's pretty straight honest
yeah and that hasn't changes in a long
time so it's pretty pretty fairly well
designed yeah so we'll be shipping with
at least one shell which is which is
basically one that will allow you to
specify JS file on the command line or
or work interactively much the same as
rhino or v8 is set up to do
do we have any interesting stories we
want to tell americus well invoke
dynamic as is a newborn child it's easy
to over use it for everything if you
have a dynamic language like Java Script
you use it for arithmetic because you
don't know if the compile time you have
very little information in JavaScript
snow types right but if you the
traditional way it like is to say
everything is a java object and if it's
an end ja login to do it's a box type
it's a double its Java but that's
actually quite slow for several reasons
so we combined both like local biker
variables of as narrow types it can find
the compile time of the compile time
analysis we can use and whenever we
don't know anything whenever something
has deferred to runtime computations we
have to using evoke dynamic we're using
book dynamics for getting the setting
properties because as I said earlier a
or X can be anything it could be a
method can be a getter it could be just
a numeric value so ghetto setters set by
element brackets get by on brackets
calls the allocations of objects
everything like I was implemented with
invoke dynamics there which is simple
way to do it of course put some demands
on the on the JVM because we we rather
complex method on the logic in some of
the cases for we do log in a worst case
of a new operations like seven levels of
meth and hamel's and argument
collections and pairings and stuff to
get it right which they're all quite
small so so they should be like in line
is one cold chain to my little blob but
it's it's the vm is working on like
getting that better right now we see
some artifacts but I mean the good news
is that for most real life applications
so to speak we we completely blow rhino
to the water performance wise today
already we had yesterday sample are from
Twitter came up and showed us like a
benchmark is written for for mustache
java using NASA orbiters factor nine ten
faster
Rhino just outside out of the box and we
have spent relatively little time it
feels about it I'm saying it because
I've spent a lot of time but but like
global these tools time performance
tuning working with the JVM and like
getting our human dynamics right so it's
quite encouraging that things like our
node implementation is actually quite
fast it's like not ola natey no level
but it's in the bolt it's time the
ballpark but it's definitely like
possible to get there yes kill it is I
mean we are I feel it's going to do a
check-in fastly with calls so we can
implement them faster and probably next
week how about Friday Friday yeah yeah
we don't like to check-in things I even
though there's a lot of complexity
involved in the vm sometimes doesn't
catch up with all the stuff we do it's
encouraging to see that we have so much
better than right now without
significant multi-person performance
efforts yet being spent so so it feels
like this right direction some of the
things we can probably never beat a
native runtime like spider monkey or v8
on as like numb cryptographic number
crunching if you own the runtime and
have your own object representation and
it's really hard to like get the vm work
with that but we're also doing some
intrinsic can go directly into the vm
and without violating any java stylers
or things like that to help out the
performance is is an ongoing research
area so when I when we started the
project I basically sort of we have this
Creed that we were going to conform and
conformance correctness and performance
that was the order we were going to do
things so so we're basically almost a
hundred percent conforming according
test two to six to one one test left
that we're not passing in atilla's got
it in his lap and on the next week or so
he'll have it done so well we'll have a
hundred percent conformance which is
which is probably eight to twelve bugs
that better than any other vm on the
market right now so I think that's
pretty cool right I was invited to five
percent still so I mean I yeah as a
replacement we were more conforming as
well right so actually say I'm said 20
times he said 20 x that was actually at
broadcast over the over Twitter so that
was so it was pretty it was pretty cool
that you know just something neat he was
given him that on Friday he spent all
day Saturday just poking around with it
he didn't have to change any of this
JavaScript code and just worked and he
was a Mason see yeah it's pretty cool
that like the case you can see the
compliance you try stuff with Naz a'ren
and it it works either that or you made
a massive sacrifice to the demo gods
yesterday but it's it's my it's my like
when I try stuff with Mazarin right now
either it usually it works out of the
box so that's to be clever compliance
here so so we're may focus over the next
year or so before jdk came he comes that
will be focusing on hardening the
environment and in performance obviously
improving performance there's certain
things that we have to worry about like
the memory management make sure that
we're not thrush and memories to pieces
and the we that we don't leak and we
yeah i just wrote miles we r memory
profile or before yeah so these so these
are all things that we we we actually
have a little bit of leisure time to do
it it's it's still a lot of hard-working
video yeah but a hard work to do yet but
but the thing is that it's not like
we're got to have it done next week you
know and i think it's we have time to
get it right and that is basically what
i'm trying to say anything so with the
open source
potential coming up we hope to be able
to to bring other people on board to to
introduce new technologies into the
environment new ideas one of the things
I thought up fairly early on night when
I came off of the FX team and started
working on this I thought well maybe we
could add add features that would help
FX say the one of the big things FX has
is binding where values change send up
propagation propagate the change through
and if that could be built into the
language it would make people who are
writing FX applications that would make
it easier for them to do so so there's
lots of possibilities there is lots of
possibilities work on performance so you
know if you're if you have any interest
in working on this for the project when
it becomes open source there's there's
tons of things to do so so we're at the
top of the hour here and how many node
user and we have in the on the audience
is using note to know didn't work
north or no jar works on windows
yes yes yes what sort of time is the
same as a java start a time yeah same
issues yeah yeah that plus many other
things I guess but yeah to such an
extent and JD gate we have profiles so
if I don't know if nazron will be able
to run with a small profile
the train but Google's
jumpin screwed directly
things
it's not so much so Horning involved and
wellness horan it comes you know we're
not that's one comes from obviously is
German it's it's it's German for writer
and rhinoceros and the predecessor is
right now right yes yeah yeah so but but
it the project was primarily designed to
put scripting in Java right and and in
the Java world it's not so much to to be
a grand solution for JavaScript it's
mostly to be able to provide scripting
in a Java world
we can't get out All Right see thought
this is the same group of people for
both
guys
we will let that mean we're at the
minute we're pretty much the same root
for it's the same group yes yes okay
we're getting restless okay open the
doors thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
