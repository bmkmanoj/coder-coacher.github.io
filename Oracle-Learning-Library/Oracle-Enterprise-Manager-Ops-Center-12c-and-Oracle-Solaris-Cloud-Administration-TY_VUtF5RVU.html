will be consuming resources in the
environment let's examine how the cloud
administrator will leverage opscenter to
help them with his daily job let's
immediately go straight to the virtual
data center here we see we have two
clouds in the environment we have the
SCA production cloud which we've just
experienced with the end user and we
also have the Santa Clara quality and
test cloud which is built on ovm x86 as
we dig deeper into these virtual data
centers we can see they're made out of
networking storage multiple server pulls
and then accounts that happen to have
virtuals virtual machines allocated to
them
here we see much of the same views as
the end user was seen the cloud
administrator can see across multiple
clouds and accounts let's dig a little
bit deeper into the components that make
up our virtual data center one of the
key components of the virtual data
center is the server pool in this case
we have a production pool let's dig
deeper into that production pool by
going to the server pools tab here I
have multiple pools in the environment
at the top I have some opium for spark
pools I have the old vm x86 server pools
and then I also have a server pole made
out of Solaris zones there's many things
that I can do with these server pools
one of the most exciting things about
server pools are the level of automation
they bring to the virtual data center
let's explore what automation is
available
here we have three types of policies
with placement policies auto balancing
policies and automatic recovery
placement policies will allow top-center
to place automatically the guests
virtual machine on a global zone or a
Dom 0 or a control domain that has the
lowest relative load it can place them
on the lowest allocated CPU and memory
or it can place them on an energy policy
minimizing the overall power consumption
across the multiple physical servers it
will classify a physical machine as
being over utilized if the CPU
utilization goes over 75 percent for
more than 10 minutes those are the
placement policies we also have
balancing policies balancing policies
will allow me to add a specific point in
time on a calendar automatically balance
the pool make sure everybody's using
resources equally or it'll allow me to
do it on a very ad hoc nature we also
have automatic recovery or a che
available for our Solaris zone server
pools and our ovm x86 server pools and
lastly we have a migration script many
people have changed control policies
they want to be notified when things
move they want to plug into a larger
system or they want to manipulate some
storage this migration script interface
allows people to hook in what they need
to take care of
next let's explore what we can do at the
virtual machine level here i can add
storage to a virtual machine replicate
it or clone it i can migrate it
individually on an ad hoc basis or i can
move the storage itself a full life
cycle of shutting it down or halting it
let's explore doing a live migration of
a no vm spark box here i see that i have
a box with eight gigs of ram available
I noticed the el dom that I want to move
though is consuming 10 gigs of ram I've
can very quickly and dynamically change
the RAM allocation to the guest moving
it to a range that's acceptable by the
other physical box in the pool now I can
very quickly migrate the logical domain
and with a click of a button I've live
migrated in ovm spark workload now let's
explore now let's explore the servers
our clouds just don't run on thin air
they run on machines an OP Center has a
great feature set that allows us to
drive very deep into the hardware here I
can dig into the status and the field
replaceable unit information for the CPU
memory network adapter disks power
supplies fans I can even take a snapshot
of the service processor I can dig into
the energy consumption of the box I can
look at the power consumption based on
cpu utilization but I can also get into
the temperature the efficiency of the
cooling system in the room based on the
inlet power and the efficiency of my
rack arrangement based on the based on
the outlet temperature
the cloud isn't all about pools and
physical boxes it's also about operating
systems and operating systems need
analytics and he ran ops center we have
a great analytic feature set to increase
our observable attea cross that cloud
notice how i have OS analytics in zone
analytics very quickly i can see that
the total cpu consumption of this box is
at four percent the physical box now i
have policies that guard the physical
box performance but also notice one of
my work loads over here one of the
individual zones is at a hundred percent
i can dig a little bit deeper now let's
troubleshoot that on the fly let's come
over here and edit dynamically the
number of cpus i have allocated out to
that individual slayer zone i can double
its CPU count and then very quickly we
can see how his workload has been cut in
half
and things are now moving much more
efficiently opscenter doesn't just allow
me to change CPU and memory allocations
dynamically it also allows me to control
the network bandwidth here i can use
less Elevens flow control i can change
the priority based on a virtual nic card
that my zone is sitting on and I could
drop its max bandwidth down to 50
megabytes this allows me to control my
workloads very efficiently another cool
concept in solaris our ZFS snapshots and
alternate boot environments here I can
take free snapshots based on file system
space of my operating system as it is
live and in production I can then take
one of those snapshots and then create
an alternate boot environment now I have
quarterly software test up under the
alternative boot environments I can
select it and make it active at any time
I want opscenter doesn't stop at
operating systems through its
integration with enterprise manager
cloud control ops center now has the
awareness of Oracle Applications here we
can see an oracle database happens to be
running on one of these linux boxes i
can get dig deeper into that oracle
database without leaving the opscenter
user interface leveraging a out of the
box plug in with enterprise manager
cloud control option is allowed to see
target information it's allowed to
subscribe to the events for individual
targets and it's allowed to leverage its
process analytics to do business
performance awareness on the fly here we
can track individual processes to their
target types
now everybody knows that virtual data
centers or clouds are highly leveraged
very quickly somebody can run out of
resources and very quickly our
administration staff needs a way to
replenish the clouds here we can see our
ovm x86 cloud is quite small it already
has two accounts allocated to it and it
only has 16 v cpus available let's look
at how those accounts are doing
let's dig a little bit deeper into this
application form and we noticed here
that we have five CPUs allocated out of
our maximum assignment of eight I think
it's time to add some more vcp use to
this cloud leveraging op centers
deployment plans I can take a multi-step
process and make it a single click item
here I have a plan called attached to
enterprise cloud and in this plan i'm
going to configure the service processor
i'm going to lay down a raid controller
configuration that fits my ovs
hypervisor i'm going to update the
firmware to the latest version available
from the factory and i'm going to
install that OVS hypervisor come over
here to my dynamic groups and i see i
have a group in Broomfield Colorado
named new equipment ops center has an
incredible discovery prowess where it
can scan your network for Oracle
hardware has oracle hardware is brought
in racks and cabled op center can
discover it and dynamically add it into
this new equipment group very quickly I
can select the entire group
and view its membership pric procurement
has purchased some sunblade x 60 to 70 s
come down to my install server action I
select my deployment plan of interest
and I apply my plan I simply need to
select the subnet that I want these ovs
hypervisors to come up on I'm going to
pick the 0 port I'm going to give it an
IP address range I'm going to select the
ovm manager I want to connect these
individual vs is too now i'm going to
select a server pool as part of the
deployment plan this allows me to very
quickly allocate those resources to
their proper end users i have pools
associate to virtual data centers and i
have virtual data centers associated to
accounts so now all i have to do is make
that connection here at the earliest
point in the servers life it's bare
metal OS provisioning select the server
pool in next
and we'll go ahead and schedule that job
to run immediately now as we wait for
those servers to install we can come
over to the virtual data center and
we'll see once those servers come online
our resources are increased we've gone
from 16v CPUs 288 Oracle Enterprise
Manager ops center leveraging the latest
technologies and infrastructure
operations has never been easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
