Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
TiVo series this demo shows you how to
visually compare to past periods of time
when for example you run the same
activity twice but one was more impacted
than the other and you need to
understand why the performance decreased
during the second run for this prepare
the target database by deploying
packages and this only once and then you
can use the compare period a DDM to get
changes that happened and the effects
that were mapped to the root causes of
the performance decrease or could be
also an increase once you have deployed
the PL sequel database management
packages you can use the compare period
addm we discover in the performance page
that the same application workload that
run twice run much slower the second
time we would like to know the reasons
of this performance decrease whereas no
change on the statements scripts
occurred for this we use the compare
period addm so click on the performance
button in the awr so you click on the
compare period ad DN and we will supply
in the first step the begin time and end
time for the comparison period so the
period that run slower than the base
period the first one so let's fill in
the values here with a calendar so the
begin time of this comparison period
occurred on the 4th of July and around
6:30 tube in the morning so the end of
this
though period happened at around 650 and
then you specify the parameters for the
base period that will be the referenced
period so again we can specify the begin
time of an end time of this base period
so let's specify the begin the beguine
time and end time so let's say it
started around 619 until 625 and again
we could have used here either a
baseline or for reference or either not
set of one snapshot or of a previous day
and in this case it would have used at
the same time as the comparison period
so let's run this comparison and see the
result so now it's going to take some
time to make the comparison and here we
are the overview shows two periods on
the left the base period the referenced
one and on the right the compare period
the referencing one which in our case
ran much slower than the base period
between the two periods the report shows
that they are 100% compatible this means
that you can rely on the comparison as
both periods contain identical sequel
statements as this is an intelligent
reporting we get the changes that
occurred between the two periods and
that could be the reasons why the
performance was different
let's view the changes in the
configuration tab and we discover from
this configuration tab that on the
instance level regarding the memory
target there was a change between the
base period and the comparison period so
in the base period we had
around three hundred and seventy six
megabytes and in the comparison period
we had around eight hundred and eighty
megabytes and regarding another
parameter in the instance which is the
result cache mode it was during the base
period said to force for us during the
comparison period it was set to menu now
this is the most interesting part in the
sense that we can view the effects of
such changes and the impact it could
have on what happened in the performance
decrease so in the finding tab it shows
that there was an impact on host CPU
using saying that for example in the
comparison period it had an impact of 53
percent more than on the base period
regarding the buffer cache latches it
had an impact in the comparison period
of 50 percent more on the active
sessions rather than on the base period
and if you want to have more details on
each of these effects related to the
changes that happened then you just
select for example the buffer cache
latches to get some more information
about this effect that could have
happened on the comparison period
sessions and statements now there was
also an impact on the top request
sequels and on the shared pool edges as
we can see during the comparison period
we had an impact of 118 percent on the
average sessions whereas during the
basic period we had only 0.19 percent
which has an impact of 12 percent more
on the comparison period rather than on
the basic period
now it's also interesting to know the
resources that were consumed during the
comparison period and the base period so
let's click on the resource tab and here
it's declined under four areas the CPU
consumed during the base period and the
CPU consumed during the comparison
period and we can also identify the
memory consumed during the base and
comparison period the iOS and the
interconnects and here it just informs
us that we should point to both areas
CPU and memory consumed and these were
the resources that were consumed mostly
consumed during these two periods and
that also may have resulted from the
impact the effects of the changes that
occurred so regarding the the CPU
consumption during the base period we
see that the database consumed eight
point seven percent of CPU whereas
during the comparison period which was
slower it consumes seventeen point six
percent
so that is twice as much CPU as during
the base period this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
