name is jenna Kuiper's i'm with SLT and
in texas and i've been working with the
meal over the last nine years and i'm
the lead information architect CB is a
company there's about 145 years old
started in Amsterdam I don't go too far
into history but are in the middle of a
big use change and it's the digital
transition from physical books to ebooks
we serve about ninety percent of the
market do logistics between publishers
and the book sales in the Netherlands
and all of a sudden there is something
called an e-book and if the market is
changing the rise for information is
used the demand for information from our
customers and we deliver that as a
service to our customers our challenge
is to support the digital transformation
for our customers we deliver bi as a
service to our customers we are doing it
already from 1997 do the transformation
and the pressure on the market the
declining physical market the rising
digital market you need to have inside
information on a very low grain level
what's going with my books who is
selling my books I man going to bricks
am I going to clicks is it streaming
what is new business model I was
surprised that letter T between physical
books and digital books a lot a lot a
lot of questions by our customers so we
need technology to answer those
questions by a huge amount of data there
is where alka came in and Renee knows
everything about the change a couple of
years ago we moved from we moved to
exadata for our primary data warehouse
environment and that already gave
enormous boost in performance but like a
meal set with the with the change that's
going on in the book market and the
ebooks coming out and the faster a need
for information and the need for faster
information actually led us to a new
architecture so we got into X Linux a
couple of years ago and the most recent
addition to the X oolitic machine was
database in memory so we use obiee we
have reported actually run they used to
run for over 20 seconds but how
it's over a billion records that the
report hits and yet again we wanted to
improve that performance so we
introduced database 12c on the ex latex
box we set up in memory and somehow that
turned out to be the Silver Bullet the
immediate response times went down from
over 20 seconds to split second and not
only we are happy but the customers are
happy as well a very important thing
nowadays is that people want to have
great visuals but also great response
times because if you're looking at the
information for example at your iPad if
you don't have response within two
seconds they're gonna check the Wi-Fi
and if we want to have a mobile platform
given the inside information what's
going on in business what's going on in
retail with the books therefore you need
response time within two seconds only a
mobile device but we got huge amount of
datas under the merger dro rows of data
must be crunched and an instant to
answer the questions of the publishers
and booksellers and there was not not
only beneficial to the end-users it was
also beneficial for our development team
because we could get rid of indexes we
could get rid of materialized views
basically a lot of knowledge that we had
built up over the years around data
modeling and performance shooting we
could have thrown in the bin because
once we set up database in memory the
only thing we needed to set up was the
lowest grain of data in tables we have
no indexes we have no materialized views
anymore only rotator raw data so there's
less objects to manage and and the
beautiful thing is if you don't need to
worry about performance or data modeling
or indexes anymore you could put all the
effort in creating real value out of
money out of information for your
customers so instead to be internally
focused to technology you can be
excellently focused to the business and
that's a beautiful thing that came along
with dbm yes and what adds to that is
that the development team now is even
faster in creating new report in
creating inside when you run your
development team and they create new new
reports and you have to wait for over 40
seconds to get a result that is not
satisfactory you have to
do the report now they have that result
within one second so the actually
development process has become much more
like much faster and we change our
development methods to agile development
and because that speed of fault
designing it embraces the way you are
developing agile so you can deliver
every two weeks new insight information
to your customers instead of delivering
performance issues and fix it issues
every week and what have we learned what
if we learned put everything in memory
and you're done no in axis normal to
LSU's no aggregates raw data I'm for 18
years in the bi business and its really
amazed me flipping the switch has never
been easier and happy customers don't
forget about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
