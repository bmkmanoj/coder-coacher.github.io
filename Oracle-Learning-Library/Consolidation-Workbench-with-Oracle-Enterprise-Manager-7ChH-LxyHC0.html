Enterprise Manager database
consolidation workbench today we're
going to look a little bit closer on the
new database consolidation workbench
feature that you find in Oracle's
Enterprise Manager 13c let's begin with
why do we want to consolidate you want
to consolidate because you may have a
need to reduce complexity in your data
centers maybe you want to standardize on
a specific server configuration in order
to make maintenance and support easier
you may want to improve the efficiency
drive up the hardware utilization get
better security and also to lower the
costs while you're looking at database
consolidations there are some
considerations that you may want to
explore so what database consolidation
strategy to use can different workloads
coexist with the chosen strategy or will
they conflict because of the workload
characteristics can the system that you
have chosen to consolidate on handle
peak workloads and how can you perform
the migration and the consolidation with
reduce downtime and last but not least
how can you test the consolidation
strategy to minimize your risks there
are many different consolidation
alternatives anything moving from
virtual machines dedicated databases
dedicated schemas or using pluggable
databases each approach has its pros and
cons but as you move from virtual
machines towards dedicated databases
towards pluggable databases you will
increase the consolidation density
Oracle database consolidation workbench
is an end-to-end consolidation solution
and made available in Enterprise Manager
13
it allows you to do a risk free and
accurate approach to consolidate various
databases and through that eliminating
guesswork or human errors the Oracle
database consolidation workbench uses
historical data gathered from the
database and hosts in combination with
awr data to understand what resources
these databases consume Oracle database
consolidation workbench supports Oracle
10 - databases or higher
it also supports consolidation - clouds
or Exadata
it also supports high availability
options to minimize downtime depending
on what kind of source or destination
databases you have the Oracle database
consolidation workbench is an end-to-end
consolidation solution it moves the user
through three different phases the plan
phase where it gives consolidation
advice by identifying candidates
databases for the design consolidation
platform using awr data gathered from
the database the migrate phase helps us
to implement the consolidation plan by
migrating the databases to the new
platform using the enterprise managers
provisioning features and last but not
least the validates phase where we can
use real application testings sequel
performance analyzer to test the
workloads on the consolidated databases
the database consolidation allows us to
estimate resource utilization
under various scenarios and conditions
we also support three different
consolidation modes database to database
using the Oracle multi-tenant features
database to server meaning you're
basically going to servers or exa data
consolidation or Oracle public cloud
consolidation it also identifies com
Lix based on workload characteristics
and if exadata
is a suitable option for your
consolidation strategy if provides
storage and platform advice impact based
on compression or i/o as well as storage
now let's have a look at a demo of the
consolidation workbench as you know this
is a new feature in Enterprise Manager
cloud control 30 and see we begin with
going to the enterprise menu then
selecting consolidate and database
consolidation workbench the database
consolidation workbench allows us to
create what-if scenarios for any case
where we want to consolidate databases
either onto different hardware or to
other databases in order to do this we
have to create the project and within
the project we can then specify what
databases we want to use and where we
want to move these databases let's begin
with creating a new project within the
project we have to specify a name and a
description and then we can specify if
we want to do a consultation from
databases to servers or databases to
databases we are going to do databases
to servers we have to pick the source
databases and we can filter out which
ones we want to see in our case let's
just look at the ones in Oracle Redwood
Shores we're going to pick out five
databases here for the consolidation
project and as you can see we are able
to do multi selects here then we select
them now in this screen we can see the
databases we selected and the resources
that these databases require in order to
work properly so we click Next and then
we can select where we want to move our
databases so the destination candidates
for our consultation we're going to pick
two servers for this
project next we will see how much
resources these servers have available
for us so we click Next in order to do
the consolidation estimations we have to
collect a lot of data from Enterprise
Manager as well as the awr reports in
database on this screen we decide how
much data we want to use for a database
consolidation estimate let's change the
date range here so I go from 0 to 90 now
we click Next we have the option of
using pre-configured scenarios but we're
not going to do that before we submit
this to Enterprise Manager we can review
everything that we've specified let's
submit us the project has now been
created from Enterprise Manager we can
review the source candidates as well as
the source work load the source workload
can be viewed either as line chart or as
a heat map the heat map is really a good
view of the resource utilization
everything from blue with very low
utilization up to green orange red being
the highest utilization we can view CPU
memory or storage the destination
candidates and finally the adviser
findings that helps us to understand if
there's something that we have to think
about the adviser findings here actually
shows us some real problems the ERP
database for example seems to be CPU
bound and we are recommended to do some
tuning on it now let's create a scenario
a scenario is basically an experiment
what if by doing a scenario we can see
how would this particular consolidation
play out for us we specify a name maybe
a description we can also specify how we
want to Alec
the resources how aggressive we wanted
to do let's go for medium we can also
introduce a scale factor if we believe
that we will consume more memory or CPU
resources in the future but let's stick
to a one-to-one scale factor for now
next thing we can do is that we can
define a comp ability for the databases
or just going to leave that we can
specify if we want to use existing
servers or a phantom server for example
when I have extra data machines or if I
want to use compression we can also
specify what is the maximum CPU or
memory utilization let's go by 70% for
the CPU the database consolidation
workbench can automatically map the
different databases that we have and we
are going to use that for our scenario
and then we can review all our
definitions but we're just going to
submit this the database consolidation
workbench can now help us to understand
how successful we would be with our
consolidation scenario now let's have a
look at how well this constellation
would pan out we have our sources we
have the destination servers we have the
mapping of the databases onto the
servers and we can see that we have four
databases on one of the servers the most
important thing here is really the
confidence tab and this indicates here
that we have a lot of red which is a bad
indication if we look at the heat map we
will see a lot of red areas with
exclamation points so this is a good
indicator that the consolidation will
not be successful if we go by this
scenario that we specified since this
was not a really successful scenario
let's look at some other ones that are
already prepared for us
here I have created three different
scenarios doing a consolidation from
database to database using Oracle's
multi-tenant database feature this
scenario has the same scale factor as
the previous one
we don't use any compression and we can
see here that the heat map looks
dramatically different compared to the
other ones that we had since we're using
a database to database consolidation did
this nation side will look a little bit
different so we have one machine here
that holds all of the different
databases that we have regardless if
we're doing database to server
consolidation or database to database
consolidation we still have the same
kind of metrics and we can see the CPU
utilization as well as the memory
utilization on the screen the advisor
findings shows that we have a
potentially CPU bound data source and we
might want to tune that one as well as
that we have a mix of OLTP and DSS
workloads and we are likely to benefit
from a storage solution over by exadata
so what happens if we add compression
here I have a scenario or were added
compression you can look at the heat map
the heat map hasn't changed dramatically
but let's look at the adviser findings
the adviser findings shows us that we
still have some tuning to do since we
added compression most of the
differences it's probably going to be
seen in a storage if we look at the HR
database for example here we can see the
compression estimates that we could have
for the HR database if we would look at
the I ops on the ERP database for
example we would see that we would have
a huge benefit from exit data on the
interconnect bytes here we have an
impact of 71.3%
if we were to use exadata instead I have
another scenario here in this scenario
I'm using a five time scale factor
meaning expecting five times as much
load on the CPU and memory if we look at
the heat map this is of course something
that is barely exercised so we have very
low load on it even if we have a five
times scale factor we see that
everything is running on a Database
Machine and we're actually also using a
two node rack here so all the databases
that pluggable databases are on those
nodes what you have seen in this demo is
that Oracle database consolidation
workbench allows you to create different
what-if scenarios so that you can find
out the optimal consolidation strategy
for your databases we are through the
Oracle database consolidation workbench
eliminating the guesswork and allowing
you to really understand what is going
to happen if you decide to consolidate
your databases and how can you move
forward once you have identified the
right consolidation strategy you can use
Enterprise Manager and the consolidation
workbench to implement this by clicking
implement scenario we're able to select
the migration method simply select your
migration method and generate the
migration command you can now use this
to implement your database consolidation
you can also use the sequel performance
analyzer feature in order to validate
the consolidation now let's have a look
at licensing Oracle's database
consolidation workbench is part of
Oracle's real application testing option
please make sure that your license is
accordingly in addition during your
three phases of
the Oracle database consultation
workbench you may use other database
management packs or options in the
planning phase Oracle database
consultation work punch makes use of the
automatic workload repository the awr
this requires Oracle's Diagnostics
packet to be licensed during the
migration face you're making use of
Oracle's database lifecycle management
pack for Oracle databases additionally
you may use the real application cluster
or active Data Guard during the
migration phase make sure that you
license these accordingly during the
validation phase you're making use of
real application testing but as we
mentioned earlier this is a prerequisite
for using the feature for more
information and documentation on Oracle
database consolidation workbench please
have a look at the Oracle Enterprise
Manager 13c documentation this concludes
our demo thank you for watching
you
