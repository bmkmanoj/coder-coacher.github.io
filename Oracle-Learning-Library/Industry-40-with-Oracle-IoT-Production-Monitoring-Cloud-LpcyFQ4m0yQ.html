Revolution is here
machines are self-configuring and
adapting to efficiently create
personalized products to succeed in
industry 4.0 we will need smart sensors
on-boarded - a computationally superior
IOT platform big data analytics
algorithms and location technologies to
derive real-time context specific
insights as well as augmented human
machine interfaces and mobile devices to
communicate real-time instructions to
the physical world or coyote production
monitoring cloud is designed to help
factory managers with these industry 4.0
goals imagine a factory manager who
manages multiple factories producing a
range of products or Coyote production
monitoring cloud has digital twins of
all factories and products and therefore
tracks key operational performance
metrics to help the factory manager gain
real-time visibility to understand the
current status of factory's products and
machines it helps the factory manager to
identify a specific factory product or
machine that requires attention via the
comparative tab the historical view of
the performance indicator helps to
assess if the poor performance Factory
is a new problem the factory manager can
further diagnose and identify the
specific product that contributes to
poor delivery performance in the product
view the factory manager can identify
the bottleneck machine and study its
health via real-time sensor data using
the business friendly rules engine
Oracle IOT production monitoring cloud
can notify factory managers of machine
health anomalies with integration Oracle
IOT production monitoring cloud can
communicate anomaly incidents to
automatically scheduled maintenance
further powerful analytics will generate
predictions of key performance metrics
that factory managers can use to improve
factory
uptime and reduce inefficiencies
industry 4.0 holds the promise of
cooperative mass production factories
where products machines and personnel
communicate seamlessly get there quicker
with Oracle IOT production monitoring
cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
