hi I'm Mike Williams and I'm a principal
curriculum developer for oracle server
technologies
okay in this demonstration we are going
to create the portfolio controller
servlet from exercise to task 2 so here
I have the project broker tool setup
ready to go
this is where using NetBeans 6.8 I'm
going to right click the project name
and to create the servlet I'm going to
do a new servlet this gives us the
servlet wizard and I'm going to do is
I'm going to put in the portfolio
controller and that's the you know the
name of the servlet class and then for
the package we can just see we can type
it in here I'm just going to pick it
from the drop-down its trader dot web
now I could take the default just by
clicking finish here I'm going to click
Next real quick and you can see here you
can add additional information if you
wish change the URL pattern or add
attributes to the servlet I'm not going
to do either one of those we're just
going to take the defaults by clicking
finish and then here the class is
created for us portfolio controller that
job you can see that here's the code
here so I'm going to remove the comments
first and I'm doing this just to create
space for us on the screen so you can
see more of the code okay so there the
comments are gone and here is the
process request method and this is the
one we're mainly concerned with this is
what they do post and do get methods
both call and so I want to replace the
content here and so I have all that
copied into the clipboard the code I
want to go here so I'm going to remove
the
it from this and we're going to delete
it and then I'm going to paste that in
here
so there's the code I want you'll notice
that it's generating a number of error
messages so you'll see that here with a
little red in the margins and then on
the screen and that just means that
NetBeans can't find the the classes for
those particular objects and so instead
of typing them in you see here there's
the error message cannot find symbol I'm
just going to go up here the imports I'm
going to right-click and then we have
this cool feature here
I just just fix imports and then
NetBeans will go out find those classes
and then put the import in automatically
for you at us fixing all the error
messages I'm going to save the file and
then we're ready to go so I'm going to
go over the code just really briefly
first we have a customer ID we're
pulling that in from a form passes a
parameter there and we set up a model
object which we're going to use to get
some information from so then you're on
line 26 we get the shares for that
customer based on the ID that was passed
in line 27 we get the actual customer
object and pull that in here also based
on the ID and then we set the shares on
line 28 and then the customer on line 29
and put that into the request object
then the other important thing is on
line 33 we set up a request dispatcher
where we take the requests and we're
going to forward it to our view in this
case a GSP called portfolio JSP and
that's where the data will be formatted
and displayed for a browser to read and
view
that's all thanks for watching the demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
