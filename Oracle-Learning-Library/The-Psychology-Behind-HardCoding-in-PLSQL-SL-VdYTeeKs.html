practically perfect pl/sql art coding
has a lot to do with human psychology
because we live in a world of change
everything's changing around us all the
time and so we often look for some
pillar something we can grab onto that's
not going to change that we can hold on
and in the wake of the storm that's
blowing around us and what we often grab
onto are things that we perceive to be
you know forever information rules that
are set in stone in our application
thanks to which we can apply the word
never or always which is always a
dangerous thing to do now at the classic
hard-coding which is the hard coding of
a literal value pretty much gives us the
insight into this so in the piece of
code you're looking at here you can
probably find really quickly the literal
values because they're Green sequel
developer color codes them for us very
nicely and there's a number that repeats
itself and that number is ten million
and what this is saying in this piece of
code looking at lines 19 through 22 or
so is that the rule for defining who is
a CEO in my company is you got to make
at least ten million dollars and that's
the rule it's written right down in the
documentation and it's obviously never
gonna change so what I will do in my
code is use that number over and over
and over again whenever I need to
determine whether or not an employee's a
CIO CEO and then to use that information
as well as you can see on line 24 I
passed that guy again clearly I suppose
the third argument to analyze
compensation is what is the minimum
salary for the CEO now at a glitch
hopefully you'll look at this code and
save yourself Steve and you're not
supposed to everybody knows that you
don't repeat hard-coded literal values
why not well the reason we say don't
repeat it is that we pretty much know
that everything's going to change and
probably the thing that we're most set
on believing is never going to change
changes tomorrow happens all the time
but in our minds you know
psychologically speak and we look for
those points at which we can depend on
to be static unchanging partly because
we're kind of lazy we don't want to have
to bother doing the right thing which is
to hide that number or that value of
that expression the answer the real
value so that's the core concept of
hard-coding
we think it's something that's not going
to change we need that same thing and so
far we've talked about and mostly what
people think about our hard-coded
literal values we then take that hard
cut literal value we put it in more than
one place and then when the rule changes
we have to go and find all those
instances and replace them with the new
value that is hard coding now most
developers only perceive hard coding as
a matter of repeated or hard-coded
literal values and I would argue that
that's actually the smallest problem
when it comes to hard coding literal
values are the least of our problems
there are many many bigger fish to fry
in this area and so again I suggest you
check out this code and ask yourself
where are all the hard cuttings that you
can find and then what I'm going to do
is go through each of them line by line
and explore what they are why they're
hard coding and what techniques in PL
sequel you can use to get rid of that
hard coding and make your code soft
coded easy coded much higher quality
much more resilient to change good luck
in your search for hard coatings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
