this is the fifth in a series of eight
videos about upgrading Oracle BPM suite
to version 12c in earlier videos we've
taken care to verify our pre upgrade
requirements have been met we've
installed the version 12c software in a
new Oracle home and as you saw in the
creating database schemas for 12c video
we've created the new schemas required
for version 12 13 now let's talk about
upgrading schemas and instance data
using the Upgrade Assistant the Oracle
Fusion Middleware upgrade assistant or
you a is one of several Fusion
Middleware tools and processes that are
used to complete an upgrade during this
task the Upgrade Assistant will upgrade
the database schemas that support our
component configurations you a will
identify the list of possible component
schemas to be upgraded it will determine
the order of schema upgrade based on
certain dependency information present
then it will upgrade eligible schemas
adding tables indices and constraints as
required finally it will move all of the
active 11g BPM instances into the newly
created 12c tables as you saw in the
previous video we've stopped our 11g
servers and other processes and verified
no components are accessing the database
that's important as the Upgrade
Assistant is going to update the
existing schemas and active instances in
the database in the previous video we
described how you can use the sequel
query on screen to display the names
versions and upgrade status of each
schema record in the schema version
registry table of your database the
Upgrade Assistant is going to offer a
list of components to up
and a list of schemas that will be
affected these sequel results will be
useful when selecting from among those
the Upgrade Assistant displays in our
example three schemas are already at 12
13 these are the schemas we created with
the repository creation utility in the
video titled creating database schemas
for 12 see the IAU schema is not
eligible for upgrade to understand more
about exceptions like this refer to
upgrading with the Upgrade Assistant
your results will vary but in our
example we'll use you a to upgrade each
of the remaining 11g schemas in a
multiple hosts topology like ours it's
important to run the upgrade assistant
on the host where the admin server is
located the Upgrade Assistant is
expecting to find and reference files
that will not be found on a host running
only a managed server if you have a
similar topology run the upgrade
assistant on the host where the admin
server is located the Upgrade Assistant
is installed under the new Oracle home
directory that was created when we
installed Fusion Middleware
infrastructure 12c we navigate to Oracle
home Oracle common upgrade bin and there
will find the Upgrade Assistant the
welcome screen always appears first it
provides an overview of the steps the
Upgrade Assistant will complete more
importantly it reminds you that before
you begin you should backup all software
that will be affected by the upgrade and
verify that your databases operating
system and hardware are certified for
use with version 12 13 we've done each
of these important tasks so we'll click
Next the next screen asks you to choose
which type of upgrade to perform you can
choose to upgrade your schemas or your
weblogic component configurations we
need to upgrade our schemas first so we
will leave schemas the
balt option selected because we chose
schemas in the previous screen a list of
installed oracle fusion middleware
components that have schemas that can be
upgraded is displayed from here we
choose which components to upgrade for
any selected component the schemas and
any dependencies are automatically
selected based on our topology we select
Oracle platform security services and
Oracle so ax we re-examine the list and
click Next on this screen we provide the
path to the 11g domain to be upgraded
don't make the mistake of putting in the
new 12c folder structure here we want
the path to the 11g domain that we're
upgrading the prerequisite screen
requires you to acknowledge that all
prerequisites have been met before you
continue with the upgrade you must check
each of the boxes before you can
continue I've backed up my 11g
installation and instance data object
the interoperability and compatibility
guide and verified that my database
version is certified for this upgrade I
verified my system meets all
requirements for this upgrade to 12c and
if I had a file-based opss I've
converted it to a database policy store
at this point a sequence of schema
information screens is displayed one
screen will be displayed for each schema
to be updated based on the components
you selected to upgrade earlier in the
wizard for each schema enter information
required to connect to the selected
schema and the database that hosts the
schema that information includes the
database connect string username and
password
the schema username is shown provide the
password for this schema here's the
connection information for the MDS
schema for ucs ums in our example we've
used the same passwords for all schemas
so we can page through these now we are
editing the UCS ums screen this one's a
little different because the component
ID or schema name is changed for ucs ums
schema in 12 12 the Upgrade Assistant
does not automatically recognize the
possible schemas and display them in a
drop-down list we need to manually enter
the name in a text field if we were
upgrading from 12-1 to the name would be
prefix underscore UMS but since we are
upgrading from 11g the name will be
prefix underscore o our ASD p.m. here's
the connection information for the so
infra schema the examined screen
displays the status of the Upgrade
Assistant as it examines each component
verifying that the component is ready
for upgrade each of the choices we've
made is listed each green checkmark
indicates that the examination of the
schema was successful the upgrade
summary screen provides us a chance to
review a summary of the options we've
selected before we start the upgrade
process the upgrade is underway the
upgrade progress screen shows the status
of the schema upgrade process but
there's one important thing happening
that's not suggested by the checklist on
screen all active instance data is being
upgraded to 12c the wizard will not
advance until that task is complete as
well depend
on how many active instances you have
this step may take quite some time when
it's complete we click Next after a
successful upgrade of your schemas and
instance data this window will display
the list of successfully upgraded
components they're starting versions and
their current version if your upgrade is
not successful the window will display
upgrade failure in that event the
upgrade failed for one or more specified
components and upgrade assistant will
have to be restarted before we leave
this window though let's take a closer
look at item 2 in the next steps section
note that an automated upgrade of closed
instances has been started and will
continue until the upgrade is complete
or until weblogic server is started if
yours is a typical implementation you
will likely be motivated to restart the
servers before this automated upgrade is
completed be sure to take the on-screen
advice and refer to the section
administering and monitoring the upgrade
of so ax instance data in upgrading so
sweet and business process management to
learn how to schedule and otherwise
manage the upgrade of your closed
instance data we'll talk about that
briefly in the video title to performing
post upgrade tasks and verifying success
if the Upgrade Assistant exits with an
upgrade failure message or if you would
like additional confirmation of a
successful outcome you can rerun the
sequel script we saw earlier to list the
current schemas and their versions the
example on screen lists each of the
schemas in our demo system the 411 G
schemas we were expecting to upgrade
have indeed been upgraded to 12 13 our
results confirm the successful
completion of the Upgrade Assistant and
of this step in the upgrade process
we've created new database schemas
upgraded our existing schemas and
migrated active instances the next step
in the upgrade sequence is to
reconfigure the 11g WebLogic domain
you'll learn how to do that in the next
video in the series I'm Rosie pillar
