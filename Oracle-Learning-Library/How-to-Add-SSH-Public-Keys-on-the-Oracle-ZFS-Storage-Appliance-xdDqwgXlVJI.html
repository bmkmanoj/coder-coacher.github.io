to show you how to set up ssh public
keys these can be used for setting up
password lists SSH connections into the
appliance mainly used to automate CLI
scripting things like that some you know
admin users like to use it for
management it's probably easy to set up
when you're logged in as whatever user
in this case I'm logged in as root
invigoration preferences and then for
whatever user logged in these SSH keys
will be for that user so this would be
for the root user and then you simply
get your SSH key in my case I used putty
hee-jin to my Windows machine and I cut
and paste that it's a DSA tech key I
pasted in here just lives on my PC I'll
add that in hit apply then you simply
can go to open up a putty session and
create a save session here to the same
IP address and we'll call this CS 3 4 I
have to change a couple of settings you
can hit save just to save it
I don't login so you know I put in the
same username that you wanted to use and
then one other thing under SSH
authorization the private key file so
you need to come in here and pick the
correct private key file what I got for
my putty keygen and then I'll go back to
the top one last time hit save and I
should be able to hit open and you'll
see it logs in right into the machine
with root and then automated I didn't
use the public key that one right there
and you're ready to go so now you're at
the
sssh screen so I can go to configuration
I can look at things in the box just
says what you normally would but again
the main purpose besides giving without
password is to automate CLI scripts
which will be another short video thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
