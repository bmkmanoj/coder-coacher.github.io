documentation and training resources
this video introduces you to those
resources shows you how to access them
and gives you a summary of what you can
find in each we're going to focus on the
NetSuite Help Center and sweet answers
and we'll touch briefly on to other
resources the NetSuite Help Center
contains the technical documentation
that details how NetSuite features work
you can access the Help Center in a
couple of different ways first you can
access the Help Center by clicking the
help link next to your username many
pages and NetSuite have
context-sensitive health topics so if
you click the help link while you are
viewing a page in NetSuite the help
topic for that page is displayed
automatically when the Help Center opens
some pages such as those provided by a
sweet app do not have context-sensitive
help topics so if you click the help
link on a page with no context-sensitive
help the Help Center displays the
homepage you can also open Help Center
and perform a search against it all in
one step by using the global search
field and NetSuite if I enter help colon
followed by the text I want to search
for the Help Center opens in a new
window and shows me a list of topics
that match my search criteria so I'm
going to search for help on using the
Help Center
the Help Center provides several
important features that help you find
the information you need at the top of
the helps in a window our quick access
links to important topics such as the
user guides which are PDF versions of
the Help Center content you can download
the PDFs for offline viewing and
reference the new release shortcut lets
you access several timely release
documents including release notes cornet
sweet release notes are translated into
8 different languages the new release
page also lets you access sneak peeks
which are a summary view of important
and exciting new features in that
release the language drop-down list lets
you choose a language and see the help
topics that have been translated into
that language the search field lets you
search topics by keywords too many
results indicate your search term for
too vague so try adding more keywords
and use netsuite terminology if you know
it too few results mean your keywords
were too strict so be more generic with
your search terms and again use NetSuite
terminology if you know it the table of
contents gives you organized navigation
for the topics in the Help Center click
an entry in the contents to drill down
into the topics the table of contents is
available only in the Help Center
breadcrumb navigation lets you retrace
your steps
most help topics include links to
related topics and page a little
feedback lets you rate a topic and
comment on it for example you may find a
topic especially useful and want to give
props to the writer or maybe you found
it lacking in you have suggestions for
improvement page level feedback is
closely monitored and topics are
frequently updated based on feedback
sweet answers has a similar page level
feedback option now let's look at sweet
answers you can access sweet answers
from NetSuite by clicking go to sweet
answers on the support menu or you can
access sweet answers from the Help
Center by clicking the sweet answers
link at the top of any Help Center page
sweet answers provide you with more
content media choices than you find in
the Help Center it also gives you access
to the case submission form sweet
answers includes all the help topics
from the Help Center and many other
useful topics including articles written
by support these articles have their
origins in actual support cases and
provide troubleshooting tips videos and
how to's training articles which provide
getting started videos as well as new
feature training videos that roll out
with each and a release and sweet world
slide presentations from the past few
years the sweet answers home page lists
important timely announcements new
release information trending topics and
newly added topics
similar to the Help Center you can
search sweet answers for a topic by
entering the keywords in the search
field you can also search for a topic by
the sweet answers ID the search results
can include multiple content types
including support articles videos health
topics and best practices to filter the
results by type click the type or click
all results to display all types use
operators such as and or not to
fine-tune your search results and review
the search tips for additional
suggestions you can also submit a
support case through sweet answers if
you have purchased additional support
you will see the contact support by
phone button click this button to show
the list of phone numbers you may use
click the NetSuite phone menu routing
options link for a list of product area
and feature options you can use on your
phone call when you click the contact
support online button you're first taken
to a search and encourage to search
sweet answers for an answer to your
question if you find an answer to your
question click question answered things
if you don't find an answer then click
continue to create case this displays
the create case form so let's ask a
payroll question for severity we say
it's non urgent the subject is
pre-populated with the search keywords
the product area for the question is
payroll the feature is payroll setup and
when we choose that we see the details
are pre-populated with a set of
questions designed to give support
enough information to help answer the
question we'll attach any related files
provide a phone number and then finally
submit the form a support rep will
review our case and then contact us
let's look at to additional
documentation resources these are filled
level Hill and developers sweet home
nurse comm you access field level help
from directly within NetSuite when you
point to a field name a question mark
with of what's this tooltip message
appears next to the pointer this lets
you know there is filled level help
available for that
filled all standard fields in NetSuite
give you filled little Hill click the
field name to display the help text
specific for that field developers suite
commerce comm is a web portal for the
Suite commerce developer community the
suite commerce technical documentation
from the Help Center and sweet answers
is also provided in the developer portal
the developer portal also gives you blog
posts design documents and other suite

access the developer portal with your
valid NetSuite credentials at developers
suite commerce com if you don't have a
NetSuite account you can register as a
community user to gain access to the

with invaluable information and they are
at your disposal anytime here's a good
rule of thumb for each resource use the
Help Center when you want to see a
structured view of the technical
documentation you suite answers when you
want to search all of the documentation
and videos available or to file a case

reference on a field and use the suite
