Oracle Access Management Suite provides
several services
to easily implement and
manage access to resources in your enterprise.
These services include Oracle Access Manager,
Oracle Identity Federation,
Oracle Adaptive Access Manager, and
Oracle Mobile and Social Access Management.
Consider a typical use case,
where you log in to your office computer and
access your corporate portal.
The corporate portal presents a dashboard that 
contains various applications.

You then click the Analytics link
to perform  data analysis.
You're redirected to a data mining application in 
the cloud environment.
The cloud-based mining application pulls data
from a database located at your corporate office.
And formats the result as per your business 
requirements.
That formatted data is then displayed on your
dashboard.
This process may be straightforward and
seamless to you, 
but behind the scenes, it's achieved through the 
integration
of various access management services
at different levels.
Each of the services offers different functionality.
We start with Oracle Access Manager
which provides the core access services such 
as
authentication,
single sign-on, and
coarse grain authorization for enterprise
applications.
Next, Oracle Identity Federation  provides
authentication and authorization.
This services delegates authorization across 
internet domains.
Supports industry standards
such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID.
And, uses social logon using social network 
identities.
Another service, Oracle Adaptive Access 
Manager, provides
strong multifactor authentication and
heuristic fraud detection.
It also enables you to manage
access risk within transactions.
Finally, Oracle Mobile and Social Access 
Management
provides seamless single sign-on
across native and web applications
on mobile devices.
