manage changes to a model in subversion
with our model checked out of subversion
we want to make some changes so we're
going to double click on the customers
table and then we're going to go to the
columns attribute and add a couple of
columns to this table so we're going to
make a change and then click OK and
you'll see those columns have been added
now we need to save this local copy
because now what we want to do is we
want to compare this model to what is in
subversion so we're going to turn on the
pending changes option and you'll notice
that a change has been detected and
you'll see that we've got two outgoing
changes so we're going to expand the
tree and the table that it detected is
the customers table so we're going to
double click on that and you'll see a
comparison here on the left is what is
in subversion on the right is what is
actually in the locally saved copy so we
can scroll down here and you'll see that
the two columns that we added in the
local copy are not in the subversion
copy on the left so we're going to go
ahead and close this and then what we
want to do is commit those changes to
the subversion repository so we're going
to select the the highest level node and
then select the commit changes icon and
enter in some comments and then click OK
and it's going to put it those changes
into subversion as another revision you
have just learned how to manage changes
to a model in subversion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
