knew that by now this is the last in a
series of eight videos about upgrading
Oracle so a suite to version twelve one
three there's just a few more things to
do to complete our upgrade and those
things are the subject of this video
recall that when we installed the twelve
one three Fusion Middleware
infrastructure we established a new
Oracle home for 12c this new directory
structure includes administrative tools
such as tests to production utilities
and composite deploy compile and package
utilities however the domain was
upgraded in place that means the domain
related components such as the scripts
to start and stop WebLogic server are
still found in the original domain
folder the specific tasks that you'll
need to perform after your upgrade will
vary according to your environment and
which components you have installed
we've listed a few tasks that are pretty
common you may recall that in the
performing pre upgrade tasks video we
suggested you tune your test environment
you'll now want to tune your Sowa
infrastructure applying the settings you
determine during that testing as we
described in the pre-op grade tasks
video change is made before an upgrade
to the set domain env script or any
other startup script will be overwritten
by new regenerated scripts during the
domain reconfiguration process consider
creating a set user override script to
store your domain customizations you can
read more about this option in the
document listed on screen if you're
unable to create the set user override
script before your upgrade you'll need
to reapply your settings as described in
reapplying customizations to set domain
env in the upgrading so a suite and
business process management guide the
upgrade process also doesn't preserve
file ownership and permissions so you'll
want to review them and modify as
necessary
even after purging unused instance data
as a pre upgrade task the migration of
your closed instance data may not yet be
complete the unmai graded closed
instances won't be visible in Oracle
Enterprise Manager and won't be
available for reporting if you want to
wait until the data migration can
please you can monitor its progress as
we'll see shortly but if minimizing
downtime is a priority you can restart
your servers when you restart WebLogic
server the background migration of
closed instances stops you can then
schedule the data migration during
off-peak hours and monitor its progress
at that time to monitor and configure
the upgrade of closed instances navigate
to the folder you see listed on screen
invokes equal plus supplying your sewin
for a schema owner and password then
call the so upgrade menu dot sequel
script to display the upgrade
administration options the first six of
those options are shown here you can use
option 1 to determine if the upgrades
complete and use option 5 to schedule
when the background process runs with
the migration of closed instances
handled either by allowing the
background process to complete or
scheduling it when it's most convenient
it's time to restart our servers and
make sure everything is working properly
first we start the admin server recall
that in our system the startup script is
in the domain folder which is in the 11g
folder structure but the script now
points to the 12c Oracle home we're
using a node manager for each of our
hosts and during the upgrade we
reconfigured these node managers to
reside in the domain structure so that's
where we'll find our startup scripts
with the administration server and node
managers started we can now bring up the
WebLogic server administration console
to start the managed servers notice the
console displays the new release number
in the lower left corner when we examine
our applications we find these newly
upgraded instances accessible and active
so that's it we've completed the upgrade
and our applications are back online for
more information on post upgrade tasks
be sure to read upgrading so a suite and
business process management and
upgrading to the Oracle Fusion
Middleware infrastructure 12c along with
specific upgrade documents related to
your components I hope these videos have
given you a high level understanding of
the upgrade process and it they'll serve
you well as you read the documentation
and begin to plan your own upgrade
project around Pinkerton and in case I
forgotten to mention it thank you for
your time and attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
