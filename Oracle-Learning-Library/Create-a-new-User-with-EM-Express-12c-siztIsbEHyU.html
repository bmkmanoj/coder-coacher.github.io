is Maria Billings I work for oracle
server technologies curriculum this is
the second video in a miniseries on
enterprise manager express or am express
and we will show you how to create a new
user SEMA Express administrator first by
showing your predefined elements and
then by creating and editing the user so
first let's review some security items
that we will use for our new user there
is the default profile and as you see
the password expires every 180 days so
you will need to confirm if that is
appropriate if the default profile does
not work for you it is recommended that
you create your own but do not change
the predefined ones next to be preview
roles two roles a pre created for EM
Express and you can find them by
entering express in the search list
first let's look at the basic role you
see that the e/m Express basic role
includes create session contact and the
select catalog roles and when you look
at the object privileges you see that
they allow diagnosis from tasks for the
performance management next we look at
the en express all and you see it has
many more privileges among others the
role that we just reviewed emx press
basic it also has a couple of additional
object privileges that allow the user to
execute tuning tasks so I named the user
Express DBA and provide a password that
is not shown for security reasons you
see here that the default profile which
you saw is being used and they go to the
next page we accept the default
tablespace is for this user and go to
the next now here we want to provide the
predefined role and so I'm searching
by them i use emx press all and show you
the sequel what this looks like and this
is fine at this point i could provide
the DB overall but I pretend to forget
about it and execute the user just to
show you how to edit the user so here we
see the Express DBA if I now want to add
the role that I quote unquote forgot i
selected then I click Edit i specify DBA
to clear it by it and add the role at a
later point in time you can look at the
sequel again it grants the dva and I
click OK to execute it so this was it we
have a new user is called Express DBA
with the DBA and emx price all roll so
this was the second p.m. express video
where we looked at predefined security
items the default profile and emx press
roles and created a new user thanks for
watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
