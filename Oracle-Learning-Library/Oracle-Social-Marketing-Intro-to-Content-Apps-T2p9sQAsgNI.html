give an overview of the content and apps
product content and apps allows you to
post content as a now which is viewable
on Facebook and other websites apps are
listed here as tabs on Facebook if we
click one you'll see how the content is
displayed like a mini website so let's
look at the tool used to create these
tabs content and apps you can access
content and apps here in the home menu
content and apps has five sections
views connections brand templates
contests and admin content and apps
opens here in the view section this is
where you can manage any view in your
bundle make sure you choose a bundle
that has views or the section will be
blank a view contains the content that
later becomes an app you can create a
new view by clicking the create new view
button just give it a name and click
create view on the left you'll see a
list of existing views the list notes if
any view is connected to a Facebook page
on the right you'll see a quick list of
recent changes made to any view in the
bundle the connections section is where
you can manage existing applications and
connections to your Facebook pages this
is where you need to go to connect a
view to a Facebook page once it's been
created the brand templates section
allows you to create templates that
specify fonts colors and any sort of
skinning that's important to your brand
this saves time by allowing you to
quickly apply a template every time you
create a new view the contest section
allows you to edit and manage any
existing or past contests this is also
the section where you can view and
moderate the contest submissions you
have received finally the admin section
keeps track of the changes made to your
views this section gives a full history
of where changes have occurred who made
them
what those changes were and the time
each change was made
