registering a standard on-premises Cloud
control agent as a gateway to Oracle
cloud this is done with the Enterprise
Manager command-line interface
eeehm CLI first use AM CLI to display
the agents in your site so that you can
select which cloud control agent you
prefer to use as the Gateway best
practice is to not use the central agent
that is installed alongside your Oracle
Management Service the register hybrid
gateway agent command is used to tell
Cloud Control which agents can be used
as a gateway to Oracle cloud by default
the command will try to ensure that
nominated agents are able to connect to
the Oracle cloud services but will
ignore that check now that we've
registered our hybrid gateway agent we
can use it to deploy a hybrid cloud
agent to an Oracle cloud service
instance at the same time will define
the secure shell connection details for
the service a hybrid gateway agent is a
variant of the standard cloud control
agent so we use the add hosts target
wizard to deploy it entering the IP
address of the Oracle cloud service
instance in the host field is the
simplest way to deploy the hybrid cloud
agent because we don't have to get
entries added to the DNS or make other
network configuration changes however it
does mean that cloud control will
present a warning because it prefers to
use host names rather than IP addresses
but will continue as our Oracle cloud
service instance is not resolvable by
name for the installation based
directory do not specify the Oracle base
of your cloud service product as this
may be affected by regular maintenance
the instance directory is automatically
filled for you check the configure
hybrid cloud agent checkbox so you can
select a registered hybrid gateway agent
to be used to connect to Oracle cloud
and nominate a port for the Gateway
proxy process or leave the field blank
to allow the Installer to find and
select a free port itself if you haven't
already created SSH named credentials
for your Oracle cloud service instance
you can create them at the time of
deploying the agent
specifi Oracle as the username then
upload the private key files that you
use to create your Oracle cloud service
instance give the credentials a suitable
name and return to the add hosts wizard
similarly you can create route
credentials for your Oracle cloud
service instance by specifying OPC as
the username and uploading your private
key files specify a run privilege of
sudo to be run as root nominate a free
port for the agent or leave it blank to
let the Installer find and select a free
port itself review the inputs and
initiate the deployment after that your
Oracle cloud service instance virtual
machine will be listed as a managed
toast in cloud control and you'll be
able to discover the service products
that are running there alternatively you
can directly discover Oracle cloud
services using the cloud REST API s and
deploy your agents at the same time the
difference between this and the
traditional discovery method is that the
rest api is allow Enterprise Manager
cloud control to present the cloud
services management console within cloud
control making Enterprise Manager cloud
control a true single pane of glass
through which to view your IT ecosystem
from the hybrid cloud console start by
registering an Oracle cloud identity
domain
and then register an account in that
domain getting the test service URL from
the Oracle cloud service pages
add a hybrid cloud gateway from those
that you have already registered using
EMC Li
add SSH keys for both normal and
privileged access using existing named
credentials
or creating new ones now it's time to
discover an Oracle cloud service select
a service type and an account
for this demonstration we're going to
override the global settings for
discovery making sure the service URL is
correct for our database services and
specifying the DB SNMP users password to
use for monitoring
the discovery wizard will use the rest
api is registered at the service URL to
discover what database instances you
have even though the rest api is have
allowed discovery to proceed this far
Enterprise Manager Cloud Control still
relies on a hybrid cloud agent running
on your services virtual machine for
some functionality so provide the
familiar inputs
perform any desired target configuration
before reviewing the input data and
submitting the discovery job once
discovered your instance will be listed
on the cloud homepage from there you can
navigate to your services page where
you'll notice the same look and feel as
the native Oracle cloud interface you
can even open the Oracle cloud service
console
thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
