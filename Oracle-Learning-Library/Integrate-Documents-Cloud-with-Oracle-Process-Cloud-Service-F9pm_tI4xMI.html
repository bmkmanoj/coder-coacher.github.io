document centric processes and enable
your users to share documents and have
online conversations with other task
participants with an Oracle documents
cloud and Oracle process cloud
integration you can build document
review and approval workflows with the
use of incoming documents and folders
document centric processes use managed
folders these folders are created for
each process instance and become
available through the start form in your
process before users can start
collaborating an administrator must
configure connections between the two
services in Oracle documents the Oracle
process cloud service rest URL username
and password are required to create a
connection in the Oracle process cloud
workspace the Oracle document service
URL username and password are required
the identity domain is also needed to
enable conversations in Oracle process
cloud composer developers then enable
documents and conversations for existing
applications set up additional folders
for documents and define a conversation
properties now let's look at each piece
after integrating Oracle documents with
Oracle process managed folders and
conversations are automatically created
for each new application instance
developers can enable documents and
conversations for existing applications
Oracle process automatically creates
application instance and startup folders
for each application the startup folder
is the only folder users can upload
documents to when starting an
application developers create additional
folders as necessary and based on use
case use manage folders to organize and
restrict access to important documents
that are required during the development
of document-centric processes use
incoming documents or folders to create
a process that uses a document or folder
start event when building
review and approval workflows select a
default access this access defines what
a user can do with the files and folders
properties let you change the route or
instance folder name and the startup
folder edit the folder to change its
name or the default access override the
folder access at the task level in the
implementation pane for conversations
the developer defines the conversation
properties at the application and
activity levels the name defines the
application level conversation it
defaults to the application name but you
can change it make your selections for
how messages are handled such as when a
process starts or a task assignment
changes modify these messages in the
implementation paint when the
integration in setup are complete
developers can build document review
workflows and document-centric processes
that enable users to share documents and
have online conversations with other
task participants thank you for watching
