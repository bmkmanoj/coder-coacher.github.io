developer at Oracle in this demo I will
show you how to create and use the flags
viewed in business process workspace
the default workspace only shows the
task title instance number creator
assigned date priority and which person
this instance belongs to what if you
want to display and query using costume
attributes for example a new approver
may not be interested in the details of
a sales quote but who cares a lot about
a total net revenue of a deal he wants
to display that revenue as a column and
future tasks based on the value of the
revenue as well as searching tasks with
certain amounts of revenue
human workflow mapped attributes also
called
flags fields can help him to do that
because you can only mind a primitive
type viewed as flex food we will first
create a new primitive tasks payload
argument and Mike the total net revenue
field to it then we will create a flag
field label and the map new tasks
payload argument to it last we'll reuse
the Flex view query sort and filter
calls let's start with the preparation
first in BPM studio we add a new date
object to approved yield has payload
because it can only map primitive type
views we will create it with a data type
of double
we were named it revenue do not select
edit bone because we will not match the
object as an output parameter
then map the total net revenue fields of
the quote versus state object to the
revenue task payload argument because a
quote requests payload argument has a
complex datatype we cannot use it to
create a flex field we need to pull out
a value of the total net revenue from
the quote processed data object and map
it to the revenue field we have just
created so we can display it as a column
later on save all the changes and
redeploy this project next we will first
query the Flexi label and then map the
human have payload to that label let's
login to business process workspace as
WebLogic the administrator click the
administration tab from the
administration areas select public flex
field to open the flex field mapping
editor click create label because the
revenue payload argument has a data type
of Thabo we will select member
attributes for the attribute type select
the task attribute to which you want to
apply the condition here we accept the
default one enter revenue as a label
name this will be the column name when
you display the Flex field in a
workspace enter a description to remind
us what this field represents and select
currency as a format click create the
label has been added now we will map the
human task payload argument to the label
select edit mapping by task type then
click selected hospital select the
approve deal human task of the cells
quote process select revenue as a
payload attribute to map click select
label in the map payload attributes
dialog will choose the revenue label we
just created save the changes
the flat field has been added let's take
a look at how this application will look
to the end-user lock into the workspace
as the Deacons the approver currently if
we want to examine the total net revenue
for each quote you need to click each
task and view the details the total net
revenue for those four tasks are five
thousand twenty one thousand twenty ten
thousand twenty and fifteen thousand
twenty now let's use the new flat field
to enable us to search a quote based on
its total net revenue list a total net
revenue as a separate column so we don't
have to click each task two views amount
and then filter the costs based on the
total net revenue first let's search for
quotes based on their total net revenue
click search advanced currently there is
only one condition in the definition tab
therefore the match field is grayed out
click select a task type and choose
approve do human tasks this condition
ensuring only cause of approved ill
human hands will be selected now click
add condition costume and select revenue
the flax field we have created in the
value field enter ten thousand twenty
you can choose other comparison
operators from the drop-down list for
now let's use the equals from the match
field select all it makes sure that only
code matches both conditions will be
selected click search and a quote with
the total net revenue of ten thousand
twenty show up as a result
next let's displays a revenue column for
all approved ear tasks to display the
flats field as a column you will first
need to create a custom view click Add
wheel in a definition tab enter my
custom view as a view name select
approve do human tasks from select task
type field
in the display tab shuffle the revenue
flux field from the available columns to
the selected columns click OK to close
the create user view dialog from the my
views node select my custom view that we
have just created the revenue fuse
appears as a column in the Inbox
you can also sort the crus based on
their revenue ascending or descending
finally let's filter quotes based on
their total net revenue click Edit view
in the definition tab click add
condition costume and select revenue
from the drop down menu select greater
than and in the value field enter
ten-thousands click OK now we have only
two tasks showing up they both have net
revenue greater than 10,000
hopefully now you understand how to
create a flexibility and how to use the
black dude to curry sort and future
tasks and pity her
