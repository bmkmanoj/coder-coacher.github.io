for Salesforce.com.
In this video, we show the concrete steps
to integrate Saslesforce.com with E-Business
Suite, synchronizing customer Account information
from E-Business Suite to Salesforce.com. This
could be part of a larger integration between
a Salesforce.com SaaS application for Sales
and on-premise E-Business Suite for back-office
order fulfillment implementing a seamless
Opportunity-to-Order system between cloud
and on-premise.
First we will see how to configure the Salesforce.com
adapter using Oracle JDeveloper.
Second, we see how to synchronize Account
information from on-premise E-Business Suite
to Salesforce.com using Oracle Salesforce.com
cloud adapter and Oracle SOA Suite.
Last we see monitoring capabilities of Oracle
Salesforce.com Cloud Adapter in Oracle Enterprise
ManagerFusion Middleware Control.
Configuring the Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com
In this demo, we will use Oracle JDeveloper
to build a SOA Composite Application with
using the Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com.
So to get started, we�ll drag and drop the
Salesforce adapter from the Component palette
onto the right swimlane to create an outbound
interaction with Salesforce.com.
This launches the Adapter Configuration Wizard
that we can use to configure the adapter interaction.
First we�ll provide a name for the service
that we are modeling using the Adapter. Click
Next to continue.
In the Server Connection pane, we specify
connectivity to the Salesforce.com instance,
such as the Enterprise WSDL Location. To do
that, click the browse button and select the
WSDL from the local filesystem.
Now we�ll click the edit icon to specify
the Authentication Key used to identify the
credentials to connect to Salesforce.com Let�s
enter the user Name, Password, and an alias
known as the CSF Key to hold these credentials
securely in WebLogic�s credential store.
Once we have specified the WSDL and the credentials,
you can click Test Connection to validate
the connection. For additional connection
properties, Offline Configuration option downloads
the Salesforce.com Object metadata onto our
local m filesystem and provides faster offline
access. Once we have downloaded the offline
configuration, the Clear Cache option becomes
active. This will clear our previously loaded
local copy of the configuration and we can
fetch a newer version over the network again.
Click Next, and the Cloud Operation Configuration
pane opens.
This pane shows all the objects and operations
we can configure. Clicking the drop-down reveals
the supported set of operation categories.
Here we are demonstrating some options from
CORE API calls. Upsert is a combination of
create and update operations. We can use the
shuttle to choose which business objects to
use. In this example, we select Account.
Under the MISC option, there are two processing
options available. The ProcessSubmitRequest
option is used to submit an object for approval.
ProcessWorkItemRequest option is used to process
an object already submitted for approval.
Choose the SOSL and SOQL option to enter Salesforce.com
query/search operations and return object(s)
and the attributes of interest.
With the Run Query button we can test these
queries in real-time at design-time for a
maximum of 200 records.
We can specify binding parameters and the
wizard automatically provides mechanisms to
specify those dynamically. If there are any
validation errors, they show up in the panel.
We can correct those and proceed to finish
the query modeling. We�ll click Save when
finished. We can model simple to complex SOSL
queries using the �Search� operation,
and this is used to search specific data for
our organization from Salesforce.com.
CRUD is another option available. We can model
create-read-update-delete operations against
the objects. The adapter design-time allows
modeling operations against both standard
and custom objects in Salesforce. In accordance
with Salesforce.com limitations, the adapter
allows only up to 10 objects for selection
for performing operations on them.
Now we�ll click Next to get to the Header
and Properties pane. Depending on the chosen
operation, we can configure the required headers
for the various interactions.
This completes the design-time modeling experience
for the adapter. At this point, we can go
back and change the options or Click Finish
to conclude.
Integrating the Oracle E-Business Suite with
Salesforce.com
Here, we show you how to create integration
between Oracle E-Business Suite and Salesforce.com
in Oracle JDeveloper.
We will create a BPEL process to orchestrate
the Salesforce.com to E-Business Suite integration
and do message transformation. We will create
a polling database adapter for Account information
in E-Business Suite, which will invoke the
BPEL. Then we will create Salesforce.com cloud
adapter that will pass changes in account
information into Salesforce.com.
First, we define a service composite for BPEL.
In JDeveloper, click New &amp;gt; Application.
Select SOA application.
We'll name our application, and then we select
Composite with BPEL Process in the Configure
SOA Settings pane.
We'll click finish, and in the Create BPEL
Process wizard, we select Define Service Later
from the Template drop-down.
Now we see the BPEL process in our Jdeveloper
SOA Editor.
Now we create a database adapter that will
read from the E-Business suite database.
Right click in the editor and select Insert
&amp;gt; Database adapter.
We name the connection, and then we change
the database connection JNDI name.
We select Poll for New or Changed Records
in a Table as our Operation Type. This operation
will monitor for additions and changes in
database table.
Here we import our table by using a Query
and choosing PARTIES from available tables.
This is where E-Business Suite keeps customer
account information.
Once the table is imported, we define the
Primary Keys.
Click Next for Relationships and Attribute
Filtering.
We select Update Field for after data is read.
This mechanism keeps track which rows in database
have been processed by adapter already.
In the Logical Delete pane, we choose REC_STATUS
(record status).
We review our polling options and click Next
to define our selection criteria.
Then we continue through the wizard and click
Finish.
Now we see our Exposed Service in the left
swimlane.
Now we create a Salesforce adapter that will
synchronize changes to Salesforce.com business
objects.
Let's right-click in the right swimlane and
select Salesforce adapter.
We name our adapter, and next we choose our
WSDL file.
We select a local filesystem copy of wsdl
file defining our server connection.
Now we set our Cloud Operation Configuration.
We click CORE API call from the Operation
Category drop-down, and then
select upsert as our operation. Upsert operation
updates or creates the business data, depending
if it exists already in Salesforce.com
We select our account as the business object
to update or insert, and then click next in
the Headers and Properties pane.
Finally, we review our selections and click
Finish.
We drag a wire between the BPEL process and
the database adapter to invoke the BPEL process
and click OK to set the Transaction Properties.
Likewise, we drag a wire between the Salesforce
adapter and BPEL process to create a connection.
We double-click our BPEL process and drag
and drop Receive to create our receive operation,
connecting it to E-Business Suite database
adapter, so we receive information from the
E-Business suite.
We edit Receive, and automatically create
our variables to store input data.
This operation initiates the bpel process
so we also check Create Instance.
Next we drag and drop Invoke operation into
the BPEL process. We edit the Invoke to call
Salesforce.com adapter InvokeUpsert.
Similarly we autocreate variables that pass
information for the Salesforce.com adapter.
The data from E-Business is in a different
format from the Salesforce.com data, so we
need to create a transformation in between
the two. So we add a transform activity and
choose Input Variable.
Now we can create visual mappings between
our E-Business Suite message on the left and
Salesforce.com message on the right.
We verify our mappings, and everything looks
good.
We close our files and save our changes.
Using and Monitoring Oracle Cloud Adapter
for Salesforce.com
Next, we show you Oracle Cloud Adapter for
Salesforce.com seamlessly synchronizes customer
information between E-Business and Salesforce.com,
and how we can easily monitor this integration
in Enterprise Manager Fusion Middleware Control.
From Salesforce.com, let's look for accounts
that have the word general in the name. We
don't find anything, so let's move over to
the E-Business Suite.
Here, we know the account number for an account
that has the word general in its name. We
find an account called General Technologies.
Let's make a change to the account address,
and the change will automatically integrate
with Salesforce.com.
Going back to Salesforce.com, we search again
for General, and here is the account that
we just updated in Enterprise Manager.
Now we are using the Enterprise manager Fusion
Middleware Control. Among many other things,
this console enables you to manage and monitor
your cloud adapter integrations.
Let's look under SOA, and we find the SOA
application that we created.
Here are the runtime instances that have been
executed.
We see that in the last 24 hours, three transactions
that were completed.
This one is the last executed. Let's click
it and look at the details.
In the Flow Trace window, let`s click the
BPEL process and get the visual presentation.
Clicking the EBiz data shows all of the account
activity.
The Transform Account shows the Updated variable
with the assignment completed.
Clicking the Invoke upsertActivity, we see
the account information and the new address.
Scrolling down, we see the message from the
Salesforce.com adapter.
So this concludes our Oracle Cloud Adapter
for Salesforce.com series. In this series,
we've shown you how to configure the adapter,
integrate it with the E-Business Suite, and
monitor the transactions.
