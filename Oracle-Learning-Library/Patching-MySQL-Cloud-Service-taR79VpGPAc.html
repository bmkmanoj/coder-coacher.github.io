patch a mysql cloud service instance
under administration it indicates that
one patch is available i'll select
administration to apply the patch the
patching tab lists the patches available
updates are generally released about
every quarter so if you haven't patched
your instance for several months more
than one patch might be listed unless
you have a reason for doing otherwise
you generally patch to the most current
version available before applying the
patch I am going to check for patch
prerequisites from the menu icon I
select pre-check the pre-check verifies
whether there is enough storage space
for the patch and check the other
prerequisites so that I can remedy any
problems found before applying the patch
while the pre-check is in progress I'm
going to check the release notes I
expand read knee and select the link for
the release notes the release notes open
in a new browser tab in the release
notes I learn about any changes in this
update that I might need to be aware of
I am going to close the release notes
for now while the pre-check is in
progress i refresh the page occasionally
to update the status of the pre-check
after a few moments the pre-check has
completed so I click the pre-check
summary the results indicate no
conflicts found so I can click OK and
proceed with the patch
from the menu I select patch I enter
some notes for the patch these notes
will be displayed with the patch history
after entering my notes I click patch
while the patch is taking place I can
check details of the progress note that
a backup is taken automatically in case
it is needed later for row back and
restoration the service might be
restarted as part of the patch and will
be temporarily unavailable to users I
refresh occasionally to update the
status of the patch after a few moments
the patch has completed and it displays
under patch and roll back history if I
wanted to I could expand read me and go
back and look at the release notes again
near the patch version is a roll back
button if for some reason I might need
to roll back to a previous patch I could
select roll back I'm not going to do
that for this demo when I go back to the
overview it now shows the version of the
new patch I just applied</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
