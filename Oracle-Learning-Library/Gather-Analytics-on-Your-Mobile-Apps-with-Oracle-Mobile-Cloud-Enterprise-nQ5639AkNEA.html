where users are dropping off and which
products are bestsellers with studies
showing most users never checkout you

a purchase first name the funnel and use
a custom date range next choose events

completion goal now click run report
when your data is returned you can see
which users didn't check out and what
they did instead click the bars in the
lost users chart to save this group as a

filters we want to find users who put an
item in the cart but didn't check out
