assets wizard in Oracle Enterprise
Manager off center so let's get started
App Center can manage and monitor a
variety of data center assets such as
server hardware network equipment
operating systems virtualization
software and clustering software App
Center offers three ways to discover
assets using the add assets wizard
adding a configure asset such as a
servers service processor or operating
system declaring a server to be a target
of always provisioning and declaring a
none configured Hardware asset let's
review some examples on using the add
assets wizard to discover servers and
operating systems the first type of
asset declaration is add and manage
various types of assets via discovery
probes you can use this option to add an
asset that has already been configured
let's go through an example of adding an
operating system and its server using
the discovery profile in a set of
credentials we start by creating a
discovery profile specific for the asset
we are adding by clicking the new
profile icon on top of the table of
discovery profiles to discover a profile
wizard appears on discovery profile
wizard we add a name and choose the
asset type from the tree in this case
we're discovering an Oracle Solaris
system so we select the Solaris Linux OS
option let's click Next to see the
screen for setting up tags
attack is a set of information attached
to an asset each stack consists of a
name in a value tag names are specific
for each type of asset we are not using
tax for this example we now click Next
to see the IP ranges table we can add an
IP range here by clicking the plus icon
on top of the table or reuse existing IP
ranges that have been created for other
discovery profiles we are skipping this
step as we are adding a single IP
address and the final step of the add
assets wizard let's click Next to setup
the discovery credentials we need to
specify the SSH credentials here we can
either create a new set of credentials
or select an existing set using the
available buttons let's reuse an
existing set of credentials in the
management section of this screen we can
specify if we want to deploy an agent
controller on the operating system this
is recommended to enable full management
of the discovered server we now click
Next to read the summary after we read
the summary we can click finish we are
back to the add assets wizard and we can
verify that the profile we've just
created is selected we can now type the
IP address of our asset in the host
names slash IP addresses field if you
scroll down you can edit the credentials
in agent controller setup finally let's
click the add Now button to start the
job
after a few minutes the job completes in
the server and OS are added to the asset
stream under left navigation pane the
second type of asset declaration is
manually declare a server to be a target
of OS provisioning you can use this
option to declare a server on which you
later want to provision an operating
system let's explore the fields on this
single screen option on the manually
declare assets - Oracle WebCenter wizard
we can declare vary servers using a
discovery file or declare a single
server we are going to declare a single
server for this example you can find
more information about using the
discovery file in the assets management
chapter of the ops center reference
guide lookup for declaring servers for
always provisioning we specify the
server name as we want to see it in the
assets tree the IP address of the server
and select the appropriate model
category and model for the server on the
ports and MAC addresses table we click
the plus icon to add a logical port the
available logical port names RGB
underscore 0 through gb underscore 11 if
the server has only one network
interface we can use gb underscore 0
let's click Add port slash back button
to get back to the wizard we are ready
to continue we now click a declare asset
to start the job after a few minutes the
job completes and the server is added to
the acid stream
the third type of acid declaration is
declare an unconsidered Hardware acid
you can use this option to declare one
or more bare metal systems in
preparation for service processor
configuration for this example we are
adding the following information one for
the number of servers to declare we
select the model category in model and
we add a name prefix that is used for
all the server we declare along with a
starting number in a suffix
besides this basic information we also
need to add the network on which the
server is added the IP address of the
server and the MAC address of the server
once this is ready we click declare
asset to start the job this concludes
our overview for more information
consult the op centers library go to
Docs oracle.com look for Enterprise
Management and select the Enterprise
Manager ops center version you need
