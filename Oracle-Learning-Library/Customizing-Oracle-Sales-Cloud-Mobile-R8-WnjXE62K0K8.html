I'll show you how to customize the
Oracle sales cloud mobile application we
will add a custom object for trouble
tickets and a child object for
activities to the mobile application
this tutorial will not go into all
aspects of application composer we will
only show the areas of application
composer that customized sales cloud
mobile will begin an application
composer the trouble ticket and activity
objects have already been created the
objects including fields and data types
have already been defined for the web
application now I'll add those objects
to the sales cloud mobile application
will start with the trouble ticket
object by opening it and clicking the
pages link here I see a tab for mobile
pages which allows you to customize the
mobile pages for the selected object we
don't have the pages defined for the
trouble ticket object in the mobile
application so I click the Create mobile
pages link that starts a three-step
process allowing us to define how we
want to manage trouble tickets in the
mobile application first I select the
fields that will appear as columns in
the ListView I can select a maximum of
three fields to appear for the trouble
ticket object we want to show abstract
company and status then I select the
configuration to display this option on
the launch page next I select the fields
that will be visible on the detail page
these are the fields that users will see
when they view a specific trouble ticket
record then I select fields that will
appear as columns and they create or
edit view of the trouble ticket
when I click Next I can view
select the related objects for the
trouble ticket object will skip this for
now and click Submit which takes me back
to the mobile pages tab since i created
the trouble ticket list and details
pages i no longer have the create
trouble ticket link i now have a link to
edit the trouble ticket pages i also
have a link to create the mobile pages
for the activity object this option
appears because the activity object is a
child object of the trouble ticket
object this relationship was set up when
the custom objects were configured for
the web application clicking on the
create mobile pages activity link will
take you through the same three step
process I have just covered so I won't
go through this again once you have
created the activity as a mobile page
you'll need to create the link between
the child activity object and the
trouble ticket object edit the trouble
ticket and add the activity in the
related objects page the activity object
is now listed as an available related
objects field so I add the field and
click Submit
now I'm done when users view a trouble
ticket in the mobile application they
will be able to see the related
activities I can take a look at the
pages i have just created on my
smartphone you can see that there is a
new trouble ticket icon on the home page
from here you'll create a new record and
activity note that application composer
allows you to make changes to standard
objects as well as custom objects you
can find additional learning resources
in your Oracle Fusion help application
as well as in the Oracle Learning
Library and at Oracle University thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
