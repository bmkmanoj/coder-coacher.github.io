this screen watch is part of the
enterprise manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series and shows how to configure a
host with privilege delegation sudo and
power broker tools that enable users to
run privileged commands without granting
direct access to privileged accounts
such as root Enterprise Manager includes
a privileged delegation feature that
allows you to integrate these tools this
screen watch will demonstrate how to
configure privileged delegation for a
host that's been configured with sudo
set up a privileged delegation consists
of three steps firstly you must
configure sudo or power broker
appropriately on the host next you need
to configure the privileged delegation
settings for each host in enterprise
manager finally you should execute tasks
from enterprise manager using
credentials that use privileged
elevation the first step in configuring
Enterprise Manager for use with sudo
power broker is to set up the target
host for use with Enterprise Manager
when executing commands r enterprise
manager using privileged delegation all
commands are executed by the nmo sudo
binary therefore if using sudo it's
necessary to configure sudo so that non
privileged accounts can run mmos pseudo
with elevated privileges this is done by
editing the sudoers file I want to login
as user Scott and execute any
commander's room so I've added the
highlighted line to the sudoers file
which says that Scott can execute nmo
pseudos route with any argument with the
argument being the commander want to
execute from enterprise manager
the commands that are allowed can be
restricted further and details of how to
do this are in the enterprise manager
documentation once we've configured the
sudoers file we can configure privilege
delegation enterprise manager for this
host the host already has an agent
deployed so we go to set up security
privilege delegation from this page we
can configure the privilege delegation
settings for each host I click on the
host that I want to configure and select
the privileged delegation setting I'm
choosing sudo as this is what I'm using
on my hosts I enter the path and options
for my sudo command the runners and
command parameters will be passed in at
runtime when we try and execute
something from enterprise manager using
sudo the configuration is now complete
all that we need to do now is set up
credentials that use sudo to do this we
can navigate to set up security named
credentials
here I'm creating a global host
credential for the OS users Scott I'm
going to set the run privilege to sudo
and the run as user to root this means
that any action that I execute using
this credential will execute as root but
using Scott's login credentials I'll
test the credential as I save it using
the host I just configured this
credential can now be used to execute
routes commands using Scott's
credentials to demonstrate this I'm
creating a simple OS job at my house
that runs the ID command
I select credential that I just created
and submit the job
upon completion the output shows that
the ID command was indeed executed as
root more Enterprise Manager demos can
