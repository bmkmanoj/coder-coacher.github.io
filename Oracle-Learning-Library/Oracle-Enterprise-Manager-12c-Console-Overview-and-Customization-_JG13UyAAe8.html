cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration we'll show you an overview
of the enhancements of the Enterprise
Manager console they're organized in
four main sections first login
customization global menus global
searches and the home page
personalization
then for the first time you are
presented a choice of different types of
pages you could use as your default home
page for your future logins you can see
your summary overview incidents overview
databases overview and middleware
overview for each of these pages you can
click on preview to get an idea of what
the page might look like
here the summary overview gives you a
summary of your targets health let's say
we like this view so click close and
then click select as my home for that
page that makes this page your home page
now another area of interest is
navigation we support what we call
global menus that are accessible from
wherever you are in Enterprise Manager
let's start with the Enterprise menu
this menu gives you access to the key
functionalities within Enterprise
Manager for example we have monitoring
configuration compliance and my Oracle
support
the next global menu is the targets menu
this allows you to look at your targets
by types groups systems and services
let's move on to the favorites menu
basically this is the equivalent to
bookmarks in a browser you can mark an
Enterprise Manager page as your favorite
and you can manage your favorite pages
from here you can see that the summary
page is currently your home page the
history menu shows you the last 10
targets you visited moving on to the
other side of the console we have the
setup global menu this is where you set
up your preferences which dictate how
you access various areas from Enterprise
Manager like targets passwords email
addresses and your home page from the
setup menu you can also add targets
manage your agents and set up your
security
so let's move to the help menu this is
where you can access Oracle resources
like online help documentation forums
and OTN another interesting feature you
can find on the console is the global
search by default you search by targets
but you can change that to knowledgebase
bug database or communities so let's put
a targets partial name here and select
return to search for it this gives you a
list of all targets that match your
search on the Left panel we have
additional search facets that allow you
to further filter the search
for example let's click on up which
shows you only the targets that are up
and available you can also filter them
for a particular software version once
you are done you can clear all your
filters and at any point in time you can
also save your searches if you plan to
reuse them on a frequent basis
now let's drill down to a host target
homepage from here
the targets homepage gives you an
overview of the targets health with
information like its status and
performance each targets home page has
its targets context at the top where we
show the targets name and current status
and there's an information icon that you
can click this gives you quick access to
important information about that
particular target
every target also has a contextual
target menu this menu is target specific
for example you can go to monitoring and
then CPU details
at any point in time you can go back to
the targets homepage you can also
personalize your homepage to increase
the effectiveness of your roles and
responsibilities to do that click on
this icon on the right from here you can
change the layout you can move regions
around and you can also add content by
clicking add content this gives you a
list of regions you can add to your
homepage let's add the performance
metric chart for example
as you can see it is added at the top in
addition each region can be personalized
by clicking on the wrench tool this will
allow us to choose metrics that we want
to be shown on that chart click on add
then let's expand the network interfaces
summary
scroll down and choose the second and
fourth one here click ok now let's give
this region a name and click OK now
let's say we don't want to start with
this network performance region but
rather with the CPU and memory you can
simply drag and drop the CPU memory
region to the top position when you're
happy with your modifications click
close to save your customization
because we'll access this page on a
regular basis let's make it a favorite
once added you can see it in your
favorites menu the last feature we
illustrate here is how to make any page
your home page for example you are an
administrator working on incidents and
you want to make the incident manager
your home page
once on that page go to set up my
preferences then select set current
pages my home you can verify that this
page is your home page by looking at
your favorites menu this is the end of
the demonstration thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
