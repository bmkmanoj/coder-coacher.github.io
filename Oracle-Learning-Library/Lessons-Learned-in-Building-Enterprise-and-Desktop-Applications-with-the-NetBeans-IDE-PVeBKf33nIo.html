a very interesting program lined up for
you is not one second that you can
possibly get bored because we have so
many speakers this particular session is
focused on a range of users of NetBeans
IDE on the one hand and on the NetBeans
platform maybe we can have the yes so
first of all we have speakers two
speakers who are going to be telling us
about what they're doing with netbeans
ide so that is one branch of the
NetBeans technology their uses of
nikki's ide and we have on that side of
things chatter tbg the lead developer
from the prime faces jsf component sweet
and also shown cam offered a surprise
guests not even on the agenda from
espn.com he'll tell you how espn.com
makes use of NetBeans and after those
two presentations you'll see two other
presentations but this time from the
NetBeans platform perspective because
you can use the framework underneath
nipples IDE as a basis of your own
applications so from that angle we see
I'm Garrick Bevins talking about a
reservoir management system and Angelo
dunya no blue from NATO showing a
product which has just won a jig slicer
word so you see how and why they chose
netbeans ide in each case and netbeans
platform and you see also some tips and
tricks and they'll tell you things I
like and areas that could be improved so
we start immediately with shown from
espn.com I has a radeon so i am going to
run through hopefully kind of quickly
the slides i have and try to do a quick
demo hopefully if or Chris or fingers
and assume it works but you could see I
for some of you if you have to be at the
community day for netbeans I was gave
the same kind of song and dance there so
I'm actually going to get out of
presents or mode so that's just a little
bit of information about me I'm in
charge of the platform architecture team
at ESP
encom sorry I hold on one second I got
to try and get this not to be in
presenter mode do i do then alright well
I'll sorry I'm having a little trouble
seeing the slides but this is basically
just a brief overview of how calm works
if any of you are curious kind of goes
into the demo I'm going to try to do at
the end there's feed providers that send
data from the stadium people have
actually key in the data it's all
ingested into ESPN into a pretty large
oracle RAC f database called you know
SDR database let's then replicate it
over to the digital media side of the
world which is where espn.com lives we
have bunch of JMS message pipelines that
come in with all the various data we
basically take all those messages and
you know ingest them into various sports
specific databases so real high level
that's how things work that there's a
lot of business logic I guess that goes
into that in jest process so you might
think it's pretty cut and dry you just
get stats and scores and things like
that but there's a lot that can go wrong
you have real humans at games and a live
you know in a football stadium entering
data that's coming in on a fly the data
might get degraded for some reason so
there's a lot of fail sleeps in place we
have to scrub data make sure it all is
valid it makes sense the clock is not
null or something like that there's also
other scenarios where you know we have
to downgrade what's called downgrade the
feed where we might not show the
detailed play-by-play information but we
show you know some basics of at least
how the score works so we have a pretty
large read architecture process to go on
if you notice in the previous slide
you'll see this seems like there's a lot
of sports specific kind of paths through
our environment we're trying to address
that kind of make all sports the same
write our code base and our ingest
processes and our application api is in
such a way that it's all the same that's
just you have to ask for a specific
sport you want but it's not an actual
separate application so weary
architecting a lot of this on the back
end using specific key technologies like
MTBs and JPA egb CDI or starting to use
that more and more we're getting these
all via glass fish and of course like it
says you know if you're going to be
using all those technologies we feel
like NetBeans is probably the definitely
the plate the best place to get the
support
for them some of the features
specifically that we love about NetBeans
er up here I mean this came up with the
community day over and over again if you
guys use if anybody uses maven like it's
awesome it's just you can't even compare
Eclipse just it's a pain in the neck to
be honest with you so mavens board is
great obviously the GlassFish
integration there's plugins you can get
for for eclipse to set that out but it's
nice to just be able to take you know in
our environment just take NetBeans and
plug it in and start working and not to
configure these five plugins and get all
this other stuff work in it and it may
or may not actually work in other IDs
code generation that's another big one
for us like I said we as the worldwide
leader in sports recover a ton of sports
so anytime we can avoid having to like
just tediously type in data objects and
things like that just generate them
we're all we're all about that another
one that I mentioned the J visualvm it's
not NetBeans itself but it's built on
the same platform we love that so we
have a ton of services we cover a ton of
sports just being able to not have to
remember that the NFL service is on this
host with this Jam export like that's
worth it alone to the using that visual
vm is a free tool in the jdk right yep
yeah so it's a lot of people are not
aware of that they think it's just Jake
consoles and only acts I mean a lot of
times J consoles good enough but Jay
visualvm is much liquor I mean we're
starting more and more to not even use
jconsole anymore so just things we'd
like to see the performance has gotten a
lot better it's a lot more streamlined
starts up a lot faster startup time used
to be a big deal i think with netbeans
the memory footprint is probably the
biggest thing and I understand that's
something the teams working on so we're
looking forward to that so I've left
about six minutes which I'll go through
talking through the cool tool that we
built and probably only like a week or
two I mean this is like years of pain on
the.com side of trying to replay games
right so you know as the slides say you
know most of what we do is we is the
business logic of ingesting sports data
and we serve in espn.com as the data
provider to all the different product
teams that build iphone applications and
the website itself and TV widgets that
go on set top boxes there's a ton of
different places you know the ESPN has
its tentacles out there in the product
world we are basically the ones we
behind the scenes that provided all the
data to those platforms so like I was
saying earlier the feed there's a lot of
scenarios and the feed you know like a
certain plays occur in a certain order
we might have to test that and a lot of
times you know most sporting events
happen at night and engineers we like to
go home at the end of the day typically
so we don't want to have to stay all
night watching baseball games replay
until two o'clock in the morning and
then if you miss it then it's live duh
now what do we do like we got to come
back again the next night and watch it
again so we're like this is ridiculous
maybe we can let's try and see if we can
build a tool to solve this problem for
ourselves and that was how we came up
the idea that's what we call the ESPN
rewind tool so I'm going to turn out a
little bit look at this to talk to a
little because I can't see my own slides
in the presenter view so you can see
basically we get all of the sports din
oh it's right down there in front of me
that would be easier so we have the read
this is just a high-level design of how
it works all of the messages come in
through a single topic we then have a
message broker that kind of splits them
off into various topics of interest
right so different groups want to get
MBA data but they might not care about
NFL data they're split off that way we
also have what's called feed replicators
and these are MTBs that we wrote to
basically take all of the xml messages
we get in the feed no matter what sport
it is and store them in a database and
we also store like timestamp information
of exactly when we got that message in
so theoretically any message we get for
an NBA game we're going to store we're
going to store with it I time stamp
showing exactly when we got it so that
normally does messages get replicated
over to MBA the NBA ingest process takes
over and it updates the database and
then there's a whole sub separate you
know application on the other end that
shows it on the site and caching that
gets expired I won't talk too much about
that but we thought since we have all
these messages captured that would be a
good place to inject like a replay tool
so we created you know this thing called
the rewind app it's basically two points
there's a there's a jsf front end which
kind of serves as your controller to
replay a game you can stop a game start
a game one of the nifty features that we
added in was being able like replay to a
specific message within the game
so you know even in you can fast-forward
the game but sometimes and we first
started using the tool we'd fast forward
and then oh we missed it now we gotta
rewind and we basically put in a way to
jump to a specific play how it works is
basically the front end calls out to
some ejbs on the back end that provide
like a web service endpoint those things
go in say alright they want a replay
game one two three four give me all the
messages for that game they create a
timer the timer basically wakes up every
so often this to look and replay and as
much as we can in real time how it
happened like is we look at that time
stamp I was talking about in the in the
the feed messages database and we say is
it time to send this message okay yes
send it so that way it's replayed more
or less in exact real time as the way
happened and obviously you can speed up
and slow down the rewind service just
grabs those that timer takes over and he
just starts at the appropriate time
injecting the messages on to that topic
that the apt already uses so that's at a
really high level how it works I'll see
now I've got some slides here just
screenshots in case this demo doesn't
work but hopefully it will so this is
our UI as I said we're engineer's mostly
but it serves its purpose that is up
there oh that's not a good not a good
start sign there oh boy
let's see here
it's the typical it worked when I tried
it before alright so we'll take a quick
look just to see hopefully it'll work
this time but you can see this is our
dev environment it's a dev server we
have in our environment the game is
obviously final this is the championship
game where the bowls are sorry not the
bowls the heat beat the thunder LeBron
James finally got his title so if I
click start here yeah so I guess it's
not going to work unfortunately let's
see there's another game i can find that
would work it's unfortunate i don't
define any flavor yeah so i guess i
won't really try and bore you with the
tedious details of describing how it
would work the long story short
unfortunately the demo is not working
but the all of this data we have this
all captured I cancellations the
screenshots those might be a little
easier to see my fallback plan so that's
just the replay tool obviously you can
see you know this is the same dev server
that we're talking to but we have the
capability in there to see the game
happen rewind it's not just basically to
score it's it's everything that goes on
in the game all the stuff we would have
detailed you know box score information
all the player stats your time on the
floor all of this stuff could
theoretically be wrong or calculated
wrong during an Jess process so the
replay tool obviously allows us to in
real time to replay all the processing
of this data play-by-play that's the
scenario where things go wrong a lot so
the NBA feed will be sending in
something that's it's actually a you
know three pointer but the NBA clarified
it wrong having the replay tool is
extremely beneficial shot chart that's
an hour thing all this will populate and
repopulate in real time as we stop and
start and fast-forward games this is
another example we have it if yet it's
another tool we built with jsf and
netbeans we call the line reader
basically any single given message if
let's say we know there's a particular
message that's causing problems we just
go directly to this line reader tool
will not deal with the whole replay
aspect of it and we can send off a
particular message to replicate a
particular scenario so that's another
helpful to
and again these things that C have saved
us enormous amounts of time and trying
to like the bug issues and they are
really simple to build basically with
the technologies and the integration
there was a net being so that's about it
for me perfect sorry about the demo no
that's perfect so let's switch from that
immediately to primefaces so I'm going
to switch the slides back and chat i qg
and we're actually going to do a session
tomorrow together about using java ee 6
with with netbeans and we will use
primefaces as the view layer and chatter
and i will be doing the session together
so instead of doing a demo he's going to
introduce the prime faces concepts and
how many things is used there hello yeah
now we really upper all right I'm chart
i qu jie the prime phase project lead
and javaserver faces expert group member
since jay said too and i'm also apache
pmc member it's like reading news yeah
like so i put my face p MC member of the
upper open-sourced years of
implementation so I'm more like a jsf
guy but i also like other frameworks as
well i speaking conferences and work as
a consultant trainer but my full-time
job spine pieces so we can move to next
slide maybe okay so the prime phase is
it's developed in netbeans so we use
netbeans every day we were using eclipse
before but you were having some problems
with the mail integration just like
mentioned so met mrs. great out of the
box mainly integrations so that was
magical for us so it just works we had
took the best thing i like is that we
can just bind customizable Mahlon
comments like clean install offline to
the nice icons of NetBeans so that when
i click
which are also customizable they build
clean and I can just run whatever I want
so that was the reason why they moved to
NetBeans and we also like to other
features that code completion you our
generation so I'm a jsf developer so
NetBeans has great tooling for jsf and
Prime face as well so if you cover
primefaces as an overview it's currently
the most popular jsf components to it so
jsf is from what i see is mostly used by
corporates for broad air no internal
frame internal projects and most of our
clients are corporates and in primefaces
souls the common problems of let's say
nice rich looking you I with Ajax
features with themes feel like 40 teams
write them and you can create your own
team with no video plumbing CSS by the
way any practice users here ok bye
that's fine so we have more than 100
components these compounds are like
toffee top panels accordion panels and
all trees all kind of common stuff you
can find in the UI library and we have
also some other weird components like
image cropper that you will not use
every day but things like that there are
other add-ons like themes based on
jQuery theme roller we had to push
framework which is quite nice IP check
aadhar showcase left its part by the
famous atmosphere framework which is a
portable push framework whether we are
running jetty tomcat plus which they
have logic even on ie6 it were it just
works with graceful degradation and we
also have a mobile a ton so if you open
the same JSF page on a mobile plot on
mobile device it just the buttons will
look bigger so the community is quite
large we're like fifteen thousand
registered users in forum but I guess
it's much more when I count downloads I
don't really count downloads I just look
at that so I think we have for example
download count of users guidance 40,000
Soviet we are close to 4,000 users and
the form is like 75,000 so
we are close to 100,000 posso is the
biggest GSF community and the cool thing
is that if you download netbeans it is
bundled so if you get at actual last
year netbeans team approach this is when
i first met get john and when you asked
as if they can include prime face
because of the license think it's apache
license but and we were glad that
because map is a great tool and at the
time we were moving to NetBeans so it
was like a sign so so real if you get if
you select javaserver faces from the
framework you will get a component step
at first we were the only one but lately
that's other competitors are in but I
think there's only one bundle they need
to be big yeah so because prior face is
only one jar that's I think unique you
want to keep the NetBeans back it's
small so netbeans is one click installed
it's one of the features we like as well
and it really matches the idea of
primefaces just one jar no dependencies
just drag-and-drop library and start
using it and from the NetBeans point of
view we also develop java applications
primefaces actually i didn't match the
company's prime technology in Turkey
stumble in Ankara we also develop java
applications we are like 30 people right
now we also do ecommerce trainings
consulting so the prime face is like one
thing we do and the only open source
thing we do the other things are a lot
more like commercial so our team is
using NetBeans I admit that some of the
guys are still using Eclipse and
IntelliJ because we have a freedom of
what they use but most of the company is
using NetBeans and I'm trying to
Congress other guys and for example when
I I also give some trainings time to
time and if the client is using actives
or other library it's a pain for me
because I do a lot of hand coding in the
training and during the training I say
ok there's a better way to this and I
while they're working on actives I open
up netbeans and do some code generation
using jsf tools and a
probably by the end of the training the
consoling to at least causing to
migrating NetBeans so how we use
primefaces sorry netbeans we use jelly
and jsf tooling a lot for example we can
for legacy data tables we generate the
JP entities from the tables and we can
do other way as well from JP entities to
the tables and the one of the problems
best feature I like in netbeans is that
I can just generate the UI forms data
tables any kind of jesup form from
NetBeans by just choosing the entity and
jay-z net means will give me the form
also we have even talking with ted piece
team providing feedback like to improve
the code generation david and so yell
code completion is a must if you are
doing july and cause it's mostly yell
NetBeans is doing a great job on it and
facelets templates if you can just rent
a faceless template net busy one has
built in CSS stuff for that although we
mostly use our own CSS you can just
create a facelet template and use or
face the template client and it just
works even NetBeans gives you the UI
defined parts in your face a template of
course as a regular develop reviews
testing profile and debugger tools as
well we don't have any most I mean
especially at the same point two things
have changed drastically in that means
the speed is awesome I was working with
ad the other day anyway he had net pins
702 we had his background scanned
there's no background skin so we had to
wait for his necklace to show so the
background skin is awesome so we re
looking forward to the new features in
that pins and from a maybe rajala a
company and yes fau I company trying to
give feedback to NetBeans team on how to
improve the current tools
and at the end of the session and I'm
left over and there should be we'll be
asking some questions to the people in
the panel and we'll open the discussion
to the floor so save your questions for
the end and we'll have some discussion
so for the moment it will go on to Garak
to our completely different context and
this time not focusing on NetBeans IDE
so much but on the framework underneath
it and how it's being used and you've
just seen some screenshots from the next
one which will be about NATO but this is
first about the reservoir management all
right so like Kurt John said my name is
Garrett Bivens I'm a software architect
at halliburton kind of my background I'm
not going to spend too much time on the
slide just because I want to get to the
demo of the application so I'm a
scientific visualization guy so my
backgrounds OpenGL and computer graphics
and stuff like that when i joined object
reservoir in 2007 their java house and
so that's how i got it to java and Neffe
things like that so what is Orca so a
week when i came to object or ism where
we had a existing product already a
child abuse it was a full full-blown
simulator for oil and gas analysis and
we want we had a new idea for a product
offering and we wanted we had some
commonality between these two products
but we could leverage any of the other
functionality so we were looking for
ways to build kind of a common
architecture that we could build
multiple apps that shared kind of the
common common themes across them so
NetBeans platform provides this kind of
capability you know you can have an IDE
but you can also do like C++ development
or Java development different
perspectives based on the application
you're developing so we wanted to do
something similar for oil gas
applications so limits which is kind of
a funky name for a software package but
that's our that was our first product
that we delivered on the Orca
architecture that was kind of developed
in tandem with the Orca
arm basically it's used for these new
well not new but newly discovered
unconventional reservoirs are having
problems with the traditional tools in
doing the analysis because it's just not
working like the kind because the
characteristics of the rock and
reservoirs are completely different the
old tools that they were using don't
give them reliable forecasts and things
for the wells so it's kind of the
history of Orca or of limits it started
out as spreadsheet which is obviously
something you can't go and sell to
clients we have an idea for like a
portal app that you could log into you
and connect up with your corporate
database and then do all your your
workflow analysis there but it was it
was a it wasn't very practical that we
had to do too much on the browser had
too much data transfer and things like
that so then we went to a desktop
version we had just a straight up swing
app which worked really well we've got
we sold a bunch of licenses off of it
but what we found out is that as we
wanted to do new features and we wanted
to stick with our mantra of having a
platform that we could build other
applications off of this just wasn't
practical for so that's how we got to
the NetBeans platform so now I'm going
to bring up the app sorry about that ok
so this is the application it's
basically what we have over here
basically is a list of wells that we've
connected up to a Derby database not
sure how many people of done NetBeans
platform development here ok quite a few
so we're leveraging a lot of the power
of the platform here so right now so
just this project view were just there's
an API for it we made it our own project
type that can read in the open Derby
databases a cool thing about it that's
probably not a parent here but because
of the modularity we're able to define
pieces of the persistence external from
just the core so like as as we look at
our workflow here we've got different
modules contributing to the whole
application and each one of those can
define its own domain and its own
persistence and whatever and when it the
system discovers dynamically hey there's
these new domain pieces that need ad and
it just adds it to the hierarchy so it's
pretty cool so if you look at that
counter to the application general areas
of our app we have just navigator here
that are the different kind of steps
like do X do i do you know the next
steps through your workflow in the
analysis and so I you're seeking my
notes here kind of on a technical level
each one of these is a module sweet and
so it defines basically three levels are
three different pieces of the stacks
we've got the UI portion is it defined
in a module we have kind of calculations
and things like that are defining the
module and then the domain objects are
defined in a separate module and so
these are the pieces that you can put
together to build your application and
so and this one we have six six or seven
different module suites contributing to
this whole application let's see here
so what happens when you switch from one
to the other so yeah so as we're walking
through the workflow what's going on now
is we're basically changing kind of
perspectives so for this task for the
first task was i connect to the database
and get all your geometrical
configuration information counter
reservoir Rock properties and your fluid
properties and things like that now
we're switching to a different tasks
that we're doing in the workflow and so
we're opening different groups of
windows we call that kind of our tag
name development was the canvases and so
each one of these modules defines a
different canvas so as you're stepping
through your workflow these things are
changing being defined a cool thing
about that one of the other talks was
kind of talking about this look we're
taking a lot of advantage of what they
call the virtual file system and
netbeans these workflows have a bunch of
different components and it looks like
there's a lot of like UI development
that we had to do but really there's
only one chart in our code base and one
outline view that we customized in our
code base and the way we're doing that
is so each module the canvases are
defined in the lair xml by registering
they're calling these instance files and
so we can go into a factory layout in
the late XML file we can register like I
need five charge for this view and I
need a couple of editors for this view
and I need them in these positions and
here's the data that i need to get from
them we're going to do this all
declaratively and so if we want to
extend the application there's no coding
you have to do you just go in and define
stuff declare diesel do it's really
really cool we even took that further
with the charts memory using the road
our own annotation processor so then you
can even just annotate packages and
it'll generate all this stuff for you so
adding new modules and new features the
application became less of the coding
task which was one of the goals for
development because we were you know
this was changes with product was
changing quite a bit during the
development computer discovering as we
were
doing it so it's pretty cool some other
things so things like that so now that
we only have one chart and one editor we
were able to enrich those things because
there was only one thing that we needed
to one place we're going to go to do to
do some of that so we have some
interactivity here this is just our
charting is based off jfreechart sand so
that out of the box you don't get a lot
of interactivity with Jeffrey charts so
we're able to do some things this is I
could go into more detail about what
we're doing here but we're just the
thing i wanted to highlight is that
we're able to focus more on features of
the components because we don't have to
do up netbeans didn't care of a lot of
the other stuff that we don't have to we
ought to worry about see some other
things I could point out I guess I don't
want to talk to you technical about what
we're actually doing in the application
is because I'm not a reservoir engineer
so haha the guys might ask me questions
although they are I don't know I just
wrecked the UI hats all I know so but so
some of the cool things here like i was
saying so the module the the separate
modules that we have for the workflows
all contribute to the UI somehow and so
one one cool thing is so now we have
these actions that are tied and declared
it fully as well into the platform so we
get to this step in the workflow we have
some of these charts and what you're
seeing here these great data is the the
previously measured historical data of
the well and behind the scenes we have a
model that kind of simulates what's that
what the how the world's going to behave
and we're trying to tune the model so
that it matches the historical data that
we've seen so we can go ahead run that
and what we're going to see if the data
is going to come in or actively we can
see that our models we've got a couple
models basically a
we're building part of the distribution
so at the end we can do a stochastic
forecast so our three models these are
like them in Matt the min case the most
likely case of the maximum case can you
guys see the charts okay and so right
now neither of the models kind of match
the history data well they look good
here in the great great charts but like
in the the pressure charts are not very
good so then we can do a calibration to
try to tune our models to get a better
fit so this is going to go off run some
stuff on the background you see some of
the cool kids and netbeans give you the
platform just provides you progress so
we've got three running task in the
background those things are giving us
feedback even they use your feedback
like hey I'm calibrating this case and
here's my kind of error approximation
it's kind of a tell me one but that's
what it's doing that it's going to take
a little while on my mat for some reason
it's been slow today but this will go
ahead and finish and complete the charts
will start updating as the data is
coming back from the calculations things
like that and you'll see we're getting a
better match now so our curves are now
starting the light right over the data
there's some more work that the engineer
could go through to try to tweak it to
get an exact match but as this thing is
going but the process would be more
iterative here so and then one other
thing if this could finish I think that
Max case was the most out of whack there
so it's having a little more time
calibrating it but
come on you can do it here we go Stalin
finish so all the three curves now lie
within the range a little better so if
we build a forecasting page are going to
do we're going to do the same thing but
now we're going to run like I guess we
have 20 here but we're going to do is
stochastic sampling in our area so let's
bring up another chart kind of give you
an idea that's another cool thing to sew
these menus are all declarative so I
remember I was saying that we registered
all our for each of our module our
workflow steps we'd register what goes
in there declaratively so these menus
are also driven off of that so you can
see you know for each of the pieces
contributing to the application there's
you know so for feasible range we have
44 charts that are available same thing
with the workflow steps we've got you
know six or seven editors that are
available that's all being done
declarative we were not really coding
for that right there so it's concrete
too so anyway so in this app will have
we're going to run a stochastic sample
it's going to generate some points and
it's going to go out and run all these
bottles submit those have run all the
models and what you'll see is really a
live feed back of the data running its
processing it's going to come back some
of the charging an update as this is all
right so you get kind of this really
nice interactive feedback of what's
going on and it allows you to relate the
data in your analysis so I don't how
close am I on time by because with my
research back to the slides no okay oh
yeah
let's see those some very old cultural
pictures of the app and just from the ID
side like it everybody's been saying we
we picked NetBeans just because of some
of the great things they have like the
maven integration its top of the line I
believe they've got you know nice can't
think of the word but the svn and the
get integration is really good things
with the j unit for our unit testing and
things like that really good in our case
when we were translating data from our
translating our refactoring code from
the big swing app into the modular
desktop the refactoring tools were
excellent for that moving code around
changing a package names things like
that it was really good we have a lot of
so like when you're developing workflows
the pieces of the domain objects that we
were generating kind of boilerplate so
the code each iteration stuff came in to
be really useful for that like I said I
had I have a background in C++ and so I
was doing a lot of visual studio and
stuff like that so coming in to Java
relative new nepean xiety you made it
really easy to start learning the
language playing around with stuff a lot
of the concepts in the IDE or just like
straight forward right you open a
project hey you got a project you've got
editors there's not this know if I want
to throw that out there with this weird
workspace concept and I mean that
stuff's really really weird to me for
coming in as a new person to like why is
that even why do I even care about that
but so it's really nice definite to
NetBeans environment and just getting
going and it you know I was getting up
this be really quickly like that so
otherwise really yeah and for the final
presentation we switch to the nato
programming center and then would have
some time for discussion I prefer to
stand because she at least we know just
dispute good morning everybody a man
Jordan ya know just some pieces of
personal background worked in the
Italian Air Defence for 10 years join
NATO 2001 worked on several projects all
always defense-related and the age of
2008 had been working on mice we can go
to the next slide what is mice basically
I all dates back to the 80's probably
the older among as we remember a field
that was called war games what was a guy
a teenager that was dialing into the
northern air defense system and was
playing tic-tac-toe in order to stop the
mutual assured destruction so basically
that's what every fancy is the air
defense is that at PVD that ensures that
the air space is not compromised and it
dates back from the Cold War was
basically the main priority was to
protect our countries from the Russian
threat and for a number of years it
basically the situation stayed the same
then the the Cold War ended and somehow
people were started to think that air
defense was not even any longer said
enough sep 10 or 11 01 revamped the de
need to have air defense so what is nice
nice is a platform application the
application of for air defense
applications so basically those
applications that allow the operators to
control the integrity of the airspace
what is it important is that being a
safety critical application having the
control of the aircraft's we are legally
obliged to use some practices that are
known as back to processes but we have
to use legally mandated because we have
to abide to some international standards
that give the guidelines for development
of a safety critical software basically
this is how the maze consultant based on
mice looks like so as you can see that
is basically a screen where the flying
objects are depicted in their position
there is a number of possible symbols
that give the operators the idea of the
I nature of this flying basically the
green ones are those that are the liners
the white one set of different meaning
the yellow ones and son in order to
assist the operator as well to know
which who is which aircraft and where it
goes we are connected to the civilian
air traffic control
agencies so we receive the flight plans
at the bottom of the screen here we can
see that we have the list of flight
plans the operator can then select one
of those flight plans and see on the
screen the path and the expected
position specific moment you can imagine
that this is particularly important if
you want to see if an aircraft is
deviating from his plan the path and so
that the appropriate actions have to be
taken in something if something is
happening on the left part of the screen
with the possibility for the operator to
filter the objects that are organized in
layers so that we can have for example
the yes what is fly but not only we have
also the surface tracks the possibility
for example to exchange land tracks and
this is a more complex environment we
can go ahead of course here we can show
that the operator is the possibility as
well to be to represent on the screen
different geographical data of course
different types of maps aeronautical
charts but not only also representation
whereas the CD is important for example
let's imagine there is an aircraft and
military aircraft that is s as an
emergency we want to know if he's
playing over see d if is flying over the
sea of over the ground here we see as
well that we plugged into the netbeans
platform to in the options of the
netbeans platform in order to give the
operator possibility to customize the
look and feel of what he s on the screen
basically the symbology number of labels
just let's go ahead here for example we
showing a map with the digital terrain
elevations that the operator immediately
knows which altitude is the ground in a
specific place before showing a video of
mice in operation we can probably I just
go to the through the points that
brought us to use the NetBeans IDE and
what are the big points actually I could
speak about this for about half an hour
or an hour but I forced myself to stick
to seven points as I said before we are
mandated to use the best
practices for the development because
it's a safety critical application so of
course everybody of us knows the
importance of a bit version control for
the software but one thing is that we do
it because we feel it one thing is that
we have also to show evidence so version
control for us is one of the mandatory
things to web for in the development of
the software again you can imagine that
our software has to be unit test before
we assist ship Liberty to the
verification section so and that means
give us a possibility to use j unit from
the next version from the 7.3 test
energy as well as far as I recall it is
integrated with cobertura so that
basically we can show also the evidence
on how the unit tests cover our software
because its own it's not only about
doing the things it's also about showing
the evidence study code analysis as well
as best practice but the ISO I 61508
that is the international standards that
mandates the development of programmable
and electronic devices it clearly says
that these things have to be done so
study code analysis not only helps us to
identify the upshot of the code where
possible problems can be but also give
us then the evidence that we run through
a formal process where the software is
statically analyzed before it's put into
into the in into operation connection to
issue issue tracking I mean again very
few of us do not do not use continual in
Turkish continuous integration nowadays
and issue tracking I mean NetBeans
provides that the possibility to
integrate seamlessly so that the
operators can basically checking the
code against a known bug the code is
automatically put into the repository
the repositories then pushed to the
shared one it goes into the continuous
integration unit tests were run we are
notified if their unit tests are failing
so basically all this is automated CPU
and memory profiling as well being a
soft real-time application our one
specific requirement
for performance before we mentioned the
JV to the end that is the tool that is
shipped together with the JDK not not
everybody knows that basically a visual
vm is shaped about the CPU and memory
profiling tool that is inside NetBeans
so basically from inside net means we
have all the tools that Jay visualvm
provides plus the integration with the
source code the powerful debugger I mean
I mean it's not reinventing the the
water it's debugging is vital especially
when we are debugging soft real-time
applications web for example we cannot
stop the application from running
because this would disrupt the
connection with the server so the
debugger gives us the possibility to set
a number of criteria where the
application has to stop where it does
not have to stop basically conditional
stops and so on and last but is for us
actually the most important plus for the
NetBeans IDE it's a showcase of the
platform may mice is based on the
NetBeans platform so basically it uses
the same pipelining the same components
whatever it's possible whenever we don't
know on how we could design something
out we could present something to the
user we just think how is it present as
a similar thing in the IDE how is it
done then we say ok if in the idea ton
in this way like for example balloons
popping up telling us that there was a
problem now on the unit tests on Jenkins
we could use the same mechanisms being
an open source tool we basically go
inside the source code and we can then
reuse the components see how things are
made basically copying not only the look
and feel but also the design so this is
basically that's the biggest plus
because knowing well how the IDE works
keeps us the possibility to understand
the possibilities of the platform and
then gives us then the mean to exploit
the past those platform to its best just
this is about the usage of the ID but I
mean the benefit
of using the platform are are numerous
my experience I started developing in C
C++ motive and then we move to first
Java and what I can say is that we got a
boosting productivity when we went from
c to java and that's equivalent to the
boost productivity that we experienced
when we passed from the java to java on
the planned on the net means a platform
because basically you get a number of
components that make your life easier
like for example separating the view the
model from the view I mean the
possibility to present oops sabotage
something something fell
they're what happened
anyway any clear sign of sabotage yes
it's a pity because we prepare the video
to show how actually nice works in
operation but we are we're doomed we
couldn't make it on on Sunday yeah we
can put it on YouTube but then we have
to bum you to be on ok anyway thanks
thank you very much so thanks everyone
for an interesting contribution so you
can see that you can use netbeans ide as
a development tool but it's it's also a
reference implementation for the net
miss platform going to show the video
let's see if you can do that so it is
your
nope is the other one
here we go okay let's see the movie ah
perfect
okay basically as I said before the
operator is presented with the number of
the of tracks that represent the flying
objects this is dialogue that is
integrated again what I was saying
before how we could give the user the
possibility to customize his stuff we
look at this done in the NetBeans IDE
and then automatically we are given a
framework on which we can plug in and
give our possibilities for options here
for example the operator is changing the
the labels that displayed together which
track you met you can imagine for
example there are operators that are
interested to know which altitude a
specific track is flying it left perform
deconfliction on the right side you can
see that whenever the operator selects
the track the properties of the tracker
displayed this is clearly for those ones
that use the IDE whenever you select a
swing component humidity of the
properties this is basically reuse of
the NetBeans property sheet and if we
had to program this on our own it would
take us probably weeks while using the
property sheet from the from the
platform was a matter of days as you can
see for example not operator perform the
geographic search on the screen the
tracks that are presented specific
geographic area then shown at the bottom
of the of the page again this is a
standard NetBeans component it's an
outline view whenever the tracks are
selected on the screen they are then
automatically selected at the bottom and
whenever you elaborate wants to perform
an action on one of the tracks can start
either from the table or from the screen
this is all automated in the wiring of
the NetBeans platform cool I think that
you know more or less fish which shows
it and we can narrow the LMS so we don't
have very much time but tin you and
myself we are both from the NetBeans
team and we've been following these
these projects and it's very great to
see these different things in action and
to hear from the architects behind them
now we have some questions and then we
see if anyone else wants to contribute
as well
hello can we have the mic
at the end working okay so chat I uh you
know you're talking about primefaces how
it's a you know the most popular joseph
library what why is it you know what
accounts for the popularity of it
compared to the older or you know the
other libraries that are out there today
well we have used other libraries so
practice quite new it's like 23 years
its actual three years old and the
competitors i like sir it's not a book
okay so okay thank you so when you
compare it with other products it's
younger it's actually mature now every
three years old but it's younger and
when jsf to came up there were like one
and a half year period when there were
no other just to library other than
primefaces so it was the only choice and
it was a good choice for people and so
that now even there are other jasa to
libraries it's still being used and we
used other libraries and we think we
thought that we can do better and we
designed the library depending on the
being lightweight easy to use so even
i've used that the competitive libraries
before in my day job so I can see what
they are doing good what they are doing
bad so that was the main thing actually
that we created the community and the
project based on these design principles
and
that's the that's worked quite so far it
might be a question for for espn.com
what what would be some features that
would really help you in netbeans ide
that make things currently doesn't have
when you say for example plugins plugins
plugins what what kind of features would
be like to have that's a good question I
mean I think so one of the things that I
not aware of it maybe you guys already
have it but we didn't see one as for
whatever reason we use the source code
control system called perforce and
there's a plug-in available for eclipse
which allows you to tie in directly but
we weren't able to find an equivalent
one for peripheral sorry for netbeans so
that that was that's a more of a minor
one there's obviously a GUI we can use
for that but I think just in terms of
the big thing for us as kind of as I
mentioned in the community you know
we're very interested in the cloud
technology and almost up in EE 7 and
ESPN like we have one of the best use
cases probably for like scaling up and
scaling down right NFL Sunday the
traffic on me SPM comms nflp just goes
crazy everyone's on their looking for
scores Monday to some extent to Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday middle of the week
nobody's really checking that much so we
definitely would love to be able to just
add servers dynamically and then scale
back down to keep our footprint small
but when we need that extra capacity get
it so just keeping in line as it always
seems to do with the spec and all the
features and hooks that are gonna be
there that'll be great for us we're
definitely excited about that cool are
there any other questions anyone has at
this point to any of the speakers yes
I'm sorry Android development
you
yes there is a proper there's a project
called NB Android and if you go to NV
android org you will find all the
information about that plus a plugin and
it's it's a community contributed plugin
and it's pretty good the one thing
that's missing is a visual designer and
but the cool thing about it is it's a
community project and they say and
depending on the actual financial
contributions they get they will
prioritize particular features so if so
their philosophy is if you really want
to visual designer you'll pay you'll pay
them to make it but it's it's really a
viable thing apart from the visual side
and I think it should get a lot more
attention because it's it's a really
good project maybe another question from
here
okay this is a question for the Angelo
and Shawn as well you guys are working
for you know very large or well known
organizations what's the process like to
get that beans adopted in an organ
organization such as yours do you have
an impact on that decision what's that
yes okay in our case before we started
to develop on the netbeans platform we
did not use snap it's mainly development
was done on CC plus you can hold the mic
closer okay the development was done on
C C++ motive so there was really the
need to use an ide like netbeans was not
that spread and you know geeky WikiLeaks
envy is world all the way all I need of
course when you move to java the ID is
much more important the choice for us to
go for netbeans okay i'm a long term
netbeans user since 2004 when it was
about then to choose the development
environment for us was it was basically
i wouldn't say the only possible choice
because usually i think we decided to
use the platform it sounded logical I
mean it was more or less automatically
says you know we are going to use the
platform we want the ID it's like the
software development kit for the full of
platform correct ID yeah because I mean
it would have really made little sense
to use something else the dark side or
rectal exam it is possible leesport it
is possible but you know again for us
evide knowledge of the IDE is also
getting awareness or what the platform
can good news and all that that's one of
the big pluses you definitely
I mean a thing for us we have some
benefits in that while ESPN is part of
disney and disney's a huge company they
kind of left us alone and calm to kind
of do our own thing it helps obviously
that it's open source and it's community
and there's not a licensing fee attached
with it because that's you know or could
also kind of be sheep sometimes with
software cost management but I mean the
biggest thing for us is just been the
proof is in the pudding right like
people are kind of free to choose what
they want to use in our environment but
just being able to show people like you
know that replay told me may not seem
like a big deal but it seems a huge
amount of time for us has been a huge
win and that peach other people's
interest within the organization right
it's kind of like a community or an
organization you know grassroots I think
they see that they hear that we built it
pretty quickly and then they start
playing with it and a kind of word of
mouth has been the best way and just
showing productivity games i think is
ben what's gotten people interested any
other questions from the floor anything
i think we are kind of running to the
end of the session so thank you all for
coming and as testified here making the
school it's what great productivity
tools try it out today in fact NetBeans
IDE 73 beta was released which has all
the project easel tooling that you might
have seen in the keynotes and a lot of
sessions project ease or so if you want
to do html5 development you can try that
from today in 73 beta release thank you
very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
