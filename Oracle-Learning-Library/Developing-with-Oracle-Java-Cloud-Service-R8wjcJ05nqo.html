Java Enterprise application it could be
an amazing looking website or a great
REST API or web service or some custom
integration solution if only you could
start coding right now but there's other
stuff to worry about first you need a
server with the right hardware and
someone has to download install and
configure the WebLogic server software
installing it configuring a database is
another headache
and even when this environment is
finally ready who's going to back it up
and keep it patched
automated code builds and tests would
save your team tons of time but that's
even more set-up time
and what about scalability and even
performance testing
in the end all of these infrastructure
requirements can take weeks which is
time you could be coding
welcome to Java cloud service with just
a few clicks you can begin provisioning
a complete development environment
that's ready to use in just a few hours
this environment includes our ready to
use instance of WebLogic server and
oracle database that you can further
customize if you need to go ahead and
start with a single VM that has as much
CPU and RAM as you need but with a few
more clicks you can quickly scale up
this VM with additional hardware or even
scale out to a larger cluster of VMs and
WebLogic servers there's also automatic
daily backups of your entire environment
so if something breaks it's easy to
restore things back to a previously good
state even one-click patching to make
sure your applications use the latest
and greatest versions of Java Web logic
and the database or are you a real power
user tired of using the web console for
example Java cloud service offers an
equivalent command-line interface and
REST API s2
so how do you start coding in the cloud
basically you can choose any development
tools you like many can deploy directly
to WebLogic server just point the tool
to the VM running the admin server or
you can always use standard web logic
deployment tools like the admin console
or the scripting tool but there's even
more Java cloud service includes access
to Oracle developer cloud service this
service offers a complete team
development platform in the Oracle cloud
that's based on popular industry tools
and methodologies you can check in your
work into a git source repository
compare versions and create branches you
can automate application builds
deployment and testing with ant and
mavin
or use continuous integration and
schedule these tasks to run periodically
with Hudson jobs
Java cloud service offers enterprise
developers an unmatched experience you
can provision a new environment in less
than a day instead of waiting weeks for
IT or trying to do it all yourself do
you need more power
do you need a cluster do you need to go
back to last week set up or to a
different patch level all of these are
trivial tasks to do in Java cloud
service and you can instantly start
collaborating with the rest of the team
share code track bugs and automate your
development process in the end happy
programmers do build the best
applications as you already know so
start a Java cloud service trial today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
