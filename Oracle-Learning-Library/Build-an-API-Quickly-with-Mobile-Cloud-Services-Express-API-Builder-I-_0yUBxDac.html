demonstration of the Express API editor
part of Oracle mobile cloud service I'm
going to switch right over to MCS and
start this out I'm going to go to our
API section and now instead of just new
API I have an option I can use the
traditional API editor or now I have
Express api's so I'm going to choose
that and I'm going to get you to the
editor so here I see the general things
that I just entered but the important
tab is now the resources instead of
going in and entering endpoints which
could just be a random collection of
rest endpoints now I'm doing things that
are Business Objects eccentric so here
I'm going to create a new resource or a
new business object and hear this i'm
going to use opportunity i also want to
be able to get a list of opportunities
as a collection so here I'm going to
provide the plural so now I'm presented
with a view that lists my resources down
the left and their details on the right
so here in the overview I can see some
of the information I just entered I can
see it's child reference child resources
and reference resources as well as any
parent relationships it has and it's
defaulted and created a bunch of methods
for me to list find create edit and
delete elements of that object so now
let's go over to fields so here now i
can create fields that define my base
resource
you
okay so I've got the fields for my
opportunity object or resource I can see
the default methods that we already
talked about but here i have the
opportunity to deselect these so if i
didn't want to expose the ability to
create an opportunity or edit an
opportunity i could just unselect those
you'll notice in the overview if I
unselect that I want a collection if i
go back to methods both the create and
the list are gone okay but for this i
actually want those now let's go and
enter some sample data it tells me I
don't have any sample data so now
instead of just pasting Jason I now have
a much more structured method of doing
this
so now I've created this resource with
some sample data now let's go in and
look at maybe list opportunities so I
can click into this method in the list
opportunities I also want to be able to
support creating parameters
also the response right now it's
returning complete opportunity resources
for the list sometimes that's not
advisable maybe I only plan on showing
some limited data I don't want the extra
cost of returning all of this data let's
shape this I don't need the products and
maybe I don't need the expected clothes
I only want the name the region revenue
sales agent win percentage and if I want
more responses i can add those here okay
and I could set the media type so now
I'm able to shape each one of my methods
to create the edit for example so here I
can see I can edit the ID well in my
instance I don't want to be able to edit
the ID it's set once you create it so
I'm going to modify that and again I can
also add parameters here the response is
still returning the whole object so now
I've set up my opportunity object let's
create another object call
you
ok so I've got my bass fields my bass
methods again I could go and restrict
these I'm going to leave those alone
and so I have some data so now what I
want is I want to relate these two okay
when you request an opportunity I want a
child object that returns the account
related to that opportunity so I'm going
to add another field for the account but
this time it is a reference and this
reference references the account object
now you can see I've got a reference set
up here I will go in and show this but
let's look at the methods now under list
the response for this still is shaped to
what I had but now you can see there are
more fields that could be selected so
this is nice I don't want all of the
account information to come down for
every row but when I do a find on an
opportunity I do want the whole object I
want all of the account information to
come down with it as well ok now for
opportunity there's one more thing we
want to do we want to create a child
resource note okay so this actually
creates a note child opportunity I will
get into the difference between a
reference and a child in a second
you
so now I can see for note it has a
parent resource of opportunity
opportunity is a child of note so lets
you see how your things are related so
now when i request an opportunity object
the account object will be embedded
inside it okay so every time I return an
opportunity the canonical opportunity I
will get an account object embedded
inside the Jason as opposed to a note
okay which is a child I'm going to have
to make a separate call for notes so it
will be opportunity you'll see for note
it is / opportunity ID note this get
will list all the notes for the
opportunity so I've got my thing set up
let's go look at the wrong so really
what we have is a editor that creates
the wrong just like you did before if I
really wanted the endpoint view I could
go here and see the view that you might
be used to and see the endpoint view now
that we're done creating our API with
the Express API editor let's take a look
at the Roma one thing to note is when
looking at the rommel view this is read
only because you need to edit things
using the editor so first I'm going to
scroll down to the opportunity
collection schema that got generated and
you can see it's only got the attributes
that we shaped if I scroll back up to
the entire singleton for opportunity you
can see it's got all of the elements
including a reference to the account so
the entire account object will appear
here if we go down to the the actual end
points here we see / opportunity and the
get and
is going to be the list it says list
opportunities here we see even the
sample data has been edited to only
include the attributes that we wanted if
we go down a little further and we look
at the gate for slap / opportunity / ID
we see all of the sample data and
similarly all of the other schemas have
been created here for me based on what I
edited in the editor so now if we want
to test this we can simply hit the test
button yes I'd like to save it so now
I'm in the tester for list opportunities
if I hit test endpoint you can see it is
returning me exactly these sample data
okay I haven't done an implementation
for this yet so it's really just kicking
back the sample data but you can see
this is what it's going to return ok so
we've completed our Express API the next
step would be to add the implementation
just like you would for a normal API if
you want to do anything advanced you can
also just download the romel and
actually create a new regular API and
start it with that Rommel and you'll get
exactly the same result except you'll
have a full API and you'll be able to
edit the normal as normal if you need a
back door thanks for joining me for this
demo of the express ABI editor a feature
of Oracle mobile cloud service we look
forward to having you tried</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
