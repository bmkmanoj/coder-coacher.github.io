going to show the triggers feature for
Mission Control that's found under the
mbeans tab group so here we normally
come into the ambience browser the
triggers tab let me go ahead and click
that and triggers are essentially
conditions or events that occur which we
can then do some action from so we're
going to look at some condition and then
we're going to get some sort of
notification about that condition and
notice by default we've got some default
rules for both java SE and for weblogic
so i'm going to look at this one here
cpu usage too low and if i click on that
you'll see here we have three tabs
condition action constraints condition
is what we're going to fire off of so
you can see here I've got an attribute
name which is the process cpu load and
then this is showing what the current
value is I can set my trigger value i'm
going to set it to ten percent and
notice that we're limited to 60 seconds
so that means that instead of every time
a trigger occurring and like overloading
your system it's only going to send an
alert or whatever once every 60 seconds
so that's a nice feature to have and
then we have here when the trigger
occurs either when the condition is met
or recovering from that condition so i'm
going to go ahead and click on action
then select an action and this i'm going
to just choose application alert which
is just a pop up from this application
but you can send stuff to the console
log it to a file send an email dump a
flight recording lots of options there
very interesting stuff you can do then
finally we have a third constraints tab
where you can set when this occurs
during a given a time a day Dave week
time span things like that
so let's go ahead and enable this
trigger so I just do that by checking it
there and then boom the fires off here's
the latest trigger I had one from
earlier that had not cleared and if you
scroll down you'll see the detail
information about that trigger and what
caused it and I'm going to go ahead and
close that and turn that off and that is
the triggers feature of Mission Control
