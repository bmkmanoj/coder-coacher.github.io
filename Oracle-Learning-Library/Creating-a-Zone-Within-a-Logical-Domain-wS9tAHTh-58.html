domain to store the non global zones
operating system to do this use the add
storage action
this step is needed if you want to use a
fiber channel LUN for storage in the add
storage panel select a SAN storage
library and one of its Lunz
after you're finished the new LUN is
listed on the storage tab next on the
library tab for the guest domains
operating system access the local device
library refresh the local disks table to
list the LUN that you just added make
note of the disk name for your lund
because you'll need to select it later
on when you provision the zone select
the disk and click the enable local
device button to enable the Len a
checkmark is displayed next to the disk
name now that it's enabled using the
associate libraries action associate the
guest domains operating system with the
nas storage library use this library to
store the non global zones metadata you
don't need to associate the sand storage
library after it's associated the nas
storage library is listed on the
libraries tab for the guest domains
operating system now you're ready to
create a profile and plan that
provisions the non global zone browse to
the Oracle Solaris Zone option in the
plan management pane and perform a
create profile action in the wizard
start by adding a profile name and a
description if you like retain the
option to create a deployment plan and
select an operating system for this
example I'll select Solaris 11 enter a
name for the non global zone and append
a number to the end of the name specify
the source that contains the installer
for the operating system in this case
I'll select the Solaris 11 image
packaging system repository you can
leave the CPU memory and Recovery
Options as is
for the zones default root filesystem
specified 20 gigabyte of reserved space
and 20 gigabyte for the quota select the
NAS storage library that you associated
with the guest operating system to store
the metadata and select local devices to
store the operating system select one
network to keep things simple for the
zone setup select your language and
timezone for the terminal type select
Dec VT 100 enter a password and you can
retain the other settings specify an opt
center administrator account to be
created on the operating system none for
the naming services review the summary
and finish the plan is listed under
create Oracle Solaris zones in the plan
management pane and the profile is
listed under Oracle Solaris zone now
it's time to apply the plan and create
the non global zone within the guest
domain in the assets pane select the
guest domains operating system and
perform a create Oracle Solaris zones
action in the opening panel select the
plan that you just created apply the
plan with minimal interaction and
continue you can leave the non global
zones name as is for the operating
system storage select the local device
that you enabled earlier on in this
example it was c3 d4 leave the nas
storage library selected for the
metadata specify an IP address retain
the network resource assignments
schedule the job now review the summary
and apply the plan
fast-forward about 30 minutes and you
can see that the non global zone is
created and listed under the guest
domains operating system in the assets
pane keep in mind the duration of the
job may vary in your environment general
information for the non global zone is
provided on its dashboard and summary
tabs on its network's tab you can view
its MAC address and
address the storage tab lists the zones
file systems and virtual disks you can
see that the LUN is listed here if you
open the libraries pane and view the SAN
storage library that contains that LUN
notice that the LUN is shown as
allocated to the guest domain the nas
storage library lists the non global
zone in the network Spain the non global
zone is listed under the network that
you had selected that concludes this
