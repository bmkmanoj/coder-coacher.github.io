power services generators power co uses
generators information from the gen max
3000 is monitored via the Internet of
Things platform the gen max 3000 throws
an error a notification is sent to a a
power the error is a known issue based

the procedure for replacement is also
part of the knowledgebase entry using
the Oracle social network collaboration
with technicians guarantee the service
appointment will go smoothly based on
current products and contracts a cloud
recommendation engine suggests a new
warranty for the customer using the
software as a service platform field
service can become predictive instead of
reactionary next-gen can design a better
generate amount or create a better
installation procedure hey power can
inquire to their customer base verify
enough replacement parts are available
and potentially upsell inspections and
send out notifications powerco can
interface describe and document any
issues that might have read up to the
failure through social media as well as
purchase additional warranties everybody
