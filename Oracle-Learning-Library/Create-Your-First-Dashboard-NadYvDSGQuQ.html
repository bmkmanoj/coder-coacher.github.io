data for specific brands by region the
first thing that you need to do is
create a dashboard prompt comps limit
the data displayed on the dashboard
select the column add a meaningful label
and then decide how the prompt should
look on the dashboard by selecting your
user input types such as checkboxes and
other options now add a second prompt
for brand use the display pane to see
how the prompts will look on the
dashboard use the new column check box
to rearrange the prompt so that brand is
positioned to the right of region save
the prompt you need to ensure that the
analysis which will be added to the
dashboard respects the new prompt that
you just created view the analysis the
analysis is only filtered for time for
the process to work properly on the
dashboard a filter for both region and
brand needs to be added the value for
each prompt should be set to be is
prompted operator only records matching
the value of the prompt will be
displayed similarly add the brand prompt
save the analysis create the new
dashboard if you want to create the
dashboard for personal use change the
location to my folders in dashboard
builder drag and drop the region brand
prompt to the work area of the new
dashboard page notice that a new column
and section are created automatically
into which the objects are placed

it's likely that you'll need a second
dashboard page in the future use
dashboard properties to change the name
of the first dashboard page
add the second page that will contain
content in the future when in edit mode
review the print and export options for
the revenue page you can change the page
settings print layout and so on to
adjust the appearance of the printed or
exported dashboard page change the
report links available for this analysis
to these links will be displayed along
with the analysis on the dashboard save
and run the new dashboard you can see
the new page report links along the
bottom of the dashboard ensure that the
prompt works properly

brands print the current dashboard page
