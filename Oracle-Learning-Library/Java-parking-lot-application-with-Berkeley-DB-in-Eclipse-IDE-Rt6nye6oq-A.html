going to import and run the Berkeley DB
Java sample program in the Eclipse IDE
in the previous tutorial we have already
built it's necessary Berkeley DB
libraries and copy them to the simple
programs directory so let's open eclipse
and import of the project now we are
ready to import and run the sample
program before that we want to make sure
that JDK 7 is configured as installed
JRE Eclipse to verify that click Eclipse
preferences find execution environments
and the Java installed GREs click on
Java SC 137 and verify that it is linked
to a JDK 7 installation now we are set
to import the sample program from the
context menu select import select
general existing projects and click Next
select the rooster
three of the sample program at the juice
directory make sure the sample program
is checked and click finish now the
sample program is imported we can see
that it contains a few competitor errors
now we configure the build path of the
project to fix the compare errors from
the context menu click build path
configure buta in the libraries tab page
click add jars and select the two jar
files built from the Berkeley DB release
package
if you did not copy them into the sample
programs directory you may need to click
add external jars to find them after
adding the two jars we need to configure
their native library locations click the
arrows to expand the Edit jars and
select native library location click
Edit we can simply add the workspace
root directory and the native library
location because we have copied the
native libraries into the root directory
of the sample program
now we are ready to run a sample program
expand the psaltery and find the parking
demo cars from the context menu select
run as java application now
see that the sample program has read
successfully let's take a quick look to
the output of the sample program the
sample program
simulates five cars entering and leaving
a parking lot when each car enters the
parking lot it gets a ticket with a
unique ticket ID when he leaves the
parking lot it pays his parking fee
based on a whole long he stays in the
parking lot at the end of the simulation
two statistics are also computed the
total number of cars enter in the
parking lot during a day in total
parking fees collected on the same day
before wrapping up the tutorial I will
also like to show you how to select the
api's used to run a sample program over
the parking demo class you can see then
at the beginning of the main method you
can specify which API to use to run a
sample program the default API is set to
sequel which means the JDBC driver is
used for example we can change it to
base which means the basic key value api
is used
you
or you can change it to DPL to use a
direct precision layer API now this
wraps up the tutorial thank you for your
time for more information on Berkeley DB
in the sample program please visit our
