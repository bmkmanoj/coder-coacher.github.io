identity management services that can be
leveraged by any application in the
cloud using open standard integrations
in this video you'll learn to integrate
your client and resource server
applications with identity cloud
services federated single sign-on and
authorization
in this integration we use OAuth 2.0 and
open ID Connect open standards so auth
2.0 provides authorization services in
the cloud with consent open ID Connect
extends the OAuth standard with
federated single sign-on capabilities by
performing this integration your
applications will provide secure access
to users even without having user data
stored in their databases all the user
data authentication and authorization
will be provided by Oracle Identity
cloud service during real time to
demonstrate the integration we'll use
the demo applications customer quotes
and sales insight customer quotes is a
web application accessed by the sales
team to gather information about their
sales performance sales insight is a
rest server that provides information
about sales to other applications like
customer quotes since the sales
information is confidential both
customer quotes and sales insight
require user authentication and
authorization to display information
first let's integrate customer quotes
with Oracle Identity cloud services
federated single sign-on with this
integration users can access
applications in the cloud with a single
login provided by Oracle Identity cloud
service
to perform the integration we first
register customer quotes as an
application
a client ID and client secret will be
issued these are the equivalent of a
credential that the client application
will use to authenticate itself against
Oracle Identity cloud service finally we
need to activate the application
now that the application is active we
need to update customer quotes with the
client ID secret and URL from Oracle
Identity cloud service the integration
is now complete let's launch the
application and login
after logging in notice that the user
information is data provided by Oracle
Identity cloud service due to single
sign-on users also have direct access to
their profile information now that the
customer quotes integration is complete
let's work on the sales inside
application a rest service that provides
information about sales to other
applications like customer quotes
customer quotes needs to gather data on
behalf of the logged in user from sales
insight while sales insight needs to
evaluate if the request from customer
quotes is legitimate with Oracle
Identity cloud service application and
scopes you can protect both applications
we need to register sales insight as an
application an Oracle Identity cloud
service this is performed in a similar
way as the customer quotes application
except this time we need to add the
allowed scopes for the resources
create one sculpt for each REST API call
supported by the sales insight service
as before you'll be issued a client ID
and client secret activate the
application to complete the process now
let's visit the customer quotes
application
and add the scopes from sales insight
now that the identity cloud service
configuration is complete we need to
update sales insight with the client ID
secret and URL from Oracle Identity
cloud service the integration is now
complete
so let's access the customer quotes
application after login click on urgent
quotes with this option customer quotes
needs to make a rest call to sales
insight Oracle Identity cloud service
receives an access token request from
customer quotes to access a sales
insight REST API on behalf of the
resource owner Oracle Identity cloud
service presents a consent request to
the user this time a user can allow
customer quotes to check their urgent
quotes after allowing consent Oracle
Identity cloud service returns an access
token the customer quotes passes along
with the rest call to sales insight
sales insight validates if the access
token is legitimate using a digital
signature provided by Oracle Identity
cloud service if it is it returns the
quotes to the customer quotes
application that displays the results to
the user with Oracle Identity cloud
service you can bring your applications
to the cloud using OAuth 2.0 and Open ID
Connect standards your applications
don't need user data since this data is
provided by Oracle Identity cloud
service during runtime to learn more
about these integrations you can
download the sales insight and customer
quotes applications from github and try
our tutorials you can also use the
applications as a template to create or
update your own thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
