for your interest in machine to machine
technology and Java well we come from
Germany from a company called Centurion
we're at gemalto company have been
acquired two years ago and i'm pretty
sure every one of you has a Gemalto
product in their pocket because Gemalto
does security solutions so we make for
instance the US passport the biometric
passport some security solutions like
banking cards NFC access control badges
SIM cards for instance in your phone and
we're from the business unit that deals
with machine to machine technology my
name is Manfred kuba or money and I'm
responsible for marketing at Centurion
and also doing business development for
em health and in mobile health care i'll
show you a couple of examples later
we're dealing a lot with java technology
because it can provide real benefits in
this space yeah my name is Florian I'm
working since 2000 in m2m we started as
demons company so we were part of
Siemens part of their communication
group and got spun off to be cinterion
at siemens was getting rid of all their
communication parts and later we were
now acquired by Gemalto as money set i'm
working in product and portfolio
management basically in the product
house where yeah our products are
created which is in berlin the
headquarter of cinterion is munich but
we have a true global footprint i would
say we have offices in the US we have a
lot of engineers also around the world
because the business we do is we don't
sell a product you can immediately take
out of the box and use its some sort of
component which will be integrated in
machines in any type of other products
and that's why we need a strong support
a strong technical team which supports
Hamas which usually come from specific
vertical industries and which for
example have some machinery they want to
monitor or automotive applications
metering a heads as money said so
there's a broad variety so when I start
with what is m2m m2m is basically making
any acid which is inaccessible
accessible so you connect the asset
using cellular communication to your
business center to some sort of off of
back-end system and therefore make it
part of the business process make it
manageable and have have a better
insight in what's happening with these
parts which were formerly inaccessible
so what we sell what we produce what we
developed are these modules which are
integrated into these assets so
basically there's a picture down there
it's a very small component it is there
are some some chips inside but it's it's
it's almost like a chip its surface
mount today so it looks like a component
it's very very small and it basically
has the functionality of a mobile phone
so it can connect it can do even a voice
call if needed but the the main usage is
to connect it into data networks so to
use something like GP is hsdpa something
like that some data standards to connect
right into the internet and as I said
it's integrated in a machine and it's
also an encapsulated unit which is type
approved so the approval process of a
device which which is transmitting
wirelessly is can often be very
difficult so since this product is
already approved them typically when the
final device is created so the vending
machine or something then you only need
to do a Dell
prove us all so it's it's basically all
packed into one form factor maybe
something to add quickly to the last
sound you notice it's really small what
we do in terms of modules but we don't
only do modules we also supply what we
call mins which are SIM cards for m2m
you know those little chips that go into
the mobile phone and also the service is
on the back end side and across this
whole value chain of m2m we implement
Java so we've been active in Java card I
think since the very beginning since
1995 even which powers those small
machine identity modules or means and of
course our service solution or service
enablement platform on the back end also
runs java but today we focus very much
on the module part that go into
different machinery and the devices yeah
so here you can see basically a short
history of cellular machine-to-machine
communication it started in nineteen
ninety-five which is not that long ago
and at that time it was basically not
even an IP based data connection it was
SMS or some sort of analog modem
functionality you had to use that made
it of course very difficult to terminate
the data at a back end because you had
to translate it somehow and handling of
SMS is very difficult so so it really
started in 2001 2003 when packet
switched data was introduced to the
mobile standard mobile communication
standard and in 2003 we introduced the
first module which then also featured
Java functionality so basically you have
a java virtual machine on the module it
sits on the processor which is in the
module to do tasks like the cellular
communication function and since these
processors come from mobile phones they
usually also host an mm I some sort of
graphics system some sort of phone menu
type of
and even the Java applications you know
from the phones base so since these
processes are designed more powerful we
can now use this to to run applications
on there but since we are embedded in a
machine we don't really need a display
or we don't need to download the
wallpaper I have things which you're you
know from mobile phone so so we are
using this resources this processing
resources through java to to to have
application parts or whole application
hosted on the module and therefore make
the applications Lena so this was also
the reason why we did it in 2003 to to
put Java on there the goal was to
replace microcontrollers which are
typically in these m2m application
present they drive basically the module
as a modem and by putting Java on the
module we can throw them out and the
module drives itself as to say today
with the 5th generation of m2m Java this
focus shifted a little bit I think it's
still very true that we want to replace
a microcontroller that we want to make
applications Lena but in addition we
have or we have seen an involvement of
the whole mtm application ecosystem and
to end chain and that means that there
are much more tasks to do and much more
use cases for java for for this yeah for
this type of new challenges which we
will
in the next slides and Floria maybe one
thing we should add here is obviously
all you guys you all know the slogan
Java write once run anywhere but here
it's also more like write once run any
time because actually the code that he
created for our very first Java module
in 2003 you can still execute now well
five hardware generations later today
right so that's cool break okay so here
an overview about a module so as I said
it looks like a component the back side
you see there are some some pets where
you solder it in so it's an LG a
mounting that is basically as a as a
chip almost mounted so you have it
through a through a soldering bass and
then it's it's stuck to the application
there are also modules which come with a
connector which you can just snap in but
due to economy of scale and with high
volume application the surface mount
really proved to be the best way to have
to have these module designed so aside
from the connectivity part which can
also consist of GPS or so we have some
modules which are also equipped with a
GPS receiver which you can then use of
course also for applications and there
are the processing capabilities I talked
about so you have MIPS you have memory
you have a file system which is also
handy and of course you have some some
ways of remotely update your
applications which reside on the module
and of course you have all the
development towards you need to create
applications on the module so if the
module then is let's say the the core
part of the application of course then
you need interfaces you want to connect
peripherals to the module so therefore
we have a broad range of interfaces
which then can be accessed through java
and where you can drive peripherals and
attached peripherals maybe one thing to
add here would be that our mission is
really to take this consumer technology
from mobile phones and really make it
reliable
for m2m industrial applications so
that's what we call our m2m stack the
comprises of the different interfaces
for instance that florence has mentioned
then we have make it reliable and
suitable for industrial use I think the
main difference is with an m2m
application you have no user which can
reset or which can do some sort of
adjustments while the module is running
when the module is running it's in the
field that somewhere out there and there
is nobody really to do any modifications
but of course as we will see later since
you can access the module now today with
Java they are some some ways also of
course to to adjust this exactly so
there's no one there to take the battery
out I don't know if your mobile phone
freezes you just can't do that in every
way so the application itself is usually
some sort of box some sort of PCB which
contains the module which might contain
the microcontroller which can also
contain some specific measurement
circuitry sends us peripherals of course
you need an antenna you need the sim
card or the MIM which is a ruggedized
machine solderable SIM card and of
course a power supply and this then goes
as I said as one box or a PCB into the
application if you have it into heavy
machinery like that you probably have it
and captured in a box somewhere where
it's maybe not too hot and it's a little
bit protected and yeah then you have
your device basically connected if you
use Java then you can reduce some
components you can reduce the
microcontroller but the application
structure itself stays basically as it
is so if we then look at the m2m
solution you have this device and this
device is embedded into the vertical
application then you have maybe GPS some
satellites around you have the cellular
network and you have some sort of
back-end where you report the data to
and what you transmit is you have some
user data of course some payload but of
course you also have some management
data
we have to basically to data passes you
you transmit if we look at the life
cycle of an m2m application you have two
phases you have the integration phase
and you have the deployment phase the
interesting part is probably that the
deployment phase can last up to 15 years
so you have quite some time this device
out there so if you if you are in the
integration phase you better think very
carefully what you want to do what you
want to implement what kind of
flexibility you want to put into this
device because this device yeah might
need to be changed maybe you will rent
this device out to someone else maybe
the machinery you once acquired and used
exclusively for your business at some
day you want to rent it out when you
don't use it things like that so so so
the key here is to really make sure to
have a have a very flexible design and
well thought through design and of
course you also want to shorten the
integration time you don't want to wait
too long until your expensive machinery
is equipped and then put into the field
the product life cycles are much longer
obviously than from a typical mobile
cellular phone business yeah that of
course is also reflected in the
technology you have to use it has to be
a very robust rugged technology so in
the integration phase I think the
benefits from Java are that you have of
course the development tools that you
have a lot of functionalities which are
already there which are proven which you
can use and basically you also of course
have some sort of better open
architecture structure where you can
also work very easy together with a lot
of Engineers on the application and
since this one is out for so long it's
also easier to maintain the code over
over the long time during the deployment
phase and in the life cycle management I
think what's important there and of
course this also has to be considered
when you do the integration is that you
want to be
be able to access the application that
you want to do maybe some optimization
you also may be want to do the agnostics
this could be maybe some part of the
device itself you want to see maybe if
you get over temperature if your device
ages maybe too fast and you can make the
15 years or if you have a battery driven
devices and there are some devices which
really are designed to be there for five
to ten years then you really have to
look at your battery budget for example
so you have to maybe look at your
application itself you have to of course
transmit the data where the use case is
built up from so maybe some data usage
data of your machinery and then you also
want maybe to have some information of
the cellular network you want to see
okay is there coverage can I do certain
operations now or is this machine not
may be reachable maybe you have some
sort of tracking device which is
connected to some sort of good and the
good is somewhere deep in some sort of
storage and then you don't have cellular
connectivity so you want to think about
these things and be able to to adjust
these and for example prevent that the
application tries to connect to the
network all the time that you want to
maybe say okay I know from the use case
that this device will now rest for two
weeks in a container so don't bother go
to sleep save battery and then in two
weeks you can look again at the network
and it doesn't work then next days also
all these kind of things are needed to
to to have a very lean and optimized
application so in terms of requirements
if we look at these different phases as
I said you want to have some some
specific tools you can use which may be
are also available for a long time some
code which you can maintain if you want
to change something you want to use
building blocks you want to have
something where there's a developer
community so you
and pull in more people or you can can
somehow also benefit may be from
synergies you can get there and of
course you want to create a structure
which is easy to understand and where
you can really work with different
people on there for the deployment phase
I think basically what you have a life
cycle requirements so you have to be
able to do the optimization as I said
you want to do the extensions you want
to have new news cases maybe of the
whole application and you also maybe
want to to reassign so here the key is
basically not to set things to static so
you can you can have a nice long yaar
deployment phase without pulling pulling
the machine back in if we compare m2m
applications how they used to be and how
they are today in terms of requirements
I think the first n2m applications the
one we have seen on the left side on the
history timeline which used as a mess
for example or even packet data what
they did is they basically had a data
ping of some sort of data they have to
report and they had this data ping at a
specific hour every day 24 hours 7 days
a week 365 days a year for 15 years so
completely set once thrown somewhere in
the field and then it was like a
constant ping you receive on one
specific address and that's it and that
of course is completely different from
the requirements you have today today
you want to have maybe a network of data
sources you manage you have different
sensors attached maybe you need to
calibrate some sense or maybe you attach
a new sensor to some application if you
do maintenance but then of course you
want to do the software update remote or
you want to yeah have some new business
rules and things like this and on the
other hand on the other side you have
different maybe areas where you report
to you have different
addresses maybe you have some payload
data which goes directly into some sort
of accounting system while you have some
diagnostic data which goes into an
operation center where people just look
how is the device performing and this
could be outsourced it could be a
complete different entity so so
basically you need a lot of flexibility
and you don't want to have a timer which
just sells to the device send data you
want to have like an interaction with
the device yeah maybe a good story to
tell here is that we know if a company
in Austria they deployed their m2m
solution a couple of years ago and they
are now facing a problem that everything
is very static so they had a very hard
coded behavior so there's an error here
on the left they even even had
hard-coded parameters of the way the
device connected to the network and now
they have the problem with the operator
that the operator actually changed those
dialing parameters and now they're
facing the issue that they have to get
all those devices in which is of
obviously very costly thing to do right
and so these days is the future yeah
what we see is a more and more scenarios
I think in the in the early days it was
a great thing to have a device reporting
data back I think that already was was
helping a lot of devices even though if
you can control it but if you really go
into more complex applications into
maybe also some bigger business cases
like some smart metering deployments and
things like this where a lot of things
depend on this yeah the smart grid for
example yesterday we could experience
how it was horrible the power outage
went so so so what is may be interesting
yesterday I was writing an email while
the power went out so first thing which
went out was alight I still had some
sort of internet access through wireless
LAN then I'd say 10 seconds I could send
out my email and send
seconds later this was also cut and then
I could switch to cellular and cellular
was working fine so so that also shows
that a lot of let's say benefits we can
offer are related to that you don't have
to set an upper Network you don't have
to set up a point-to-point connection if
you want to make your machine connected
you don't relay on some sort of wireless
router which maybe is used by some some
someone else or you have don't relate to
to to anything where where you have not
some sort of a secure connection which
in wirelessly is much easier to
establish you have a lot of ways also to
use even like secure channels and things
like that and where you have encryption
and where of course you can put on top
end to end communication and basically a
lot of applications where modules are
used you could also use wireless LAN but
often it's much too expensive to set up
the equipment if you have for example a
smoke detector or something you have to
set up a wireless LAN for this and
people try to get into that you maybe
change the wireless LAN the standard
changes a lot over time and if you just
use a cellular module you just plug it
there it doesn't use a lot of air time
so it's not expensive you get like
special m2m tariffs also from the
operator and then it basically reports
yeah maybe never hopefully any data
maybe some management data that it's
still there or that the battery is ok
but basically it's a device you you just
put in and that's it and and that's a
lot where the success of the module
solution comes from it's not that you
really absolutely need wireless
technology lu laa technology it makes it
easier to maintain and makes it easier
to install ok so if we look further and
see ok how how is the module positioned
within these end-to-end change
then we see on the left side we have
what we call the etch the different
applications that can be anything it can
be a car it can be a vending machine
surveillance camera ye Health's
application machinery you name it like a
lot of different devices and somehow
they communicate through a module to the
enterprise on the other side which also
can be yeah can be a big server can be
several servers several different
entities are waiting for data and the
position of this module is basically in
the middle and it has to enable these
integration of the different vertical
applications and it if we use Java of
course everything goes through the
module everything is within the module
the data flows through the module so so
that makes it the logical let's say
place for for having these kind of hop
roll to control the application and also
to basically mediate between the edge
and the enterprise and if you put
additional some pre-processing or some
local business words on the and you can
also sort out the data you can also
bring the data and a much better format
to the to the backend and of course
since we are talking about cellular
communication you have of course a price
to pay for the data you transmit so if
you if you are able to do some smart
processing on the module if you maybe
compare values and if you see the value
hasn't changed and I don't report or
things like that if you agree on
specific words then you can make this
very lean and you can prevent the cloud
from from overload so it's really much
better communication control through
java right
exactly so so it's basically a
communication control you do so you you
offer to the backend a control and a
data link and you can put some sort of
intelligence to it and you can host any
protocol you want to use while talking
to the back end you can implement
end-to-end security if you want to you
can use a lot of things in between the
back end and the module and looking to
the vertical elements you can integrate
these you sometimes are confronted with
very exotic devices which which maybe
are not very smart which use very small
8-bit microcontroller and can only
report their data in a very specific way
and then you can take this you can
translate this you can even give some
sort of IP address to a sensor if you
want to you can make these idea so you
can identify these also you can really
help these very diverse and sometimes
very primitive devices to be really
viewed at the back end as as a
well-described element so together
really what you have is you have some
sort of bridge you have some sort of hop
where you basically make sure that that
whatever is out there can connect to the
back end so this was kind of the
introduction part and we want to go a
little bit more into detail are there
any questions maybe maybe you have some
questions related you have to to to m2m
to to something
okay that's like the physical layer 12
you have the software okay okay we will
add this we have a little bit more and
we will try to add this on top we don't
have a picture with a layer model but we
can just maybe feed that into the slides
any more questions concerning let's say
the basics of m2m
and peer-to-peer network since I guess
and I mean yes of course that's possible
but basically what's happen is you you
have the device and as soon as the data
exits the device and enters the cellular
tower in the internet so everything
which would be device to device
communication will be routed any way
through the internet so it's really
something like you have the big cloud
and it absorbs everything and of course
you can then reroute and you can of
course make the devices a line to each
other so if you have let's say a network
of sensors and you want to maybe have
some sort of load balancing also or you
want to say okay I'm I measure for now a
little bit you go to sleep because your
battery is down you know if you have
some sort of redundancy or something
where you have synergies between
deployed devices and of course you can
send let's say some sort of alignment
between these devices but usually you
access the device through the back end
you always have of course the capability
which is interesting also to use an SMS
or so and there is one big problem in
m2m and it will be solved with ipv6
which is to find the device in the field
because the IP address is assigned
dynamically so basically you have to
tell where you are and then you can
establish the link and for that today
often an SMS is used to just initiate
something or to have let's say if you if
you tie them in the application if you
do the first time setup then you have
usually some sort of SMS setting
everything and then you keep some sort
of phone book or some sort of mechanism
and so so the nature really is that you
you throw your data into the internet
and and have it routed and then you
would relay it to to the other device
and of course maybe to add here and of
course there are lots of panic benefits
as well because you don't have to worry
about the pairing of the devices are
they in reach but in general if you want
to do short range we definitely offer
the interfaces so you can connect a
short-range radio like Bluetooth
Bluetooth Low Energy or smart or seek
the things like that you know we can
shoulders with the architecture later
where you can see where this would come
to okay
yes
I I think there will be there will
probably be some sort of data available
for the devices which which pic it this
data up or you can use specific like
existing things like whether or
something you know if you because you
can use all Internet protocols with the
devices we can I think we can use HTTP
HTTPS we can use a lot of things so so
you could basically program your module
even to go to a website or to go some
sort of API which was offered and then
get out for example temperature so it
could be for let's say a battery deploy
device if it wants to have a weather
forecast and CEO it gets very cold that
is hard on the battery then of course
the device could look for the weather
report and then say ok I do my data
sending now and I'm gonna go to you have
to hibernate through the winter through
the gold or whatever I mean this is a
just a maybe an awkward example but yes
this could be possible so so I think in
the future what you will have this
device will and as it may be has to talk
to different entities it has to some
sort of subscribe maybe also to to data
feeds and it also has and it's also
maybe being subscribed by some sort of
so you maybe have again maybe you have
like some sort of whether a sentence or
station or something of course you can
subscribe to that you can say ok I can
give this information I have some
specific sensors which matter some
humidity or something very difficult and
then you can of course offer this to
like some some Institute's or low and
then they get access you have some sort
of way to to subscribe to this and and
it could be also the other way around
there a lot of possibilities I think and
that's the interesting thing you see a
lot of different m10 devices you see
some which are very let's say not so
smart we could just send out an SMS or
something or have this ping or you sees
you you could really leverage a lot of
things to optimize the device and since
you're talking about a very long
lifecycle everything every additional
information might be good might be
valuable and with this really flexible
opportunities all these various
opportunities out there i think java
really gives us the flexibility to well
cater to this well plethora of
applications for the internet of things
really okay any more questions okay then
we continue with the second part where
we talk more about the architecture and
the building blocks and then maybe we
can also talk a little bit about the
layers I let you do that already here so
so basically what we have was in an m2m
design is we have some sort of vertical
part as I said which can be very
different it can be anything it can be a
sensor if we have our smoke detectors
maybe really one sensor or a glass
breaking sensor which really is just a
high or low or it can be really a can
bus from a car or something where
there's a lot of the agnostic
information or it can be some sort of
metering interface so the variety is
very big and together with the module
this is the device deployed in the field
and you see two designs basically one is
where everything is integrated into a
PCB or where let's say the design of the
device is is some sort of integrated
device you have one pc be somewhere sits
the module somewhere
is the vertical part of the application
maybe some sensors are attached to this
and I wired somewhere else but it's a
it's a really through and through
designed device and the the other
possibility is you have some sort of
gateway so it's usually a box which has
interfaces so you can have let's say
even a short-range interface you can
have a zigbee interface on there or you
have serial interface or like like an
industrial ours 84 or 85 or something
yes very symmetrical a serial interface
any type of interfaces and on this
interface then you can connect with with
any devices so this is the more let's
say plug-and-play approach while the
other one is really designed soldered
everything on one pc and yeah the
back-end system can be can be anything I
think it's very different they are
approaches or very complex it could be
owned by one by some one only or you
have a multi-party setup and within the
setup you can have different roles so
it's a quiet can be quite diverse and to
look at the characteristics what you
basically have is on the vertical part
you always have something very
proprietary very vertical focus which is
really represents the core idea of the
device so a meter or or a vending
machine or something like that and the
part you add to the device is basically
just a different way to get some
information out of the device so you are
always confronted maybe not always but
very often with an existing environment
where you are kind of like entering as
some sort of alien technology and you
have to be integrated in this one and
they are often specific development
processes
scientists so if you look for example at
automotives they have a very specific
development cycle they have a lot of
testing a very long phase of preparing
the applications to run through a lot of
quality test so you have to start very
early but it can take like two years and
then the application is rolled out and
then you want in another like additional
ten years maybe a few deployment so that
can be sometimes very challenging and
that petitioning also makes a lot of
sense for us because we are not the
experts in health care all the experts
in tracking and tracing but we're
definitely the experts in communication
and yeah this is where I think this is a
great partitioning of in terms of
architecture yeah that you have this
vertical specific part and then the
people developing the actual application
they don't have to worry also about the
connectivity part because we can provide
those building blocks yeah so so the
module then is basically the
non-proprietary element at this one
that's why we chose Java we don't want
to then introduce some some proprietary
way of managing it or something we have
to find some sort of exit point out of
the ER forest or out of the ocean where
something when you surface where it has
to be some sort of standardized
non-proprietary understandable and this
is basically the module and you have
scalability there in terms of
communication so you can decide what you
want to do we want to have the 2g or 3G
communication
maybe LTE later when once it still
deployed and of course as so shown
before you have processing capabilities
as the base for for this and on the back
end side I think you are there are a lot
of solutions i think for health for
Health's there are some some very
defined and good described solutions
that's very easy to connect to in other
verticals they aren't really so let's
say well prepared or standardized ways
of dealing with the data and off of
interfacing I think there's currently
also a standardization activity going on
which is called one m2m where this is
dealt with on an on a more generic level
that doesn't go very deep in the
verticals but it wants to describe in
general the way how to access backends
how to have roles how to indicate
capabilities of devices and things so it
will introduce like a service layer
that's sort of in between and that's
more or less here standardization in the
communication
big about it that the service layer that
is specified by one aim to him yeah its
basics it's you fluent you could
interface yeah yeah you could call it a
middleware you could call it a middle
way about it said I mean what you need
you have on one side you have existing
systems databases ERP systems which are
working and somehow maybe you enter in a
very vertical specific way for example
for Health's money what kind of data do
we have we have a very specific format
exactly I'm going to talk about this
later with my use case but they have
stand there's a standardization
organization or industry industrial or
association that deals with defining
standards for the communication and for
our part they are dealing with the one
interface so this is a good example of
where the communication over the data
formats is actually standardized but
there are a lot of examples out there in
the m2m world where you're very specific
solutions then you need the flexibility
to adapt to the different while
communication partners yes so so if
maybe now to the device itself one slide
I mean it's it's an illustration it
tries to show the the elements I don't
know if we can put the layers on top of
here let's try so so so what you
basically have is here an example for an
integrated device where you just throw
everything on a PCB where you have some
sort of exotic measurement circuit a
black box you can generalize which is
non generic which is proprietary we
don't really know how it works probably
exactly you know some sort of output
then you have some processing may be off
this data but you also have a business
rule or some logic a link to that and
then you have the connectivity part
which is the module here
and you of course need the sim card and
antenna and some power supply if you use
Java you can reduce this so you
basically interface with this vertical
specific part into the ER directly in
Java through through the interfaces of
the module so and if you what or if you
if you would see the the the the
structure of the module or if you want
to view this from a layout a approach
then you have some sort of communication
layer some sort of layer which takes
care of the whole cellular communication
part which is basically to to the
application some sort of shielded of you
you have you have some sort of control
interface to this where you can say make
a call for example sent an SMS open up a
data connection or give me the network
string something like this but it's a
it's a layer which you can't reach which
really is taking care only of the
communication capabilities and this is
also an approval relevant layer this is
a very complex software which has has I
don't know million lines of code and is
is really tested is really if you do any
changes in this software you have to do
a complete test of the whole
communication functionality you have to
do it even under different temperature
ranges and things like this so it's a
very difficult and tricky part I would
say not the nicest type of code
structure probably and a very complex
thing and you have an access to this
rule API so an interface which is today
AT commands which someone maybe remember
it's so it's not really an API on
functional interface but this is how you
can control it and of course you can
also control it differently but the
broadest axis is through these AT
commands and then you have another layer
on top where the Java resides and the
Java is completely shielded off from
that it has these control lines or in
their faces present in the Java
environment but you use these just if
you want to trigger cellular
functionality and on top you can put
your application and you can application
can first of all has nothing maybe to do
with the communication part it just
checks the sense or do some comparison
calculates a little bit and at some
point the application says okay now I
want to send this up so then it it gives
the command to the module it fits the
data into a specific interface and then
this goes to the back end so it's really
you have some sort of two layered system
I mean you could also cut it down but
the further but the basic idea is the
communication part is shielded off and
the driver part can control this
communication part and on top can do
anything you you can do with a regular
Java so any application everything you
want to do if you want to light some
LEDs or or do do anything on top you can
do that and without even using the
cellular bounty yes n.e it's emmie it's
it's it's the emmys redox to embedded
which was launched I think like the day
before yesterday or something so so it's
it's an Emmy Java and it's also headless
so you don't use all the the parts yes
exactly co DC series so we on top of
that underlying layer which we call the
baseband and license from big companies
like Qualcomm or Intel for instance
there we license on top of that the
official Oracle virtual machine for java
hotspot implementation and it's actually
I am PNG or used to be and and we are
driving that jsr since its inception in
2003 which is really focused on those
low processing power devices for interim
like our modules and maybe in terms of
perspective outlook so we are using a me
because we are very similar to a mobile
phone in terms of processing
capabilities and architecture that make
sense but on the other hand we are
different from a mobile phone we don't
have the display and everything so the
the idea when we start at the EMP mg in
2003 is to take everything away you
don't need and also DUI ya make it very
lean and what we are now doing is now we
are adding specific trace ours
functionalities and this process is just
started and I think in the end you will
see probably some sort of m2m Java which
then will contain everything you need
you know you need maybe the location API
maybe a little bit different you need
some sort of visual sensor security Jays
are 177 but maybe that will also change
a little bit or you you combine it so so
what's happening is and this is being
kicked off let's say to a tour to a next
level and also if you look at the
development of Java towards me8 or Java
aids however it is caught later and it's
it'll be a way to understand the
vertical industries to understand m2m
better and to add this functionality so
I think what where we are now is we have
done the first generation of Java in m2m
we have extended it in terms of
performance
and what will happen next is now 22 also
use the stronger processing power we
have we started with an arm seven in two
thousand no we started with a sea 166
microcontroller I don't know if anybody
knows this one it's a specific siemens
microcontroller very small not very
powerful was the microcontroller i think
of the first mobile phones gsm 444
siemens belongs to intel today because
they bought infineon which was spun spun
off from siemens and this is really
something i don't know comparable it's
it's it's half of an arm seven i would
say so it's really not a lot so we
started with less with that one with
java then we move to arm seven we moved
to arm nine today we are at army level
it with LTE we will be a step up and of
course that aligns very well with the
development of Java which is the pass
towards eight towards more
functionalities and then maybe we will
also see some some some other
implementations in the future okay so
now again we have the elements we have
the device we have the back end we have
Java in the middle we connect to to the
vertical part we connect to the back end
we try to establish some sort of
management link aside from the
communication and if we map this now to
functional blocks with within this and
m2m device then we will we see that we
have on the left side we have the very
specific vertical circuitry which will
ever be there which is completely
determined by the use case by vertical
which at some point maybe becomes more
virtual the more resources we can give
the more a drivers live Ariz we maybe
have four sensors we can push that
further and further let
say towards a very very very very
generic implementation a non-generic
implementation and pull as much generic
parts out as we can this will be a
process but in the end it will be a
specific sense or something which you
have to connect to then we have some
sort of vertical logic some business
rules we have maybe some some some some
processing to delay we have to decide we
have to say okay now i want to send data
or now i want to compare two values or
now i want to go into sleep mode things
like that then we have back-end
interworking so i have to somehow have
some sort of mechanisms to connect to
the server to speak a specific language
to the server to have some sort of
protocol implemented then we have the
communication control this is the
channel I set which is the pipe into the
cellular protocol stack into the
cellular part so that's where I decide
what kind of commands I give to the to
the wireless part of the module what I
want to do do I want to send an SMS
probably not better data connection so
this also has to has to be some sort of
off block within the application then we
have the pure communication
functionality which will always be in
capsule in the module which will always
be some sort of sealed in approved and
never touched again afterwards and then
we have the back end and there yeah it
can be anything as I said it can be a
lot of things and this example shows
that how it will or how it's typically
done with a microcontroller
microcontrollers used are like these
small atmel takes us something like that
usually I don't know C code or whatever
sense to to program these so this is how
it would look like if you have the
module just used as a modem if we
introduce Java into this then basically
we can have everything which is related
to processing maybe or
at least everything which is related to
decisions to settings of the application
and to connectivity to the application
protocols and so on of course the
communication control and communication
functionality is there any ways we can
have everything in Java so it's
accessible it's it's not buried in the
microcontroller so the rule to send the
data at 12 the everyday noon up in this
picture would be somewhere in the
microcontroller the microcontroller
connects to the module and yeah you can
connect to the microcontroller probably
manually to some sort of plaque or so
but usually it's very difficult to go
through the module onto the
microcontroller because you don't use
any logic any processing capabilities of
the module so with this one you have
everything on a java layer accessible
and therefore you can change it you can
adjust it and you can really do your
life cycle management you can you can
deploy applications change them in the
field everything we talked about before
so it really becomes a back-end oriented
architecture by having this shift and of
course you skip the microcontroller so
it becomes a little bit more cost
efficient and if you if you can skip the
microcontroller so so that is basically
the idea how it is done in some
applications today and I'm sure in the
future it will it will be a yeah a lot
more fun this way because it makes sense
it is it is else you have something
which you can't really access you can
change and it sends data to you there
are also some examples for metering
where some metering applications were
also set to a specific time to send the
data and it was done in every device the
same so 12 o'clock so then you have like
twelve o'clock maybe once a month you
have like a New Year's you know
everybody they call it God's home or
once
talk network breaks down and the
operator is very unhappy so the trend
really is to keep this flexible and
maybe over time you want to change the
operate and the future you maybe can do
this with these devices or you want to
change tariffs within one Operator and
then of course you can adjust and you
can also of course talk to the operator
and say hey if I would send my data at
4am do you give me a better price your
network is silent anyways and I don't
interfere with your let's say other and
maybe where they where they make more
money with talks or with all the the
iphones also on so this this is a way
really to to prepare this also
commercially to have have head room to
negotiate who have had room also to to
make the business case may be a little
bit better over time or more flexible so
as I said you have in these different
building blocks you have some sort of
functionalities and these are just some
examples so as I said you can have
thresholds in the business logic you can
do the pre-processing you can have alert
things like that for the backend
interworking you can add a protocol if
you want to you can make a very
optimized maybe then data transfer or
you have some sort of back end which is
maybe expecting something nicely
structured than you do that you can add
some security of course and for the
communication control of course the
scheduling as I said is very important
becomes more and more important the
bigger the fleet is you deploy the the
easier it is for you to harm the network
and yeah you want to have maybe also the
connection managed a little bit better
maybe you want to have some way of
making the device accessible even you
you're using some sort of ipv4 or
something where you can see the device
directly then you can implement some
mechanisms that it acts like a device
which which can be accessed directly or
it can even act like you can access the
pure sense of the device and it has ten
sensors so everything you can do there
with the connection management so here
Java also helps us because there's lots
of libraries out there available ready
to use for developers like for instance
if you want you to implement web sockets
here there's implementations out there
that you could use and put into your
application so now the quick example I
think there are five more minutes okay
so this is a great example I think where
we can really show the benefits of Java
as we could implement them in this
demonstrator that we put together with
the great folks from Oracle for instance
and other members of the continued
health alliance what is the continued
health alliance the continued health
alliance is industry organization where
we work together with more than 200
member companies to establish a
standardized way of communicating
between the medical devices and the
backends so the continua defines or
rather not defines well recommends
standards to be used and for us the one
interface is very interesting so what
we've did is we've taken off the shelf
indeed blood pressure cuff that I have
up here for instance it's so far
previously it was it only had bluetooth
connectivity and there were a lot of
challenges with that so it had to be
paired with a mobile phone for instance
yeah and with the pairing breaks the
person who's using that is probably not
capable of well reestablishing their
connection but what we did is we
actually this is for the demo a great
def kit that we have available for a
developer community
attached it to the device and what
happens now it is actually that it takes
the data from the device there were no
modifications necessary on the actual
device which is very important for the
approvals also in the medical space that
we take the data put it into the Java
Modi on the Java module then translates
it into this industry standard format
defined by continue and sends it off
across the cellular network to a
back-end server which Prince is provided
by the Oracle or orange mobile network
operator Harmon and this space and the
benefits and we should probably move to
the next slide really that was we could
leverage the continue our ecosystem like
it was a great example of how those
partners got together and we could
really very very quickly it was a matter
of a couple of days really where we put
this together in Java and could really
implement the solution in a very
efficient way and as I said without any
changes to the basic blood pressure
meter because in here is also a good
example of what fluorine has explained
before it's a very low power
microprocessor can't do much the micro
processing there wouldn't be capable of
performing all those tasks what are
necessary to actually convert the data
into the standards compliant format see
we have to cut it off yeah and of course
the flexibility because we can adapt to
different devices we put it on a wide
scale we put it in other machines and
for patients it's really plug in place
so those devices can be configured you
switch them on they work outside the box
you know you don't need to do any setup
no pairing with Bluetooth devices it
just works and of course what can be
done then later on is leverage all the
benefits that Florian has explained
before that you can do device management
with those devices
and the remote provisioning okay I
things we have to stop here so we skip
the other example exactly so yeah we
will be outside so so anyone who wants
to discuss a little further about m2m
it's very welcome to do so thanks a lot
for listening thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
