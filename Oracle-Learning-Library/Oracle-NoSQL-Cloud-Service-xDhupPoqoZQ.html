sizes storing this variety of data so
you can access it quickly at just the
right moment can bring a competitive
edge needed for your business to succeed
pork will know sequel database cloud
service is a cost-effective easy-to-use
service for storing a variety of simple
data where access needs lightning-fast
performance to enable time-sensitive
application workloads application
workloads such as consumer profiling
time series data analysis risk or fraud
detection and more by pairing the scale
out capabilities of the Oracle cloud
with a scale-out architecture of Oracle
no sequel database you can start small
and grow without bounds while delivering
extreme performance and always-on
operations oracle no sequel database
cloud service gives you automated
services you get complete control of
database cluster with one-click services
like cluster expansion and rebalancing
patching and upgrades and application
recovery you get Oracle integration
access beyond native no sequel API is
using sequel from Oracle database where
you can combine sequel and no sequel
data into a single result set
integration with other Oracle
technologies like spatial and graph
coherence wallet and more you get
flexible schema support the ability to
model and store data and application
align types including key value tables
and json the ability to define and
evolve schema dynamically at runtime as
well as agile development and continuous
deployment you get predictable
performance scale performance linearly
through horizontal partitioning that
leverages built-in load balancing
parallel operations and value-based
secondary indexing easily build a new
generation of cloud-based applications
first sign up for Oracle no sequel
database cloud service then add an
Oracle cloud compute service covering
your ideal development stack like Java
or no
use a drop-down selection in your
services portal to create a service
association with your Oracle no sequel
database cloud service access localized
environment variables to bind a no
sequel cluster connection and perform
database related operations get
developer flexibility with a variety of
programming interfaces and a powerful
database capability and a fully
functional low-cost easy to use service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
