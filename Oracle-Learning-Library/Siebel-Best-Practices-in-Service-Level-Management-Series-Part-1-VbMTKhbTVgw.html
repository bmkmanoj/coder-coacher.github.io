cloud control 12 seed emissaries
focusing on the best practices for
Siebel application management this
screen watch is part of our series on
service level management or slm for
civil applications the purpose of this
series is to highlight the
out-of-the-box capabilities and benefits
of enterprise media 12c for service
level management and administration
foreseeable applications service level
management or slm is a key tool in the
proactive management of civil
applications the benefits of slm are
that administrator can utilize
representative civil transactions which
are constantly and automatically running
behind the scenes to verify that all of
the key application and technology
components of a civil applications are
available and performing to expectations
a single transition can verify the
availability and performance of a
multiple civil servers and components in
a much more efficient manner than by
monitoring the same underlying targets
individually our use keys today we'll
use the Siebel sales application where
we were login navigate to the context
view update the record and then log out
as you will see this transition exposes
availability and performance metrics of
a multiple zebra servers multiple
components and component groups and the
Sibyl database in a single unified
manner we can the monitor and manage
these transitions like any other target
in ian's topsy including placing
proactive orders on them if the
transition is either unavailable or is
not performing to require the levels slm
touches on a number of different areas
in enterprise media club control and for
that reason we are covering this topic
in three distinct screen watches as
follows the first screen watch entitled
record is the topic for today it covers
recording a simple transaction using an
end
major tool called open script open
script is the key scripting tool that
comes with Oracle's application testing
suite the second screen watch entitled
modeling covers the process of creating
a service test with an enterprising
major club control using the open screen
recording and executing in a recurring
manner in this screen watch we'll cover
how to upload the open screen into
enterprise major cloud control how does
it the frequency of the execution of the
test how to set performance and new CD
matrix and the location of the test
execution the last screen watch entitle
manage covers all of the monitoring and
management aspects of the service test
once it is executing will cover how to
create a service level agreement as well
as how to measure after performance
against the baseline so let's get
started with a demo to start open screen
select open screen from start menu this
demo will show you how to create a load
test project and recording a synthetic
transaction we will use the recording
capabilities of open screen to record
page navigations and generate the Java
code for the synthetic transaction to
create a load test project whistling new
from the file menu then select Siebel
under the load testing folder as you can
see from this visitor open script has
auto box menu for other applications
besides able such as Oracle e-business
suite or confusion application on oracle
JD edwards therefore if you want to run
load testing for this oracle application
you can certainly use open screen now
click Next and neymar scrib as civil
load test click finish to record all see
below testing also click record button
on the screen menu open screen will
automatically launch is the default
browser and open script tool bar as well
once the browser opens enter your civil
application URL in this example also
taxable sales shortcut
then press enter now I log into system
as set me and once the system being
launched we will see my civil sales home
page for our testing demo arm i'll
select contacts view and click my
context view i'll choose baxter can s my
content and let's change his mobile
number so update his mobile number to
your number and step out of the record
to commit our transaction after reaching
the record i will return to the home
page and i will log out of the system
since we are done with a simple
transaction will stop the recording this
completes our civil synthetic
transaction once we stop our recording
we can view the information about
synthetic transaction by reviewing the
nose in this view the wrong note
contains the navigations that are
recorded to the synthetic transaction to
playback on open screen you can click
the play button on the screen menu the
navigations and actions in the synthetic
transition will be played back in the
order recorded this screen shows the
result of our playback the bottom tip
will show the result of each transaction
is shown saturation and response time of
particular transaction if you want to
see the screenshot of particular
transaction you can select screenshot on
right panel for example if you click
this transaction on the Left panel this
shows my screenshot on the right panel
and if you scroll down and click these
transactions the left panel using my
context view on the right panel once you
are satisfied with the recording and
confident of capture the transaction we
can save our synthetic transaction
and in order to save this grave let's go
to file and select save as and you can
type your screen name or choose the one
that you already selected and click OK
and we also need to export this indebted
transition to zip file and use this file
to upload to enterprise menu call
control later to export the file go to
file and export scrip and select the
path that you want to export the file as
you can see from this demo open scrip is
very easy to use because it has a visual
scripting interface also open script has
developed a civil accelerator which can
facilitates the simple specific
transaction which enterprise major
called control being catalyzed as in
daily transaction lastly open scrip has
tight integration with enterprise
medical control Enterprise Cloud Control
can monitor and make the services that
are created by open screen so our next
step in service level management process
is to upload this script to enterprise
media control and our next series will
cover the creation of a civil
engineering service test this concludes
our first series of civil best practices
on service level management thank you
for more information on this topic as
well as other enterprise medical control
12c please feeling specified in this
screen thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
