so the first step in creating our Oracle
event processing sour-sweet edn for
detection application is to provide the
application name followed by the project
name which is part of IP suite and then
we leave the default names for the java
packages and the run time now we have a
clear canvas onto which to paint a local
event processing for detection
application firstly we will use and drag
onto the canvas
EDM inbound adapter which allows to
automatically connect to the event
delivery network form solar suite we
will give the name of adapter as a
default configuration name and now we
will specify in the wizard the
parameters that we need for this edn
connectivity here we are defining and
accessing the EDL the event definition
language which specifies the event types
which will be use in this application
and now we can specify the specific
event type that will be used by this EDN
inbound adapter and finally we're going
to associate the schema of these event
types the IDE will now create for us
automatically the Java source artifacts
needed to do the Java binding necessary
to the EDM and here we can see those
artifacts automatically created next
we're going to define a channel an input
channel we will give the name to this
input channel as the EDM input channel
remembering to provide capitalization
where necessary
once the channel has been defined we can
connect the adapter to the channel and
then on the properties for an input a
channel we can see the event types that
are available for us to use and we will
select the required event type for this
channel next we need a processor which
will analyze the event patterns for for
detection as part of our application we
will call this the edn processor and
within the processor node which is our
meta container for our CQL at continuous
query language we will select here the
queries that we need to identify these
fraudulent patterns and you can study
these queries at your leisure
I will now include these sequel
statements as part of this processor
a good practice is to always save your
application during the construction
process to make sure that everything has
been built and saved correctly now we
can connect the channel the input
channel to the processor and add a new
channel a new outbound output channel
which we'll call the EDM output channel
you will connect the processor to that
outbound output channel and again for
the output channel we will see the list
of event types and we will select the
required event type for that channel
finally to communicate back to the edn
from this application we will use an e
DN outbound adapter and in the same way
with the inbound adapter we would define
specify the parameters that you need to
connect to d DN and in this situation as
we've already defined the schema for the
event types we will only point to the
EDL file that is needed for this
application with the event type
once we finish we will connect the in
the outbound output adapter to the
channel and we have now completed our
for detection application and we will
now rebuild the application to make sure
all the elements are tied together
nicely before we integrate without so a
suite and that edn in the runtime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
