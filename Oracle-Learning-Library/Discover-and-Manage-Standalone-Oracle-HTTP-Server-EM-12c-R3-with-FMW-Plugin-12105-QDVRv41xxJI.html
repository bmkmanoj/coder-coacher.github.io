cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to
discover standalone Oracle HTTP server
that is an Oracle HTTP server that is
not associated with an Oracle WebLogic
domain I will also show you how to
monitor and manage a standalone Oracle
HTTP server using Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c previously
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c provided only the ability to monitor
the status of stand-alone Oracle HTTP
server beginning with Fusion Middleware
plug-in released twelve 1:05 management
of standalone Oracle HTTP server has
been expanded to include the following
features improved discovery of
standalone Oracle HTTP server predefined
performance metrics spanning server
metrics such as active HTTP requests and
percentage of busy processes as well as
virtual host metrics such as request
processing time for a virtual host these
metrics are available from which
thresholds alert notifications and
performance history features can be
leveraged other new features include the
ability to view and correlate messages
from standalone oracle HTTP server
access and/or error log files automatic
daily collection of configuration data
including configuration files such as
HTTP decomp and my WL o HS Kampf
collection of such configuration data
enables analysis of the collected data
via comparison operations change
tracking and enterprise search another
new feature includes a predefined job to
stop start or restart stand-alone Oracle
HTTP server processes these capabilities
enable administrators to more easily add
standalone Oracle HTTP servers as
managed targets to Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c
as well as to more thoroughly monitor
and manage those targets
to begin this demonstration let's
navigate to the global setup menu in
order to initiate discovery of a
standalone Oracle HTTP server will click
on the add target menu followed by the
add targets manually menu then we'll
select the add targets using guided
process option from the target types
drop-down menu will select standalone
Oracle HTTP server remember that while
standalone Oracle HTTP server can be
added via this option an Oracle HTTP
server that is associated with a domain
what is often referred to as a managed
Oracle HTTP server is discovered
automatically when discovering a
WebLogic domain from the add standalone
oracle HTTP server page we must provide
details associated with the web server
first we must search for the host target
type on which the standalone Oracle HTTP
server is installed and running this
requires that an Oracle management agent
already be installed on that hosts
target machine
second we must provide a name for the
target this name must be unique in the
cloud control console for purposes of
this demonstration we will specify
standalone OHS 11 third we must provide
the Oracle home in which the web server
is installed and fourth we must provide
the absolute path to the directory in
which the web server configuration files
reside after providing such details we
can then add the target for centralized
management and monitoring for the
purposes of this demonstration I have
already discovered a standalone Oracle
HTTP server target so we will simply
navigate to that existing target after
standalone Oracle HTTP server is
discovered we can access its home page
via the middleware summary page from the
middleware summary page we can search
across all middle or targets for our
webserver targets name here we see the
Enterprise Manager is monitoring two
instances of standalone Oracle HTTP
server let's drill down into the first
one from the standalone Oracle HTTP
server home page we gain an overview of
the status and health of the web server
we can see if there are any outstanding
incidents or configuration changes for
the instance as well as to understand
the current performance of for example
the virtual hosts and modules from the
target menu we gain access to other
features such as a performance summary
page which allows us to obtain more
details on the performance of the
instance this page is completely
customizable we can add more metric
charts to the page via the metric
palette we can overlay another instance
data alongside this targets data or we
could overlay
has data with current data or we can
modify the timeframe for which data is
displayed other new features for
standalone oracle HTTP server management
includes the ability to start or stop or
restart the instance as well as the
ability to search and view log messages
for the instance in addition a new
feature for standalone oracle HTTP
server that's accessible from the target
menu is the ability to view
configuration data and analyze that
configuration data for the instance for
the purposes of this demonstration let's
drill down and view the history of
configuration changes for this instance
we see here that in the past seven days
there have been zero configuration
changes if we change the search fields
in order to view configuration changes
within let's say the last seven weeks we
can see that some changes were made on
October 8th let's take a closer look at
the first change history record here we
see that a change is made to the mod WL
OHS comp file let's drill down further
in order to determine the exact change
that was made to this file in the
history details page we see that this
passed change was to enable requests to
be proxied from the oracle HTTP server
to to manage servers in a web logic
cluster having such extensive
configuration data and analysis
capabilities at our fingertips enables
us to quickly identify configuration
changes that could have impacted our
applications and users so that concludes
this demonstration thanks for watching
how to use Oracle Enterprise Manager
cloud control 12c for discovering and
centrally managing
stand-alone Oracle HTTP server
