model from a table that was created from
a flat file now you can with data
modeler I'll start by creating a model
models are made up of dimension and fact
tables and joints dimension tables
describe the data attributes such as
customer name or customer marital status
fact tables contain measures such as
revenue or build units and joins show me
the relationships between fact and
dimension tables in the data models next
I'll review the table I want to use as a
basis for the new model it looks like
the table contains over five thousand
rows because this table contains both
attributes and measures I select the add
as fact and dimension tables option I
can design the tables myself or let data
modeler do the work for me I rename the
fact table and then preview a column to
see the contents I can add other
dimension tables too deleting a column
is easy I can right-click the column in
a table and select remove to add a
column I drag and drop it from the
source table pane or click Add column
next I review the suggested dimension
tables I can change the table names and
combine tables but to create reports I
have to join each dimension table to a
fact table data modeler has recommended
the joins for me if I deselect the
checkbox in the dimension table the join
is removed from the dimension table and
the corresponding column is deleted from
the fact table I pick a new column for
the two table joint
it looks like data modeler will create
five views one fact table for dimension
tables and four joins from the source
table next I'll make a few enhancements
I'll start by updating the revenue table
and making all of the columns available
for editing I can use customer number to
count my customers but the customer
dimension is joined to the fact table on
this column it's preferable to create a
joint on columns that don't have
aggregation methods because business
requirements change over time and the
meaning of the original aggregation
method could become ambiguous to
eliminate the likelihood of this
ambiguity I can use the copy option to
create a new column for customer number
and then add the aggregation method to
the new column I continue with my
updates by renaming the columns to make
them more user-friendly and then add
aggregation rules for the measures six
measures are defined and count distinct
is selected as the aggregation method
for the new customer number column I can
also update the column names in the
dimension tables to suit the needs of my
business next I review the model
including products and revenue and then
validate and publish it
the tables are now ready to use in
reports finally I create a visualization
that uses the data model first I pick a
subject area as the data source I use
the ctrl key to pick columns I want and
then drag them on to the canvas the
system selects the best visualization
type for the set of data elements that I
want to add to the canvas and
intuitively picks the best locations in
which to place them in this video I
showed you how to create a data model
from a flat file that contains one fact
and several dimension tables ad
aggregation rules - the metrics rename
columns and invalidate and publish the
