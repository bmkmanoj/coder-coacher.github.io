how to use virtual assembly builder
studio to deploy an assembly to an
oracle vm server pool this demonstration
assumes that the assembly archive has
been previously registered with the
server pool and is now ready for
deployment after launching studio locate
the deployments panel in the lower right
corner right-click the previously
registered HR appt assembly and select
deploy select a deployment plan to use
also map each virtual network in the
assembly to a network defined in Oracle
VM a new assembly instance is defined in
the deployer and the deployment process
is initiated you can select the instance
in studio to view its current deployment
state in the property inspector
similarly using the structured pane on
the left you can view the state of each
individual appliance in the assembly
this assembly consists of three
appliances the yellow icon indicates the
unda ployed state the HTTP server
appliance is in the staging state
meaning that its vm template is
currently being cloned by oracle vm
the state of the assembly and each
appliance is automatically refreshed on
a regular basis here you can see that
the first appliance has finished staging
and also that the weblogic admin server
appliance is now being staged all
appliances must be successfully staged
before the deployment can proceed to the
next phase
you
now that all appliances are staged each
enters the preparing phase in which the
VM is started and then reconfigured with
the network settings in your deployment
plan one appliance has already finished
these tasks and another is still in the
preparing process once again the
deployment will not proceed until all
appliances have been prepared
you
this is a good opportunity to monitor
the deployment process on the oracle vm
server pool itself login to the vm
manager console in this simple example
our pool only consists of a single
server so naturally all of our VMs will
be assigned to it
at this point in the process one VM has
started one is being started and the
third has not yet been started you can
select one of these generated VMs to
inspect its configuration settings and
to also monitor its current state
you
now both the HTTP server and admin
server appliances are prepared and the
cluster appliances preparation is
underway after all appliances have been
prepared each enters the starting phase
in this phase any product specific
reconfiguration is done and the
applications are started HTTP server and
weblogic server in this example after a
successful verification that the
reconfigured HTTP server started the
appliance is finally moved to the
deployed state which is indicated by a
green icon subsequently the other
appliances are also started and verified
you
only when all appliances are deployed is
the parent assembly considered deployed
as well next let's also test the VMS
ourselves for example try connecting to
one of the weblogic appliances remember
to use the appliances hostname and root
password that you specified in your
deployment plan after logging in quickly
confirm that a weblogic process is
indeed running
you
you can also identify the specific name
of the server
you
similarly use a browser to connect to
the HTTP server in this example the
deployment plan actually overrides the
original port number which is 7777 by
default the HTTP server shows an Oracle
marketing page but this server was also
configured to proxy to weblogic using
virtual assembly builder so let's try to
access our weblogic application too once
an assembly instance is deployed you can
control it as a single unit in virtual
assembly builder right-click the
instance in the deployments panel and
select stop each appliance is then
unprepared meaning that the vm is
gracefully shut down
you
once again you can monitor the progress
in oracle vm as well here you can see
that one of our VMs is being shut down
you
after an appliance is unprepared and
it's VM is shut down it returns to the
stage state and just as before once all
appliances have transitioned to staged
the assembly itself is considered staged
as well as you might expect you can now
restart the assembly using studio if you
wish keep in mind though that the
reconfiguration processes only perform
the first time and appliances started
finally use the vm manager console to
confirm that indeed all VMS associated
with this assembly instance have been
stopped
