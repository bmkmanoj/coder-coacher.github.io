configuration package it also allows the
selection of additional components to be

summary step preview the package
contents and finally create and download
the export file in the create step
imports also has a wizard flow providing
a step-by-step guidance to import a
configuration package after uploading
the import file and viewing the package
details map users in the user mapping
step user mapping is now a feature of
imports instead of creates seen in
earlier unifier versions there is no
change in functionality then import the
package
new functionality in unifier 17 includes
additional options for copying
attachments in auto-created records copy
a perform and detail form attachments of
the source record into the auto created
record specify if detail form
attachments are copied as record or line
item attachments the availability of
these options depends on the business
process type line item or simple let's
assume we want detail form attachments
to be copied to the upper form of the
auto created record the source record
has two attachments in a line-item click
send to initiate the auto creation open
the auto created record line-item
attachments are displayed in the upper
form only unifier also now extends the
ability to reset field values on the
creation step in Auto created records
this is particularly useful if the
values are no longer applicable in the
auto created record tasks assignees can
enter new values in the fields this step
in the business process is designed to
auto create a new record reset is
defined on actual completion date and
record status fields let's see if their
values are cleared in the auto created
record click send to route the record to
the end step and auto create a new
record
values of the actual completion date and
record status are reset the reset
enhancements applies to I step and s
step methods of Auto creation resets can
now be defined on date pickers and data
Pickers the unifier now allows the use
of custom stamps created in Auto view
begin by navigating to the new Auto View
stamps node under configuration in the
company workspace tab administration
mode unifier provides to default stamps
and data elements to place on custom
stamps created in Auto view available
data elements are displayed in the left
panel but not all are applicable for
stamps the right panel displays elements
previously selected by administrators
for custom stamps selection is typically
based on generic fields placed on
business process forms in a moment we
will see how these fields read data from
a business process form when a stamp is
placed on a file attachment in Auto View
use the import wizard to upload the ini
and EMF files associated with the stamps
the new stamp will now be available to
place on documents reviewed in the auto
view viewer in unifier unifier also
allows you to compare two versions of a
vector document which can be business
process attachments or documents in the
documents manager open a business
process form to view its attachments the
left attachments panel displays the two
versions of a design next we will
compare the two versions and see the
result clear the document versions
checkbox if you want to compare with a
version saved on your local system the
two versions are displayed side by side
the drawing in the comparison results
section highlights the changes next we
will view an approval stamp placed on
the revised version stamps are
associated with markups which in turn
are associated with comments add or
modify values in the DMS attributes the
stamp reads the values from the related
fields in the business process form
unifier now allows you to specify the
preferred language timezone and date
format for a contact in a vendor record
add contact language dates formats and
timezone fields in the upper form design
of a master vendors business process
when we use the requests for bid
business process to send a bid
invitation to vendors the notifications
they receive are in the preferred
language specified in the master vendors
record the portal and the bidder form
also reflect the selected language
timezone date formats and numerical
format</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
