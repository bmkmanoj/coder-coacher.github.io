add and apply a rule set with our model
open we want to go to the design rule so
we select tools design rules and then
design rules again and you'll see that
what we want to do is we want to create
a rule set that contains rules from
multiple objects so we want to go to the
rule sub tab and then click the Add
button and then we want to modify the
properties so we select the rule set
properties and the window with all the
rules appears so we want to scroll down
and select the rules that we want to
include in this rule set so in this case
we want to select the column rule to
identify columns without datatype and
apply that to the selected rules and
then scroll down and select all the
other rules in this case we have some of
the rules under the table object so
we're going to shift select those and
then select that under the selected
rules so when we click OK it'll save all
of those rules within this rule set and
we can go ahead and click the Save
button to save that rule and then we
want to apply select it and notice that
all of the errors for all the rules in
the rule set are now listed in the
results area you've just learned how to
add and apply a rule set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
