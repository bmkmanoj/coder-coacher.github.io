template files it's important that you
not make changes to the original
template file instead you want to make a
custom template file that overrides the
original any changes you make to the
original file could be easily lost in
the future upgrade and by creating a
custom template file it's less likely
that you could lose your customizations
with the template override customization
method you override the entire file
because you can't extend or customize a
specific section of a file during this
video I'm going to show you how to
create a custom template file that
overrides the default template file I'm
going to make a change to the SCA demo
discount code message that appears on
the home page of an out-of-the-box SCA
site now here you see the message list
of 30 percent discount and I'm going to
change it to a 25 percent discount
during this video we're going to create
the directory structure for our
customized template file we'll copy the
original let's see a template file to
the custom directory edit the template
file create the NS package.json file
adds a new module to the distro based on
file and then view our changes to begin
I'm going to create the directory
structure where the files from my
customization will reside my SCA source
files residing the folder named for the
version of SCA and inside that folder is
a subfolder named modules and that's
where the SCA module is residing I'm
going to put my custom files inside a
new subfolder within modules folder so
I'm going to create a folder called
extensions and this will be the main
folder for any custom modules I created
in my new extension folder I need to
create a subfolder for my template I've
arrived customizations best practice for
naming custom module folders is module
name at version and the version can be a
number or a label since I'm customizing
the home module I'm going to make my
folder home extension at 1.0.0
now within my home extension that 1.0.0
folder I need to create a templates
folder
now that I have my folder structure in
place I need to copy the home template
file into my custom folders and this
copy of the file will be the starting
point for my customizations the file
name is home TPL so I'll do a ctrl P
search to search for that file and this
is the one I want here I'll reveal it in
the sidebar so you can see where it's
located now I'll save it to my notes new
location
since I already have the template file
open I'll go ahead and make the change
now if you remember I said I was going
to change the discount code message and
change it from 30 percent to 25 percent
here's the section of code that I'm
talking about and this is the number I'm
going to change here so I'll just change
that to 25 percent and save the file now
that I have my custom file I need to set
up the override so that it will be
deployed this is a two-step process
first I create the NS package.json file
that defines the override and then add
the module to the district JSON file
which is the SDA distribution file so
let's create the NS a congested I now
create a new file in the root of my
custom module folder I have the code for
the file copies of my clipboard so I'm
just going to paste it here
you'll save it in main McGuiness top
package JSON
the first part of this code defines the
standard objects used by Gulf to include
customized template files when combining
the application the second part of this
file contains the overrides that map the
original file in the SCA source
distribution directory to the custom
template file and adhere that we tell
the Gulf Jas combiner to override a
specific file next we need to add the
custom module to the distro got a some
file and it's located in the root of the
SCA source files directory that this
drugged-out json file lists all modules
that will be deployed well open the
district JSON file and if we look at the
list of modules we see that it orders
them alphabetically and I'm just going
to add my custom module to the top to
keep with this convention they don't
have to be in alphabetical order but it
makes the list neater and easier to
maintain you for this
and now I just need to save the file
now I need to learn the Gulf local
command to start the vehicle server and
publish my changes to the website and
you see a message about to the other
ride alright once servers up I think you
go to Chrome and enter the URL for my
local site until we see the 30% discount
message has changed to a 25% discount
message let me point out again that
we're doing this change on the local
server which points to the shopping -
local SS p.m. as opposed to the shopping
s SPF for the live site after the
changes are confirmed it can be deployed
to the development s SPF in NetSuite
