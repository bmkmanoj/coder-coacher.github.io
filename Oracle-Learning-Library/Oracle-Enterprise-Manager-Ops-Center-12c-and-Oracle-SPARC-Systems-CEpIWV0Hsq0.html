scale reliability and performance needed
for mission-critical applications this
global company did not want to exclude
those qualities from the cloud
foundation the Oracle spark technologies
offer an extreme thread count and memory
density and a small and eco-friendly
form factor the company wanted an
architecture that ensured they could
leverage their existing SPARC platforms
but not exclude new growth into the t4
chassis models they found opsin offered
them the complete coverage where they
were most invested with opsin are
included in all oracle premier support
contracts they got started right away
the first thing they utilized was bare
metal OS provisioning opsin allowed them
the capture service processor
configuration RAID controller
configuration update firmware and
install the operating system and
applications in a very efficient and
compliant manner ops center allowed them
to leverage both Solaris 10 jumpstart
and Solaris 11 automated installer by
marrying these technologies together
with the hardware they were able to
create complex deployment plans with
multiple steps from provisioning an OS
to updating the OS to installing extra
software and configuration to deploying
monitoring thresholds and templates
after bare-metal OS provisioning
discovery of the environment and all of
its components is of upmost importance
whether or not they were using the t4 in
a blade
form factor or leveraging an engineered
system from Oracle such as the SPARC
super cluster
they were able to discover their t fours
and see the relationship between the
chassis models and the other components
held within the rack rack mounts are
also extremely popular for this series
whatever the case may be they were able
to discover the field replaceable units
found within the box they could see full
coverage of part numbers serial numbers
locations and faults t-series also
offers an embedded lights-out management
console this resolved the need for
expensive terminal servers energy
consumption is also important when
dealing with data center architectures
ops Center offers a way to connect
energy performance to server performance
we can dig into aggregate collections of
boxes and find out who are the top and
bottom consumers the T series also comes
with the ability to switch between
performance and elastic mode changing
this on one box will not affect energy
bills but doing it across the Rack will
definitely save costs as you can see op
Center houses a granular level of asset
information use our simple reporting
interface to quickly run reports against
your environment to pull out the
attributes that are most important to
you
the result is an easy-to-read report
that lists the model in the serial
numbers get the most out of your my
Oracle support contract with op center
it'll automatically download firmware
for all Oracle Hardware and allow you to
select which OS images you would like to
leverage op Center also downloads all
Solaris patches from 8 9 and 10 all the
way to 11
using these downloaded components is
extremely easy here we'll grab a mix of
ILOM service processors select a logical
group and run a report the report will
allow me to see which servers are
compliant and not compliant here we see
a t4 is not compliant yet a t54 40 is
compliant and this T 50 to 40 was not OP
Center allows me to take snapshots of my
service processor
once captured I can leverage this
information to deploy other service
processors in a more consistent manner
OP Center comes with a event console
here in one location I have all the
events coming from my Oracle
infrastructure once a fault is
identified op Center will automatically
open up a service request for all
Hardware faults it leverages the
automatic service request service
program op Center does not stop at the
hardware
it also has extreme observability of the
operating system here in OS analytics we
can see all the processes that are
running on the Box based on category I
can dig into the service management
framework I can look at dependent
services and I can dig into a process ID
where I can troubleshoot based on threat
information and memory heap size
OP Center also will suggest thresholds
for me in my environment it will allow
me to go back in time and compare server
performance I have a extensive list of
attributes that will help me during any
troubleshooting situation op Center also
has zone information it understands the
difference between physical utilization
and virtual guest utilization through an
integration with Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control op center also has
application awareness from the
application to the disk Enterprise
Manager offers you a complete solution
here we see an Oracle database is
running on the Box I have a live event
feed from the database to off center I
can perform analytics on the processes
that are running on the Box op Center
houses the intelligence to connect
Oracle application target information to
processes op Center allows me to pool my
server resources together for the SPARC
series ops center provides two
virtualization methods you can pull
these servers together based on the o VM
for SPARC hypervisor or the Solaris zone
technology there we see a pool based on
the ovm SPARC I can see the servers
contained within the pool and the
logical domains on them
the spark processor offers an extremely
high thread count by pooling the
resources together I ensure that I'm
getting the most out of my spark CMT
purchases off-centre leverages dynamic
policies to govern pools there are
placement balancing and high
availability policies available to match
any business need the pools are the
engine room for the cloud here we see
two virtual data centers or clouds one
is called production the other quality
and tests the production is based on
Solaris zones running on SPARC
processors here we see the network
storage server pools and accounts
accounts are assigned resources CPUs
memory and storage it is a more
efficient way to make sure your business
users are getting the most out of your
server purchases here we can see the ERP
solution has seven virtual servers
running in it we have full lifecycle
control over the Solaris zones from this
interface as the account uses the
resources option are automatically
deplete to their allocated count this
ensures that everybody is getting the
right amount at the right time SPARC
based technologies changed how this
company viewed private cloud solutions
combined with op center this solution
offered a way to leverage existing
infrastructure and open the door to
running business critical applications
and a more efficient self-service model
