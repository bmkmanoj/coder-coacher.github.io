Martin and this is my good friend Pat
and today we're going to talk a bit
about how to integrate web content like
HTML and JavaScript into your job FX
applications and use it as part of the
user interface and we'll be doing this
by using the webview that was introduced
in Java FX 2 we have a lot of examples
and demos to show you and the plan is to
both show how the webview works and give
you some ideas of what it could actually
be used for because in this case the
possibilities really are endless
well my possibilities are endless your
demos are pretty brainless wait a minute
mister are you been picking at me all
week saying that my demo suggests boring
and ugly and now brainless as well yeah
but you know what at least my demos
worked I mean your demos are just full
of compiler errors and a lot of triple
nested for-loops so you should be
ashamed of yourself you know we had this
conversation or a discussion on Twitter
a couple of weeks ago I don't know if
you remember this especially this part
down here
does it ring any bells where you
promissed live fireworks heavy metal and
free beer I could show you go for a free
beer right now I don't know about you
but that would be great you know what
about the free beer I I might have been
a bit intoxicated about JavaFX fumes at
the moment so no free beer no free beer
no free beer but I did try to bring
fireworks with me from Sweden so what
what do you mean tried well if I works
do you know what happens if you you know
well let's just say that Homeland
Security doesn't appreciate it when they
find a lot of fireworks in your luggage
so I mean you should be happy that I
meet that I'm even standing here you
know presenting with you cuz I could be
in a totally different place yeah
so no firework I'm really happy ok no no
fireworks no free beer and I guess no
heavy metal either forget about the
heavy metal in the free beer what's
they said my demos are way cooler than
yours that's it NE yeah sure and I know
you're having a hard time understanding
but why don't you just ask the audience
I mean they know they civilized okay
that seems a bit pointless but how many
of you think that his demos will be the
coolest one we can do oh come on you're
bribing the audience I mean that's just
cheating exactly but doesn't that just
prove that you're them are useless you
have to resort to bribing people bribing
it's not farming I'm trying to be nice
guy
alright well enough of this nonsense now
let's see your first demo let's see what
you got sure I'd be glad to show my
first demo so the webview is obviously
capable of showing web content so that
seems like a good good thing to start
with loading a web page so this is a
simple java fax application with a
single webview node and this is what it
looks like okay so for your first demo
at JavaOne
in San Francisco you you're showing my
little pony yeah I'm trying to be nice
guy oh you don't know about it I've seen
all the posters in your apartment I know
it's your favorite page it's for you man
anyway let's move on okay so this is a
just simple page loaded in a webview and
before we look at the code let's just
take a quick look at Pacha texture so
the webview component contains of two
important classes a webview and a web
engine and the webview is just a normal
Java effects node that you can insert
into your node means you've seen and the
webview is responsible for presenting
content that is generated by the web
engine the web engine class is
responsible for getting the document of
the pages from internet and applying CSS
generating the DOM and generating the
the content that is forwarded forward to
the web engine for presentation so it's
the simple architecture let's look at
the code so I have created a very simple
application and in the stock method I
create a web view and I invoke web view
and get engine dot load and that's how
we load a web page so we use the web
engine to load a page I mean it's super
simple now sometimes you don't want to
load an external page I mean sometimes
you want to load a page that is stored
in your application and if you want to
do that you can just provide the load
method with the path to your local file
that's bundled with your application and
sometimes we want to show just a little
piece of HTML you know some HTML that
might be hard-coded into string in our
application and if that is the case when
we can just create a page content string
and we can replace the load with load
content and just display some you know
whatever we really want to do and in
this case it might look something like
this so the the web view is extremely
powerful and it's backed by WebKit an
open source project that is used by many
of the major browser vendors and the
webview supports CSS media JavaScript
you know canvas everything that you come
to expect when working with modern web
technology so loading a page nice okay
well I guess loading a page is pretty
basic but it's also pretty boring you
know not much going on so I'm gonna make
things a bit more interesting by showing
how you can integrate the webview into
your application and kind of communicate
to the user what's going on so we'll
talk a bit about integration and there
are a number of ways of doing this but
I'm gonna focus on three of them
visualizing page load progress handling
alerts and opening new windows from
JavaScript
and I know you think it's enough to just
show a screenshot of something and be
done with it
but I prefer to show real live you know
something real that's actually working
so if you please so I've created an
example program with these three
different techniques in so this white
area here is the webview that doesn't
have any content yet and up here I've
also added a progress bar which is
another standard Java effects component
and if we load a page in this web view
you'll see that the progress bar fills
up just yet
like you would expect it to and having
important having feedback like this is
very important because on a slow
connection it might take several seconds
before anything appears in the webview
and the user won't really have any way
of telling what's going on so progress
bars are a big good good good thing so
the second example is an alert and
alerts are those annoying JavaScript the
dialog boxes that you see on webpages
sometimes this is a very simple web page
with a single button to just display an
alert and if I loaded this in an
unmodified webview nothing would
actually happen when I click this button
because the webview doesn't really care
about alerts by default it's very easy
to create your own though you can get a
callback and display it any way you want
so here I created a simple pain that
just slides down from the top with the
alert message from JavaScript but how we
visualize this is well that's of course
entirely up to you all right and moving
on to pop-ups very similar page in
JavaScript there is a method called
windows open that takes a URL and opens
it in a new window the default behavior
in the web view is a bit different
though instead of opening a new window
the URL is loaded in the current web
view but if you want to you can override
this too
and have it open elsewhere or disallow
it completely and I've chosen to create
a pretty traditional pop-up window so
when I click this button oh it appears
here that's interesting well let's do
this like that an amazing page I know
and but you can choose to do whatever
you want with with this URL so let's go
back and have a look at some code
alright so for the progress demo we need
web view and the progress bar right then
we get an object called a load worker
from the web engine of the web view and
just like the name suggests the load
worker is responsible for loading
content into the web view so somehow we
want the progress of the load worker to
be reflected on the progress board we do
this by using a very neat JavaFX feature
called bindings so we can get the
progress property from the progress bar
and use the bind method to multiply that
to the previous property of the load
worker so every time the progress
changes the progress bar will be updated
automatically all right I gotta say I
gotta say I really like this working
with bindings this Way's great when were
you writing user interfaces you don't
have to write very much code and the
code you do write this you know it's
very clean and easy to read so I like it
a lot and showing alerts well that's as
easy as while registering an event
handler really so every time the
JavaScript alert method or function is
called will get a callback to our method
here and we'll get an event and the date
of that when event is the alert message
so we can display it any way we want
opening new windows takes a bit more
work when you open a new window in
JavaScript you can request that it has
certain features like whether it should
have a menu bar or whether it should be
resizable or not
and we get a pop up features object as
input to this callback to this event and
ER with those feature requests inside
that object and our job here is to
return a webview or rather web engine
where this URL should be loaded so as
you remember I created a very simple
pop-up window so I create a new stage
with simple webview and return the web
engine of that webview so this tells the
framework that this is where I want to
load this URL and it can be in a in a
new window or well in a completely
different part of your application if
you want to and if you return null the
URL won't be loaded at all so you can
prevent new windows from opening all
together all right so that's a bit nicer
don't you think whoa man you're really
pushing the limits I mean alerts in
progress
at the same time that's that's
outrageous so having event handlers to
take care of alerts is well it's
necessary but it's not enough if you
want to create a seamless user
experience what's missing is
communication so in this section I will
show you how to issue JavaScript
commands from Java or Java FEX and into
the JavaScript engine and let's take a
look at the code we create a simple web
view and we get the engine and we load a
page so far so good the next step is to
wait for the engine to finish loading
the page if we don't we send command to
the engine and they will just fail so we
add a change listener to the load work a
state property and every time something
happens in the loading progress our
changed method will get invoked and when
the page is fully loaded the state will
be equal to succeeded and we know that
the page is done and that's when we can
start sending commands and well this is
what it looks like this is an example so
I invoke engine and execute script and I
can pass in any valid JavaScript
into the web engine so anything you can
write between the script tag in HTML you
can pass to the execute script parameter
execute script method so in this case I
just change the background of the body
and if we if we continue from a previous
example it might look something like
this red background so changing the
background is one thing but there's more
things you can do so you can just in
this case we just ask for the HTML
source code and the web engine doesn't
contain any method for getting the
source code so this is the only way of
doing that or we can scroll the page to
specific points we can just execute any
existing JavaScript function so any
valid JavaScript is okay communication
yes communication is important but
that's not very elegant is it I mean
you're passing strings with JavaScript
and just you know you're throwing them
throw them at the webview and see what
happens now I don't think that's very
nice I'm gonna talk a bit about how to
communicate from JavaScript to Java
effects and this requires a well a
slightly more civilized solution so
let's have a look at the different
context that we're working with here we
have our Java code of course running in
our java application and then we have
the JavaScript code running inside the
webview and parallel just showed us how
to communicate this way by passing these
strings with JavaScript into the webview
but how about the other way around I
mean there's no way we'll have a script
with Java code and have that execute a
string with Java code and have that
executed in Java but that's that would
be crazy but what we can do is to create
an object here in the Java context and
kind of pass a mirror image of that into
JavaScript so this javascript object
will have the same methods that the Java
object they will be called the same
thing and by invoking them we can have
the corresponding Java
being executed in our java context
javascript can pass variables as
arguments to these methods and Java can
return data back to JavaScript so this
is a very elegant and nice solution I
think and I've created a really really
cool demo to show this off I'm ready for
this
demo time nice see if I can just remove
this perhaps great all right this is my
extremely cool demo it's got a single
webview this white square here and
everything else is just plain Java
effects and what I've done here is I've
created three links a red one a green
one and a blue one and using these
awesome powers of integration with Java
I can actually click these links and
have the color of the program change and
tired oh this is just it's amazing don't
you think no all right if that's not
enough I've created one more link and
this is a dangerous one down here this
link does something that no JavaScript
would be able to do without talking to
Java and that's to close the application
entirely so by clicking here I can just
shut the application down and that's
pretty cool if you ask me right all
right let's have a look at the code
you're never happy all right let's start
in Java land and here we create a new
class with a single method called exit
that will close our application so we
have an exit method that closes the
program then we create a webview and get
its web engine just like we always do
and then we'll actually use something
that you shown us the execute script
method but in this case we'll we won't
use it to run some JavaScript but to
actually get something from the webview
so we actually exit
possibly the shortest script you've ever
seen
it's just window and by doing this we
get a reference to the window object
from the web view and the win window
object is the topmost object in the
JavaScript hierarchy this is where all
the global JavaScript variables live and
this gets returned to us as a JAAA
subject which is a class representing
any JavaScript object and it has a
generic setter called set member that
we'll use so we create a new instance of
our integration class and we choose a
suitable name for it and use this set
member and method two to set this
variable in the window object right so
the set member that's where you inject
the Java the Java object yes exactly
when we do this the Java object or kind
of a mirror image of it will be
available in JavaScript and since we're
using the window object our integration
object will be available to all
JavaScript in the page so anywhere in
the page we can just run Java
integration which is the name we chose
dot exit to close the application so in
this case it's a link but it could have
been in a function or wherever you want
it so I don't know that's I think that's
pretty cool yeah sure you go from one
pad Emma to the next but you know what I
have a real world example that we can
solve using your technique mm-hmm what's
that do you know what this is it looks
like perhaps some code 202 calculate how
much free beer for the entire audience
would cost right very funny no it's not
it is JavaScript and if you run it
inside a browser you will get this image
and it's fractal
now what's interesting about it is the
rendering times so for Chrome it's 1.6
seconds and for so far it's 1.8 seconds
and for the webview it's close to 4
seconds now this is not a you know this
is not a nice user experience
I mean waiting for even for Quellin 1/2
seconds it's too much the solution is to
do the task in the context where it's
you know best suited and in this case
calculating a fractal is much quicker in
Java so what we're going to do is we're
going to pass the parameters from HTML
Javascript into java java effects and do
the factor calculation things called
calculations in there and then just
return you know about the way your a
path to it to the image and if we do
this we can reduce this the time to 800
milliseconds for the entire rendering
process and that's pretty good
so I should probably mention that we
have a very high iteration count when we
calculate the factor so it's it's a
unnecessarily high but I just want to
make a point that heavy lifting should
be done in you know in another context
in this case so well it's not every day
that you do a fractal it isn't you know
not for me but think about it image
manipulation phase recognition it takes
a lot of time so if you can pass the
arguments of the entire algorithm to
Java it's a much quicker thing to do all
right well that script seemed pretty
complex to me that's that's a lot of
strange for loops in for loops in photos
yeah and as far as scripts are becoming
more and more complex well sooner or
later buggies are gonna show up in them
I mean especially with your poor
JavaScript skills at least so I think
it's time we talked a bit about
debugging most modern browsers have
really good debugging tools built into
them these days and that can be great
but when we're communicating with Java
this way I mean there's really no way to
test that in a browser they don't know
about our Java context so we have to
figure out some way to debug the scripts
running within the webview right and
sometimes all you need are a few quick
printouts to get an idea of what the
script is doing and there aren't really
any dedicated
methods of doing this in the web view
but for already showing you a way of
doing it by while being a bit creative
and we could use the alert callback for
example so by registering an event under
for the on alert method and just
printing any message we get all alert
calls in JavaScript well essentially
becomes system.out.print lines so it's a
bit of a hack but if all you need are a
few quick printouts this is probably the
easiest way of getting them but I know
you don't like this no it's not a very
nice solution but it is a hack but
luckily you can do this which is much
nicer yeah on my code it looked like
something you might have written on a
bad day I know but or a good day yes but
I mean this actually works this does
something and that's not always the case
with the stuff you produce but what this
strange squared does is that it loads a
tool called the Firebug light into the
webview and Firebug is a debugging tool
for Firefox and this light version is
implemented entirely in JavaScript so it
can be run in many different
environments this of course isn't
something I came up with on my own
it's kind of the standard version of
loading Firebug light and you can easily
define this script online so let's have
a look at what it can do I've created I
created a simple browser for this
example very simple one all it does is
the bug stop reading so I don't know of
a good page we can use for our debugging
purposes sorry we can try yes right like
I said the feedback is very important
this is where I rent all my cars when
I'm traveling it's it's a very user
friendly and practiced page I've ever
seen in my entire life
no it's totally disrespectful to the
audience I mean no it's not a chance
it's fun forget
about it nope not gonna happen no I mean
look at it do you know what will happen
you will break Firebug if you try to
debug that page I'm so sorry but they
have really good rates doesn't matter so
let's try this instead much better okay
I have no idea where you come up with
this stuff but all right that you don't
like onions do you I do but we can talk
more about that later but I agree this
page is a better example to to show off
the powers of Firebug light so we'll
click the debug button up here and there
it is just like that we fetched it from
from the web
nothing cached so it's pretty fast and
Firebug lights appends itself as a panel
to the bottom of the webview and you can
resize it and there's really no way of
telling this is just JavaScript
I think it's they've done a really good
job so the first tab we get here is a
console this is where all well any
warnings and error messages from
JavaScript will be printed so that's
pretty useful in itself we can also
execute scripts up of our of our own
here like checking the title for example
yeah and one who doesn't like onions is
an idiot yeah you said that yeah thank
you we also have an HTML tab where we
can kind of drill down into the Dome of
the page or we can use the inspect
function to select an element to have a
closer look at so we see the code for
the element out here and we see the
style here to the right and we can
actually edit this like that right wait
and try out new changes to our code and
layout and stuff like that and they're
so dedicated CSS tab and we have a
script tag with all the script for the
page and so on so it's it's a really
nice tool and it's great that you can
load it just like this without actually
writing much code at all so yeah
debugging to everyone thank you
finally you showed us something useful
yeah but you know a good debug tool can
be like it can be like a bridge over
troubled code
I guess nah speaking of bridges whoo
that's a pretty ugly bridge that's one
of your bridge I know and that's what
the next section gonna be about about an
ugly bridge what are you gonna do about
it like write a new one or what kind of
but I'm gonna enhance the looks of this
bridge and one way to do that is to just
execute a lot of JavaScript commands and
we can manipulate the Dom in whatever
way we like but the java script commands
are very generic you can do it you know
you can do anything with it but if you
only need to change the Dom you know
manipulating the background and stuff
like that there is a much better way of
doing it
so let's take a look at the source code
for this page it's a body and it's a div
containing some text and an image and we
have two IDs header an image and there's
a source attribute as well on the image
I mean it's pretty simple and the dawn
looks something like this about it with
a div and an image now what's important
to understand is that for every div for
every tag in HTML corresponding JavaFX
class exists so we have in java facts
HTML image element and we have an HTML
div element and an HTML body element so
instead of doing a lot of JavaScript
execution we can just get the elements
and manipulate them to update the page
so let's take a look at the code we
asked the engine for the HTML document
and the next step is to ask the document
for a specific tag with the name body so
now we have a reference to the body in
the HTML and then we just change the
style of the body in the
scary's we changed the background the
next step is to get an element with ID
equal to header and that's the div tag
remember and we changed the text content
and we change the style attribute today
make it look a little bit better and the
next step is to just ask for the image
and we change the source of the image
and the style and this is the result
it's much better it's a much better
looking bridge final but you know all
these changes you made there just refer
reflected immediately to the page yeah
you don't have to reload anything or no
updates no commits no nothing just
change the object and the page will be
updated
so changing object is one thing but you
can also insert new notes into the Dom
by invoking insert before on the body
where you can append the child lost in
the Dom or you can just remove one if
you like so it's it's powerful it is
pretty powerful yeah but I think it's
time to bat we stop showing you know it
make
imaginary examples and perhaps moved on
to something that could actually be
useful you know maybe so for this
example I've written a really
complicated program a very complex GUI
that's really hard to use well I tried
it take it takes a lot of work but I
managed to pull together a small one so
we'll see what happens all right it's my
program maybe you can close the other
one yes great so as you can see it's
very complicated and none of it really
makes any sense where would all those
strange things here and you know yeah I
don't know how it works but the point
about this is that I think many
inexperienced computer users feel this
way when they when they sit down in
front of a new application for the first
time you have a lot of strange names for
things and dials to turn and so on and
you don't really understand what to do
but luckily this complicated program has
a help function built into it so
Jews help and show the menu and that's
the manual and it's a web view of course
and it's showing a very simple HTML page
and that's hopefully useful enough but
why stop there
we've already show how to communicate
from JavaScript to Java and back again
so why not try to make the help function
a bit more well a bit smarter down here
we have how to section how to do
something in this application and the
first step is in the main window select
the ding radio button okay doesn't make
any sense but we'll try to find it if
you know it could be anywhere it could
be another in another window or in
another tab and so on but what we can do
is just click this link and the button
will glow and show itself to us so we
select the ding radio button and now the
first step in our how to turn screen and
we know that this is done we can move on
to the next which is move the Fred
slider to the desired value and it's
clearly down here and well 27 is
obviously a good value good enough for
you yep and finally we click the chords
button whatever that is and we're done
well done the guide is completed and of
course this is a very simple example of
something that I think could actually be
really really useful we're running a
full WebKit browser here so we could
easily embed audio video maybe some
animations or small like certification
tests or whatever into the documentation
of the program I've seen several cases
where there is a wiki for an application
well why not integrate the wiki directly
into the program and you won't just get
the content you can also get all the
editing function and everything you get
in a normal browser as part of your
application so I think that's great I
think it could be a really useful thing
in you know all the applications out
there right thank you
well thank you for Chris
the crapfest have a section in history I
mean look at it you don't even have the
same font I was in a hurry
yeah I know so this is obvious some HTML
without any CSS and that is just wrong
man but maybe that's what the Help
section looks like I mean it's it's a
web page in I do nope that's not a way
to way to do it so I'm gonna just make
this a little bit more beautiful and
it's a lot of work but be patient so I'm
gonna inject a CSS into the application
and make his demo so beautiful and as I
said it's a lot of work this is it
that's my demo so just invoke set use a
stylesheet location with your style
sheet and that's how we do it so when
you load the page the stylesheet will be
applied so I have a demo I can show you
what it's like and it's not just a
screenshot monitor this is my first real
demo and I copied your code so yeah good
job
okay so I've changed the font it's a bit
embarrassing but you get the point
and while I removed the underline from
the link I don't like that so two lines
of code yes thank you for that you
reused my demo and showed two lines of
code
free candies your answer to anything I
don't know I think I can beat this
actually and I'm not even sure I need to
go back to the slides for this now I'm
just gonna start it right away this is a
demo that's well it doesn't really
introduce any new concepts but it's kind
of a clever way of using the webview all
right this might look a bit strange you
know with the different colors and the
different fonts and things don't really
seem to fit well together but these are
actually different parts of separate web
pages running in my application so up
here I can see what's there whether it's
like I'm apparently in San Jose not sure
why but that's fine the weather seems to
be nice in the great outdoors
and down here I have a widget where I
can see when the next bus leaves from
the bus stop down the street so if
everything goes wrong here this is my
exit strategy you will have to leave
alone because I got candy you have to
throw farther all right so two widgets
that sounds very impressive let's add a
third one three widgets are really
impressive this is this is in Swedish so
bear with me but this is a page over
here where I upload all my exercises
when I go running I upload the GPS file
to this page and it keeps track of what
what I'm doing and I can move my mouse
around here and highlight different
elements and when I find something I
like I can just click it and it
immediately appears as a widget on my
well in my program here so I can move
this around arrange things any way I
like
and I think it's a pretty clever thing
to do it's just like a dashboard you
know in the reception where you don't
know history information dashboard
that's a good name for you as well yeah
but this could be actually useful you
could show we're like the best times and
perhaps the company stocks are key so on
and yeah really cool I like it
all right so so what's next
we've been you know we've been fighting
each other you know trying to work right
the best demo and I think it's it's
gotten out of hand so I'm gonna go back
to basic and just do something simple
again so you can just you you can say
that you beated me I'm just gonna share
a webpage that's it oh so my little pony
again no this is Java most-wanted calm
oh yeah
so let me show you I have a demo and
this is it this is Java most wanted and
it contains the 10 most dangerous and
ill-behaved Java FEX persons in the
world so if you see one of them run for
your life
but don't leave a session you mean these
guys are walking the streets right now
yeah ooh it's kind of scary you know
Jasper the Ripper I know and Jim Weaver
Oh No
yeah the Birdman ooh scary yeah I know
okay Steven bondage in you know there's
scared people yes but let me ask you
this job a Bureau of Investigation yeah
that's even a real thing super serious
yes it exists Java most-wanted come and
did you happen to create some of this
stuff well it might have been me yeah I
wrote the page yeah yes because I think
you made a mistake no I don't do mistake
I don't think Indiana Jones should be on
that list
why not no you know he's not on the
JavaFX team he's nice and cool committer
I mean he's like JavaFX
he's the king yeah but but it's a secret
it is yes okay my bad so I guess we have
to change the page yes you have to
remove Indiana Jones before Larry
Ellison sees it okay and you know what
this isn't an ordinary
web browser this is something very
special so when I move the mouse over
its it's just like a web browser but as
soon as I click the command key I start
to highlight the different elements
that's under the mouse and when I
clicked the mouse I will just display
the editing bar
so you said Indiana Jones and that's it
and what you see is all the attributes
that are available for the image tag in
HTML and I can just change I can just
change the source attribute so who do
you think should be there James Gosling
perhaps I think that's better okay
let's write Gosling I know there's an
image Gosling dot jpg so golf swing and
that's it that's pretty neat right you
didn't expect that did you
that's not James Gosling no that's me
and Martin machine gun well I'm
satisfied much better okay thank you I
did not see that coming no but like this
but you know it's a lot of work and it's
pretty much a waste of time don't you
think why because the next time you load
this page all your changes will be gone
what actually no because I've added some
code that you know as soon as the change
happens in this application it's
uploaded to the web so it's live your
life and kicking yeah okay it's just
kind of bad but yeah so thank you Java
Most Wanted Ofcom what ill-behaved all
right I'm just gonna close this there
and I have another demo and I think I
can actually beat this this was pretty
good but I think I can do better and
once we're done here I'm pretty sure we
will go out and you know have a beer and
celebrate our great work or you know
drink to forget
and drown our sorrows it will be paired
I know it will have beard yes and I have
the perfect application for planning or
big night out all right
and this is it I'm still pretty
disappointed you didn't bring in a free
beer so we're gonna start off by having
a beer and it's gonna be on you so I
look like that I need a beer button and
immediately all the pubs and bars in the
area show up on this map here and you
know creating a map service it's pretty
hard I've heard people fail at creating
maps well you know everybody doesn't
really go all the way I know instead of
writing a map service of our own which
is very hard we're using Google Maps
which actually actually works so we'll
start by having a beer and I know this
is a great place so I want to go there
right we get it
okay this is how much a taxi right there
will cost us and ten bucks well you are
paying so I don't mind all right and
we've had beer plenty of beer now I
think it's time that we have something
to eat so we'll check out the
restaurants and I'll go there perhaps 11
bucks
sure I'm hungry and well I think that's
about it
beer food but we've had beer I want to
dance okay go ahead no very funny so I
can dance cuz I'll be drinking beer so
let's go down there well I'm I'm already
broke so it doesn't matter all right
no one is on it is enough I've had
enough and whoa we get the root for our
entire night out and also the tab
everything you bought this is great I
mean perfect Newport's unknown like 85
bucks
I mean why I don't remember so you
bought it
all right so this is probably the
coolest demo we've ever see I mean
there's no point of going on we can we
should just go home wait I have lost one
last demo and I've been thinking about
this for a very long time and I was
having a real hard time coming up with
what to do
I mean we've covered most of the things
we want to show you so after two weeks
it hit me
you know the abstract that we sent to
conferences to get accepted abstract
yeah what about it
apparently it's supposed to say what
we're going to talk about I mean it's
stupid but that's just a list of
buzzwords and you know I know I know
so who reads it anyway
no one nope people read it I mean
apparently they're here so we have to
you know it's strange they're here for
the free beer I know anyways I figured
out a way to come up with the next demo
so what we have to do is read the
abstract and do what it says only it's
super simple and we should have thought
of that years ago I mean we should have
saved so much time okay but this is a
this is a bunch of text yeah so we've
shown most of the abstract but this is
what's left learn the line between web
and application that's that's my demo
well it's easy to draw lines in Java
effects and there is a blur effect you
know no that's not it so I've created
the demo that will blur the line between
web and application and I think I've
done such a good job that no one in the
audience will find the webview and you
know I'm ready for some serious bedding
so if you find the web you you will get
candy
candy all right so let's take a look at
it
this better be good that's close
I don't we ran okay and this is the last
demo so where is the webview any bets
free candy
no one there's not that many things to
choose from the bar at the bottom mmm
that's Java FEX it's not the word it's
right and one no no you're absolutely
right and wrong so it's not the ball I'm
sorry about that any other bits no Java
effects
okay so it's difficult I'm gonna show
you what part is the webview
so you see the checkbox show webview
when I click that checkbox the webview
will color to red we're ready so we have
eight web views and eight JavaFX
components and we are doing some heavy
communication to calculate the ball
where it is at what part of the ball to
to paint or maybe knowing you maybe
you're just moving an image above all of
this and that saved you like many days
of work do you never trust me do you
know and I knew and I knew you were
gonna say that so I've added this
special ball special yeah so I'm gonna
decrease the speed and when I press the
special ball the ball will be painted in
a very different way in the webview so
I'm just gonna
wait for the ball and press the special
ball and there you go I can guarantee
you that I'm not cheating that's so cool
yeah it is I'm slightly impressed I'll
give you that like 1% yes 1% I noticed
all right well that is pretty good I
know so writing a pong game might not be
you know something you do every day I
mean like your boss not gonna pay for
this I promise you but if you combine
all the demos we've shown you like pong
the map jbi and all the different
techniques that we've learned today we
hope that you've come to realize that
the webview is really really powerful
and the sky the sky is the limit even
for you
even for me yeah it's just a little bit
clouded it is yes but I think that's it
we have a few minutes for questions if
you want if you want to type on if you
want to play yeah it plays itself we
have candy so unless there are any
questions would like to thank you and
feel free to come up and have and talk
to us up here and well thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
