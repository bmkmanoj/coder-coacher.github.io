the intent is to show you how fast the
query can run in parallel compared to a
serial execution here we are using a
database machine to make this comparison
okay so the first thing we want to do is
to connect to sequel plus on the first
database node and then because we want
to be able to reproduce the demo over
and over again and make sure that all
the SGA structures are cleaned we're
going to shut down that database
instance so that's the first command we
issue here shut down image yet so it
takes a couple of seconds to shut down
and then we're going to start it up
again
okay so the database is open now and we
can start running our queries so the
first thing we need to do is to connect
to the SOA schema in this case then set
timing on so we want to look at the
timing information when each time we
execute a query and this is the simple
query we want to execute select counts
down from order and the score items so
this is without using parallelism in
this case so let's see how long it's
going to take so here we are not going
to wait until the the complete time is
done for this query but it took around
one minute and 23 and 24 seconds let's
say to return that many rows so this is
a pretty huge number of rows so now the
the other part of the demo is to redo
exactly the same thing but this time
using parallelism so let's connect back
as C's DBA to shutdown the instance to
make sure our test is consistent once
again and start up the instance again
takes a couple of seconds again we
connect as the SOA user we set the
timing information on to look at query
time the execution time and then this
time around we run the exact same query
but triggering parallelism oh there are
eight different machines in this case
and let's see how long it's going to
take so let's run it and this is the
result so you see that this time it took
only two seconds for the exact same
number of rows ACK as compared to the
previous case where we took more than
one minute
these concludes the demonstration thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
