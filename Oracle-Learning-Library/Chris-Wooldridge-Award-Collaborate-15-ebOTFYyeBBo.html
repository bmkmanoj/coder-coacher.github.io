Baldrige award at collaborate 15 so
first of all ray congratulations on your
award thank you really appreciate that I
really do it's a well deserved I know no
ray how many collaborates have you been
coming to over the past few years this
will be my 16th or 17th 1630 17 very
impressive the conference committee for
seven years and so I I mean it's it's
that kind of volunteers kind of stuff
that they decided they wanted to give me
that award for because it takes a lot of
dedication to get there but it's worth
it i mean it pays off i'm seeing the
community grow they're seeing some depth
of experience and i'm seeing really
great relationships with oracle you know
it's just it's so fulfilling on its own
just see those things grow and to see
people ask you know mature intelligent
questions from both sides of the aisle
so for anyone there's not been to
collaborate would you recommend it no
really I think everyone should stay home
of course I recommend it look you can't
beat having four or five days together
with people that have the same
challenges that you do right it isn't
just about hearing the content from a
contextual point of view right it's one
thing to hear about here's how it ought
to work
collaborate people get to hear here's
how it works in my world yes here's the
context for a successful case study
supplemented by vendors supplemented by
stories from Oracle employees but then
in the background we've got all these
wonderful networking opportunities
you've got the special interest groups
you've got is standing in the hall
waiting to get into these sessions and
this is saying people all week and I'm
encouraging it I think everyone should
take advantage of it because I mean
that's how I've become involved to the
level and I'm at is that I talked to
someone I meet someone else and they've
got a similar challenges that I've got
right i mean mines unique to me but it's
still how do i use enterprise manager to
do this are you challenged using RAC one
node because of this let's talk about
how we handle those challenges and it's
very enlightening to me to see that you
know some areas i thought i was pretty
backward but when i talk to people for
much larger shops we're doing all right
you know it's very filmy know it could
see the oven take yeah and you're not
going to get that sitting in your office
reading the manual you're looking at a
webcast it's just not there
to walk you going for the rest of agree
if I knew what I was going to do for the
rest of the week I I would let you know
I think there's so much going on this
week I mean it's just it's constant
sessions obviously there are meetings
their interactions between the Oracle
executives in the iou G board constantly
keeping each other price of what's going
on and then there are all of these great
networking opportunities I'm REE meeting
people that I've known from the user
experience for quite a while it's like
hey you know what that stuff you told me
last year I did something with it in a
sec Oh feels so good right I know it's
not about just feeling good but you know
what it feels really good makes a
difference yes good to meet you once
again enjoy the rest of week thanks i
look forward to meeting you next year oh
yeah and congratulations again in your
award thank you very much really thank
