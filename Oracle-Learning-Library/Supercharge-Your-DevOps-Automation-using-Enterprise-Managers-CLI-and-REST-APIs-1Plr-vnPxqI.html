Oracle Enterprise Manager technical
webcast series our topic for today is
supercharge your DevOps
automation using Enterprise Manager CLI
and REST API s my name is Martin Pena
and I'm a product manager here at Oracle
headquarters I'm pleased today to have a
couple of our databases a service
experts with us Pat combs is going to be
our primary presenter is part of the
pre-sales team in North America leading
up the cloud POC implementation team
also with us is Shuba deep Sengupta he's
a product manager on my team responsible
for technical lead as the database as a
service and snap clone area let's start
out with a little bit of an introduction
in terms of the
safe harbor statement I sure many of you
have seen this before so just take a
second to read this please
and then before I turn it over to Pat
just wanted to note that we do have some
content posted already on Oracle
technical Oracle technology Network
we have a database as a service REST API
cookbook the URL is here and you can
download this which will be a great
takeaway reference from this webcast
I'll post the URL in the chat as well so
with that I'm going to go ahead and
switch presenter roles over to Pat and
let him go ahead and provide an
introduction before he does that I just
want to mention in terms of QA and
questions we do have the WebEx chat
feature available feel free to post any
questions there while Pat is speaking
Shiva deep and I will be monitoring the
chat and if we can we'll post any
responses during the session and if we
have at any time at the end we'll also
open the phone's up to Q&amp;amp;A for live
questions as well so with that Pat
please go ahead Martin thank you so much
and thank you so much as well everybody
for attending um so today again very
interesting topic a lot of things uh are
out there an Enterprise Manager is a
relates to capabilities um but really we
want to focus on really the full
integration and the enablement of DevOps
so we're going to provide a quick
overview of Enterprise Manager you know
talk a little bit about DevOps and
integration what does that mean uh it's
a great buzzword these days a lot of
things are happening in this space full
automation is is absolutely where where
our customers want to go so you want to
talk a little bit about the tools that
are out there how we integrate with
those tools and how that's going to take
effect and then more specifically you
know around Enterprise Manager and
DevOps you know what does this really
mean how can it help you automate the
provisioning of the resources and
requirements for your development
organizations you know how can we manage
these things how can we maintain IT
currency I'll look at a bit of the
security around that how that happens
then we're going to look at it we're
gonna actually execute the RESTful API
I'll do a demo of all three things that
I use
a regular basis um give you some
understanding of best practices around
that and we're going to look at the
RESTful API cookbook that Martin had
mentioned earlier really just providing
a nice roadmap on an implementation of
the restful api and the EMS command-line
interface in conjunction with with
integration tools source control tools
things of that nature and of course QA
so let's talk a little bit about
Enterprise Manager so for those who have
been exposed to Enterprise Manager for a
long time you've seen the evolution of
Enterprise Manager for many many years
ago from ten to eleven and then twelve
and then of course thirteen c-arm
you know again new features
functionality come out on a regular
basis 13c as a fantastic write of the
latest version of Enterprise Manager the
UI is more streamlined is a little
cleaner arm so I encourage you to take a
look at Enterprise Manager 13 as soon as
possible if you haven't already looked
at it some great new features are there
and 13c one of the big ones is the
always-on monitoring feature which is
which is something that you know myself
as a customer of Enterprise Manager and
a user of Enterprise Manager as well as
all of our other customers have been
looking for for a while so that's there
um and again we've we've expanded the
capability as it relates to the
management of a full integrated stack so
you know again it's really critical for
us to understand what's happening across
the entire stack and this also includes
cloud lifecycle management you know
what's happening in the cloud whether it
be private cloud or public cloud of
Enterprise Manager 13 does support true
hybrid so I encourage you to take a look
at Enterprise Manager haven't already
done so I would get it installed in a
little sandbox if you will sort of kick
the tires on and take a look at it
because there's a lot of new features
and functionality there more
specifically let's talk a little bit
about um you know DevOps and how do you
start this with where do you start I
mean what are you going to go with this
arm you know what do you want to do with
it what are the integration
opportunities and when you look at all
the things that are out there you know
from a DevOps perspective there's a lot
on the map here from source control to
configuration management development
tools integration continuous delivery
containers and there's a lot of tools
out there but if you're not integrated
you're not
working with a solution that's going to
sort of pull these together in a
seamless transaction then then you've
got to find something to do with this
and it becomes very cumbersome so what
we really wanted to do with the api's
and Enterprise Manager is provide that
fully automated end-to-end solution so
integration with things like puppet chef
source control systems as an example
continuous delivery integration we
wanted it to be very flexible and give
you the capability to provide a fully
integrated end-to-end solution so as an
example if a developer was looking for a
particular database based on a source
control a set of source controller code
with an ax source control system they
had checked out you would be able to
integrate with Enterprise Manager via e
em command line interface or the restful
api to provision the requirements for
that particular source control that was
checked out of the source control system
as an example and of course you know
with puppet and chef with configuration
management and ansible as an example for
deployments we wanted to provide a
capability to be no touch we've got a
lot of customers out there now that have
a lot of these solutions in place we
want to work with those solutions this
is not something that you're looking to
replace we're looking to you know plug
into everything you have integrate with
the solutions you have and provide that
seamless solution so you can take full
advantage of things that are elsewhere
an Enterprise Manager around
configuration management as well as you
know monitoring and things of that
nature so provide a centralized solution
to to sort of assist with the
orchestration and integrate with the
orchestration tools you already have on
the floor today so let's talk a little
bit about Enterprise Manager and sort of
how this integrates and how it affects
the organization quite frankly so when
you look at you know the segregation of
duties and you look at you know what
we're trying to achieve here what we
really want to do is to give the cloud
administrator who quite frankly is a DBA
but let's be honest this individual
knows Enterprise Manager understands you
know the flow of database provisioning
and things of that nature so a cloud
administrator or a DBA administrator
that's on staff today could easily take
control of things like pool creations
quote administration service templates
what we wanted to do is
by an orchestration solution via restful
api that would give you the capability
to automate the creation of all these
things as things hit the floor so if you
had a new group of infrastructure
components whether they be physical or
virtual we wanted to be able to automate
the creation of the pool of resources
for databases of service in one fell
swoop as an example and that's what you
see here making it ready for database
provisioning at that point then if you
look at it from an end-user perspective
it's even further simplified because we
also wanted to provide a solution that
was going to fully integrate with
whatever orchestration solution you have
today and provide very few questions for
that particular individual to ask for a
particular database or again as we
talked about earlier from a source
control perspective if they checked out
some code and there was a particular
database middleware stack and
application that was pertaining to that
particular code we want to automate that
in the backend so that the end user
simply receives a notification that the
database and the wider infrastructure or
the wider stack is available for them to
particular to develop against or execute
testing against so really what we wanted
to do is look at it from two different
perspectives fully automating the
creation of the assets required to
implement something like database as a
service specifically and then further
automate and simplify that via API is
from the end-user perspective because
what we're seeing is a lot of customers
who are customizing portals as an
example they have a flavor of portal
that they want to use which is which is
fantastic we want to provide that plugin
or that integration with the restful api
to fully automate that so it looks
seamless to the end-user although things
are happening underneath the covers and
as it relates to the integration with
Enterprise Manager the end users
experience is exactly the same
regardless of what sort of asset they're
asking for
so as you look at the roles and is this
further defines it in another fashion on
the end-user is development they want a
database they want it on asset quickly
they want to be able to manage it at a
very basic level they want to be able to
delete it self-service deletion so as an
end-user I'm asking for a database I'm
not necessarily asking for an
infrastructure component I don't really
care quite frankly where the database
resides as long as I get the database I
need within the pool of resources that I
needed in and then once that service is
available I need to be able to access it
shut it down
start it up at a very basic level look
at some very basic statistical
information around performance and so I
can execute against that particular
environment as I see fit
again it's all about self service and
then finally what I want to do is I want
to be able to self delete that database
I don't want to have to go ask somebody
when I'm finished with that resource and
what we're finding is is it's changing
the behavior of the organization's and
so what we're seeing is increase of
utilization of resources at the
infrastructure level because individuals
are moving in and out of the pools and
they're using things as they need them
and not letting things sit around so it
really is liberating to the development
organization so that they have the
capability to create things they need
increases the capability to move things
to market faster and that's really what
it's all about providing a self-service
opportunity and again from a development
perspective we want to also provide that
integration via restful api and if you
look at it from an administrators
perspective on the outside again it's
all about ensuring that we have the
assets on the floor we have the
resources available so that we can
provide quick and easy implementation of
whatever the development organization
needs as well as administering things
around quotas as an example creating the
service templates that are the latest
and greatest for the organization fleet
maintenance which is a fantastic
opportunity for for what we call sort of
self-service patching if you will on
what essentially happens here is that
I've got an opportunity to let the
end-user move their database from one
Oracle home that would be lets say base
to another Oracle home with the latest
PSU as an example
patch that update well which also
includes the security updates so it's
you know we're providing this the
portal if you will or this integration
with the RESTful API to enable the
end-user to self-service and this is
really what it's all about and again
full integration with the current things
you have on the floor around
orchestration specific as a puppet chef
or ansible as an example and so what we
have here is a really nice marrying of
the two api's because they feed into
each other and as we go through the
demonstration you'll see what I'm
talking about there are certain things
I'm going to use to gather is the
information specific to our
infrastructure components for emc li and
then i'm going to incorporate those
pieces into the JSON bodies or the the
bodies themselves of the restful calls
to enable the execution of a creation of
a service template as an example our
creation of databases as an example
deletion of databases as an example and
then of course all the things on the
back end through the CLI as it relates
to administration pieces so what you see
here is really a holistic solution that
will incorporate not only the
administration of the private cloud with
a fully automated integrated API but
also the end user experience giving the
user the capability as indicated via the
restful api
and so if we look more specifically at
EMS command-line interface what this
enables you to do is fully provision all
of the things that are needed on an
infrastructure environment so as an
example let's say we recently received
for operating systems that are managed
targets and Enterprise Manager whether
they be physical or virtual doesn't
really matter we've got an agent sitting
out there we've got a managed asset and
Enterprise Manager what you see here is
EMS command line interface provisioning
the levan tool for Grid infrastructure
Oracle home which includes the build of
ASM on that particular host you see here
so we we set up these things in the
software library so they're centralized
so that we don't have to worry about
pulling these from different locations
Enterprise Manager manages this for you
automatically in the centralized library
and then we can install these with
baseline standards for configuration so
this really provides an opportunity for
the cloud administrator to standardize
across the entire landscape so we've got
the same org homes the same versions on
particular environments we've got some
same configuration details all of the
things in the ASM environment are the
same as it relates to the groups if you
will so all those things are
standardized and then we pull these
assets as indicated earlier so that we
can take we take full advantage of the
infrastructure that we have maximize the
utilization of resources and sometimes
increasing those resources is related to
utilization upwards of 80 percent eighty
to ninety percent and this is what we
actually saw internally at Oracle so
it's very very significant for us and so
we provision these through the EMC Li so
if you think about this if we looked at
something from an infrastructure
perspective around let's say of VMware's
of ECAC the automation center if we were
to provision a VM template automatically
as an example through that particular
engine we could call the EM CLI to
provision all of the Oracle assets
required for the database rack database
environment with no hands no touch as
well as set up access and of course
we've got the capabilities to the
chargeback and metering and in the show
back plans if you will so this is the
first piece of fully integrated full
automation this is the first step when
you start talking about integration with
the things we saw
earlier around puppet chef ansible
automation a tool orchestration tools
this is the first piece once this is
finished we then incorporate this into
databases of service through the restful
api and so we can control which you're
executing whether it be through the UI
which is out of the box for Enterprise
Manager which is the self-service portal
or as we are going to talk about here
shortly the command-line interface or
the API itself for the restful api so
what we're going to do is once we get
that infrastructure completed we then
would incorporate those assets into a
zone incorporate that database home into
a pool and then create the service
templates are going to enable the users
to access that particular environment a
fully automated fashion as indicated via
an orchestration tool so if we look more
specifically at the API is for database
as a service certainly the the building
and creation of zones templates of
service instances creation of databases
themselves obviously we talked about
deleting the services themselves
extending the service because we can
fully automate the deletion of the
database we can set parameters within
the service templates that indicate when
that database would be deleted and prior
to the deletion we can also set up a pre
delete script that would back it up as
an example and of course deploying those
databases requesting databases pluggable
databases because if you look at the
infrastructure for the zones we've got
you know a database pools and pluggable
pools which would be containers schema
as a service we can track those so as we
create this if we look at the UI or
excuse me we look at the restful api in
the demonstration you'll see where I can
status the build to the user so we could
provide a framework around that what
give me capability to see where their
build is and with the statuses and of
course managing those we can certainly
stop and start databases through the
restful api backup databases create
snapshots for thin provisioning and then
we can take a look at the chargeback
your metering details as well so we
wanted to provide a fully functioning
functioning very rich restful api to
fully auto
made end-to-end and again is indicated
we've got a lot of customers that are
working towards that with the e/m
command-line interface in the restful
api fully automating a boolean agree
so if you look at database-as-a-service
well you know we were providing you that
capability to be more efficient use
assets more efficiently as I talked
about earlier increasing utilization of
resources we want it to be accessible
very easily very quickly through
whatever well orchestration solution you
see fit
wanted to be able to to move quickly to
to expand scale up scale down relocate
these are things we wanted to provide in
enterprise managers
database-as-a-service
and in turn as well the RESTful API and
the IAM command-line interface wanted to
be able to track things so I will access
the UI for Enterprise Manager 13 only as
a reference to sort of validate what we
did through the restful api because
everything we do through the restful api
is recorded and tracked through
Enterprise Manager it's no different
than the UI you'll see when I log into
enterprise managers restful api I still
have to authenticate so just because I
have access to a portal I still have to
authenticate into Enterprise Manager
which you'll see and again as we're
talking about today we want to make sure
we can integrate so quite frankly it for
us in the end it really doesn't matter
which tool you want to use to integrate
with Enterprise Manager these are open
standard api's you can integrate with
virtually any solution that you see fit
we'll take a look at the e/m
command-line interface as well give you
some examples of what that looks like
and how it would interface with the
restful api and then I've also created a
script that will take a look at a basic
k shell script that does a curl call so
you can see you know the integration at
that level where you can start slicing
and dicing and parsing things out for
that particular user that logged into
Enterprise Manager or if you were
logging into the restful api as a
privileged user to administer the cloud
assets and finally this is a really
great summary because again there's a
lot of ways to integrate with Enterprise
Manager we're going to talk more
specifically about the restful api in
the amp command-line interface but I
thought it would be important to note
all of the opportunities of integration
with Enterprise Manager so e/m will plug
in and and send data in a
with data anywhere you see fit to
provide that holistic picture of
everything in your particular a IT
environment so with that being said
let's let's take a look at what this
this restful api does and some of the
capabilities there so I'm going to jump
out and take a quick look now we've got
Enterprise Manager 13c here and again
we'll look at this only as a reference
arm what I like to use is a postman
postman is um free comes from Google
integrates with Google Chrome and it's
really nice because it gives you the
capability to save calls and reference
those so what you see here is an initial
get to the home page if you will for the
restful api so we're going to log in to
enterprise manager 13 with sis man in
this particular case now I have an end
user that we're also going to use to
request database assets so we're going
to click ascend here real quick now you
look at the basic headers here we're
going to click send and what it does is
it logs in based on the authentication
here and gives me an overview of what's
available for this particular user
so as this man I've got pretty much
everything in in that particular world
but you see zones here this is a
particulars owned that was created an
enterprise manager for databases of
service we've got database templates
that we'll use later on and you see a
number of templates that are available
here and then it also gives me an
overview of the things that have been
executed for that particular user so
we've got the family of opportunity here
as well but we also see service requests
and the status so as as you look at
integrating this with your particular
portal as an example or orchestration
solution this is the first place you're
going to go you're going to authenticate
into the basic home page if you will for
the restful api and if you want it to
display these things to the users as it
relates to the recent requests whether
they were successful or failed or
whatever the status might be you can
absolutely do that here so staying in as
sis man what I want to do is take a look
at now how do I create a service
template as
one example of how to use the REST API
so I'm gonna click on my call here to
post and I'm gonna look at my headers
and there's some standard headers here
umm no surprises here but I want to look
at the body because the bodies were
everything is really happening obviously
so if I look at integration with this
and and I look at how I would do this as
as an uh as an IT organization I would
provide input variables so as an example
as an end user I would provide the name
uh or as a cloud administrator excuse me
I would provide the name of the the
service template that I wanted to create
so let's say as an example we want to
create final 3 I've got some standard
input variables here got roles that are
available to assign to the service
template we've got the uh value here for
the cloud zone in the pool now this is
pulled from software pool so if we go to
another tab and pull the software pools
based on that authentication for sis man
you'll see I've got a number of pools
here I've got an HR pool zone I've got
an HR pool I've got a financial pool
this is the ID that we're pulling to
pull into this particular call so this
is a sub call to the software pools
available based on that user to create
this service template could be sis man
could be another user you don't have to
be sis man to do this as long as you
have cloud administrator privileges on
that user they would be able to do these
things and then they would pull this ID
as an input variable for this particular
pool in this particular zone and these
details are standard then we've got the
profile component you are n now this is
actually the reference to the DB profile
or service template we're going to use
this is this isn't actually two places
here so how do we get this in this
particular case if we scroll down you'll
see this is also referenced here so we
need this as the service template we're
going to use in order to create this
database now the service template in the
database profile the database profile is
essentially the blueprint for creating
the database so let's go to the command
line interface and see how this works
because we talked
about the command-line interface working
in conjunction with the restful api so
as we look at the command-line interface
you'll see we need to log in first so in
this particular case I'm logging in as
sis man but again this could be another
user with with enough privileges to
access the environment the login is this
man and then what I want to do is let's
say as an example I want to list the
entities in the software library and I
want to pull everything that's got the
dbca again input variables here so I can
list all of the entities within the
software library that have the word dbca
in them this is the particular service
template that I would like to use so now
I want to take one step further and I
want to pull that one and I can pull
that here now I can again with
programming here I can sort of tailor
the output here so this is actually an
input variable into the RESTful API call
if you will the building of the restful
api call based on the service template
name that i want to use or make
available or the database profile that i
want to make available for the service
template and in this particular case
i've sort of parsed it a little bit so
when i hit return on this it's going to
give me the line that i need to enter
into the restful api this is the exact
line that i need in order to execute the
restful call
so using emc li in conjunction with the
restful api i now have the capability to
pull the exact line i need which is
right here this would be the variable
inbound
so then i've got the reference zone that
we looked at here in the service pool
service pool here the reference zone is
right here so we can pull that from the
same call and see you see we're building
or sort of building out the completion
of the json body for a creation of a
service template the reference hosts
that will but will be in this particular
service template there's the pool that
we looked at earlier and in this
particular case i'm using filesystem
storage I could use ASM here as well and
then I that in that case I would
actually add details around the ASM
groups things of that nature
I'm turning log
I've a modem off so I don't want log
archive mode so again you see a number
of variables here that we're going to
incorporate into the service template
the service template is the blueprint
for creating the database from an end
user perspective the end user does not
enter any of this data we've answered
these questions ahead of time that's why
it's a simplification of a database
build for that particular end user so as
we scroll down the context of this
you'll see again here's our u RN we
looked at earlier our reference targets
and then we've got details around what
sort of prefix we want on our SID all
possible input variables that the end
user could could type in if you will arm
from from a creation perspective of
specific to administration once we
complete this then we post and execute
so what this is going to do is this is
going to create a service template now
where n is the cloud administrator
currently we're not an end user right
now this is the cloud administrator
executing through an automated solution
as an example the creation of the
service template so we hit send and it
will create the service template and
Enterprise Manager so you see down here
we've got a positive return it's created
that service template so in the interest
of validation let's go into Enterprise
manager's UI and go to the cloud
administrator area and let's take a
quick look to validate that our service
template is there and here it is so now
we have a service template built on the
restful api call here once this is
finished we can then close out as now
we've created an executed administrative
task specific to building a service
template from the cloud administrator
perspective so now what I want to do is
I want to go in and I want to go in as
an end user so I want to log into
Enterprise manager's restful api has SSA
P Combs which is my user and I want to
look at what's available for that
particular end user and as you saw with
the self with that assist assist man we
see the same thing for that particular
user now clearly there's not as much
available not as much there now you see
our service template is here
that's available to me based on the role
that was assigned to this service
template so this user is clearly part of
the role that was assigned to the
service template we created it and again
you see some additional service
templates and then at the bottom here
you will see service family types as we
had seen earlier and then you'll see
specific requests by this user only here
deletion of databases creation of things
of that nature so here's what you see
here so if we go more specifically to
the create statement as the user now I
want to ask for a database I'm going to
a plural on the backend
I'm calling enterprise manager's restful
api so the end user again certainly
doesn't see this what we want to do is
once we logged in as it relates to the
basic we want to pull or capture the
service template that we want to use so
as an example if we look more
specifically here's the service template
we created through the administrative
piece of the cloud API what I want to do
is is pull this and save this because
this is available to the end-user now
when the end-user asks for a particular
database we might list those templates
now they wouldn't see this but they
would see a nomenclature that you could
list for them that would identify
against that particular ID the user
would simply check it in the UI and it
would reference this particular ID for
that particular service template that
would give them what they needed in this
particular case a 12c are one single
instance database with no standby as you
can see here my standby requirement is
set to false if you're looking at it
from from a build perspective the UI
would simply give the user the
capability to check a box
do I want to standby database yes or no
uh which database do I want do I want it
I want a 12c are one database that's
single instance and I don't want to
standby so I don't check the box or I
check the box and it would say true so
here's why you here's where you would
manipulate the opportunity for the user
in the backend on the background what
you see here is an end user in the
database itself so when we create a
database and database as a service we
need to ensure we have a
user or an account on that database so
the end user can access this is what you
see here so if you look at it from a
portal perspective calling the restful
api I simply want to know what kind of
database do you want do you want a
standby database and what account you
want created so the end user would
answer three questions in that portal or
you would feed three answers into this
particular rest call from a fully
automated perspective as an example and
it would create the database so if we
finalize this and simply sit send we now
see it's going to make a call and it's
going to ask for a database
Oh my service name actually this is this
is good so you'll notice here that I had
a service name that was already being
used so if we received an error we could
change it quickly and resubmit
and so now we have a request ID here of
141 so it's been initialized and
scheduled
if we click directly on this or we were
to show this directly to the user or we
could send a return back to an automated
solution let's say puppet or chef as an
example we could send back a return code
based on the Status initialization if we
click on this link and go in as this
user we can see we've got detail it's
creating the database as we speak in
progress
so from an automation perspective we
could record this occasionally provide
status back to the automated tool to let
them know that we're actually executing
something and it hasn't failed and keep
executing this particular call to ensure
that the end users or the automated
solution received a positive return so
let's take a look at it from an
enterprise managers UI perspective again
only validating that the execution is
taking place because again we record
everything that's happening even if it's
a restful call through enterprise
managers common framework so if we go to
the UI and we go to enterprise
provisioning a patching and procedure
activity we'll notice that that database
is being created as we speak by this
particular user and we can see that as
well on the backend from an enterprise
management perspective recording this
current status of this particular bill
now once this completes we would then
receive information and you'll see this
when it completes connect string
information more details about the
account that was created so we can
return this information to the end-user
or we can capture these as input
variables as a return back to the
automated solution to do further
execution so if you look at this from an
automated fully automated perspective
we're returning information back to the
centralized orchestration tool letting
know things are good that we're
executing accordingly things are moving
as they see fit once it completes we
provide critical data that's going to be
needed to further integrate again TNS
Connect details as an example to
integrate with the middleware stack and
the application itself
arm providing um
sensitive details around this particular
build as it relates to the user accounts
that were created out there so we want
to provide that information so that if
we if we're not going to have an end
user interaction we want to provide
those as captured input variables for
further execution in a fully automated
solution and so we keep moving forward
with this in progress and this will
create the database while we're waiting
for that um we can check the ID here as
well not the ID that you see at the end
of this here
the 141 actually correlates if we go
back to the basic URL and login as this
user you'll notice at the end of the
return if we scroll all the way down to
the end you'll notice that this
particular call has been recorded for
this particular user here once it
succeeds it'll it'll show up here as an
execution is created so there's 139
it'll it'll record it at the end of it
once it succeeds it will show up here
the number correlating back to the
execution is always at the end of the
execution itself you'll notice that also
in the UI so if you had any questions as
to what the execution number was it's
actually sitting right at the end of the
call even in the UI so we're actually
executing 141
and we send the off the authorization
and you see here this particular piece
is also executing so we're seeing the
same exact thing here just doing a check
request data at the same exact call
once this completes then we have the
opportunity to delete and what you'll
see in the delete here is there's a list
of resource instances so first we want
to find out list all the resources that
are available to that particular user
and that's what you see here so no
assets this user right now we click on
this particular detail here
and what we'll see is once it's created
we'll have a total instance availability
here and we'll see this particular
instance listed
so we can continue to check status on
this particular instance
and again as you see here in the UI as
we talked about earlier we also see the
same details in the UI itself and this
usually in this particular environment
usually takes about seven minutes so we
get about three more minutes on this
particular execution
you
and once this complete then we can list
those instances and we get the ID
required to delete the delete is
actually a put on one call based on the
ID for that particular so what you could
do on the UI when you're building out or
you could automate this let's say as an
example we've got the creation of the
database asset based on extraction of
source code from a source control
control system
they execute they change they test they
validate and when they were to
reintroduce the code or check the code
back in to the source control system you
could theoretically make an automated
call to the RESTful API and Enterprise
Manager and delete the database asset
automatically so this would further
automate the solution end-to-end so
really what the end user did was simply
check out the code check out the code
get an intern Ohta fication that their
assets been created execute manipulate
the code test the code check the code
back in once the codes check back in we
make a call to delete the asset
automatically the user never talked to
anybody to ask for a database the user
never interacted with anything other
than the source control system and they
got the assets they needed quickly with
full automation no touch from an
infrastructure perspective and then we
release that asset when the end user was
complete or finished with that
particular asset
so once this creates we'll take a look
at the deletion of the particular
database itself while we're waiting for
that I want to take a quick look at the
restful api cookbook so this is the
restful api cookbook as martin outlined
earlier the objective of this document
really was to provide a really nice best
practices roadmap on how to execute one
of the things we wanted to do is provide
some information about how to sort of
validate your JSON bodies I like to use
this particular JSON
body valid JSON code validation tool
there's a there's a lot of them out
there on the Internet this one actually
is pretty easy pretty cut-and-dry and so
what we do is we simply just drop our
body in and just validate so as an
example if I was to actually take
something out it would actually show me
an error in that particular space I was
missing something there it would give me
some context details as to what it was
looking for its what it expected putting
the comma back in it validates my JSON
this is kind of important because when
you start looking at these JSON bodies
to get kind of complicated and the
syntax has to be exact as we all know so
it really is nice to look at a
particular validation tool and this is
the one I like to use we go back to the
cookbook itself some good information
around administration and again Crean
postscript execution so with all of
these service templates we have the
capability as outlined earlier a bit pre
and post execution so let's say as an
example we have a service template and
after the database is created again
fully automated from from an
orchestration solution we wanted to
automatically also update a
configuration management database this
is where you would execute a perl script
as an example to abstract dynamic
variables about that database build and
update those via the command line or
excuse me via the CMDB api totally
automated same thing goes for the delete
prior to a deletion we could run a
backup of the database of our man script
as an example in post database deletion
we could take it out of configuration
management databases automatically
another good use case there is
post database creation we can actually
integrate with your security framework
whether that's identity management
whatever the case may be we can
integrate that database into that job
that security framework in a fully
automated fashion so as you know the use
case I had mentioned earlier around you
know code extraction from a source
control system once that database is
created we still need to maintain all
the security framework all the
authentication and entitlements for that
particular database we can do this with
a post Perl script as an example against
that particular database and that
security framework then of course some
examples of some operational
implementation as well so if we scroll
down look at some of the details here
what we wanted to do is provide all the
information needed to implement the
command line interface the JSON body
validation tool we provide
recommendations here as we've outlined
earlier and the integration
opportunities we wanted to discuss
creation and administration of zones so
this is the actual call to create a zone
and you see here on the left hand side
the e/m command line interface execution
that would be required in order to enter
something within that particular
environment so again getting things like
the credential GUI D as an example is
something we would need in the body of
this particular JSON call and so that's
what you would use to get that
particular credential and that actually
is right here so that's how you would
actually get that so we wanted to
provide something that was giving to
give you the capability to pull things
cleanly and easily so the e/m CLI on the
restful api work closely together if we
scroll down further you'll see things in
examples on pool creation so here's how
I would get my targets that I would need
from an Oracle home perspective because
a pool is essentially an Oracle home or
a group of Oracle homes and again if we
scroll down further we've got credential
requirements here and then of creation
of quotas so we could administrate the
quotas as well through the restful api
moving on further we've got resource
administration capabilities
database profile creations through EMC
Li here and provided some good
information on best practices around you
know provisioning the flow of
implementation of database as a service
is seen here and of course the offerings
the service templates are willing to
offer here moving on down we wanted to
give you some context around creating
the service templates themselves so this
is how you would create an 11 gr for
with stand by using a database template
this is going to create the service
template that the end users would call
later and as you see here I've got
details as it relates to the restful
call that would be made in order to get
the resource details for the zone here
and as well we've got the emc li call to
pull that we had seen earlier which is
the you are n number requirement with
that would relate to the database
profile that i want to use for this
particular service template so this is
the same context that you'd seen earlier
when we were doing the restful call
itself scrolling on down further you'll
see we've also got one for 12c
and if we move on down further there's
some specific details around service pre
and post scripts so this is an example
of a Perl script that would be pre and
post so this is an actual output of what
you would see when you created a
database so you see all the details here
these this is an example of a list of
all the variables that are available to
use to put in a Perl script post
database creation if we scroll on down a
little further you've got an actual Perl
script that parses these things and this
particular script has some input
variables here
and an execution as as as an execution
here to make directories as an example
this is an actual integration with a
particular security framework
so we scroll on down further you'll see
some specific details on how to
implement that particular or create a
particular command-line interface
executioner or PostScript creation
because all of the pull scripts are
actually saved in the software library
so let's go back to the restful api and
check our status on our database bill
okay so the database is ready so we've
got our database name the database ready
status we see the details here on the
connect string we want to provide that
to the user we've got some additional
details on uptime so if we wanted to
actually provide you know when the user
logs in some initial understanding of
the uptime and details there we've got
some additional details on space CPU so
a lot of good information about the
status of this particular build for this
particular database so if we go back to
listing and we go in as sis man
we'll see a listing of all of the
services available when we see our
listing there so here's our database we
just built owned by this particular
users status up this is the global UID
for this particular database creation I
want to capture this and make it
available to the end user to delete so
they would have a list of databases as
an example that would be referenced by
this global UID now of course the end
user or the automated solution would
reference this the users would not see
this information so we would make a call
then to delete this database based on
that particular ID
and so what we're doing here is if you
look at in the context of full
automation we're now deleting this
database because the users are completed
finished with the database as indicated
earlier with the use case around source
code they're finished with the database
they check the code in we know the ID
for the database that they asked for
requested earlier we construct the URL
we do a put we execute the headers
accordingly and we delete this database
so when I hit Send on this it's going to
go into Enterprise Manager and it's
going to submit the deletion of that
database so there's our ID for deletion
so we can check the status of that 1:42
here by just simply changing the name on
the end here the ID on the end logging
in and we see here the creation has been
the deletion has been created and so we
can watch this until the deletion is
finished so it's in progress right now
again we'll go back to the UI just for
validation that Enterprise Manager is
watching everything you do regardless of
UI or restful api here we see it's
deleting the database so we go back to
the restful api
and it will delete the database in
progress and it's destroying a database
as we speak so this is a nice overview
quickly of the capabilities of the
restful api in conjunction with the e/m
command-line interface as you've seen
there's a lot of capability here the
last thing I want to look at from a
demonstration perspective is um an
example of a call from the command line
so what I've done here is created a
really basic script that will call uh
this is a case yell script very basic
obviously you could do this in Python
you can do this in Java whatever
whatever your language flavor is and
what I wanted to do is just provide a
quick context here what this looks like
so I've created a script here and this
curl is going to call the URL that we
had in the RESTful API and postman and
I've parsed it a little bit and sort of
turned it into to some variables there
so I hop out of this and we want to
execute this I would simply provide
input variables to the user ID which
would be sis man in this case or we
could use the SSA he Combs and the
password input variable is would be
dynamic as an example in this case
welcome one and it'll it'll call in and
so you see the same return that we had
seen through postman so this is
extremely powerful a lot of capability
just a quick example of what that would
look like and of course we would parse
this and they present it to the end-user
as an example or we would parse this and
present the returns to a fully automated
solution so we'll go back to postman
take a quick look at our delete and our
delete looks like it's complete we
successfully completed it so this
database is no longer available to this
particular end user and that completes
the lifecycle of an execution for the
restful api so let's recap from an
administrative perspective we created a
service template we used a standard body
with input variables to create the
service template and we could certainly
create another service template as we
speak we can change
define the roles we used eeehm
command-line interface as well as
additional calls to the restful api for
input variables which you saw here and
in is of course which you saw here
through the e/m command-line interface
we then executed the creation of the
service template once we created the
service template we then logged out and
log back in as an end-user and created a
database based on the availability of
the resources available to that
particular end-user with the home page
call if you will to the restful api
presenting these to an automated
solution or presenting them to the user
with whatever front-end you would see
fin created the database status the
database and then deleted the database
and of course we took a look at a quick
k shell script with curl so let's go
back and of course we looked at the
restful api cookbook to give you guys
some best practices on how to execute
that so that's a nice overview of the
restful api for database as a service in
conjunction with the e/m command-line
interface
hope you enjoyed and hope it get you
guys down the road with fully automation
with your DevOps opportunities Thank You
Pat thank you very much that was a great
presentation and demo so at this point
I'd like to see if we have any questions
from our audience you can unmute
yourself by pressing pound 6 and I do
see one chat question on there I'm not
sure if it was answered from Kevin when
customizing DPS how do I know which
built in interface which variables I can
use in different show languages for
example K shell or Perl
I have answered it Martin
basically the deployments the Shriekers
which is used by the cloud management
back or the self-service users they are
not available for customizations and the
variables which given and looking for as
posted the link from where he can pick
up all those input variables okay thank
you should be
any other questions from our audience do
do it this is Francis from young people
do we have restful api there we can
integrate into TCS
- what if you want to take care of me
too
yeah the short answer is that yeah your
short answer is you're talking about
Cloud Foundry um sure is yeah yeah the
short answer is yes it be the same call
to the restful restful api to provision
the assets in that particular space
okay um is there any link of some promo
from on documentation for that well we
can review internally yeah yeah we can
certainly take it offline um I've
actually done some work with college
foundry myself um and sort of uh uh for
lack of a better term played around with
it a little bit um so let's take this
offline definitely we should get
together and look at the use case and
sort of construct something that's going
to be more specific to your liking okay
is it's not perfect yes sir okay okay
I'll process on one people that's fine
I'll send you or send you email yeah
let's chat absolutely okay thanks
any other questions it
okay it looks like we have no more
questions and perfect timing with the
top of the hour so I'd like to thank
everyone for attending today hope you
found this enjoyable and very much would
like to thank Pat for the presentation
and demo and Shuba deep for helping out
with the Q&amp;amp;A so thank you everyone for
attending and have a great day bye-bye
