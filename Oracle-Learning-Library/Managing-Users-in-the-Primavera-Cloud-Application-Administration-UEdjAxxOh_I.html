to manage users for the Primavera cloud
in this video we'll look at adding users
managing their accounts and application
access and creating partner companies
let's start with an overview of the
cloud administration application which
will refer to as simply the admin
application cloud users are stored in an
application called Oracle Identity
Manager or oh I am the admin application
provides a simple interface for managing
users and works by writing information
to oim all administration should be
performed in the admin application oh I
am should only be used for users to set
up challenge questions and reset their
own passwords other actions performed in
oh I M are not supported by Oracle
customer support inside the admin
application users are stored in a table
options are available to quickly filter
by user status you can select multiple
filters then use the only option to
select a single filter you can also
search to find users when you select the
checkboxes for users buttons become
present with actions that are available
for those users to add a new user start
typing in the blank row at the top of
the table enter basic information for
the user such as name and email address
assign a company to the user companies
are used to grants partner access for
Primavera unifier a users password
policy is also controlled by the
assigned company
lastly assign access to cloud
applications when finished save your
changes a notification indicates the
changes have been processed any errors
will be reported here and the log will
provide additional details for further
investigation after creating a user it
may be necessary to configure
permissions and privileges within the
applications he has access to once this
is complete reset the users password to
email him a temporary password for a
single user there are options to auto
generate a password or manually change
it when resetting the passwords for
multiple users new passwords are
auto-generated and emailed to the users
note that there is no prompts Save
Changes and the password reset is
executed immediately
users can also be imported in bulk from
a spreadsheet to do so first create a
template for entering user data add the
application access to be included in the
template using the shift key to select
multiple options when finished open the
resulting zip file two items are present
a readme file with instructions on using
the template and the template itself
inside the template add users by
entering their basic information
to assign application access enter a Y
in the appropriate columns when finished
save the spreadsheet you can then import
it into the admin application use the
manage application access button to add
and remove application access for users
with a single user use the right and
left arrows to add or remove access when
managing access for multiple users the
list of application access options is
presented select an option from the list
then select the checkbox for a user to
add access or clear the checkbox to
remove it
users can become locked after too many
bad password attempts they can use
challenge questions to reset their
passwords and become unlocked but if
there is an issue with that process
users can be unlocked in the admin
application select the checkbox for a
locked user and the unlock button
becomes available
this action is executed immediately
after unlocking users it may be
necessary to reset their passwords when
users leave an organization or otherwise
no longer require access to the cloud
their accounts should be disabled
disabled users can be enabled again
these actions are executed immediately
let's finish up by looking at managing
companies and password policies will
start with companies on this page you
can add a new company as the child of
the parents company you can also view
and edit the properties of an existing
company including its assigned password
policy whether the policy is inherited
from the parents and application
environments to which it's granted
partner access when application access
is assigned
the company is automatically created in
the application environment note that if
you change the password policy for an
existing company with users assigned the
new policy will not be enforced until
the affected users change their
passwords when doing so it is therefore
recommended that you reset the passwords
of the affected users now let's look at
password policies on this page you can
add new password policies and view and
edit the properties of existing ones all
policies have basic settings assigned
such as minimum length and how often
they expire those that are assigned the
complex policy type use predefined
settings for required characters and
disallowed items use the custom policy
type to define these settings and others
such as maximum repeated characters
allowed and maximum password lame on the
assigns company's detail window you can
view the companies that a policy is
assigned to as well as assign it to or
remove it from multiple companies
simultaneously as previously discussed
password policy changes are not enforced
until the affected users change their
passwords therefore if you edit the
rules of a policy or change the
companies it's assigned to it is
recommended that you reset the passwords
