gel effects team and I'm the technical
lead for the co components today I want
to talk a little bit about how you can
use Java vex to write business
applications so usually when you first
hear about GFX it's lots about you know
cool graphics and nice animations and
doing all of this kind of fancy stuff
but let's face it most of us don't do
this really in the daily life they may
do it for fun but you want to write
business applications for for living &amp;amp;
gell effects has lots of features that
makes that really easy and that's what I
want to talk about today so first a
little a couple of words about me I do
live in Prague I was born in Germany but
five years ago I moved to Prague and
this is actually really what it looks
like in Prague so it's not Disneyland or
anything this is a child's bridge the
Prague Castle here and the Cathedral so
the only exception is usually you have
many more tourists running around here
it's really crowded with tourists I have
two daughters with whom I spend most of
my free time and I like to cook and to
eat but what's probably most important
in this context is how I'm involved with
JavaFX
so when I joined Sun Microsystems pretty
much five years ago my very first major
project was the JavaScript compiler so
at that time as many of you probably
still remember Jeff X whatnot was not
only a library but it was also a new
scripting language that we designed
JavaScript and the JavaScript compiler
would not take an application that was
written in JavaScript and compile that
to bytecode so you could run it on any
VM that was my first project add some
Microsystems after awhile we figured
that gel effects would make much more
fun and much more sense if it doesn't
run only on on desktop but also in
mobile devices but now remember I'm
talking out for four years ago right
Jeff X one time so what we experience
right now it's kind
DejaVu that suddenly is moving to mobile
again at that time we created a new
project Java X mobile and and the the
task was to make gel vex available on
Java ME devices CLG see phones small
feature phones and in this project I was
mainly responsible for runtime
optimizations of performance
optimizations I think I didn't write any
new feature at all during that time but
it was just analyzing the runtime and
rewrote large parts to make it faster
and actually make it possible to run it
on a small phone because it was
originally developed for desktop so
people were just wasting memory and
doing things not as efficient as you
could have done them and I had to
rewrite them so you could run them on
the small phone two years ago when the
large restructure or the reor came and
and we changed the whole focus of Java
effects to make it pure Java library I
became the technical lead for Java FX
core components the core components are
the Java properties so we extended the
Java Bean properties and added some more
functionality that you often use on
clients that you often need on clients
then the core components contain the
binding API with that you can write all
kinds of expressions and bind that to a
property and whenever one of the
operands and this expression expression
changes it gets really ated and the
property is updated automatically which
makes which helps you to get rid of lots
of boilerplate code in your in your
application because you just define this
binding once and then you can forget
about it and you don't have to think
about okay and at what points do I have
to update now or recalculate this
expression and set this property again
also the core components contain the new
collections we added we have observable
collections because it makes a lot of
sense on the client specifically that
you want to watch and a collection and
get notifications if it
Changez and the last part is the
animation API animation framework which
doesn't really fit to the rest but since
I rewrote it twice during my time in the
JFX mobile project
I knew it best so it kind of just moved
with me and it became also part of the
tale of the core components okay um yeah
I work for Oracle so I have to show you
this I guess since this is the third day
of gel one you have seen it a couple of
times and hopefully somebody who
actually understands what's written
there has explained it to you so I'll
just skip it and consider done so let's
take a look at today's agenda so about a
half year ago I think I wrote a little
application which is very simple
actually but it already contains them
some of the features a typical business
application would have so first I'll
show you this application to impress end
it to you a little bit and then I'll
talk a little bit more about the process
how I actually implemented this
application and how this differs from
from how you would do it in swing
typically so we'll talk about the
process and then I'll tech talk more
about the different steps we're going to
the details of the steps defining the
view how to do data binding and also how
to do the styling with CSS
okay the sample application is called
Jack P which stands for just another
conference planner so I don't know why
everybody is now writing conference
planner nowadays I guess it just makes
sense if you talk at a conference so I
just wrote another one you can see the
interface but actually I want to show
you the real thing so um
yeah you have a search field up here you
can search for sessions and for speakers
click on this so you get a list of
results maybe didn't really see that on
started new so you can see it okay so
you have a search box you can search for
four sessions and speakers click on it
you get the information the abstract etc
so you can click on the speaker get
other sessions the speakers doing don't
be confused this is actually still the
old data from last year's gel one
if--like I'm sorry about that I forgot
to update it with the current schedule
so don't get confused if you don't know
the or if you haven't heard about those
sessions yet they're from last year okay
so how does how is the application
implemented internally so I use a Java
EE application which was written by
Aaron Gupta to showcase some of the new
features of Java EE 6 and that's running
on a GlassFish server here on my
notebook it gets the data from a
database Java DB in this case and in
addition to providing a web interface
this Java EE application also has a
restful interface I'm using that and
wrote a client using Java FX for
communication with the restful web
service I'm using Jersey yeah so that's
basically it's a simple application but
as you can see it's also it's already on
representative for how you would do a
business application ok now let's take a
look at the process
I'll start by describing how the process
typically is works nowadays when you
swing and then I will later explain how
this has changed now this is improved by
when you use gel effects or how this can
be improved when you use Java effects so
first the UX designer usually starts to
think about the usability he develop
designs the user interface the views
maybe specifies some wireframes and
passes that to the developer who then
implements the specification in Java and
actually makes it available in as a
program and the reason this is done is
that a UX designer usually doesn't
really know how to code himself I mean
he has other skills but he's not Java
coda so it has to write the information
down somehow pass it to the Java
developer and the developer implements
it developer ants the business logic and
after while hopefully rather sooners and
then later a graphical design is added
to the team who will of whose role is to
or his job is to make the whole thing
look nice and again the graphic designer
has to specify
the design and pass it to the developer
who has to implement it in code and as
we can see already here this creates a
rather non optimal process because we
have a huge bottleneck here in the
middle
everybody has to communicate and wait
for the developer until he actually
implements the changes and as you can
imagine this is um is really a
frustrating process because the UX
designer has to write everything down
pasady to the developer the developer
may be in a meeting and then when he
comes back he started to implement the
changes when he's done the UX designer
may may already have left so the next
day they continue to work on that and
it's really a surprising how long it
actually takes to create very simple
windows with such a process and um the
other thing that this or yeah the other
thing what's bad about this process is
that the feedback loop for the UX
designer and the graphic designer are
very very long which makes them makes
the whole process very efficient as well
as we know from agile development one of
the most important features is one of
the most important tasks is to make the
feedback loop as small or as short as
possible
by feedback loop I mean the time between
making a change and seeing the result of
a change and you want to try to make
that as short as possible the best is if
you can just you make the change and you
see the result immediately to give you
an example in coding when my father was
when he was at university he tried to
study programming and at that time it
worked in a well in a way that when he
had a task an assignment to do he wasn't
able to use the computer himself but he
had to write everything on paper pass
that to the IT Center who would
implement it in the computer and the
next day usually he got the output what
was most of the times
compiler error because it's it's really
hard to write code on paper so it's no
wonder that got very frustrated and quit
after half a year and compare that to
nowadays nowadays which is type and the
new code and you see syntax errors
immediately I mean the IDE shows it
pretty much value type and you become
much faster in developing simple
applications and you can actually write
applications which are much more complex
more complex than you would ever be able
to write when you use this old process
of writing stuff down on paper and
waiting a day for the result so for us
for the developers things have improved
dramatically but those two guys are
actually still in this IT stone-age but
now I don't want to to make swingbed
here I mean we shouldn't forget the time
when swing was developed was different
the world was a different place at that
time when you developed an application
you didn't know about you a UX designer
X designers I mean this is a very new
concept I guess most of us have her
first or the first time about it and in
recent years I don't even know if if a
Job Description like a UX designer
existed when swing was developed so you
didn't really worry about that this much
and also on the other side you didn't
use a graphical designer to make your
business application appear very well
designed and that time it just didn't
matter for business applications right I
mean business applications were supposed
to do work they weren't supposed to to
make fun so designers worked on games
and things like that but not on business
applications but now this has changed in
recent years there are a bunch of
applications consumer applications
mostly but also pretty much all new
websites are very well designed they're
they're very simple to use and people
come to expect that from the business
applications when they go to work as
well but there's another reason why this
is important nowadays we just figured
that
very well-designed simple to use webinar
interfaces use interfaces also make
people much more productive so it's not
only about you know making work more
pleasant which is a good reason by
itself in my opinion but it also is
really about productivity and making
applications more more efficient or make
the people who use the applications more
efficient so um
so it's not only about making things
more fun but also to make to make the
people more efficient socially creating
business value so nowadays if you create
a business application you have to make
it look good it's really important it's
it's a key feature of applications
nowadays and that means we have now this
process when you work with swing and jar
of X now can help you to make this
process much more efficient and one way
to do it is um so1
feature we added that makes that
possible if is F XML so f XML as a
standard data format to specify user
interfaces for JavaFX and what's really
what makes this very powerful feature is
that you can now exchange the
information information about user
interfaces between different tools in
the past when you created a user
interface let's say NetBeans you are not
able to use it another and another a DES
in another IDE you enter you're able to
use it in Eclipse or other tools so you
had to use a specific tool in a project
and you were stuck with that now we have
this as in Java X we have the standard
this standard data format and now you
can use on the the one IDE you really
like and you can actually switch it in a
project if somebody prefers NetBeans go
for it if you prefer Eclipse go for it
no problem you can exchange the
information and use the graphical
builders which will be built for the
ideas hopefully but what makes it even
what's even more important what makes it
possible is to create now tools that
don't behave like a typical IDE I guess
most of you have seen the symbol already
that's possible now because we have this
data format now we have a tool where you
can put somebody who's non-technical to
create um to create the user interface
that creates F XML and you
you stand in your java application and
the Java developer can still use the IDE
who wants to use and use that F XML data
on the other side for the graphical
designer we made it possible to use CSS
in an application and again this allows
the graphical designer to make changes
himself because graphical designers
usually don't know how to write Java
code but pretty much all of them know
how to write CSS because in the past or
they have created web interfaces so with
Java X the graphic designer can now
change the CSS file in itself load the
application with the new style sheet and
then see the updated or the interface
with the new design and you can see his
changes right on the spot so we made it
possible not only to to reduce this
bottle or make get rid of the bottleneck
which is get back not only to get rid of
the bottleneck because I mean the people
still have to communicate but they don't
have to wait for the developer all the
time so it's not as as blocking anymore
and also we made it possible that the
feedback loop for these two guys here
the UX design and the graphic designer
is now short as well he gets feedback
immediately and it doesn't have to wait
for for what what his changes look like
in the real application so in all of
these components the Java code the F XML
and datas and the CSS stylesheets all of
that together now as gel effects
application so it's not only Java code
it's F XML Java and CSS
so that were some the process and how it
can be improved when you use Chawla fax
and use the new features Java decks
allow so let's take a look at some of
the steps here starting with the view so
for the application I use the scene
builder to create the view is anybody
here who hasn't seen the scene builder
yet okay so I'll just skip that I'm not
going to show it you've seen it it's
really easy to use you can just drag and
drop stuff you can from from over here
on the screen you edit the properties
over here and even a non-technical
person arm can use it as we Houston and
my form come of you is to say my former
company it's written for managers in
little children and so now we have this
F XML code this F XML file now the
question is how we can actually use that
in our java application and to explain
that I'll make a step back and explain
how the Java FX application in general
or from high-level view is is set up so
the outer container is a stage or the
outer frame and the stage is an
abstraction and it depends on the
platform you're running on what this
actually becomes on on a desktop system
this is translated into window so
whenever you use the stage just think of
it of a window but there are other
platforms which may not have you know
the concept of a window and there the
stage translates into something
different so it's just an abstraction to
make the concept of a window
cross-platform within that stage you put
a scene and the scene is the real
content that we want to show you can
replace scenes and move it around
between stages do all kinds of nice
things and the actual content is
declared in the scene graph so that's a
tree it has a route
and the leaf notes down here the these
are the elements you want to put on the
screen so it could be text it could be
an image a shape a video and whatnot and
the advantage of this in Revit is it
makes it very simple to manipulate the
data because now you can just take this
group for example and move it around and
all the children will be moved and
rotated and you can scale it and do all
kinds of neat things on the group level
and if you have a good structure of your
scene graph your code becomes very easy
it becomes very easy to manipulate your
use interface now you may wonder ok this
is nice if you start from scratch with a
new application so what if I have a
swing application but I still want to
use the new features of Java effects
there's a way to do that there's a
special class jfx panel which is a J
component so you can use it wherever you
can use a J component in the application
and in that GFX panel again you put a
scene or the scene graph and that way
you can use Java FX components in your
swing application
okay so this was just a high-level views
on how how an application is built in
Java Thanks
now we can take a quick look at how F
XML looks so this is not really exactly
the the code that was generated by the
scene builder but I I formatted it and
made it more human readable so but
essentially this is actually what the
scene builder created and you can
already see the structure of the scene
graph you have the written of the root
note up here you have children kinds of
different layout containers and again
children here you have enter abuse for
example the the VIII box is a layout
container that aligns elements in a
column and the spacing defines the space
between sorry defines the space between
those elements so if you if you know the
Java of X API you can actually get a
very good impression of what this F X F
XML code code should or what it
describes just by looking at the the
attributes which are translated to
properties and the sub elements which
are also other properties and new notes
and the scene graph okay and to get this
data into your application you just have
to use this simple one-liner there's a
class F XML loader with the method load
you pass in it would give the URL to
your gif XML file so this can be a file
in your file system but it can also be a
file in the web doesn't matter the FX
Mulder will get it
it will parse the F XML file generate
the scene graph that is defined by that
and give you back the root note off that
scene graph and then you can just take
that pass it to the scene and you're
done well not on not really but
at least you can see what the UX
designer created on screen what you want
to add now is or what you want as a
developer want to do now is at the
behavior and access those elements so
how we do how do we do that
we use the concept of controllers for
that so for each of XML file there's
this special attribute that you define
for the root node in our case it was a
split pane and here's the important
attribute FX controller and there you
pass the full class name of your
controller and when the F XML order
hits this attribute it will generate an
instance of this class and then hook
this class up with the cigarette graph
it is generating sorry this is all done
in runtime yeah so how do you hook it up
in the F XML you can define a special
attribute ID for example search result
list you can specify this in the scene
builder for example there's a text field
waken at the the ID and then it's some
it's put into the F XML code so you put
use that in your F XML code and in your
java code you have now a field in the
controller which has exactly the same
name so here the idea is called the ID
is called search result list and here
the field is called search result list
then you add this annotation F XML and
that's it you're done
so when the FX malodor comes to to note
or Crenn generates a note which has an
ID specified it looks for field or the
same name and then make sure that this
field points to that note
so with that you have you can define
references to all the important notes in
the scene graph that you want to access
from your controller the other way how
you can set things up are PR event
handlers so JAF X is heavily based on
event handlers whenever the user
something an event gets fired and you
can or you can give you can add event
handlers to all notes to become notified
by this so here I have the text field
remember the the application had the
search text field and whenever you type
something and stop typing for I think
half a second or something
it started to search or it started to
search for all sessions for example that
have this string which is missing in
this text field somewhere in the title
so to do this I added a key type tango
or you defined a key typed handler which
is called every time you press a key so
in this case I wanted to make sure every
time the key gets pressed in the in the
text field I'll start a timer and when
the timer is up and the user hasn't the
type and a t penny key for half a second
I'll start a request with the curve with
the current value of that text field so
in here you define another ID you add
this little hash and then put there the
the name of your event handler on key
type that's how the the event is called
and and the Java code you just have a
method with exactly the same name again
and you add the effects of el annotation
and that's it so now every time the user
types something here in the text field
this method will be called so I think
you can see it I you know blended it out
a little bit but here I'm just called
starting the timer from scratch okay so
and with that you're actually really
done now you have you have the data you
can now you can load it and put it on
the screen you can get references to all
the important notes that you want to
manipulate later and you can also attach
event handlers to the to the scene graph
that gets generated from the F XML code
so now I want to dive a little bit into
layouts
because I think they're very important
for business applications and I haven't
seen anything this year any talk about
layout so I'll go quickly through that
so we have different layout classes here
we have an H box it takes a list of
children and then aligns them in a
horizontal row you can change the
behavior you can change the alignment so
here all of the notes are centered
vertically you can add padding around if
you want to you can define how large the
spacing is between these elements etc
there's also the V box which creates a
column then we have the border pane it
has these five regions and then you can
specify okay I want to this for example
on this node which is the status bar I
want to have it at the bottom and my
main screen will go to the center and
then this border pane will make sure
that this works so standard layout
container I think we have the anchor
pane here you specify or here you can
anchor the the sides of the child nodes
to the sides of the container and you
can also define some office defined some
offset and then the child nodes will be
layout it so they have exactly the the
distance between their top border for
example and the top border of that
layout container if you anchor it on
both sides like here this layout will
try to resize your child node if it's
possible I mean if it's a note that can
be resized it will be resized by this
control about this layout sorry here we
have for the stack pane it takes number
of child's and puts them on top of each
other this can be very useful if you
want to change the look of of a control
based on it's in a state so for example
say you want to show an LED and based on
some boolean variable it should be on
and off so then you can use stank pane
for that
you have the both images here on top of
each other
and based on the state of this boolean
variable you can just make sure you just
make sure that the proper image is on
top we have the grid pain it behaves
exactly I would say as tables in HTML at
the time when it was still cool to do
layout with HTML tables in gel effects
it is still cool we just renamed it it's
called grid pain and our table pain but
it really gives you the exact same
behavior and for all of these layout
deals you have for a lot of these
layouts you have many properties to
change the behavior you can specify the
the alignment of those child nodes you
can specify some padding etc then we
have from the title pane that looks at
all the children and figures out the
maximum width and the maximum height and
then it creates tiles so that it fits
and each child gets one tile and then it
aligns them in this pre regular looking
shape so you can easily imagine that
using that for something like a file
explorer where you have the icons in a
regular grid and the last layout
container is the flow paint that just
takes the the child nodes and puts them
in a row you define a spinner width of
that for example then it puts on the
elements in a row and the when it
doesn't oh the first element that
doesn't fit anymore will be put in the
second row and then it starts to fill
that role again until you're all up
containers all of the child elements are
set up that way so I want to be honest
with you at this point whenever I use
the layout API how can you say that
nicely
just say the layout API is full of
surprises for me it very often does not
really behave in a way that I expected
it and I want to point out two things
which gave me lots of troubles in the
beginning just to make sure that you
don't run into the same issues again one
is some there are a bunch of properties
with which you can change how how layout
some are or how layouts look then but
the issue is there are actually three
possibilities to to change those
properties so some properties like the
layout X can be set on the child nodes
directly so layout X with that you can
define an additional offset after the
the child was layout it to to be at a
certain position you can add certain
offset to move it and you do that on the
child node directly it has a property
layout X to do that other properties are
set on the container node so for the V
box if you want to set the alignment of
all the children you set that on the V
box directly poops that's not really
right I'll have to fix it um so let's
say this is Center for example so I
think that's possible position
so with that you would say that all the
charts which are aligned in the column
should be centered in respect to each
other but there's a third approach some
properties are set like this you call
aesthetic method on the container node
you pass in the child and then the value
of that property and that's what what
was kind of confusing for me in the
beginning because I always forgot this
last one what makes it even worse it the
way you find a certain property changes
depending on
on which lay out pain you're using so
for example the alignment for the V box
it is set on the container note directly
for other layout containers it is set
here with this construct and I mean I
understand why there are three
approaches
all of them are necessary I guess but
makes things very confusing at times so
this one is usually used for properties
that make sense for all layout
containers like this often offset you
can you can find it no matter which
layer containers you're actually using
this one here is used for properties
that change the behavior of all the
children so here if you set the
alignment you set it for all the
children in this sum V box and this one
is used for properties which make only
sense for certain layout containers not
for others but it is used for single
child so I can see that all three
approaches are necessary but it makes
things confusing so just as a reminder
when you when you're looking for a
certain property and you want to change
something remember there are three
approaches and make sure that you look
in the documentation form for all of the
the approaches okay the other thing I'm
often having trouble with is the way how
the size is defined how it is used for
the child nodes but also how the size of
the container node of the layout pane
ISM is specified I haven't really
figured out how or the design goal was
behind that so but what what I have
found is even though it's the part of
the jar of Xavier the layout API is the
part that's the part of the Java API I
have most trouble with it is also the
part that's most or that's best
documented in my opinion so it really
makes sense for layouts if you read the
documentation thoroughly
I mean you know we all kind of read
javadocs but not really for layout it
really makes sense use the letter loop
use the documentation and whenever you
find that the layout doesn't behave the
way you expected you will find the
answer in the documentation because it's
really very well described what's
happening there and how for example the
size is calculated for certain layouts
okay let's take a look at data binding
when we look at this little overview of
the architecture the data comes from the
database it's processed here in the java
application provided as restful web
service and right here by Jersey I'll
not talk about the parts up here
I assume you probably know them better
than I do but when I look at closer is
this part down here so for the data
comes in from Jersey as XML I think and
to to parse this and to deserialize it
I'm using Jack's B and yeah this is how
I guess you know this already as well
you define an XML root element is used
this annotate annotation for for a class
and then for all the sub elements in the
XML code which match property in your
class you use that XML element and what
this Jack's be API expects here is a
Java Bean what we want to use in a jar
of X application is a gel effects
property but as you will see as because
the Java X property extend the concept
of a Java Bean it's really easy to to
mix Jack's be at this point and Java X
properties because we just need to want
to do this we just declare a job X
property so this is an interface defined
in the Java Runtime here we have an
implementation of that simple string
property which is the simplest approach
to create a property you pass in two
parameters in the constructor
this the first one is a reference to the
containing beam of this property so in
this case it's a reference to the
speaker and the second one is the name
of the property so you declare that and
then we just forward the cost to the
getter and the setter to the getter in
the center of this object down here
because it's a string property it has a
getter and setter and which is forwarded
and with that exp is actually happy so
with that it would already work but to
make it a proper jfx property we have to
provide one additional method and that's
this ID property by convention it uses
the name of the property and this
property string and it just returns a
reference to this object down here so
that you can as a user of this speaker
class you can then use the features that
we added to the to the Java Bean concept
and which are implemented here in this
or which are access or accessible via
this string property and with that
you're basically done that's it and it's
really straightforward and easy to use
now we can get XML data we use Jack's B
to pause it and put it into a class
which already defines JavaFX properties
now if you don't know what why why you
would actually use the Java X property
instead of a standard Java Bean here's a
little example how you can use it I'll
go through this step-by-step so with
this proper with this expression which
declares your binding we want to show
the ID of the currently selected speaker
in a label so this label is a text field
that we use it has a text property and
all the properties in the Java FX API
are Java thanks properties so it also
has this method to get the property
object
we then call the bind method on this
property with which we tell the run time
now we want to bind this property to a
certain value after that you cannot set
this property directly anymore but it
will be updated as soon as this
expression here changes it will
automatically be updated and here we use
some the bindings class which create
which provides many factory methods to
define bindings easily the Select string
takes two parameters the first is the
current speaker that's another object
property here and then we add a field or
the name of a field and with that we we
tell we create a binding that returns us
the ID of the current speaker so in
every time the current speaker changes
or the ID of that current speaker
changes this expression will be updated
and the label will will be updated as
well so you don't have to worry about
that anymore you don't have to track you
know at what in which situation the
current speaker can I can change or in
which situations the ID of a speaker can
change it it's all done for you you just
specified once and forget about it so as
you can imagine this reduces your your
client tremendously ok last topic I want
to talk a little bit some styling with
CSS so remember this is the basic
application or actually I think I show
it to you with a real application so
yeah I have the application um I'm
setting I just so far it was just using
the default um style sheet that's
provided by the Java Runtime and now I
just add this one line of code to to
read another style sheet which is
defined here so it's so it's a file on
my file system if I start that now
you can see how the whole um this is a
weird design I dip here so so you can
see the fun was changed the colors
changed and even the shapes of the
button changed here but I have more just
change that
so and you notice I didn't change any
Java code at all I'm just using loading
a different style sheet and here I have
let's use Java EE maybe for oops what
was that
okay so baby Oh jelly it's not oh I see
I like I wrote it in one word right so
now I didn't change any Java code at all
I just loaded a different style sheet
and you can see it looks totally
different I mean it's it was inspired by
a famous social network and you can do
all of that just in CSS and last example
which is a little bit more outerspace
to show you the possibilities um so you
can even use that and again I didn't
change any Java code
everything is just done using the style
sheet so you can even define very
weird-looking borders around your your
elements with with the CSS style sheets
okay
so he can see what this CSS looks like
that we use and on first sight you'll
notice it looks very much like standard
CSS I mean there are some differences
that's for sure but when you know CSS
you understand this pretty much
immediately I think let's take a look at
this thing you may be for example so
here we define an selector which first
searches for an element with the ID page
3 toolbar so the ID is as a property
that every node has we can set it in our
code and then the the designer can use
it in the CSS statue to look for that
specific node in the scene graph and
because we have a scene graph we also
have the hierarchy of the tree and then
we use that as we as we familiar with
from HTML for example below that page
tree toolbar node we look for all nodes
that have this toggle button class
that's another property of all nodes
style style class and then it looks for
all nodes which implement the text class
so you can even specify that and for all
of these text notes which are belong to
a toggle button in this page to toolbar
we set this effect down here and you can
see down here we describe what happens
if this toggle button is selected then
we can we change the drop shadow so it's
very familiar and it works pretty much
like it works in HTML so ok yeah I have
the examples in case the application
doesn't work ok to wrap it up as you can
see there are a bunch of tools now
available with which you can develop or
which you can use to develop Java X
applications there's the scene builder
which allows a user experience designer
to specify the
the the wireframes you can use that
directly in your code you can use
NetBeans for development starting with I
don't know which version one anyway if
you have a current version of NetBeans
jfx the Java X plug-in is installed by
default for eclipse the community is
built as writing a plug-in so you can
use java x or which enhances the clips
for usage with Java FX and even if you
use IntelliJ I mean there's no plugin
for that yet
but you can use Java IntelliJ with Java
FX because G of X now is a pure Java
library there's no no reason why you
shouldn't do that and in fact a lot of
developers in the JFX team use IntelliJ
for development and jasper even wrote a
small visual tool which you can use to
define or change the style sheet for for
your application so the tools are there
but what i think is even more important
is how the process was or can be
optimized now to make the word much more
efficient how this some bottleneck here
was you can get rid of this bottleneck
and how you can make the feedbacks loop
much faster and all people can work on
the codebase and parallel and see the
changes immediately so that's it for my
side we have ten minutes left for
questions while we do that I'll put up
this slide with some important links so
up here is my block I'm not didn't block
a lot in the last couple of months but
during winter I usually block more so
I'm writing a lot about Jeff X is my
twitter handle the Java fix website
where you can download the latest stuff
and get all kinds of documentation if
you have questions while you're
developing there's a forum for that and
it's it's very active a lot of people
from the Jeff X teams read it regularly
and usually if it's not too hard
question
you get answer within answers within
hours if you post a question here if you
found a buck
or if you have new ideas how the JFX API
can be extended we use gyro for that
there's a public instance that you can
use to file issues and if you want to
get involved a little bit more and see
what's happening in the future
all API discussions are done on this
public alias so you can just subscribe
to that and all API changes and I mean
even the smallest API Chan change has to
be discussed on this alias so we're not
hiding anything we're not doing anything
secretly everything will be discussed on
this alias before it is pushed to the
repositories okay thank you very much
and now it's time for questions yes yeah
it is it's I think you can download it
from the FX experience block but and but
he wrote it like a year ago yeah so it
will be an older block entry but is on
the FX experience block somewhere any
other question
yes please it's Jersey
what
I think there are other solutions I use
Jersey because the developers sit and
park and the main developer secret
friend of mine so when I had a question
you know he was just across the floor
there are other other solutions but
actually I think Jersey is the best
solution for doing a web service
requests okay any yes
yes yes
yeah I don't know if I have a internet
connection here right now hopefully I so
there's this some bindings class that I
mentioned and you can just go through it
you will see there it will probably take
too long now so there are many many
methods for defining all kinds of
expressions it's not just you know
adding and multiplying and things like
that there's a ternary expression so you
can say if this is true to take this
else this um there's um yeah it's a lot
just you know check out those methods
and you will see what's possible yes
please
oh it's just possible to do it I mean
you should probably you know just define
it for your project what works better
for you I mean if you do your layouts in
the if you have designer who wants to do
the layouts and the define this stuff in
in CSS and that's probably the better
approach to do as a Java developer for
me personally it's easier to use Java
code I am just I mean I I can read CSS
but I prefer Java code so I usually tend
to do that but it doesn't really matter
just need to define it for your project
there are rules what then happens but
I'm not really sure what what will
happen right now
I think the Java code will override
what's written in the style sheet
because the style sheet is for the whole
application while the Java code is
usually just for one element so I would
think this would be the behavior but I
materia I would have to read the
documentation about that sorry
yeah I mean the F XML is just below is
just read during initialization and
after that it's forgetting so if it's
initialized and then you override it in
Java code that's the way to use it's
really just for initialization it's not
for making the things constant or
anything there's one question in the
back yeah
yeah you can use it but I'm the wrong
person to ask about deployment I'm sorry
um I would suggest to go to the booth in
the exhibition ground where the Javits
stuff is and there are usually people
who will be able to answer that yes
what
the separate
what
yeah
you can embed F XML files in other files
so you can define this reusable
component in one F XML file and then
reuse it in other files actually I did
this for this application now I don't
remember where all the F XML files are
probably down here in the view so I have
this expandable extract which is a
component where you click on this little
error to have the application open now
so you click on this little triangle and
then it expands the details and that's a
reusable component because I use it at
two in two points so this one here right
and that's defined in an F XML file here
and I'm using it in the sessions details
which is a panel and in the speech
speakers details and all of that is then
used here in the main screen which
describes the whole the whole
application okay
that the F XML file or the oops what's
that oh it's opening scene builder by
default that's funny okay so probably
not able to see anything right now are
you we just change the font size so
maybe this is enough so can you see that
okay so um I think this is not exactly
what was generated by the scene builder
but I changed it to make it readable in
case I want to show it to somebody but
this is pretty much what it looked like
I think the scene builder sets more and
more attributes to the default value and
stuff that I would
yeah that's this one here no here there
we are
include and then the other F XML file
okay
so times up thanks for for your
attention and enjoy correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
