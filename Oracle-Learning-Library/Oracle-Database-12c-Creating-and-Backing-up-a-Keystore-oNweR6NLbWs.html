demonstration my name is Maria Billings
I work for Oracle server technologies
curriculum in this video we'll back up
and create a key storm which is part of
transparent data encryption you see the
detailed task steps on this slide logged
in as the Oracle or Susan we are
pointing to the you SEL instance our
first task is to confirm that the
directory for the keystore formerly
known as valid exists which it does then
we confirm that the secret that Ora file
contains an entry for the encryption
valid please note the indentations here
the important next we connect to secret
+ to create a password paste Keystone
and to create the keys in it now we are
creating a Keystone with the sample
password secret password let's confirm
that the volatile key store really
exists so we confirmed that the wallet
exists next we open the key store
optionally you can use the V dollar
encryption wallet dynamic view to look
at information about this valid time to
generate the Mast encryption key which
we give the tag master the executing
again a host to s command and you can
see that the key store has been backed
up before the master key was generated
you see the changing file size here you
also see the tech master here that we
defined above
obviously it's important to back up the
keystore because if the keystore file
ever lost the backup is not recoverable
if you do not have other options set up
and now let's take a look at the backup
of the key store we've come to the end
of this demo the slide lists the most
important steps to create and backup a
key store thanks for watching this
