Data Visualization enables you to quickly and easily explore your data. You create new
projects on the Home page. When you create a project, the first thing you
need to do is add data. You can connect
to an Oracle Application data source or
you can upload a Microsoft Excel file
with an xlsx extension that is up to
fifty megabytes in size.
The first row of
your spreadsheet must contain column headers.
You can change the name of the
data source to make it more meaningful. Verify that the aggregation method for the units and revenue measures is set to sum.
You can add additional data sources to this project at any time.
Continue exploring and evaluating the
allocation of units to different depots.
Start by using the control key to add
multiple data elements to the canvas.
You can pick a visualization type or let
data visualization pick one for you. It looks
like two geographical areas have a much
higher number a depot deliveries. Sort the
units to view the highest values first. You want to focus on these specific
values, so drag the cursor over an area
on the canvas to create a marquee
selection and then keep only those
selected values.
To further explore increase in depot deliveries for these
two cities, replace Units with Revenue.
After you add revenue, it appears that the
category named Internal for both cities
and the Mobile category for San Diego
have the highest revenue amounts.
Continue looking at the data by swapping
Item Type for Category. It looks like
smart phone adds to the increase in San
Diego and a large number of Modem sales
are responsible for the increase in both
cities. Add Retail Price to the canvas.
Data visualization suggests the best
location in which to place the measure.
You can see that smart phone sales
are responsible for the largest portion
of depot allocations. Add Units back to the
canvas and then change the visualization
type to a scatter chart to examine any
potential outliers. San Diego and New
York have both the highest retail sales
and number of units sold for both smart
phones and modems. Now, examine which
store types are driving these sales. It
looks like computer and electronic
stores are selling the most units and
generating the most sales. Save the
project. Based on this exploration, you
now have a better understanding of the
depot allocations in these two regions. In this video, I showed you how to create a
new project using data visualization and
explore your data by adding additional
columns, limiting the data displayed, and
changing the visualization type. To learn
