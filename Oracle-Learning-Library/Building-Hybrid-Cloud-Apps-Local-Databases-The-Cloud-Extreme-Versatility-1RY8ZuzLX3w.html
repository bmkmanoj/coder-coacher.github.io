presentation on building hybrid cloud
apps combining local databases in the
cloud for extreme versatility my name is
Mark heckler I am worked for Oracle as a
Java middle work or engineer my
background my development background is
Steve a little bit of a bio over 20
years of development experience in a
variety of environments variety of
industries retail financial medical
government that's where I spend most of
my time nowadays working with Java
throughout the government across cross
the organization's up and down
throughout the entire stack I will tell
you this right up front I don't work out
of Oracle corporate I'm a field engineer
so you're not going to hear a lot of
product specific talk you're going to
hear a lot of idea specific talk I spend
my days with the customer you guys so I
know what comes out of corporate the
idea is the the positioning and all
that's great but all of us have to deal
with the real world how to make things
work how to start small and introduce
ideas and to see how it you know shakes
out in the crucible of reality so that's
kind of where I'm coming from today that
and still trying to adjust to the
controls okay now I'll tell you up front
I brought a lot of notes because I
didn't want to leave anything out but
this isn't well established for that
well set up for that so I'm I may be
doubling back at times to pick up on
something I might might have missed so
anyway our agenda day will include that
may not be limited to the following
things we're going to cover the session
objectives what we hope to get out of it
we're going to be talk about what is the
cloud in practical terms for us where we
are in relation to the cloud how we can
use the cloud to meet real world needs I
will do a little outside the box
thinking hopefully and we'll do some
some live coding for the demo and then
talk do a little Q a little information
exchange I
the exchange and I'd kind of like to run
this as a cross between a session and a
birds of a feather because something
like this it lends itself well to kind
of throwing a lot of information out
there and talking about in a group but
there are times it you really don't want
to talk about things in a group you kind
of want to pull off to the side and have
a private conversation so if everything
works out okay what I'd like to do is
cover all of the the session you know
have that a little bit of public Q&amp;amp;A and
then a little bit of private Q&amp;amp;A
afterwards so let's give that a shot so
the session objectives again this is
idea based it's not product based
obviously I use products to to you know
show the example at the end but we're
going to be talking more in the mind
than in the the screen where are we now
where do we want to be with regard to
the cloud and how can we get there we'll
talk about one path there are so many
paths so many options so many places you
can go with this and we'll show one
prototype very small scale prototype a
little contrived as most of them are but
it might give you some ideas and again
the purpose of this is to foster thought
because today's solutions rarely fit
tomorrow's problems but if you start
getting the ideas in place a lot of
times it allows you to to be ahead of
that curve when things happen so we'll
start first with what is the cloud well
I pulled out intentionally a very
exhaustive definition from the US
National Institute for Standards and
Technology the high points model for
abling ubiquitous convenient on demand
network access shared pool of resources
whether it's network server storage
application services we'll get into that
a little bit more later that rapidly
provisioned very little hands on to get
that provisioned five essential
characteristics three service models for
deployment models it's an excellent
excellent definition it's an exhaustive
definition will cover all of that in
depth now I'm just kidding we're not
going to do that let's skip to something
a little more manageable cloud computing
is internet based computing whereby
shared resources software and
information
provider to computers and other devices
on demand like the electricity grid
however use metaphor but not bad so
let's take it a step further cloud
computing is a general term for anything
that involves delivering hosted services
over the Internet and this is why we
have the proliferation of marketing
speak that we have because pretty much
anything you pull across the Internet is
cloud for better and worse so for our
purposes what is it well in the real
world we kind of have this dichotomy we
have companies I don't want to give too
much away but we have we have companies
who want to be there we have
organizations who want to be in the
cloud but they still consider it
somewhat unconventional somewhat
unorthodox I mean they've been doing
things a certain way for years and
change comes with some difficulty so the
cloud is any way of doing things it's
something that offers a lot of promise
and it threatens quite frankly but every
new tool brings new options solutions
and challenges let's break those
challenges down into two sides the
technical and the non technical
challenges non technical legal privacy
things like that I often tell people I
don't ever want to trivialize the
technical difficulties involved in
implementing anything but compared to
the organizational and the legal issues
and things of that nature the technical
side does kind of pale sometimes so I
want to address both because that's
world we live in and we can develop the
best technical solution that if we're
not allowed to feel that we get nowhere
with it it does no one any good so we
can see the cloud from here but most of
us aren't in not really not fully you
know as some of us have poked it with a
stick and I don't want to over
generalize because some people are very
much in the cloud but i i'm not i'm not
talking so much to those folks and again
i'll kind of loop back around and we'll
cover that here shortly to but most of
us can't be in it not fully not yet and
because there's some valid reasons for
caution and your engineers you probably
can rattle off a half a dozen right now
but we're not off the hook because we're
supposed to solve problems so we have
opportunities great we have problem
to come with them great but let me just
ask a quick show of hands who here whose
organization is one hundred percent in
the cloud already okay even your dev
tools everything okay yeah that's kind
of a trick question thanks for playing
along I'll pay off later I don't know
that we'll ever get a hundred percent
everything fully cloud-based fully cloud
delivered maybe we will but we're
certainly not there yet in in most case
it's probably the closest that comes or
small companies who are startups who who
spin up immediately and you know due to
some of the promises and the the
opportunities that that offers without
having to invest in a lot of
infrastructure just to get off the
ground that you had a necessity
sometimes they fall in there fifty to
one hundred percent organizations fifty
to a hundred percent in the cloud 0 to
50 0 to 25 lower in okay that's it's
kind of what i expected i mean every web
let me ask this whose company or whose
organization has stated they want to be
in the cloud okay there are a few of you
didn't raise your hands why are you here
most companies most organizations you
know whether it's you know government
military private large bureaucratic
small nimble everybody has has
everybody's at least informed to the
point that they say i think i want to be
there they may not know necessarily what
it offers but it's sort of like the
Dilbert strip where the marketing folks
can hold of a magazine you know this is
where we need to be so we're headed that
way sorry we're headed that way how do
we get there so first let's start with
the dark side of the cloud every cloud
has a light side and a dark side let's
talk about the bad stuff first well the
cloud like any other utility has outages
and what happens hope I'm not getting
ahead of myself
yeah let's weigh it what what happens
right now in your current environments
your in-house environments when
something goes south well somebody
typically gets a call right they get a
page somebody's notified that something
broke and at that point that person
calls out the troops maybe it's a
database down maybe it's an application
that goes offline a website that goes
dark somebody gets the call that
something's broken and then they call
the essays the dba's the ops managers
who have whomever needs to be involved
in that as far up the chain as it needs
to happen so that actions can be taken
the the backups brought online the the
failover site engaged hopefully that's
all automatic but again things happen
what happens in the cloud and I know I'm
getting ahead of myself here that what
the heck will take things will allow
sequence what happens in the cloud if
you have an infrastructure in the cloud
your data in the cloud what happens in
what happens when there's an outage what
do you do when there's an outage not
really much of anything you engage a
plate person a lot of times to work with
that provider but what do you do you
wait for the call you wait to see
something come back on again you you cry
you pray you do whatever you need to do
yeah you drink a lot yeah okay but you
do it's a different feel and it's a kind
of a powerless feel again kind of coming
back to let's see if I get this work yes
okay cloud failures costs more than 70
million since 2007 these are the kind of
headlines that keep you up at night five
serious cloud failures and disasters
just of last year amazon cloud outage
causes customer to leave ouch companies
making the news for cloud failures
amazon google Heroku hosting com Twitter
Microsoft Netflix paypal Oracle's not up
there but they're just getting started
so I have no doubt it's early they'll be
there anybody have a guess on the
estimated cost of an outage a lot of
people don't talk about this but the
numbers that you can find when you can
find them are somewhere between two
a thousand and two hundred twenty-five
thousand dollars per hour and costs so
you know the the probably 45 months ago
there was an Amazon Web Services outage
that cascaded across multiple zones a
lot of companies are a few companies
anyway we're out over 24 hours so that's
about five million right out of the
pocket just something to think about
okay other reasons for caution well
privacy concerns legal concerns legal
and regulatory restrictions are real
real and actual concerns that have to be
addressed and a lot of times as
developers we don't think about those
but I guarantee if someone is and
they're the ones who can put the brakes
on any kind of activity that you're
doing to to get to help move your
company in some way large or small to
the cloud in the US we have regulatory
guidance like fisma and HIPAA and socks
cool acronyms the EU has the data
protection directive you have industry
guidelines and regs that shouldn't say
regs but their guidelines that the
typically industry consortium adhere to
like the what is the payment control
industry data security initiative or
something like that PCI DSS I think is
what the acronym is and that doesn't
even begin to cover what happens when
you cross national boundaries because if
you and I'll constantly be referring
back to data because working with the
government you hear a term a lot called
data at rest when you when you have an
application that's that's very temporal
so if if I'm using an application I
don't care where the server is based
where the real concern is is when that
data is stored when that persistence is
engaged because if I is US citizen have
my data stored in a server in Ireland or
an Irish citizen has their data stored
in New Zealand server in new zealand new
zealand or kiwi has their their data
stored in India or China or Canada or
anything like that you're not just
dealing with your national standards
your national laws and regulations
you're dealing with the other nations
and a lot of times your nation will pass
laws that specifically address what
happens when your data is stored out of
country so you've got this kind of
multi-tiered mess that you're dealing
with okay exposure and security that's
that's real and perceived because some
people view the cloud as fairly secure
however most people view the cloud is
somehow less secure legitimately so in
most cases then what's behind their
firewall what's in their data center so
those are issues that we have to address
different cloud providers just like
different networks different wireless
and wired networks have different
security models different security
levels different risk levels and with
different cloud providers and now open
providers coming online you you almost
have to study well you do have to study
each one to see what you're getting into
what they address well what they don't
address so well management mandate you
have some leaders of some organizations
and I use that term both with some
sarcasm but but they some leaders will
advocate a strong wave to the cloud some
leaders will actually insist that they
somehow have a a competitive advantage
that they're they're more secure they'll
point out competitors who are you know
flagrantly throwing everything in the
cloud potentially without keeping your
best interest at heart these are things
that are a little tougher to deal with
because that kind of gets into that
organizational side of things that you
have to address or to be able to
implement your solutions okay
reliability and control issues well
we've talked about that to some degree
the client company really doesn't have
the ability to control much of anything
in terms of when there's a failure when
there whenever there's an outage make
sense so far yes no okay alright
continuing still in the dark side the
top quote that I have there is is from
the Oracle profit magazine and it
surprised me a little bit soft in there
too but it's from a local government is
person's perspective who by the way
implemented a private cloud and he
points out that utilizing the private
cloud is a good middle ground between
placing assets in a public cloud where
you don't have much security or control
versus doing everything on your own and
everything's relative again but there is
a distinction there
Larry Ellison famously just yesterday
made the comment that there are some
environments due to legal and regulatory
issues that you won't be able to put
your things in a public cloud if Larry
acknowledges it it's got to be true
right so Oracle is making a push toward
a private cloud that matches that
mirrors the public cloud don't know much
about that can't tell you but again it's
widely recognized their concerns how do
you fix that how do you fix things when
they go wrong well we talked about that
there's you don't really have hands-on
in most cases there are avoidance and
detection examples and Netflix is
probably the best example of that
because they pioneered so much and
because they're so open with
communicating that and sharing that they
have a tool called chaos monkey which
actively goes out and breaks things and
and what they've done is get ahead of
that wave they're not fighting failure
they're embracing failure and they're
trying to get out ahead of that curve
dealing with things versus fixing things
sort of like judo versus karate you know
kind of flowing with it so it's a
failure embracing system we recognize
they'll be failures well plan around
them we'll architect around them and
will minimize their impact take
advantage of all the benefits and try to
avoid all the pitfalls a couple more
articles top 10 reasons for not using a
cloud that's actually from about four
years ago but most of it's eerily
current the second one kind of recaps
what the other one says okay so with all
that bad sitting out there yes
which glad you want what I'm sorry ok
the the comment was one thing missing
which cloud do you want VHS or beta
we're going to kind of cover that in
fact I glad you pointed that out because
you know in my in my notes which I I'm
trying not to go because I just think
it'd be too much of a distraction you
hear a lot about infrastructure as a
service platform as a service soft as a
service data is a service security as a
service storage is a service I mean
everything pretty much everything that
you use can be delivered in some
capacity sometimes better than others as
a service via the cloud whether it's a
private cloud or a public cloud or some
kind of an amalgam of both so there are
a lot of different different packages
out there there are a lot of different
terms and solutions and boundaries and
by the way one thing that makes it so
incredibly difficult is that the
boundaries are really fluid and the
terms are really fluid so and again I
don't want to give too many spoilers but
at the end I'm going to bend one of
those boundaries a little bit and show
you what I mean by that but everything
is still very much in flux you know the
cloud has been talked to by by the
marketing folks for years now but where
are we I mean Oracle is just now getting
things off the ground the clouds not new
but it's still really considered
emerging tech and probably will be for
the for the foreseeable future you look
puzzled okay all right all right so
we're not off the hook yes cloud in
general has has downsides but we solve
problems that's what we do that's our
field so what are some of the benefits
let's look at the light side of the
cloud well you and your customers and I
say this a lot of you folks are my
customers but you have customers
internal customers external customers we
all have customers and at the end of the
day we've got to make it right for them
so what are the benefits well first of
all you and your customers can access
things in the cloud from nearly anywhere
it it breaks down a lot of boundaries
you can make things available to your
customer quickly with the minimal or no
additional setup a configuration if
you're if you're working within the
cloud and again I'll use that fairly
flexibly but if you're working with in a
cloud type of environment gone are the
days that you have to for standing up a
whether it's a small system or a large
system you're you don't have to spec
your server you don't have to put in a
purchase request wait for it to be
delivered find a rack to put it in make
sure your powers adequate stand it up
install everything configure it tested
get it past network security and start
loading your application now at some
level yes you do but when it comes to a
cloud-based solution it's incremental so
if the things are already in place and
you need to add additional resources
it's very low-impact capacity can varies
demand varies some of you are probably
in industries where you have a peak time
most of you probably have a peak time
sometimes they're big peak sometimes
they're not so big but let's use retail
as an example December oh my goodness
your your capacity may have to be 10
times what it is in June what do you do
what do you do now with your existing
setup you have to accommodate that peak
capacity plus some buffer right so if
your capacity has to be 10 times in
December what it is in June you're
probably going to be about 12 times
higher capacity than you are most of the
year then you need with your current
setup with a cloud computing you can
incremental a add resources you can pay
for them when you need them bring the
back offline things scale down when you
don't and I kind of thrown at the end
innovation happens in new areas and
again the cloud isn't new but but still
for most of us as we saw from the hands
it's fairly new within our organization
so if you're going to solve new problems
if you're going to advance new solutions
you're going to have to do it with some
some new tools okay first off how do we
how do we go forward with that well I
think the first thing that's important
for us on the tech side engineering and
IT to admit to our leadership is is that
the cloud is is
not an all-or-nothing solution we don't
have to flip the switch you know shut
off everything tonight and be a hundred
percent the cloud tomorrow most of us
cannot do that we'll we'll take
incremental steps baby steps we'll do
some tests and proofs of concepts we'll
see how things shake out we'll build on
our successes will fix our failures and
make successes out of them so how do you
eat an elephant well one bite at a time
and and really the key is like i said
earlier to find those requirement holes
and fill them okay if the littles get a
lots better right well again no because
one tool doesn't do everything one
solution is it fit every problem one
size doesn't fit all and there are going
to be times when legally you cannot
implement a cloud solution so we're okay
with that we're all okay with that right
okay we're not okay with that but we're
going to deal with that okay is there a
balance point and how do you find it
well every environments different every
company every program every data center
so it's going to still take some thought
again getting back to those ideas so
requirements if I come to you if I'm a
user and I come to you with a
requirement and you tell me you can't
fulfill it what happens to that
requirement if I say I need this because
our external customers are demanding
this I've got to be able to provide this
and you can't give me a solution what
happens the requirement doesn't go away
it's not fulfilled it doesn't go away
it's just now in the head of a newly
disgruntled user now I'm going to go and
grumble because I T your engineering
they're not cooperating they're not
giving me what what we want we're losing
market share because they're not giving
us the way forward so requirements of
the key to cloud adoption really if
you've had trouble advancing any kind of
cloud development or any kind of cloud
solutions within your organization when
you show how that fulfills a valid
requirement and I'll touch on that a
little bit later as well when you show
how that
fulfills a valid requirement that's the
key to moving forward within your
organization so the bottom point how do
we fulfill the requirement while
managing risks well we already do that
with our existing solutions we balance
risk and reward we show how to fill
those needs and mitigate risk manager
asst minimize risk so this is really no
different we're just using a different
platform to get it done we have to show
our leadership how a cloud solution
solves the problem at hand better than
other options not just solving the
problem because every problem has
multiple solutions some are better than
others we need to show how this is
better how are we going to meet the
requirement and maintain or even
optimally improve our risk profile
because if we meet the requirement and
increase increase our risks introduce
additional risks that's going to be a
non-starter too and aztec folk we need
to be sure and let leadership know that
we're not just using the the buzzword of
the day the silver bullet we're not
going to throw that said everything
we're going to use the tool where it
makes sense so how do we get there well
I'm a big proponent in starting small
and building out because that lets all
of your stakeholders see how a solution
fits a problem how it can be leveraged
to to maybe address more than one
problem and how it is workable within
your organization without a whole lot of
impact realizing the following points
well first of all your first time out of
the gate even with a small example
you're probably not going to get it
right you're probably not going to WoW
anybody it's it it may fail big deal you
know every time we implement our new
technology and their tool a new process
there are going to be bumps so failures
produce improvements turn those failures
into successes when you have successes
use those to build on and make more
successes build from small to large that
doesn't mean to dive into the tinker
toys without planning that means to
start small use a small example that you
know very limited and focus and and
build out from there
one of my favorite quotes the project
guys have probably heard of james
gosling right in the lab failure is
positive if everything you try works it
means you're too careful that you aren't
taking any risks to fail is to learn and
that goes outside the lab because if
you're not reaching you're not improving
anything but on the downside to the man
with a hammer everything looks like a
nail and you ladies are off the hook
either because if you're in with a
hammer it's all going to look like nails
too we have to be careful again not to
just blanket use it and I know you're
hearing me use the term cloud a lot
today just because its presentation but
if we run around all day every day
saying cloud cloud cloud cloud nobody's
going to listen to us for very long
anyway so okay yes we're going to get
back to this about that balance point
well we talked about the different as a
services but we also have different
configurations or levels of cloud so you
have the public cloud and today within
this context really we can say to the
public cloud any cloud based resources
outside of your company the private
cloud will consider is any cloud based
resources within your company boundaries
and fully under your control
everybody still upright that's good okay
not here hybrid cloud some mix of both
so the hybrid cloud and again that's
kind of where we can take things today
we have a large most of us have a large
investment in infrastructure a large
investment and while we do things today
we're not going to shut that off tonight
it's just not realistic so a hybrid
cloud provides the flexibility of
in-house applications with the fault
tolerance and scalability of cloud-based
services now to back up a little bit I
know that not everything you have in
house is cloud-based but the concepts
still the same I mean we're still
talking about multiple mirrors in your
car if you have one mirror you have a
lot of blind spots if you have multiple
mirrors you you reduce the number of
blind spots that you have and that's the
goal to cover more of the field of
vision and reduce those blind spots the
second one is actually from an Oracle
publication the first one wasn't hybrid
clouds offer the flexibility and cost
savings of the public cloud along with
security and data protection of the
private cloud so remember the whole data
at rest thing we'll talk a little bit
more to about data partitioning as we go
along but the bottom article drunk on
cloud kool-aid time to sober up sounds
really ominous it was written by the CEO
of a cloud company same thing though you
find that a lot of terms and a lot of
ideas are kind of hijacked by the
marketing folks and people go into them
blindly maybe they don't have the
optimal experience and they run away so
again go in eyes open okay remember the
requirements we talked about earlier
typically where you can leverage a new
solution and a new tool a new process in
this case some kind of a cloud-based
initiative is VN edge case via
requirement that before you might have
had to turn away an edge case doesn't
mean something that's rare unusual a lot
of times edge cases happen with
frequency and regularity maybe there are
only ten or five or twenty percent of
the time maybe you have such a backlog
of things that you need to get done that
you just kind of push them aside for the
quick kills for the low-hanging fruit
the easy victories whatever your
organization calls them like there are
any real easy victories but those edge
cases are really
to starting new initiatives to solving
those new problems and for dipping your
toe into the shallow end of cloud
computing they provide excellent
opportunities to prototype when you do
this right everyone can and should win
and it should be with a fairly small
amount of effort and pain and cost and
again there will be failures that's fine
one size doesn't fit all the normal
caveats apply so getting to the demo
let's talk about our goals with the demo
first and then we'll get into a little
bit of live code and we'll talk about
that a little bit more but before we do
that let's talk about our basic
overarching goals well all the LEDs
really we should have the usability it
should be usable or reachable at least
the functionality that we want to expose
from elsewhere from outside
maintainability and flexibility it
should use standards so that if we're
not locked into any particular library
way of doing things things like that
should be scalable it should be
available and reliable hard argue with
that extensibility we should be able to
add on resources as we need to remove
them as we don't the security we should
be able to leverage some cloud provider
security as a cell and whatever the
cloud provider provides on top of in
addition to and around and it should be
portable hard to argue with any of that
right ok the mighty bean coffee company
we're serious about our Java you can see
that one coming right the example we're
going to use that I'm going to use is
built using the following components I
use netbeans you can use anything you
want to but I like that beans glassfish
will be used for app server javaserver
faces for the the web application I also
and and again this is a very small
contrived example but I wanted to try to
break things out and show you give you a
little taste of using javafx to access
both local and cloud stores my sequel is
the local database that I'm using
behind the scenes I've done this a
couple times I've used oracle database
Express Edition it doesn't really matter
what your back-end is locally it could
be oracle database six enterprise
edition or anything else but for today
it's my sequel and our cloud provider
for today is Evernote and Evernote is
typically considered a
software-as-a-service type of platform
but it has a rather nice API so and it's
great for prototyping if you notice all
of these things what's your total cost
for your license to stop the bottom to
spin up a quick prototype zero so you've
already taken that objection out of out
of leadership sands so you're not going
to cost them anything to spin up
something and try it out at least on the
small scale so let's build and let's see
oh actually I do want to say Oh get back
to this I do want to say one thing first
the example that we're going to do I'll
give you a little background a little
table setting the mighty bean coffee
company is a very well old established
company at least on paper it's a
wholesaler it sells coffee to coffee
retailers and like many companies who
have who are in the wholesale business
that's very traditional they have sales
folks who go out and meet they call
whatever they take orders from customers
but they validate them an interim into
the system themselves so everything's
pretty much internal and everything is
very secure it's never been exposed to
the outside world but somebody within
mighty bean has seen the writing on the
wall and they want to be able to at the
very least in a test case to be able to
let their customers know what the order
was that they just placed and they want
to be able to deliver that without
opening up their firewall to that to
every customer from the outside they
also want to be able to if if wishes
were fishes to allow that customer to go
back and say you know I ordered five
pounds of espresso roast I really want
seven and to be able to bring that back
into the local database fulfill the
order and push it out the door so again
small example but that's what we're
going to work through make sense
okay let's see if the demo gods are kind
today so to start with we'll do a quick
little web application oh good you're
seeing that that's good and we'll call
that Java one web nothing too fancy
we'll be using jsf
and already let's see let's change this
to something a little more
okay already we now have a workable app
it doesn't do anything but it's there
okay so that's good that's a good start
demo gods are happy so far so what do we
do next well if you're in your corporate
environment as we laid out the first
thing you've got to do is get to your
existing data right you have your
systems in place you want to be able to
tie into what you have in place so let's
create some entity classes from our
database easiest way to do that point to
a data source add them in we have four
key tables for the for the purposes of
this demo first as a customer table
self-explanatory then you have the
coffee's these are the products that we
offer to our customers you have the
coffee order that in effect is a header
for the order that lets you know who
ordered what win what your total is and
I shouldn't say what because the plot is
really a joint table it's the coffee's
that are on that coffee order and this
is where when you have joined tables the
the jsf generation isn't so pretty but
again for the example it's sufficient it
allows you also to rename your classes
that that correspond your tables we're
not going to do that not for the demo
nope yep and we'll put them in an entity
package and stay with the defaults
everything should be fine there so what
this is going to do for us now is create
some pojos which correspond to our
tables underneath still doesn't really
get us anywhere but that's the next step
and you create some jsf pages from the
from the entity classes so we'll add all
of those and we'll just change the
packages so we don't dump everything
into the same spot but it generates our
session beans and again a very nice
start and our jsf pages
so as you can see and this is one of the
reasons I like netbeans most IDEs have
some way of doing some of the heavy
lifting but it just works really well I
also and just as kind of a side plug for
netbeans if anybody's not using it I had
used years ago switched away from it
came back to and was just thrilled ran
into an issue ironically on this I was a
joint able issue on the code generation
when CDI is engaged and and there's a
bug with the current code generation I
want to ensure it was the bug but the
NetBeans team start to finish from
identifying it confirming it fixing it
releasing workarounds and integrating it
into the next code release 703 is when
it'll come out less than 24 hours and
that is just incredibly responsive so
you know if you haven't used it there's
there's my little commercial plug I
guess it is a little about product but
but again no no charge open source
product so what do we have so far let's
go ahead and run this as you can see it
added some things so now we have links
we can go out and take a look at our
customers okay it works you just never
know everything can work until you set
it up here and plug everything in we
have our list of our products that we
offer our coffees we have our coffee
orders we just have a few so we're
probably not gonna be in business long
but and we have our coffee orders or
coffees that are on the coffee orders
again not sort of nothing pretty but
it's out there so okay now in the
interest of time you know how I'm
cooking shows they show you all the
ingredients that go in they show you how
to mix it all up and then they stick in
the oven and then they grab the other
oven door and they pull out and the
finished product is that here that's
what we're about to see here so it's
just faster that way but it's pretty
much the same thing really so so far
what I've shown you is just the local
side of it so how do you integrate the
cloud well again this is very very small
example but what happens with those
those coffee orders
when you if you want to go out and
validate your coffee order let's go
ahead and view it and I didn't show you
this in the other one actually that oh
well here's what happens you now can see
your header and your lines nothing very
fancy but what happens before this is
shown is it goes out in reconciles your
cloud order and your local order here's
the order that's sitting out there in
the cloud and again this is just ever
known nothing fancy but what that does
your business rules will dictate how you
handle that in this case we're fairly
trusting so we just would just bring it
down and make everything match but let's
say for instance that let's see coffee
order one let's edit that and instead of
three we want seven okay now if you look
at here in the order we're still showing
three okay that's nothing not terribly
you're shattering here but let's go back
to here and pull in this and again no no
gatekeeping whatsoever we pull down
three because what we're doing is
overriding our local storage with what's
out in the cloud that's just the
business rules as they stand right now
probably not something you want
implement but that keeps things
synchronized so let's switch gears here
really quickly and go out and we will
edit this and change that to a 9 we want
a lot of espresso roast I'm so bummed I
brought in a coffee to drink while I was
doing this and it disappeared before I
even started so hello it what's that not
that fast
probably good we would have gone through
this whole thing in 10 minutes but
anyway so we see that the customer now
I'm the customer out there I look go out
and look on my order I say wow I only
ordered three of those I'd know I told
him nine I changed it to 29 so we go
back here and yeah we'll take a look
here it's now nine okay nothing magical
there agreed but now we go over to the
other side of the house and we look at
the javafx side anybody work with javafx
here as well Wow not not much at all
javafx is the I guess here's the other
little commercial plug javafx is a rich
application interface you know the old
swing days battle days of swing those
are gone javafx is much lighter it's
it's a network capable network
deliverable it's it's really nice much
lighter weight so if you were hoping for
a quick peek at that you're about to get
it if not while you're going to get it
anyway so let's say for our example that
we we can do all of this but what
happens in the morning when our shipping
people come in they want to pull up and
reconcile the orders wow that was fast
see what I mean they want to reconcile
the orders and they want to verify
everything is right before they pack it
and ship it so here we have a little
utility and it was very quick and easy
to create using I don't think I used
anything but standard controls out of
the box but this is a javafx program
that again the shipping people are going
to run they're going to take a look
through these and they're going to be
able to compare the local in the cloud
orders here we see that there's a
distinction nine versus three well
weighted we're going to go well again
this comes down to business rules and
this is why we talked about that aspect
of development so much versus just the
development as much fun as that is
because your business rules are going to
determine how you proceed maybe they
call and verify with the salesperson
maybe they call the customer maybe they
just overwrite but either way you can
either push what the values are behind
your firewall or you can pull that
information down now why is this
important and and I
I haven't lost anybody with this because
this does tend to get a little weedy but
why is this important you have data
partitioning because if you look at
what's stored out there there's nothing
that's what's called personally
identifiable information PII and again
and working with the government they get
very they want data they want data
everywhere they want to be able to
access it from anywhere the more data
the better but it cannot be identifiable
if it's intercepted and that makes a lot
of sense not just in public sector but
in private sector so heaven forbid you
have a you have some kind of a security
breach with your cloud provider what are
they going to learn from the information
on the right well not a lot they're
going to learn that a customer has an
order with some stuff on it so even
though we're isolating customers from
seeing each other's data if something
breaks down they're still not going to
get any valuable intel on any other
customer so that's that's the goal now
which way you want to go from the right
yes good of the cat caching okay
developers yes but using what using the
rules that are typically put in place by
the business because let's say for
instance well let okay let me let me let
me throw out an example oh well I'll
throw that I'll throw out an example and
see what you think of that let's say
instead of nine and three it's nine and
980 the most anybody's ever ordered from
us has been 10 packages of something now
i see a 980 what am I going to do it's
the last one in do I just blindly take
it do I put a man in the middle person
in the middle what are my business rules
so you're right I mean you have to
establish some kind of rules and as
developers were the folks who implement
those but other folks are going to have
a chop on that as well so that's why you
know again we all have to hold hands and
sing together and it all has to work out
at the end because otherwise we're out
the door with a severance check right so
so that's why so in this case mighty
beam feels like they're shipping people
should be able to verify it before they
do anything in this case will say that
yes that looks valid we know this
customer they frequently change the
order and drive us crazy so we'll push
that out and hold it hold that thought
another quick little plug one of the
things that I've done I do contribute to
open source projects as much as I can
this is dialogue FX + jf extras be a job
FX that's something that I've
contributed the community so plug plug
plug over at the local order values yes
ok so now we see they match we ok yes
local database or the cloud enemies
nominee system of the car oh oh well
right again yeah well again and these
yeah they both do tie together again
what's your system a record out it's
whatever your organization defines it to
be and this is the kind of thing that
drives me crazy too because again I work
with the government and and this is a
constant source of turmoil because for
this key piece of data this is your
system record for this key piece of data
that's a system of record and yet you
find that even though that's a system
record this becomes an authoritative
source go figure so I I can't answer
that for you now coming back to I'm
sorry what what were you saying so
what's the source of truth
well and again all that can be solved if
you just force a reconciliation right
yeah your point is completely valid my
statement though is that I can't answer
that for you because that ultimately
comes down to how your organization did
wants to deal with that how they demand
you deal with that I I hear you I hear
you I just and your organization may be
different but I just know that or
they'll hire you or that or they'll hire
you to implement it and again I
okay okay well let me just put it this
way it's a demo it's a prototype it's a
contrived example I said that up front
don't crucify me so however you work it
out with your organization that's great
I just know working with the government
customers and it's bananas I'm not going
to argue with that but you you you have
to meet certain directives you have to
meet certain dictates and and if they
tell you that it has to be this way and
you have to insert somebody in the
middle as a gatekeeper process whether
it's a guy in a warehouse or whether
it's you know the guy in the corner
office that better be there or they'll
bring in somebody else who will so
you're right data inconsistency logical
inconsistencies all bad things but if
there is a process in place that
requires an intervention you have to
work around that so anyway that's that's
just a demo it's just a prototype yeah
so anyway any other group questions
before we break up and just if you want
to come on offline yes why'd you ask
that gosh I skip past that too because I
didn't didn't use my papers Evernote has
an API that they expose several
different languages several different
mechanisms but as a jar they also use
apache thrift is the transport mechanism
i wrote and again it's an open source
library i threw it out there which
bundles and unbundled orders oh gosh I
need to get back to this really quickly
that's right yeah my fault I ask four
questions okay here's really all that's
involved in this I it's a it's a very
similar setup but on the web app you
have a cloud being all that does is
interact with your cloud store using
libraries and in same thing with javafx
I effectively use the same libraries I
have an integrator class which reckon
sighs the local and cloud data and again
in some cases I make that automatic it
in in the other case i don't i insert
that person
again two different examples compositor
represents that built coffee order the
header and the information on it the en
ml libe that's a library that I created
soap and source if anybody's interested
in that it's nothing terribly fancy it
just functions but if anybody's
interested in hit me on twitter and i'll
try to get it out and get have in the
next several days but i gotta sleep
first just a it's effectively an
interface class and then the the
functionality to bundle and unbundle and
manipulate the data add headers things
like that and then as i said the career
at Evernote api library in the thrift
library and we're pretty much out of our
discussion time at least publicly I
write the java jungle the Oracles blog
system if you're interested I kind of
cover again all across the map small
things large things you know I try to
put them in bite-size topics but I you
know it's everything from just little
syntactical things through you know you
know it key examples things like that
i'm also on twitter please feel free to
follow me and we'll carry on the
discussion later but if anybody wants to
just come up and nude a little bit or
maybe you know talk in the hallway
that's great come on up but thank you
for attending good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
