developer with server technology
curriculum development in this demo I'm
going to show you how to deploy simple
so a composer application using Oracle
Enterprise Manager Fusion Middleware
control console
what you see here is an enterprise
manager and control console which is web
enabled interface that is used to
administer and the monitor so our
composer applications a composer
application including many acid is
usually packaged in a solar archive
called SAR file in the next couple
minutes I'm going to walk through the
steps of the point a simple cell archive
hello world
Campos aye using the deployment wizard
of Enterprise Manager there are a couple
ways to access the deployment wizard you
can either expand the solar folder on
the swarm navigation tree select so
important node and use the sewing
infrastructure menu just like deploy or
you can just right click the soil in for
node
in the pop-up context menu select sour
deploy deploy
so either way you get to this deployment
wizard interface the first step of the
appointment as shown in the screen is to
select your source archive to deploy
usually obtain the archive file from the
developers beforehand the solar archive
could be either local which is on the
same machine as the web browser or
remote on the server where use Oracle
Enterprise Manager is running
in this demo the hollow water composer
archive is a located on the same machine
as the browser so I'll use the first
option which is the default selection
and the click browse
to open up the file upload dialog box in
this data box navigate to the folder
where your soar archive file is located
and select a jar file and click open
the selective jar file is shown in the
field
after selecting the source archive file
you can optionally apply a configuration
plan to change deployment properties
when you are done click Next to proceed
to the next step select target on this
screen you first select the managed
server or cluster to which you want to
deploy the sole composer application in
this demo environment
I only has one saw server instance so
another one so it will be my deployment
target once the manage server cluster
has liked it you then need to choose to
which partition on the server cluster
you will deploy the archive click the
drop down box a list of configured of
partitions will be displayed so like one
for your deployment operation here I
select them
and
then click Next
and proceed to the last step
confirmation
in this stuff really deployment
configuration make sure you have
everything one if not you can go back to
make the changes
the default revision setting is related
to compose our applications versioning
in this demo we'll use the default
selection deploy has a default revision
this makes the current to archive
revision the default or incoming request
to the composer application now you have
completed all the confusion steps the
deployment wizard prompt you click
deploy to start the rip the actual
deployment the deployment process data
box displays showing progress of
deployment operation to deployment
succeeds or fails in this case is
succeeds when deployment succeed the
deployment success that of boss process
and you can find them newly deployed a
composer application hello world compose
I displacing the deployed compose I'd
list on the so infrastructure homepage
after that you can initiate attack and
test this composer application
Enterprise Manager for how to do it
please watch the others demos in the
series
thanks for watching the demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
