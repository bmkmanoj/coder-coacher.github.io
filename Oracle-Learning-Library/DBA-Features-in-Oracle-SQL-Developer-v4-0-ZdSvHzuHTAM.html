many many features for the database
administrator most of these can be found
under the View menu in the DBA panel
which you can see here once you have a
connection added to the DBA panel from
your list of existing connections you
can connect to your database view its
current initialization parameters make
changes to those parameters save them
back to your SP file or to the database
and see who's using lot in the database
in terms of licensed features
we have a wizard for running data pump
exports and imports you can also see
existing jobs and execute those jobs if
they're there the performance page is
brand new for version for dot 0 and this
is available if you're an enterprise
edition and at the Diagnostics pack
licensed you can view existing snapshots
you can sort your snapshots to ones that
have automatic database diagnostic
monitoring findings drill into that
snapshot and view the findings report
directly
you can create new snapshots delete
existing ones you can also manage your
baselines for frequent snapshot windows
that you want to feed to a report
automatic database diagnostic monitoring
page shows you your available reports
you can change your parameters and of
course you can click into these reports
probably the feature that will be used
most in this new set of performance
items is the oddity automatic session
history report viewer so by default will
show you everything that's happened in
your let and your database in the last
five minutes if you'd prefer to see this
in your browser you can feed this over
to your default browser or save it to an
HTML file to share with other coworkers
I can always change the parameters of
the report basically you have the
ability to set predefined time periods
or be very specific with the time
pickers and you can also add filters
so now I'm seeing what sequel developers
done in the last hour in terms of
sessions in the database
we also have a interface for our me n so
you can run our man wizard to set up a
backup or recovery operation
you can see existing backup jobs
resource manager allows you to manage
your consumer groups so for example if
you want a group of users to have their
database connections timeout after a
certain period of inactivity you can do
that from here security is all about
managing database auditing so you can
see your existing audit trails and audit
settings roles in users so I can reset a
password for a user I can expire a user
I can edit a user grant them new
privileges and rolls or I can minister
the role itself
and lastly we have storage so you have
the ability to for example manage your
table spaces you can see all of my table
spaces here drill into a tablespace add
a data file or edit an existing data
file
we also have some reports for dbas our
reports that might be interesting to
dba's so under the reports viewer under
data dictionary reports you have about
your database things about as a
passionate the VR reports and then of
course database administration reports
so tops equals ops equaled by weights
over the last 30 minutes here's what we
have going on these reports are
customizable you just need to drag them
down to the user-defined reports to make
changes to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
