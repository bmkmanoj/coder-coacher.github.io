to show you the i/o and system tabs for
Java flight recorder so I'm back to that
initial recording I made off of the Java
to demo and I am showing here the iota
our i/o tab group and basically we have
information about files and sockets here
and of course this does not this app is
not right to the file system but we do
have a little socket information of
course because thats related to the
Mission Control actually talking to it
while we're monitoring it so you always
should have a little socket information
here and you can see I'm using virtual
machine there i'm using a little
different IP address but anyway so
there's the overview tab I have socket
and file information our file it a read
and writes going to be empty there but
you would see you get a lot of detailed
information about that if we were doing
file i/o and we can see here that we've
got by host information for the socket
i/o so you can see here I have the reeds
over time I can see how much data i read
and stuff like that I can look at it by
thread i can see that it's using rmi to
talk to Mission Control and I can also
see here that I've got a number of
different events that took place where
we did we took a connection and we read
some data from the system and then I'll
I figure we do a couple right so there
is a couple places here where we've
written some data back and once again I
can look at by thread by events and look
and see what happened and at what point
it happened during my
recording so interesting stuff the
system tab has just system information
about the system you're running on
mainly so you can see here I can see
what kind of processor I've got the
number of cores number of hardware
threads that sort of stuff on the
overview tab on the processes tab I can
see what processes were running on the
system I recorded with and we can see
here that we've got the window system
just by the path i can tell that and
then we have environment variables and
once again i can tell this is a window
system once again just by what the
environment variables are set to so
that's basically it for the i/o and the
system tab groups on Java flight
recorder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
