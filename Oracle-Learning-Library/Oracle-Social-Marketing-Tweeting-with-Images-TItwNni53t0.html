demonstrate tweeting with images tweets
you make through the SRM sweet have the
option of including a photo and a link
and i'll be showing you how to put that
together so here in publish i'll go to
create a post will name this post
memorial day specials since we only want
to publish to twitter I'll deselect the
facebook and google+ option now let's
enter the post content come by for some
great Memorial Day specials don't miss
out on the organic peaches and
watermelon great way to start the summer
we have six characters left next we'll
go to add media we could upload a new
image but i'll use this existing photo
of peaches the photo should appear in
the preview if not scroll down to your
social networks settings for twitter and
make sure to check this box for
displaying photos and tweets you'll also
notice that our tweet is too long by 17
characters this happens because twitter
automatically adds the photo URL to the
tweet so we'll need to make this post
shorter if you'd like to include a link
you can paste the URL on this box this
can be any URL you want publish will
automatically format the link for you
and include it in your post just be sure
not to exceed Twitter's character limit
when you're ready we can go to the
review tab and make sure everything is
correct before we finally publish the
post there's the URL and there is the
photo or I'll set to publish now
here's our post in the post grid and
here it is on Twitter if we go in for a
closer look we'll find the image the URL
we included and the URL for the image if
you'd like more information our
documentation can be found here or if
you'd like to see more demos you can
find those at our Learning Library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
