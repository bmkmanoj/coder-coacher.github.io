introduce you to some changes that come
in soon to promotions in NetSuite in the
second video in this series we will
provide a demonstration of how to
migrate to the new Suite promotions and
take advantage of their new features
NetSuite promotions are undergoing the
change that will provide you with a new
leaner faster and enriched promotions in
this video we will take a look at the
new features that are being introduced
in suite promotions and their benefits
explain the migration process step by
step for users who have existing
promotions and clarify exactly how suite
promotions will integrate seamlessly
into your NetSuite environment let's
begin by taking a quick look at some of
the forthcoming new features of suite
promotions stackable promotions or to
apply best offer a new improved user
interface and improved scalability and
performance the stackable promotions
feature allows you to apply multiple
promotions to an order or transaction no
longer a customer's limited to one
promotion per transaction you can
combine a number of promotions as
desired
you also have complete control over
which promotions you want to be able to
stack in which you prefer to be
exclusive and not combined with other
promotions
with the auto apply feature you can
automatically apply promotions to a
transaction or to apply runs in the
background and when changes are made to
a transaction it will determine which
promotions the transaction is eligible
for furthermore when exclusive
promotions are eligible on a transaction
the system will smartly choose which
promotion or promotions should be
applied to ensure the customer gets the
best offer
we have an improved user experience
thanks to new intuitive promotions forms
for each promotion type making it easier
and quicker to create sweet promotions
no matter how complex
finally we are introduced in a base
engine that provides a solid foundation
for promotions engine that is both
functionally rich performance and
scalable so how do you start taking
advantage of these new promotion
features first of all it's important to
know that if you have existing
promotions they are not compatible with
the new features we are introducing so
we recommend you replace them with suite
promotions as soon as you can you can
start creating suite promotions that
take advantage of the new features and
use them immediately while you can still
apply it standards and advanced
promotions if needed to a transaction
until you arrive at the point where all
your promotions can be stacked and
automatically applied using the best
offer logic so how exactly will the
migration work you can continue using
your standard and advanced promotions
without enabling suite promotions but
remember you will not be able to benefit
from the new suite promotions features
when you enable suite promotions you can
benefit from the new features
straightaway you can create suite
promotions that can be stacked and
automatically applied to transactions
and you will use a new promotion form
for each type of promotion you wish to
create while standards advanced and
suite promotions will be available for
all transactions in the new UI you
cannot stack standard or advanced
promotions and you will only ever be
able to add one of these promotions to a
transaction by default the first
promotion you apply to a transaction
determines if stackable can be used if
you apply a standard or advanced
promotion to a transaction new features
are disabled
continue using your old standard and
advance promotions until you no longer
need them or they are no longer valid
replace them as soon as you can create
an equivalent in sweet promotions soon
you will only be using sweet promotions
and we'll have seamlessly migrated to
the new promotions engine please watch
the next video in this series where we
will demonstrate how to set up and take
advantage of the new sweet promotions
features thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
