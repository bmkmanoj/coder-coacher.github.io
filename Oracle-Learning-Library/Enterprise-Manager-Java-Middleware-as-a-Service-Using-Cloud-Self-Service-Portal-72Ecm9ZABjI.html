control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how you
can make use of video as a service
service service application portal as a
midwestern service and the user you can
check out a separate demonstration to
understand what it takes for cloud
administrators and ssa administrators to
set up midi as a service for and the
users in the midwest service SS a portal
i will have a database service instance
and a mediator service instance first
off i will show you how simple it is to
submit a service instance provisioning
request will delete existing service
instances next i will configure the data
source to the database service instance
and then i will deploy a simple java ee
application you will also see how to
scale up the service instance and look
at its logs
first let me look into the SS a portal
application using my credential as ssa
and user let me go to the TV service
homepage to show that i have a DB
service instance ready for me so this is
a services instance i'm going to use for
my video as a service now let's go back
to the meteor service homepage on the
Left Ned bar you see your middle service
quarter information as you can see i
have weblogic service instances
provision for me already let me submit
another service instance request so
click request service button you will be
asked to pick a service template you can
think of a service template as a
combination of a sorcerer WebLogic
domain you wanna clone and configuration
parameters and that need to be set such
as port numbers and gave in hip size and
forward pelagic servers after choosing
your service template specify the name
and when you want it to be provisioned
as you can see here for any request
you're submitting a new job will be
created and you can find that
information in this table for the
purpose of this demonstration let's
drill down to the service instance that
already exists as you can see the
landing page of the service instance
provides a summary of your service
instance such as a cpu and JVM Hebe
usage of your service instance let me
walk you through on how to configure a
data source directly for a DB service
instance you go to the data source
section and click create it will start
the data source configuration wizard you
can enter the name and here you can
either provide the connection string
information for your database or you can
simply choose the database service
instance from the drop-down if you have
database service instance already and
you can provide your name
and password and you can choose to test
whether the connection information is
correct or not I'm going to go ahead and
submit now that you have a data source
configured let's deploy in Java EE
application to the same leaders at
service instance you can go to the
application section and click deploy
button you can pick your application
from the software library well you will
have an option to pick your application
from the local file system you can
select your application and click deploy
now let me show you how to scale up your
service instance you can go to the
service instance menu in the left top
corner to scale up or scale down your
instance click scale a menu in the
pop-up you can select how many more new
menu server so you want it want to spin
off hope you found this demonstration
