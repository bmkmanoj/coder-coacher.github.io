demonstrate how an operator can use
Enterprise Manager to identify
performance problem experienced by a
real user to add a problem and drill
down to find the root cause of the issue
we will use four integrated tools in
this scenario first really user
experience insight or ruie to capture
the real user activities then this is
transaction management or vtm to
understand the back end transaction
topology and pinpoint the problematic
component we will continue which ATM
diagnostics or JVM D for a deep level
Java diagnostics and finally DB
Diagnostics this is the route dashboard
you can see a metrics
KPI is related to experience of real
users accessing the monitor application
you can see here that restoring
pageviews is pretty high for one of the
users we can also see that one of the
pages is performance I write quite fully
another thing that we can see is that
for Southey users there's a high
percentage of error pages so let's go
down and see more information about
these aro pages and users I will select
one of the users and drill down to see
session information for that user so
I'll retrieve the sessions that were
executed by that user in the last couple
hours and take a look inside one of
these sessions you can see here let the
user click through a few pages and one
of the pages is indicated as a as if it
returned with an error we can take a
quick look and see a copy or recording
of the page as the user saw it and in
the bottom we can actually see there was
an error message this is a functional
error and in order to continue the
investigation
I will drill down into BTM this
transaction management to see more
information and details about the
transaction that was involved by this
page
I drove drill down directly from Rui
into vtm and now I see the topology of
the transaction of the instant of the
transaction that was invoked by the page
we saw earlier we can see the entire
topology of the transaction and we can
see that there are couple of errors that
were reported in this transaction if we
look at more in more detail we can see
that there was a servlet invoked it was
calling the create new order service
which had an error but it was calling
the submit order service the catenary -
we can see that the following two
services were not even invoked in this
instance so the most likely culprit is a
disservice submit order so let's take a
look at the payload and we can see here
the request information and if we're
looking at the response we can see that
the respondents actually Java start race
so we need to continue our investigation
in the Java level and for that we will
bring I all drill down into JVM
diagnostics the drill down takes me
directly to the JVM performance
Diagnostics off the JVM instance the
transaction instance that we saw earlier
was running on and there's a look at
this page I can see that there is
database so my problem I see many
threads are waiting for database since
the problem is everything right now I'll
take a look at the live trace analysis
to see what's happening on the JVM
right now and indeed I can see that
there are
ten threads on database weight and three
other threads are locked so the next
obvious place to go would be into the
database and I can drill down directly
from here to the instance of the
database in which to which this JVM is
waiting the drill down takes me directly
to the SQL detail page in which I can or
a DBA can continue the investigation
let's conclude this demonstration thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
