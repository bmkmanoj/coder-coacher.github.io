welcome thank you for joining hopefully
others come in as we get started here so
today's topic the discussion here is
about best practices in industrial and
consumer markets using freescale and
java so robert thompson and i both
represent freescale and the presentation
today is going to take a different
perspective than what you've seen
throughout the conference where it's
been software on the job aside our
experience freescale's experience is in
the embedded space and so this we're
going to give you a perspective from the
hardware side and kind of talk about
where java can play with freescale in
these different markets so I'm sujatha
neidig I am a business development
manager freescale specifically with our
i dot MX portfolio and for those of you
who aren't familiar with i dot MX that's
our brand forearm apps processors and
then Robert Thompson is going to present
on the consumer side he's the director
of consumer segments so he's not tied to
specific business unit or product family
he looks at the market and find
solutions throughout freescale to give a
platform solution so today's agenda I'm
going to give you a little bit of
overview freescale who we are what we do
then we're going to do some market
snapshots I'm going to talk about the
industrial market segments and then I'm
going to hand it over to Robert who will
go into details on consumer and what we
call smart devices so first of all
freescale we're a global leader for
embedded processing solutions been in
the business for over 50 years strong
heritage in the embedded space we
started as Motorola the motorola
semiconductor group was spun off about
seven years ago and became Freescale
Semiconductor we have over 18,000
customers revenues in 2011 were 4.6
billion dollars we're a leader in many
different markets so we have networking
autumn
motive industrial and consumer you can
see that we're number one or two and in
all these markets that we address so
again I'm going to give you a
perspective now of solutions that we
provide in these different markets from
a hardware perspective and then how the
software is really what's defining the
growth in these markets and the ability
to compete in these markets and so
that's where we're partnering with Java
to bring together a total solution so
some trends in these markets spaces as
an the first one is the trend of
connectivity and you've heard a lot
about that over the last two days being
connected there's a lot of data that's
being collected because of that the
example in this bullet point is meters
so there's 1.3 billion electricity
meters that are installed today in the
world about sixteen percent of those are
actually smart or have connect or
connected so that data can be collected
remotely from those devices but that
number is growing exponentially by 2020
it's going to be 600 million smart
meters that are in the market second
trend related to m2m we see that there's
going to be an increase 22 fold by 2016
and really what's driving this is
connection between people and all the
machines and devices that are out there
and then the last trend is that
consumers and enterprise they all want
the users of these want it to have be
consistent experience across all of
these devices so whatever device I use
at home and then go to work and use our
work I want the same experience so all
of that is trends translate into this
graph here and this was honoree Rashard
our senior vp of marketing and sales
gave the keynote presentation yesterday
morning and this was a slide that he
shared so in 2008 is when we
became that's when the number of devices
exceeded the population so going to 2020
we see the number of connected devices
not just matching the number of people
but being over Saul most 7x the number
of people so seven point six billion
people in the world by 2020 50 billion
connected devices and I think that
numbers been thrown out several times
during the conference it's visit 50
billion it could be more it could be
magnitudes more but the concept is we
are growing exponentially from where
we're out today with connected devices
so to give a couple of examples the
first market segment I'm going to talk
about is in the industrial market what
we call smart energy so at freescale we
have put a lot of energy and effort into
addressing this market from the
infrastructure to the end devices in
like the meters so the smart grid is
talked about and that's a relatively new
term the grid has been around for a long
time but the grid is just not capable of
sustaining the power of use consumption
by the population today they're
inefficient they're expensive so there's
a lot of initiatives in globally to
drive a smarter grid so some of these
growth drivers are listed here the first
one is governments are mandating this in
Europe they have a plan to reduce energy
consumption overall by twenty percent
between now in the year 2020 UCD
regulations also that are happening so
that providers of the energy that bring
you the energy are different than the
ones that are transporting or creating
the energy in the US the stimulus
package invested 4.3 billion dollars
directly into the smart grid initiative
to drive that initiative to become
reality in China they've put nine point
seven billion dollar investment into
automated meter reading in autumn
dimitar infrastructure another growth
driver here is the utility companies
they have it's in their best interest to
do something differently than the way
it's being done because they need to be
able to optimize the distribution
infrastructure so they're not losing the
energy that's being created they also
need to prevent the potential blackouts
being able to manage the demand versus
supply of energy means that you need
information so that you can react on
that information when you when we can
tell consumers that there is a peak
usage right now and we're going to
charge you more the utility company can
say we're charging you more at this time
that will drive people to go and use
less energy during those specific times
so we're not loading the system so the
utility companies want to be able to
provide more services to the consumers
to be able to better manage energy a
third growth vehicle here is renewable
energies so a lot of homes my neighbor
just had solar panels installed and
there is a time when there there was
just not enough cost benefit the cost of
putting in solar panels versus what
you're going to save from it didn't do
business make business sense but we're
seeing you I know in Austin it's a
little bit more liberal town and a lot
of people care about the environment so
in our neighborhood we have a lot of
people that are now moving to these
solar panels but some of the benefits of
that is that you need to be able to take
that energy that consumers are creating
and then put that back into the grid and
then the last bullet here is in building
customer comfort or home management so
in the home you've got smarter meters
with smarter thermostats with displays
that lets you control the temperature in
different environments let you set and
program them to do when you're away
there's a company that has a new smart
thermostat out that's got a sensing
technology built into it so when you
leave your home it knows because it's
tied tethered to your cell phone it
knows when you're within a certain
distance of your home and it'll you can
program it so you leave the home at
make sure your temperature goes up if
it's the summer so that you're saving
energy when you're a mile from the home
and you're almost there it'll turn it
down so when you get in the house it's
out the temperature that you want like
we go on vacation turn up the air come
back to a really hot house you know so
these types of things are what's driving
everything to be connected in the home
so another example market is industrial
healthcare so trends for innovation for
healthcare first of all breaking it up
into three sub segments within
healthcare this is how we view the
market as home portable medical then
there's diagnostic patient monitoring
and therapy and then the last one is
medical imaging but with all three of
these there's a trend that is common of
making things more portable making them
connected and doing something with the
data that's being collected so for a
home portable you know it's not just
that you have a blood pressure monitor
it's a blood pressure monitor that can
take that information send it to a
gateway or somewhere so that you can
track and keep communicate back to a
doctor's office or just a track for your
own health diagnostic patient monitoring
and therapy it's the insurance
healthcare providers are trying to
figure out how to lower health care
costs and doing so means getting people
out of the hospital sooner so it's not
just about using this equipment in the
doctor's office or in the hospitals
anymore it's about taking that to the
home and being able to do treatment and
therapy through in a home environment
and then medical imaging being able to
take that in the ambulances and being
able to get data and respond to
emergencies quicker and be able to start
treatment quicker but all the all of
these things relate to cost efficiency
that's what's going to enable it in what
we're seeing now is that with the
hardware solutions that we provide from
freescale and what's happening out there
is we can enable many more devices to
become portable and become connected
because the costs are lower so here's an
example of our case study with the
company that we work with sonam before
many years there's a they saw a need
where there are sixty percent of the
emergency room visits by seniors were a
result of these seniors not taking
medication on time that's what drove
them to end up in the emergency room so
that was a problem that the sanam Bo
wanted to address and so they built this
standalone unit to be a medication alert
reminder as well as appointments and
then they took that standalone device
and turned it into a gateway or a hub so
it does other services it can connect up
to your blood pressure monitor or a
weight scale and it can track these
vital statistics and send that
information back to the doctor's office
if it's got a panic alarm sensor with it
so if the elderly person that's being
monitored Falls it sends a text message
to people that are on the list and send
them an alert to the doctor's office or
to a monitoring center that then
contacts the doctor's office so here's a
way that freescale technology has
enabled this type of monitoring to
happen in the home instead of in the
hospital and this is an area where we
see that bringing the software on top of
that is what's most important you know
we can build the hardware but to make
everything work and have them interface
that's where we see Java coming into
play so this is an overview of what I
just talked about the diagram here is
showing the home and all these devices
that we have in our homes if you are
trying to monitor your health what we
see as a trend is people care more about
wellness now it's not medical is just is
not just about treatment and recovery
it's about the wellness and preventive
so we've got these M devices whether
it's your fitness equipment weigh scale
pedometer in your home and then being
able to take all those devices get the
data from that turn that into
information
that goes through the internet into a
personal health record so that's
traditionally where Java has been
playing but now we see Java can with emy
Java ME and java SE go all the way to
the devices so from enterprise to the
edge same concept but this is now in a
hospital environment so even in the
hospital there's this need for
collecting data and managing the data so
you've got a patient bed here and that
that patient will have all kinds of
equipment around them monitoring their
vital signs delivering medication
monitoring their reaction we also list
you know the bedside infotainment so
there's many n devices in that room that
are treating the patient all that
information has to be securely sent to a
gateway and then go through the firewall
and into the cloud and become it stored
in a patient data manager so that then
the doctors and nurses can do something
with that data and know what know how to
act upon it so this is an example of
something that we've done at freescale
for the home area that I talked about we
have a reference design called the home
health hub reference platform this is an
example of it and you see the picture on
there but again it's the same concept of
a gateway in the home connecting to
these medical devices so there's a lot
of pictures up here but thermostat blood
pressure monitor blood glucose or weight
scale all of that can connect via
different connectivity that you see
listed here USB Bluetooth zigbee are
different examples of the connectivity
to these end devices so that's the front
end of the Gateway the Gateway takes all
that data and then sends it via Wi-Fi or
through ethernet to somewhere that
something can be done with that data
then so we've partnered with digi they
provide the cloud services and then
java runs on top of that also so again
the concept here is to be able to have
physicians your loved ones caregivers
monitor patients or people with chronic
diseases and help them manage those in
the comfort of their own home this same
platform you know we talked about smart
energy just a few minutes ago this same
platform can also enable home automation
so being able to turn on and off your
light switches change the thermostat
there's a smart plug here this is also
fueled by freescale connectivity
technology with a zigbee so turning the
devices in your home into connected
devices so now I've spent the last 10
minutes 15 minutes talking about
industrial markets and I'm going to turn
it over to Robert to give some examples
of consumer although he'll argue that a
lot of what I just talked about is
actually consumer devices also correct
getting too excited okay so what I'm
going to talk about is consumer and
often when we talk about the embedded
market people assume that we're talking
about industrial and enterprise and not
consumers so I'm going to train in the
next 20 minutes change your mind to make
you believe that consumer is just as
important for the embedded market as any
other segments so let me start by giving
you a definition so what is a smart
device and when you use this wonderful
term but marketing people throw around
most people think you're talking about a
smartphone or a tablet so let me give
you a definition that was kind of
started by IDC and it's been adopted and
changed a little so let's say for the
next 20 minutes a smart device is simply
something that has a managed system that
runs a high level operating system and
connects to the internet execute snay
tavor cloud-based applications and
analyzes data now you might be saying
that's not much of a definition you
really haven't given me anything to
grapple with it's very general and
you're right and the reason for that is
the biggest mistake when people talk
about smart devices is they think your
talk
just about smartphones and tablets and
consumer devices and that's not true if
you look at the definition what we're
talking about and if you look at this
conference where most people talk about
smart devices they're talking about the
opportunities below the tip of the
iceberg which is what the embedded
market is all about home energy
management smart appliances health and
fitness devices but if you look at all
these categories where most of the
opportunity is they fit the definition
we just gave for smart devices run smoke
mobile phones and consumer electronics
also fit that device but they're all
smart devices and so when we talk about
this embedded market and the growth I
think we have to stop talking about
consumer and industrial because a smart
device is something that simply analyzes
data either natively or in the cloud and
presents that to the end-user ie the
consumer so every smart device by nature
is a consumer device now if you look at
it we've had a lot of numbers here my
numbers are a lot lower than a lot of
other people's but in the keynote
yesterday we said any number is probably
an underestimation but let's look at how
this migration from embedded to smart
devices is going to happen and let's use
something that additionally would be put
in the industrial market but again I
would argue as consumer is also
infotainment so if you look at this this
is a traditional turn for tainment
system it's actually my car although not
normally that clean it's a LD a 62 that
a form that was purchased in 2006 here
in the US of course we're in what
software does it run well you know the
only thing I have is a very small screen
telling me what radio station I'm on or
what music is playing for example pearl
jam which I'll talk about in a moment
the application processor is probably an
8-bit 16-bit MCU I don't really know I
haven't taken it apart there's no
connectivity Ali didn't introduce
Bluetooth until two thousand seven so I
have no connectivity the user interface
is very squarely aimed at the machine
not the user knobs and sand any
standards are proprietary because it's a
closed ecosystem they didn't have to
work with any any app developers or
think about how they were fitting into
an eco
so how is this becoming a smart device
well we know that as the infotainment
systems and the needs of users expand
from not only navigational systems but a
very similar user interface to what
they're having on their smartphone or a
tablet auto companies are migrating to
high level operating systems that could
be Android it could be Java or it could
be genivi a whole range and there's no
standardization in the automotive market
right now we know that they're migrating
from a very simple MCU to multi-core
because of all the different tasks that
are required in an automobile today
connectivity is Bluetooth Wi-Fi
potentially even 4G LTE very soon the
user interface is very user orientated
because it's similar to what you're
going to have on your smartphone or
tablet and they're adopting standards
because they're part of a wider
ecosystem so again what we're seeing
here is this migration from embedded to
smart is happening very quickly and it's
across all these segments is it consumer
it is industrial it really doesn't
matter because it's this migration away
from a closed embedded system to a smart
system that allows a lot greater user
interaction productivity and features to
be added that require not only from our
standpoint more processing power but
also require more operating systems or
platforms that allow more functionality
and evolution from a development
standpoint so what do we say when we're
talking about this we say the best
practices are you know follow the money
if you look at smart devices IDC a
forecasting that by 2015 smart devices
will constitute thirty percent of
embedded devices but catch a 75-percent
of the revenue so when we talk to our
customers we're saying that you can stay
embedded but your competitors are moving
to smart devices so even in your if you
try and stay within your particular
market your competitors are going to be
making that your competitive device is
smart they're going to capture more
revenue than you are if you stay where
you are you're probably going to lose
market share and potential revenue the
first question you have to ask yourself
is what ecosystem are you going to plug
too because by being smart the
assumption is you're connected if you're
connected you're connected to an
ecosystem both from an app level
standpoint but also from a platform or
software standpoint which which
ecosystem do you want to plug into which
developer environment do you want to
become part of often when we talk to
customers and they say well I'm going to
have a smart device therefore I have to
use Android they're saying that because
they want to plug into the applet the
app developer ecosystem that they think
they can then often not aware of the
other app developer ecosystems that are
out there or the developer community
simply because of a lack of awareness
because they're coming from the embedded
market where they've worked in a closed
ecosystem and software simply has been
an afterthought from an artist
perspective so that's really you know
trying to give you the background of
where we see you know consumer fitting
into the overall embedded environment
now from the very first keynote of this
you know two day conference we've talked
about the embedded embedded market
growing extremely quickly what I want to
talk about is how we believe that's
going to happen so let me give you an
example and this should be nothing new
to almost everybody if you look at the
tablet market last year and I've taken
out that uh that dominant device from
Cupertino and you see what's left in
November Samsung controlled about
sixty-three percent of the market this
is a US only three months later as we
know a certain company by launching a
product was able to catch her over
thirty percent of the market in three
months now this is a trend where the
consumer market you're seeing innovation
and disruption happen extremely quickly
was this a one-off occurrence well no I
mean if you look what's happened let's
go back to 2007 when the king / first
kindle launched it sold three million
devices in 18 months at the time that
was the fastest selling consumer
electronics device ever 2010 the iPad
came out 15 million in nine months and
then 2011 Microsoft Kinect 8 million in
two months and that is officially the
fastest selling consumer electronics
place ever but what we're seeing here is
a trend of a device not going have to go
through that that typical product
evolution where you sell to the early
adopters as people become aware the
early majority and then the laggards
adopt the product life cycle that is
changing rapidly and you could argue
here well you know you've picked three
extremely large companies that have the
resources and the marketing dollars to
achieve this well let me give you a case
study of a company you've probably not
heard of but free scalars worked with
they're called key ingredient they
started life in 2009 as a website for
foodies so for food fanatics I'm not one
of them but you know I have joined the
website and actually used a little bit
it's for recipe swapping and that social
concept of following your favorite chef
looking at recipes and they were
successful within their niche market but
what happened was their customers said
you know this is great but what happens
when I go to print off a recipe I have
to print it off and take a piece of
paper to the kitchen when I go to the
kitchen that piece of paper falls off
the counter just as I'm reading the
ingredients it gets covered in food or I
take my wonderful laptop to the kitchen
and the battery runs out or I spill
something on the keyboard just as I'm
doing doing the recipe can you develop a
hardware device specifically to be used
in the kitchen so they listen to their
customer and what they did is they went
from being a website company to
developing in all intents and purposes a
tablet specifically designed for the
kitchen now this is not difficult to do
there's no you know there's no secret
source in developing a tablet or where
it can be manufactured in southern China
they chose linux as their operating
system because it was a closed ecosystem
initially there was no Wi-Fi
connectivity to download new recipes to
device you had to connect it through USB
to your PC they then realized that if
they added functionality I your Wi-Fi
dongle they'll give their users a lot
more variety of flexibility they could
download recipes directly to
the tablet itself and so they evolved
from being that embedded to a smart
device by going from being an embedded
to smart device suddenly they started
getting a lot of interest from not
necessarily their competitors but
companies in the same field what
happened was they were actually
approached by one of the largest
European makers of kitchen utensils they
are a small company of 15 people
actually based in austin and this
company actually invested in them and
said we want that your device to become
the hub device for the kitchen so what
we're doing is we're trying to make our
devices I breadmakers crock pots even
thermometers and scales smart we're
adding connectivity to them in terms of
an plus and we want a hub device where
that data can be sent to in the end user
can read it so what from going from
embedded to a smart device what they did
is they changed their market they
suddenly realized that they could expand
their their potential market they could
pretend they could expand their
competitive set and the only challenge
they face was they had gone with Linux
they as they added as as their investors
asked them to add it features they had
to go back now if they'd had a chosen a
software that was easy and more scalable
more modular they would find it easier
to evolve and that's where the software
comes in and a platform such as Java if
you look at going from embedded to smart
and you evolve very quickly the need to
be scalable the modular becomes very
important if you use an operating
systems such as Linux unless you have a
lot of expertise within your company
it's very difficult without going back
starting from scratch to add that
modularity so what is also happening in
this very quick evolution so I'm going
to take a little poll here to see if
half of you are still awake who's heard
a Kickstarter might put your hand down
you don't count the reason I'm asking is
because my esteemed colleague here who
comes from a different area when he saw
this slide he said what's Kickstarter
and I was surprised because you know in
the consumer world Kickstarter if you're
not if you're not
familiar with about half them half the
audience was is a crowd a crowdfunding
website this is changing the way
hardware can be evolved and go to market
it's a site where if you think you have
a good idea you can put together a
90-second video and ask people to
contribute a little as ten or twenty
dollars to your project and you raise
money very quickly now the problem with
hardware development before was to go
from a concept of for a prototype could
cost at least a hundred thousand dollars
so a lot of a lot of ideas never got off
the ground a lot of small companies that
had great ideas could never progress
because they didn't have the funding to
do it that is changing sites such as
Kickstarter now give anybody who has a
good idea the idea to go from concept to
prototype very quickly and then other
inventions such as 3d printing which you
can now buy a 3d printer for two
thousand dollars allows you to go from
concept to a first prototype very
quickly and very cheaply I used to work
for a large pc OEM where I was always
amazed that to go from first concept to
prototype cost at least ten thousand
dollars per prototype therefore the cost
of economics of hardware is changing
radically as all these small companies
can now go get to market a lot quicker
the importance of software becomes even
more important because it's all about
time to market and you know what they're
looking for is we say you know the
consumer is all about time to market so
the first thing you have to do is say
you know from immediate action
standpoint what do people want on what
can I provide if I wait for the perfect
product I'm going to miss that window of
opportunity talk to your customers ask
them very quickly ask them what they
want get a product to market is you now
can do through funding and learn as you
go a lot fail often and fail frequently
is a term that has evolved in the
consumer world because the idea of
waiting to develop your product
completely doesn't exist because you're
going to give miss that window of
opportunity and then finally where does
the software fit in
well in this new world of hardware
device evolution there are where
developers are looking for software that
will reduce their development time
because they can now get to market a lot
quicker on the hardware side they're
looking for faster time to market and
also scalability because they're not
dealing with this embedded closed device
that won't evolve over time if you look
at what the major competitor major
software operating systems or platforms
in the consumer market are doing today
is they're constantly evolving they're
constantly evolving by every six months
releasing a new API structure which
causes a lot of chaos for both freescale
and a whole supply chain that try to cut
port and keep up with the evolution if
you have a software that is scalable and
modular that allows people not to start
from scratch and have to worry about
backwards and forwards compatibility
with the API structure you're going to
deliver a platform which will be a lot
of value to a lot of these small
hardware developers that are now able to
get to market where in the past they
never been able to consumerization of IT
so you know in the consumer world and
marketing we have to come up with terms
to keeps ourselves in business so
consumerization of 80 has been around
for quite a while what does it really
mean well it's really summed up in this
chart here which was data released by
ABI Research earlier this year that said
you know sixty percent of tablets that
will be purchased in the US this year or
bite sorry by 2015 will be personally
owned but used at work so what this
chart it's saying if you if you look at
the chart Lee the light blue is what
corporations are going to buy so in
terms of tablets they are very much a
personal device still and they will stay
that so companies large companies will
start deploying tablets but they'll only
make up twenty percent of the total
tablet market in 2015 the majority are
going to be people like us that buy
tablets at retail stores are online and
walk into our corporation tonight RT
deployment IT departments if I can even
say and say I want to use this as my
primary productivity device so this
trend is nothing new it's really a
hangar
from the pc world where it never really
caught on for a number of reasons and
it's called bring your own device which
again is a term that's been thrown
around what's happening is in the tablet
world especially when you get to the
cortex a15 your have the ability to
support type 1 bare-metal hypervisor
'he's in a very productive manner
therefore you're going to be able to
have one device with to uniquely
distinct domains so you can have your
personal domain where you can imagine
what the most popular OS at the moment
is where you can load your own
applications and have your own
personalization but then when you walk
into the IT department they can load
their secure OS Java SE for example that
they can control they can determine what
access you have what apps you can
download and is this a consumer device
is it an enterprise device this is the
crossover and this is one of the major
trends we're seeing and again one of the
big opportunities potentially for Java
even in what is traditionally all
thought of as a pure consumer space IE
tablets so really what we're seeing is
you know this evolution of what's called
the prosumer it has been around for a
while there's no such thing as the
consumer anymore or the majority of
devices smart devices that we're going
to purchase or be evolved you can't say
they're going to be used for the
consumer or in the enterprise they're
going to be used for both realizing that
security becomes extremely important so
you have to choose an OS or a platform
that had inherently is secure and you
have to pick the partner that will give
you the level of security that you
believe your end users will need or
require and then finally to finish off I
have to talk about you know the trends
and the hot devices because i am a
consumer guy at heart so i'm going to
talk about wearables and then another
wonderful term accessories and see where
this all fits into the embedded market
so the the wearables category is
actually one of the fastest-growing
categories but again when you think
wearables you know is this consumer is
this industrial where does it fit in it
crosses both market
the beep the two biggest sub segments in
the wearables category is actually
health and fitness and smart watches so
if we look at an example on on the
health side we work with a company
called conveyances which valved a mobile
cardiac patch which you instead of
having to lug around the large machine
that monitors your heart is now a small
patch that sends a signal back to a hub
device that sends it back to a database
that can be accessed by your caregiver
by your doctor enterprise device does
that sound familiar i think we've been
talking about that for the last couple
of days this is where it fits in again
do you need a platformer and operating
system on this device no but this is a
sensor this is the collection of the
data that will feed back into the
enterprise the beauty of this is it's
collecting the data that can be then be
viewed by other smart devices by the
caregiver by the doctor fitting in I'm
watch then we have the one of the
representative the company here is what
the one of the first android-based
watches what does it do it tethers to
your smartphone and it enables you to
receive your email your RSS feeds your
favorite applications without having to
take your smart phone out of your pocket
now you know when people when I say that
people always look at me with
quizzically as a few people are doing
you know why would I want a SmartWatch
when I have a smartphone it's in my
pocket why would I want to take it out
you know I work for many years with with
a person who worked for sony ericsson
when they were first setting up the
cellular network and he said you know
when I was when we 44 start when we were
first marketing's cell phones people
sitting in why would I want to cell
phone I have a phone in my home when I
get in my car I have a phone and when i
get out of my car i walking to my office
and i have a fun why would I ever want a
cell phone well I think a SmartWatch is
the same thing today it might seem a
stretch of the imagination and say I
have a smartphone why would I want a
SmartWatch it's that evolution of
constantly being connected and evolving
and be
connected to the cloud what the
SmartWatch does is it uses your smart
phone as a modem to get back to the
cloud the enterprise where the data is
stored it's that constant evolute that
constant connection between the end
device to the enterprise we talk about
that a lot and we talk about it mostly
in the enterprise sense if you go back
to the keynote if we talked about
tracking of containers people can relate
to that that's this is another instance
of a device to the end to the enterprise
being connected we will be constantly
connected this is wearable device this
is the wearables category which is just
evolving right now and then finally the
quantified self again is another term
that is just evolving it's this concept
of we will be constantly connected but
we will be constantly connected by
simple devices that will feed data to
hub devices that will either analyze
locally or send that data to the cloud
to the databases that will analyze it
and then send it back to be presented
either on the hub device or another
device so even when we're asleep where
we've been monitored the larks sleep
monitor is something you put on your arm
it monitors your how long you sleep how
deeply you sleep you get up in the
morning you obviously have to weigh
yourself on the scale that scale is
connected to a central hub device that
monitors your weight how much weight
you're losing or you're gaining and then
of course as soon as you get dressed
you're with your Fitbit activity monitor
that monitors you throughout the day of
how much exercise you're doing now all
of these devices are very simple devices
but they're collecting the data and you
know the other thing we've heard
constantly throughout the last couple of
days is big data this cons this amount
the amount of data that will be
collected is beyond the imagination
icing on the enterprise site this is
also going to happen on the consumer
side and in our personal lives so again
we have to look at the collection of the
data from the devices where freescale
plays how does that day to get sent to
hub devices sent to the enterprise in
terms of the servers analyzed and sent
back to us it's quickly evolving and
what we would traditionally fix seeing
as consumer market
going to play just as important part in
that as many of the other market
segments that we traditionally think of
in the embedded space so to summarize
the embedded device market innovation is
just beginning a new revolution I say
that from both the ability to get to
market very quickly the types of devices
and the type of software that will be
needed many companies as I showed you a
simple company like key ingredient with
15 people can go from being a website to
a hardware system company to a hub
device for a whole ecosystem within two
years it's not just large companies with
metal a lot of resources and dollars to
spend on promotions that can achieve
this and finally all of these companies
they need a software platform that
allows them to get to market quickly
because whether you're in the consumer
world or any other market we've seen
time to market is being reduced in every
market we playing you need secure
software security is becoming so
important because we said there's no
such thing as a consumer product there's
no such thing as an enterprise product
it's a prosumer product they're going to
be used everywhere because they're with
you all the time you need security you
need a rich set of AP is that allows you
to extend the functionality without
having to go back to square one and
evolve your software every new
generation of products and then finally
it has to be standards-based because
it's in all part of an ecosystem and you
have to use standard scalable
architecture that allows you to evolve
both your products and your portfolio's
and it's all part of connected
intelligence ok thank you very much for
your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
