engagement and monitoring presents
managing messages on own social
properties this demo shows you how to
use engage to manage the messages and
conversations that are sent to your
owned properties either publicly or
privately so to get started open engage
and choose an account from the channels
pain the type of account is designated
with the logo for that account type such
as the Facebook and Twitter logos I will
start with the facebook channel at the
top of the messages pain the messages
can be sorted by all messages that are
posted on the pages and private messages
indicated by direct messages I like to
sort these by all to be sure that I see
every message click a message to open it
this is a public facebook message and
notice that you have more actions
available with the post made directly on
your timeline you can like this post and
you can also put it in the trash which
deletes it from the pages timeline but
keeps a record of it in your deleted
folder with and engage when you click
the drop-down height is another option
and you would use this option to hide
the post from your public timeline
closing the drop down I can see now all
of the comments listed for this message
and here you can like individual
comments if you choose to reply to the
post your reply is posted to the live
page and if required you can include
links in your reply next I will look at
a Twitter account at the top of the
messages pain the tweets can be sorted
by all tweets which are original tweets
by your group at mentions from other
tweets which are designated by mentions
and direct messages again sort them by
all to be sure you see every message
the actions you can take on a Twitter
post include reply retweet the original
tweet or retweet with comment if you're
managing more than one Twitter handle
you choose the handle from which to
reply or retweet so that's how easy it
is to respond to public messages in
social engagement and monitoring please
visit our documentation at the URL
listed and see the Oracle Learning
Library for other engage demos that
describe how to navigate and manage
messages thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
