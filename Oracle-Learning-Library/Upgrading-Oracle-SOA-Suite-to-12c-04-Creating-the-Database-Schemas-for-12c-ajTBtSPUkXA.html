the fourth in a series of eight videos
about upgrading Oracle's so a suite to
version 12c if you haven't yet seen the
first three videos start at the
beginning and view the sequence in order
if you've already seen them welcome back
you're in the right place we've taken
care to verify our pre upgrade
requirements have been met including
making sure our operating system JDK and
Oracle database are certified to work
with 12c we've installed the version 12c
software in a new Oracle home directory
now in this video we're going to stop
our 11g servers and other processes and
create the new schemas required for
version 12 one three the repository
creation utility or RCU is used to
create and manage fusion middleware
database schemas before creating a
schema RCU performs prerequisite checks
to ensure that certain minimum
requirements are met the schemas are
created the required table spaces and
data files are also created RCU also
maintains a database table named schema
version registry that map's the schemas
and their related prefixes we'll see
each of these things as we demonstrate
using the RC you to create database
schemas for our 12c installation before
we run the RCU we need to shut down the
managed servers the node managers the
administration server and system
components such as OHS that may be using
the schemas we want to upgrade we also
need to be absolutely sure that no other
components or users are operating on the
same database instance that will be
accessed by the repository creation
utility there are multiple ways to do
this including using Enterprise Manager
PL sequel or other tools in our demo
environment the easiest way to do this
is to stop and restart the database and
listener once the database is restarted
we're ready to run the RC you to run the
RC you will log into the host and open a
terminal window will navigate to Oracle
home Oracle common bin notice that's the
new Oracle home
that was established when we installed
the 12c software from there we'll invoke
the repository creation utility we've
got our command line prepared we press
ENTER to invoke the RCU the welcome
screen appears when the RCU is started
the navigation pane on the left
summarizes the tasks that are Cu will
help us complete each item in the
navigation pane represents a specific
screen that will prompt us for
information required to create our
schemas as we run the RCU the listing in
response to the options we select if you
have the necessary permission and
privileges to perform DBA activities on
your database select system load and
product load on the create repository
screen if you don't have the necessary
permission or privileges to perform
those activities select prepare scripts
for system load instead that option will
generate a sequel script which can be
provided to your database administrator
in this demo we have the necessary
privileges so we're going to accept the
default option system load and product
load on the database connection details
screen we provide the information the RC
you will need to connect to our database
we start with the hostname we provide
the port number the service name
the username that's any user with DBA or
assist DBA privileges and that users
password double-check our typing and
select next to proceed we see that our
prerequisites have been checked we click
OK to continue on the Select component
screen we're asked whether to use an
existing prefix or to create a new
prefix for our schema for our sample
installation we're going to use the
existing prefix dev the prefix in your
production environment is probably going
to be different for more information
refer to the documentation title
creating schemas with the repository
creation utility in the component
section we select the new schemas to be
created for 12c based on our topology
and installed software we're going to
select the available audit services
options again prerequisites are checked
we click OK on the schema password
screen we specify how we want to set the
schema passwords on our database in this
video we're going to use the same
password for all schemas so we provide
that password and then we confirm by
providing it again click Next to proceed
the map table spaces screen shows the
default and temporary tablespaces
that'll be created for the components we
selected earlier to manage tablespace is
button provides access to options that
will allow you to create or modify table
spaces we're going to accept the
defaults and continue the confirmation
dialog advises us that any table spaces
that don't already exist will be created
we click OK to confirm we want to
continue with that the create table
spaces dialog box tells us the table
spaces have been created the summary
screen shows all the input we've
provided we review that input for
accuracy and then click create to
continue
next we see the completion summary
screen which reports the actions that
have been taken note the access to the
RCU and other log files we can access
these log files to debugging issues we
encounter or to verify logged
confirmation of success when we're done
we click close to dismiss the RCU and
we're returned to our command line
earlier in this video we said that the
RCU maintains the mapping between the
schemas and prefixes in the schema
version registry table we can use the
sequel query on screen to view the
version status and upgrade state of each
schema record in that table we can
examine the results to verify the
successful creation of the new schemas
and as we'll see in the next video this
list of schemas and their versions will
also be useful when we use the upgrade
assistant to upgrade our existing
schemas here are the schemas in our
sample database first we see our newly
created 12:1 three schemas their
versions and their status this confirms
that the RCU is successful we see our
11g schemas and their information as
well in the next video we'll be
upgrading these schemas to 12:1 3 your
list of schemas may be similar but it
probably won't be identical to this
it'll vary depending on which components
you have installed and their current
versions the Oracle documentation
upgrading with the upgrade assistant
includes a list of schemas that are
available for upgrade and instructions
on how to interpret the results to
determine if your version of each schema
is supported for upgrade for this demo
we'll set this information aside until
our next upgrade task that concludes our
conversation on creating database
schemas for 12c in our next video we'll
use the upgrade assistant to upgrade our
current schemas and our active instance
data until then I'm Ron Pinkerton thanks
for your time and attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
