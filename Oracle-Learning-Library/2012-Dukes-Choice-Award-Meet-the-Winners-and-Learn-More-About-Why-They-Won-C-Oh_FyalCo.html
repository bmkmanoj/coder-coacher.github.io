start all right so weird we are here to
do the Duke Choice Awards so guys that
are doing your presentations you have
less time so we'll do that very quickly
so here comes the introduction and we'll
get started with everything as we move
in here so I have to do a little roller
so it sounds good when we do the
recording later so welcome to the 130
shin of the Java spotlight podcasts live
from Java one and the baath tonight is
the Duke choice awards winners and this
is an exciting time we did this last
year we had about a third of the crowd
that's what we have this year so it's
kind of exciting to see this growing and
we and I see the people that won last
year are coming back this year so that's
that's even better so alright what our
job I me services that we don't want to
talk about that oh we want to talk about
the first the first Duke Choice Award
winners which is a london java community
so Martin come on up all right you got
four and a half minutes all right for
half a semester there's no way II too
long I think I don't I look at ya
exported to keynote exported to
powerpoint beautifully yeah so okay my
dad in a few minutes ago actually you
were the first one to send it was
corrupted yeah exactly so take not
technology fell from a Java user group
there you have it okay so yeah I'm
Martain I help run the London java
community with a whole bunch of us here
in the audience so hey guys yeah and
basically what we've been focusing on in
the last couple years really but in the
last year in particular is trying to get
developers more involved in the Java
standards that they've been having to
use themselves for the past 10 15 years
we hopefully tried to stop complaining
as much as we used to because we used to
swear a lot and say nasty things about
our friends the vendors in particular
and so yeah so we started a whole bunch
of workshops and things we've expanded
that with our friends in brazil and
north america and
and Morocco other places like that and
we're kind of hoping that we can have
this global program where we hack on
code hack on standards nice and early
and bring all that feedback back to the
standards body we somehow weirdly
managed to get a seat on the executive
committee which means we've learned some
Latin and we've lived some legals there
were a lot of weird people that voted
for you yeah exactly we kind of put
something out on Twitter and apparently
Twitter is a great way to get elected
for an election so Obama take notice the
other program we're running which was
kind of an offshoot of adopter jsr was
adopt OpenJDK a whole bunch of the
developers that joined us in London on
adopter jsr said we actually want to
hack on Java itself and so we went sure
that'll be really easy and so myself and
a few others sat down over a weekend and
tried to build OpenJDK and we failed and
we called ourselves stupid and then we
emailed Delabar who helps run the
community from from Oracle site on
OpenJDK and he said no you're not being
stupid as just a rite of passage so yeah
we've been working with the other Java
user groups to improve that situation as
well we've had some really good success
alongside Oracle and those two other two
programs we've been running and we got
kindly a nominated for a dookie and yeah
it's been really cool so thanks very
much who's going to get the dookie
actually a guy called Barry cranford
back in London who founded the ljc is
going to get it and believe it or not he
is the only ethical recruiter in the
world all right thank you
okay I now have us a time clock up here
so they will be on the time clock from
here on in so student Nokia developer
group come up student kingdom of mobile
application developers right so that's
what we represent so romka Shep is ahead
and founder of the student Nokia group
and I'm from Nokia I am so ready and a i
support the group and work with the
group actively so this is a group of
very young talented engineers designers
software developers and they're also a
lot of mentors from the industry
involved with the students trying to
innovate and teach them mobile computing
and mobile development a little bit over
a year from now I passed from a year
from from now actually the group
actually started weather like tens of
students together hacked up a hackathon
session and started learning mobile
computing and mobile programming and
what we've seen now for fast forwarding
to a year ahead we are about 2,000
students and the students from different
background designers software developers
industry participate also part of that
and ROM has put a lot of effort to grow
this group across India so there are
more than seven cities in India where
they are student developers from
different universities working on this
and this group has grown to two thousand
plus they're online they are all the
time innovating and developing
applications together and few key
achievements of this group which we
actually started to check what should we
actually report at javaone and we were
amazed with our results itself because
there are so many students working on
different parallel paths we try to
summarize the whole lot so we have
overall reach 500 plus applications
actually in the application store so
there are many more under development by
these students and there are over 2,000
plus students from seven countries not
just seven cities they have started to
grow in seven different countries and
basically we
reached 5 million downloads so we have 5
million consumers from these
applications and it's and when we
checked which countries where these
applications are being downloaded it's
over 200 plus countries there's a lot of
innovation lot of capability energy this
this team has and it's growing quite
rapidly and we are amazed me being a
Nokia and working with them you are
amazed with the passion energy levels
over here so it's not just learning not
just teaching other peers they have the
students himself have their own programs
they teach themselves they have they
have their own program they have created
a diploma program for six months
training giving hand holding other
students to learn how to program on
mobile devices and also pushing it to
the stores so with this what they have
mainly been doing is putting all these
applications for free and very soon now
they started to learn that they can also
monetize they can learn about business
models they can learn about how do we
use in-app advertising and some students
have even earned about two thousand
dollars per month so so we have great
achieve means your great stories you're
all excited about this and being in
nokia i'm more more excited spending a
lot of time in the student group though
this is not my main role of job in the
company but i see that this is a very
energetic team and we're hoping that it
grows it's growing in many more
countries now the thing that I find
exciting about this is the fact that
this was all started by the students
themselves oh yeah what this was not
something in nokia said oh let's go get
the students no no the nokia was working
over six or seven years and with
different universities and these
students belong to those universities
and we have had direct collaboration
with the university labs doing research
and these students connected to
themselves they created their own
programs and they have especially rom
being leading the whole groups
everywhere and there are many more
starts in in this group which are which
are highlighted in some of the slides
later and presentations so they have
created their own program and they've
all already always been saying we don't
want much of professional support we
know the stuff we can teach ourselves
you can do the programming ourselves all
we need is a support for infrastructure
where we can go have fun hackathons and
give us enough budget for running the
show like Jesus and and hold and that's
all that's all the students all these
pizzas alright well thank you very much
oh and this is their this is their
slides on what they need so if you're
interested in that you're a student
certainly come and join up so jelastic
all right I will let you run it and i'm
going to start your timer reset here we
go that's great so I'll tell you guys a
little story so a couple years ago we
were a Java startup and we're doing some
fancy java application whatever
revolutionary in a browser or whatever
it was and it was a job application and
we always got to launch it as beta and
we just couldn't find good java hosting
for it so ill so the whole jelastic was
like a huge pivot in our history and
initially were just trying the silver
only just build some level of layoffs
automation that would let us host our
solution somewhere and undo that manual
administration of the servers and
virtual machines and load balances all
that stop right and at the same time
being Java developers we didn't want to
to get locked in right we didn't want to
go with something like Google App Engine
like your coin and just get locked in
because we would have to rewrite our app
so basically AB jelastic is the Java
cloud job hosting the way that we wanted
just where we just try to imagine what
we would want ourselves and we did that
so basically it's easy to use UI for
everything no need to learn new command
line new API is intuitive get such
within minutes and no recording this
don't have to change any any liability
single line of code and ultimately
scales etc blah blah blah and another
thing that that we made like made a
choice in jelastic was that we we wants
to have a hosting platform a cloud
platform but we didn't want to host it
which is kind of like so you come up
with a cloud but you don't want to be a
cloud vendor which was kind of weird if
you think about it but we didn't have
any
Vincent doing hosting right we didn't
want to do the actual like sort of
maintenance so we made with an Android
model in a way that we recreated a
platform and that we want to host us to
their hosting industry to the hosting
companies twice peas and we said you
know what do you want to compete against
like Google's and hero cause of the
world here it is like just take our
platform and just insult in your
hardware and use it and that that was
like totally crazy and a year ago java--
one we will launch that and we didn't
know what would happen after that and
but wow it looks really weird but you
hear or like fast last night yeah that's
the last unity that might have killed it
so yeah so and last year has been like
crazy so we launched with like started
with zero and then if we fast forward
now jelastic has been launched by horses
in the US in Europe and in Germany in UK
in Finland and Russia in Japan is
getting lodged in Brazil within just a
few weeks it's in private base right now
there and it's getting launching in hong
kong and china by the end of the year so
it's been an absolutely crazy year and
the far more praise than we ever thought
it would be we are now feature them in
the Foresters pass report for this year
we've been used by more than 25,000
customers actually java developers from
these houses so it's been absolutely
crazy and fantastic and one last thing
oh we have two minutes chrome so an hour
one last thing that I will have to spend
to me is talking about that now is that
we've again something that we were not
doing initially but something that we
added recently based on the feedback
from from developers and from ice vs
like like you guys is that we've
introduced packaging within jelastic so
now a lot of a lot of companies a lot of
ice vs they have their applications
amazing wonderful java applications but
they don't have them available as a
cloud service especially in all these
geographies around the world and a lot
of these applications are not even
two channels and they don't have beauty
and customer provision and all that
stuff so some of them came to us like I
want to give a plug for cyclists which
is a popular online banking system
because they day one of the first ones
to do that and then they said you know
what you have that platform as a service
you have automated scaling and provision
and stuff why won't you have that in
your platform and why won't you just
take our Java app as it is because you
can run anything without code changes
and you just figure out how to do that
whole provisioning automatically and
then we did that so now we edit that
packaging ability for iseries just
specify what kind of service you need
whatever like my application is a
glassfish and it needs like glassfish of
that kind of size and that kind of
database and help us how you configure
that and specify the database connection
speed and stuff and I'm just package
that automatically have that package I
have that automated deployment in
jelastic good we good and where we did
that so now you can have your
applications and where without having to
recode that you can just package them in
jelastic and then get them deployed
around the world and serve your
customers around the world so it's a
pretty exciting one last thing I
understand you can't have one
high-profile user yeah well yeah bad
that was so apart from a pass from
getting getting this award which was
like probably number number one exciting
theme for this year the other the other
really really exciting teen was when it
turned out that James Joslin that the
father of Java and big order who we
prayed every day for a lot of years in
our lives I turned out that he's a
custom of drastic which was a huge
positive short that's because at some
point very cool very cool
okay now this is one that I was never
Eric's I was reading through this and
I'm going NATO okay and then I was
reading that you know high-performance
visualization environment I have a lot
of of cadet I live outside the Air Force
Academy so I have a lot of cadets that
are really depending upon this
application working well yeah actually
yes macys the system is used to provide
the evidence in in Europe I was barely
almost a kid when I saw war games and
that was this kid that was dialing in
and playing tic-tac-toe with the with
the server in all right which is just
outside my house so make sure you get it
right a lot of time has passed and at
that time basically a defense was
performed on those washing machines that
you know people the operators were
looking at the radar the screen and it
was basically everything made in
hardware and you could actually get some
suntan as well from the screens already
already in the late 80s basically a NATO
decided to move away from from that kind
of hard work because it was extremely
cost and it was dedicated proprietary so
the first solution and the first
generation of the Miss consoles made in
see motive and of course the most
natural solution was to basically mimic
on a computer hardware what what the
washing machines were looking like so we
have basically the first incarnation of
the maze software reproduced almost a
hundred percent the look and feel of the
washing machines the operator said to
learn imagine that on those consoles the
British were interfacing with the system
with a five digits of the new medical
keyboard I mean what they were saying
well this is real upgrade yeah basically
yes indeed the courses were lasting
months because you have to learn like
under them 14 medical digits that you
had to input in order to have the server
performing the operations that you
wanted of course now times have evolved
and
people at Google at all at home Google
Earth and some and they come basically
in the Air Force and they see the
operations why do we have this all
looking awkward system so basically we
MPC decided why don't we revamp the user
interface so we started the program we
went around with our defense systems air
traffic control systems and we try to
pick the best from the design ideas and
that's how the new main console came up
the novice concert was ten way to decide
on how to make it the national solution
was a Java because now basically
universities developers study Java
initially there were some kind of
difficulties in order to say to get
accepted that you know a soft real-time
system we use Java you know defense
people think you know ADA see but given
that there are already existing systems
it looked like natural to go to Java and
the next solution was then to use the
net in draft form so and since we
started developing this we decided you
know why don't we make mice that is a
kind of platform to develop air defense
applications basically we said we could
make something like the NetBeans
platform and netbeans ide be there is a
platform and then the idea is the main
usage of the platform but is not your
exclusive one so as we speak actually
last week the the second project using
my says platform 9 started so now we can
really say that we have a console
application running on the console
environment and another product that is
using the platform underlining it very
good more what we could say I mean we
would ever never expected to to get the
price because when we saw the
competitors I mean we were just dreaming
of them you know Scala closures and
inside
no way that we are going we are going to
win we had actually to blackmail our
customers saying if you want an
improvement on the we wander over here
the work for us we don't bow for us
there will be a droid coming over oh all
right level but the animals come to see
me maybe yes yeah exactly all right well
thank you very much thanks all right
right one of my favorite groups I'm not
an honorary Duchess yet but I'm working
on that so Regina hi I'm Regina I'm one
of the board members of Duchess Duchess
is a Jaffa user group for women in Jaffa
we're an international group and what
happened it's okay i want my next slide
well then go to the next slide oh okay
Vera international Jaffa user group with
over 500 members in 57 countries and we
work with chapters that means that you
can have your local chapter which has
his own rules these are one the few of
our chapters that we have we have 41 in
the Netherlands that's where we were
started by Linda from the PO she wanted
to she was going to conferences and you
say I want to talk to the few women that
are there but she's bit shy and she was
like maybe if I get a t-shirt with a
nice logo or then have a reason to talk
to women so that's how Duchess was
founded then we have Duchess France
that's also one of our favorite active
chapters at first there were not many
women going to the local jerk meetings
and now they are going there and having
good discussions being speakers there
that's a sweden in belgium you have
something away from a chapter the one
with a different boat time is Romania
it's really funny because we have a
system that you can just start your own
group
they just showed up some at one day we
have one here in the US it's not that
active but getting there with some help
from some people from it from Oracle
Brazil is one of the first chapters we
had but then it died down a bit but now
they're at javaone last year in South
Paulo they relaunched it and it's really
active the next one is a example that
the chapter doesn't need to be
geographically it's the one for
spanish-speaking one of the girls she
lives in France where she speaks she's
from Spain it's just like and we need
more larger groups than just Spain
because there's more people speaking
Spanish one of the french girls went to
Africa actually she took his medical and
she went to Africa and she started
together with some girls there Dutchess
Africa and she also went to Indonesia
she did meetings with the drugs there
and she did talks at universities people
ask me are you strictly for women yes in
principle we are but we do get male
members no no I remember in Sweden you
had a nice open boffin it was a lot of
fun except for you wouldn't invite me to
the breakfast in the morning that was
because it was for women only yeah the
Swedish girls have a rule that it's
totally for women only the French have a
rule that it's everybody can join so
yeah that's the prerogative of a chapter
and we say yes you can join but you have
to support women in Java and we call
them our groupies and next year we're
going to do a button for our groupies
finally I get my own button that's one
of the gimmicks we have we if we go to a
conference we need somehow to identify
that we have talked to someone so that's
the buttons we hand out and then we know
that because the conference is bacon
there's quite a few women and
you go two sessions as well and it's
hard to remember when who you talk to so
very good i do think you guys have one
of the best alternative logos of duke
that has been around so it's it's quite
good I was wondering who was the the the
one with the blue and the red in there
but quite good it's a Romanian fact
there's also a little yellow spot in the
middle oh yeah i forgot that ceremony
man you flip and you guys have been on
on java spotlight podcast you were on
like the fifth or sixth 12 years ago yes
yeah yeah yeah very very long time ago
congratulations all right Argo since I
like this one improving farming methods
to feed a hungry world your slides are
these came early enough to where they
fit okay well we created after sense
which is an open source file management
system and an ogre services platform
which means that anyone who has some
service related performing and plugging
into our system I said we are open
source if you want to join you go to
java.net on our project you can see down
button oh nice oh this is an impression
of what we have created and well I have
only a few minutes to explain why
pharmacy school which is not a lot
because most people I speak to say well
farming why farming it's not not so much
to do with computers in farming well
actually it's a very data intensive
industry there's a lot of information or
data on the farm there's data about
together about soil about the crops
that's growing growing and well what we
want to do is help the farmers to
transfer all this data into information
which the farm we can use to grow better
crops and grow more crops with less
agents in less pesticides less water so
actually be more efficient farmers well
this is an impression of what we are
for example we have the sensors which
are attached to spray in beam so if the
is applying some kind of agent he's
driving around on his field with a
sensors attached to the beams you can
see here and then he had no way to
visualize it so we created the project
we made some some importer module to
support a sense of format imported into
our application and now we can visualize
it and the next step is to create a task
file for instructor you can put it on a
USB stick and put it on instructor and
then you can drive to his lens and then
you can read a paper while the tractor
is driving over his length and applying
the right dosage at every part this is a
good deal I mean the partridges can sit
back and relaxed yeah the only reason he
has to be on the treacherous for is
insurance they will not ensure the
attractor when there's no way out when
it's not automated I painted an
automated vehicle before and it's not
it's rather scary yeah yeah yeah yeah
what's been the reaction at the farmers
to this particular type of tool what's
been the reception well or accepting
this mixed because you have a farmers
who are working with this and some farm
is really after literally have a fruit
basket full of USB sticks and SD cards
with all kinds of data they cannot use
so they are coming and we were getting
hugs so finally there's someone
listening to us that we need to do
something with all this data and there
are also farmers who think well I'm
going to use it when it's beneficial for
me and I'm not going to pay for it
unless I earn more than it will cost me
right right because it's the basis is
for free so it's a very valid business
case for that nothing sounds very good
thank you so much
from the Apache land Hadoop distributed
processing a big data sets across
clusters of computers and that you get
to talk yourself through this because
there's no slides right I didn't I did
not prepare anything to bring anything
I've got a colleague here where a
collaborative leaderless project so we
can never have just one of us represent
things yeah so I don't know how many how
many of you have heard about Hadoop
pretty many so I probably won't say
anything you don't already know but I
can give a little history the project
started out as part of a project called
not doing web crawling and indexing back
in 2004-2005 something like that and so
we just needed tools to be able to
process data sets in this case web pages
we crawl that we're bigger than you can
fit on one machine and it took longer to
process then we could process on one
machine we saw that Google had published
in papers about the way they were doing
these things and we said those look like
good ideas they published a paper on
their file system the gfs and MapReduce
the computing method so we went about
implementing these in Java it's a part
of the nuts project and then people
wanted to use them for other things
besides just crawling and indexing so we
split him out into a separate project
called it had ooh and I say it different
than everybody else most people say
Hadoop I say how do I had to pee rocket
over walls well that would be good with
UPS well you cut and pasted an image
here it's hard to miss well yeah but up
above my head did you poop
that's interesting I haven't seen that
one that one yeah it's a nice spell here
so it's really evolved from being
something to just you know help us do
web search into becoming a lot like a
distributed operating system where the
file system is continuing to get a lot
of features get to be a lot faster have
pluggable security systems and you know
real no single points of failure be much
more reliable and the computing layer is
also getting to be much more general so
you can schedule other kinds of jobs
besides MapReduce only on these clusters
so I mean it's a it's a particular style
of computing that's become really
popular in the in the big data movement
where you know people are using this to
store and process a lot more data than
they could before for a lot less money
what's the what's what's the strangest
use case you've seen it in so far
strangest for the muslim the one that
caught you by surprise maybe well i like
the fact that these dating sites use it
to help mask people up so how is
creating love you know can you do better
than that smell oh it's pretty good yeah
different use cases some of them are
completely but me completely unexpected
that was probably the most unexpected
we've got boats that are going around
the Gulf of Mexico dragging these sonar
things and bouncing sounds off the
bottom that go down into the earth and
bounce back and there you know all these
microphones and and they listen and they
gather all kinds of data and they
analyze it and they can see under the
bottom of the sea bed and of course
they're looking for oil yes of course
they might see other things down but my
favorite example he is the high-energy
physics they actually use to store data
and analyze analyze from all those
larger Collider other colliders great
and also the analogy with operating
system he is pretty pretty accurate
because I do groove there is lots of
tools that through top of you and
they're still growing on top of it they
use it as a platform and you different
layer or layers layers of abstractions
on tokopedia we have signal database
several of them actually like Ivan
we have we have h base which is table
store we have a big data flow language
right we have pussy so it's a pretty big
big big and the new projects are
actually emerging as we speak with just
recently studied and you a new
substitute for four I do file system for
the storage layer which we call to
rocklands it so on Apache extras with
love contributions it was probably 15 or
more projects in the enemy how do you go
system they're almost all at the apache
software foundation it's going strong I
was worried for a minute that he was
going to say that the analogy with an
operating system was bad and then we
bitch things would have gotten
interesting fits better you can go there
well thanks guys Stefan Harley's anybody
in here not used parlays one only mine
she's a decent brand okay it's all she's
excused allah i'll give you a private
demo afterwards if you want i mean i
will save i only gave an image to you so
you couldn't you know companies yeah i
didn't know where if I could use the
word screw but you just said right and
so yeah for the people while everybody
knows it so it seems I could just give
you may be a bit of a history lesson how
it started because there's an
interesting culture there as you
probably know I organized a fox and also
the Java user group in Belgium and it
takes a lot of time like eight months to
prepare a conference like that and then
like after one week you don't you look
where you work eight months one week and
then poof the speakers are gone and the
content is gone and I meant like man I
really want to capture this content and
share it with the people who were
actively venue but most most importantly
share it with the people who couldn't
make it so how I started without us
create dvds and so I created a flash
application put it on the DVD and send
it out but for the people who know Java
Paul is
vox we always have these themes and back
in the day is a java pause we had a
theme which was called the java sutra
which was the Kama Sutra but with spoons
right in all different positions we had
a censored version for the American
market because they didn't like it but
in Europe that was fine right so we had
like this DVD with these bit of spoons
on there and then we sent those dvds to
the people who actually attended or
bought the dvds via the post and what
happened a lot of them like thirty
percent said like well Stefan I bought
his DVD set but I never got it and what
happened which I heard afterwards is
that the mailman for it was porn DVDs so
he just kept it and put it in his own
pocket so it was clear that that wasn't
the way to go so I thought well maybe we
should do something on the web and put
put it on the you know no wiki or
something like that and that's what I
did right so that's where parlays we
basically started was the mailman who
was stealing our DVDs that was the
trigger for parlays so in 2006 I wrote
like a conference application where we
actually record the video of the
speakers we synchronize it with the
slides and it took me about eight hours
for a one-hour talk to post-process
eight so I was I was I felt like a
priest right I was like spreading the
words doing eight hours for one talk I
mean certain speakers I couldn't hear or
see them anymore because you were seeing
their face like 48 hours so that's where
I started going and then we're like
there were so many opportunities to
actually improve it like we build a
complete so I first used Final Cut Pro
we redevelop that and created a
lightweight version of Final Cut Pro in
adobe air so we can actually now a
one-hour talk and post-processing if you
have the right material to record it
takes about between 10 and 20 minutes
all right so that's like a huge benefit
now the reason i think i'm standing here
because we're not using java on the
client we're using flex and air because
it's very you know multi-platform and so
on we have we have to write a Java fixed
version few years ago yeah which are we
using Java on the back exactly exactly I
mean we've always been using Java on the
server side and just recently because
it's really exploding we were close to 1
million users we've migrated from a one
single tomcat instance to a glassfish
cluster and I mean it really rocks I
mean seriously
very very happy user of glassfish and
they're not paying me to say that I'm
seriously you know happy user and yeah
thats energy actually works very well
and then of course when you do that
every year we're technician so we make
new versions new features and people say
well i would like to see it on my iPad
so we just released a native objective-c
version on the iPads so that's the cool
thing if you're sitting in the toilet
you can actually watch the talk right
and i get actually fan mails from people
saying like that Stefan thanks you thank
you for these for this contents thank
you for helping me when I'm on the
toilet well no no it's a different
there's one guy who he actually has an
agreement with his wife that he has to
do the dishes but the agreement with his
wife is that if he does the dishes he
can actually watch a talk on parle so
far so that's that's fine d there's
another guy who will like runs on a
thread mill and he puts the parlay
stocks in front of the face and he's
watching talks while he's running so
it's actually good for your health
parlays right it really is you know so
yeah so one last question java use your
groups yeah very important i mean we
basically give this away all the yahoo
user groups can use this for their
sessions we have about 40 user groups
already on very you know in Toron on a
weekly basis they publish new talks so
they can share it I know Jay focus uses
it we have the NL jag we have many
different user groups in different
languages and so on spreading word
sharing the content and yeah it's a
really good thing it's really moving
Java forward I mean last year we even
had Java want the talks there you know
yeah it's it's really a nice platform
and it's also nice i would say
experimental experimentation field to
play with technology so yeah so one more
thing because we want this a noun 12
seconds right yes so because we actually
won this award we wanted to celebrate so
we actually made all the talks from dev
fox 2011 freely available since
yesterday so it's like 160 talks if you
download it they have a long flight you
know you can just watch those socks for
free on your iPad or on your android
device or on your desktop whatever so
make sure you use it thank you
so let's wrap this up congratulations to
all of the Duke choice award winners we
were going to do one more award winner
but unfortunately they were not be able
to be here tonight but so let me close
it this way by saying thanks for
listening to the hundred and third
edition of the Java spotlight podcast
I'm Roger Brinkley and send your
feedback to feedback a Java spotlight
