addresses the issue of management of
similar systems at scale many customers
now have hundreds if not thousands of
components in their data center and
clouds and they have trouble managing
them consistently Enterprise Manager 13c
has a new feature called drift and
consistency management which directly
addressed the issue of managing
consistency at scale in short there are
two types of consistency management that
you can do in tortora consistency
monitoring and intra target consistency
monitoring in short inter target
consistency monitoring or here shown as
drifted targets is the comparison on an
ongoing basis at scale between a very
large number of similar targets of the
same target type consistency management
is a simple way to ask Enterprise
Manager to leverage the target model it
has for things like composite targets
database machines composite applications
cluster databases and ask it to compare
targets of a similar type within that
type of container for this demonstration
we'll just focus on these drifted
targets or inter target comparisons I'm
gonna click on this 45 to drill in and
see a little bit more detail about what
these 45 targets are that have been
drifted or have drifted as I drill into
the results here I get a further
breakdown of the types of targets that
are being monitored for drift and as you
can see if it applies or you can use
this for simple targets like database
instances and hosts as well as system or
composite targets things like you can
you can use this to manage the
consistency of applications throughout
their lifecycle so you can compare the
dev staging QA can production
environments of a very complex
application and ensure that the
configuration of those applications that
you require throughout those lifecycle
environments is the same let's drill a
little bit further into this ice out
fictitious iPad ice application here to
see what
that there is one target one Application
Lifecycle environment that has a drift
in it and two others that are not
drifted or consistent in this case so
drilling a little bit further you can
see I get a little bit further detail
and the results I can see that one it's
actually the QA life or application that
is has one drift over one inconsistency
in its configuration and the two others
the staging in the development
environment are the same so just for
illustration purposes let me show you
something here let me just turn on the
entire stack as well as the all of the
for lifecycle environment so you can see
that for the first time now an
Enterprise Manager we're showing results
of configuration comparison side-by-side
regardless of the number of targets that
you're comparing now in Enterprise
Manager 13c you can see them from left
to right side by side and you can also
see that here I have the entire stack
modeled for this composite application
consisting of host database listener web
logic etc and you can see that the one
target or the one component of this
application in the QA environment that
is drifted is the database so let's
drill in a little bit further to take a
look and see what those the difference
actually is and with one click here I
can actually see that the actual
difference is the fact that the
initialization parameter job queue
processes is set to a thousand in the
reference which was my production
environment and is actually nine hundred
in the test environment or this QA
environment
now of course detecting these
inconsistencies across large number of
targets in your cloud is an important
first step but it is the only only the
first step in the process the next step
will actually be to remediate any
detected differences and for
initialization parameters you can
actually remediate directly from within
the application by clicking on this
synchronized button right here and it
will actually synchronize the reference
value the
value from the reference target to the
target here on the right hand side
that's not equal with a with a simple
click of a button and following a few
steps in the wizard probably one of the
most challenging and common
inconsistency across a large environment
like a cloud is with regards to patching
so of course Enterprise Manager has long
had the ability to help you apply
patches in an automated way to
applications like the database and
WebLogic server but in Enterprise
Manager 13c you can now apply the full
quarterly or the quarterly full-stack
downloadable patch to the entire EXA
database machine as well navigating
under the Database Machine home page
menu you'll see a new software update
menu item here you'll see everything you
need to know about the current status of
the applied patches as well as
recommended patches to be applied and
the status of the patch application as
it's being applied to the different
components of the database machine like
the database server storage server and
InfiniBand switches so let's start at
the top here first you can see that just
like with the database and web logic and
other targets that are currently
supported in Enterprise Manager
Enterprise Manager will offer
recommendations as they become available
upon the oracle website and recommend
the latest qsr rqf SDP patch for
application until that patch has been
completely applied in addition you can
see the status of the extra check which
is now properly modeled as a compliance
standard and Enterprise Manager 13c and
runs on a daily basis and you can see
the last time that that was run which
you can click on to go see the results
of from here as well on the right hand
side you can see a quick status here
saying that
you know there are seven targets in
total in this database machine and
summon of them still need to have an
update applied and as I apply the update
or this patch across the different
components that number will decrease
till eventually reaches zero and so
let's see here at the bottom here let me
just click on the storage servers you
can see by simply selecting one of the
the storage cells here gives me the
ability to then select a QSF qfs DP out
of them just like you would when you
were building a patch plan for a
database or WebLogic server and 12c in
previous versions of Enterprise Manager
so let me click select you can see all
the information that comes down from my
Oracle support about the patch as well
and my next step would then to be go
ahead just like in the previous version
of patches and analyze and then deploy
the patch and I could even roll the
patch back if I wanted to as well so
bottom line is that you can now apply in
an automated fashion the entire stack or
quarterly full stack downloadable patch
as it's called for the database machine
in 13c as well to help you remediate any
inconsistencies in your environment
