all the items required to complete a
project for example engineering
documents and construction materials in
this video we'll look at how to plan a
project scope track its progress and
process changes to get started let's
look at the scope items page define
scope by creating the list of items
required for the project scope items are
organized by the project breakdown
structure which is useful for breaking
down scope into smaller pieces for
example the project requires a new
bathrooms including new appliances and
specifically a scope item of 10 sinks
after defining what is required use work
packages to plan how the items will be
installed or delivered assign scope
items to a work package and plan the
quantity to be installed along with the
hours and cost of the work assign gates
to plan without a detailed schedule or
if you're using a schedule link scope
assignments to activities and the
schedule will drive assignment dates
when planning is complete sets a
baseline this creates a record of the
original scope including quantities
hours dates and costs once the baseline
is set updates scope assignments to
record their progress for items you
create like a document use rules of
credits these are sets of milestones and
percent complete values configured at
the workspace level mark a milestone
complete and the percent complete is
updated accordingly
for material assignments such as
installing floorboards enter the
installed quantity when progress is
added to an assignment its installed
cost and hours are automatically updated
you can also enter actual hours and
costs to track invoiced figures this
allows you to compare what was installed
versus what was billed the percent
complete of a material assignment is
calculated using the installed quantity
compared to the total required there is
also a time phased view available to
analyze the daily progress compare how
the installation was planned versus how
it is being executed track the progress
of a work package using a weighted
average of its assignments for example
the percent completes can be weighted
toward assignments with the largest
quantities this helps provide a more
accurate picture of the work that's been
completed after the baseline is set
changes in scope require a change
request for example submit a request if
a scope assignment requires additional
quantity after the request is submitted
it must be reviewed and approved
after approved the additional quantity
is added and a record of the changes
retained</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
