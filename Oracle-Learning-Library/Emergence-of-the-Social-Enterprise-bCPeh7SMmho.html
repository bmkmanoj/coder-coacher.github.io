developer program at javaone as many of
you probably have guessed this is a
pretty new initiative for oracle as we
start integrating some really social
interesting social applications and
social technology into our stack before
I get in I have to put this up on the
screen I'm brand new to Oracle some
learning about things like safe harbor
having never worked at a public company
before but I'm really excited about the
program that we have today we've got
some fantastic speakers who are coming
in thank you for coming early and I
invite you to stay for some of these
other speakers we've got gentleman from
Facebook will have linked in Oracle
social network and others so please stay
we've got some great speakers here so
before I jump in let me just give you a
little background on myself and
hopefully that will be some context for
the content that I'm going to share
today so I'm a start-up guy I've been
with three startups to have been
acquired the most recent one involve er
by Oracle and I've been here for about a
month and a half I have a very
technology sort of a technology-oriented
marketer the last company that I was
with involve er we built a markup
language for developers and we worked a
lot with the developer community and
that was a little bit different than
some of the other players in the space
that were focused more on marketing
users so in my role there I worked a lot
with our development team and I am kind
of an agile development oriented guy and
I actually think about ways that I can
apply agile inside of marketing org
which is a little bit different than
what most people are doing today I've
worked primarily on the brand side so
consumer facing applications but part of
what I'm going to talk about today is
how we can apply some of what's been
very very successful on the consumer
side
inside of the enterprise and that's
really the thesis that I want to share
with you today because that's I think
where the starting point for the social
developer should be they don't you don't
have to sort of reinvent a lot of the
really effective patterns of social
interaction because they've been proven
on the consumer side and there's lots of
opportunities to bring them into the
enterprise so just as lastly I've been
in the social tech space for long enough
to have seen it move from an
experimentation phase through being able
to prove real business value and I'm
seeing that same process unfold again or
start unfolding in the enterprise so I'm
really excited about that so before I
jump in too much about the technology
side let me just define what I mean by
social so I'm not talking about being
polite not going which I am and i invite
you to come up and talk with me after
this session I'm really talking about
three things so I'm talking about
sharing of information in media in a way
that enriches the graph and what I mean
just to give that a little more
definition as we share information and
we draw connections between social
objects and we you know might all be
familiar with Facebook and a user is an
object of post as an object so a user
likes a post now we set up a
relationship and that in rich's the
graph when we have a very enriched graph
we can use it to deliver personalized
content at scale and that's a really big
deal and for me that's where I see the
major opportunity for social technology
right so the way that most of us have
started using social is that we want to
share and discuss the most important
experiences in our lives in a way with
our friends that actually makes us feel
more connected together and strengthens
the network so you know I recently got
married if I wanted to share my wedding
photos with friends we might sit around
a coffee table and do that but one of
the challenges is is that it's very
difficult to scale that
type of experience it's very difficult
for me to sit around the coffee table
and have that experience with all of my
friends who might care about my wedding
photos so that's sort of where social
technology comes in and we're being able
to have personalized experiences that
scale really matters so if you're a
marketer one of the most important
experiences that you want to share with
your friends and other people is a Super
Bowl because the biggest advertising day
of the year and I want to share just
something to give you a sense of the
kinds of experiences that we build while
I was it and involve ur so this is an
application that we built with Facebook
and USA Today around the Super Bowl and
everybody is already watching this who
everyone talking about the commercials
so what we were doing was we were taking
an existing behavior and amplifying it
with some social technology and allowing
you to reach your friends at scale in a
very personal way so you'll see the
sharing bit that's you know making it
easy to share content with your friends
the the content itself was the media the
commercials from the super bowl and the
enrichment is sort of represented by
this leaderboard where I was able to see
not only which videos I thought were the
best but those which my friends thought
were the best and I could compare and
compare my friends to the larger
facebook community so in that way I'm
starting to understand how we relate to
each other and it makes my experience
better and richer so I talked about the
reach peace this application lived on
USA TODAY's site on facebook on their
partners it was available through mobile
and traditional desktop so it had a lot
of reach right and it did get that
personal relevance because it was the
the all the users were rating and
watching videos and putting them in this
leaderboard so it felt like my friends
opinion about the videos in question and
I also of course got the comment on
those videos and add value so when we
think about in the engagement that we
have with those videos I want to just
make it a little more tangible to think
about how that relates
to enrichment of the graph so there is
an inverse relationship between scale
and personalization right so if you came
to USA TODAY's homepage they don't know
much about you and they if they wanted
to give you a message it's going to have
to be a pretty broad message that
deliver the same message to everybody
once you start engaging with this
application they already know that
you're interested in football so they
can personalize messages a little more
and make it a better experience view
once you get into the application they
might notice that you were gravitating
to those commercials that were about
cars so they know that you're interested
in cars and then maybe you the one you
liked best was the VW right so as that
as users engage with an application like
this you can really direct the right
messages at the right folks because you
know what they're interested in so this
idea of personalization I think of
really as being the foundation for
social experience and it's a great
starting point once you build some trust
with your community there will be much
more willing to engage with you and the
more they engage with you and you build
that trust the more you'll have an
opportunity to shape their behavior and
influence the community and that's
really where you start getting to the
business value and what's been very very
effective on the consumer side so we're
going to talk about how you bring that
chain of events into the enterprise and
why it is that we're driving it into the
enterprise so everybody hopefully in
this room is probably using social I'm
guessing we sort of fallen in love with
it it provides us utility whether we're
coordinating event or sharing photos
with our friends it's also fun and it's
also still really just beginning right
the the rate of innovation and change in
this space just it's amazing that it
just it just keeps coming and there's
lots of new interesting experience is
coming to market so we started using
this stuff in our personal lives and
we've acclimated to it
and when we come into work we start
having the expectation that we'd love to
have these experiences in the workplace
in the same way that we do in our
personal lives but it's not quite there
yet so you know we're using it in small
ways to do a better job of listening to
customers today but it would be great if
we could use it for other things HR
related sales related product
development related right so I'm going
to touch on some of those use cases and
give you some ideas of what that might
look like but before I do I want to
address one of the first questions that
I get when I talk about social inside of
the enterprise and that is folks say
yeah but we've seen these experiences on
the consumer side is that really going
to work inside of the enterprise isn't
isn't inside the enterprise really
really different and the answer is yes
and no so I think this sort of gets back
to the thesis that I mentioned up front
which is that there have been amazingly
successful models of social interaction
which have been proven on the consumer
side we can take those and apply them
inside the enterprise but we have to
acknowledge that we have to map those
interactions to the context where we're
applying them so I think of this in
terms of an affordance so there are
certain affordances outside of the
enterprise and others inside we need to
find ways of matching these social
experiences against what's possible
inside the enterprise so I also want to
point out that if you look at even
outside the enterprise on popular social
networks like Facebook LinkedIn and
Twitter each of the social experiences
on those platforms are different and
unique to the use cases that you you
know and do they're essentially so just
as there is diversity and the social
experiences outside there's going to
you're going to see that inside the
enterprise as well and we're really just
beginning the process of discovering
what these will be one of the things
though that I think is worth noting is
that there's interesting when you look
at the popular platforms out there today
there's interesting ways that the graphs
are connecting to each other how
LinkedIn and Twitter and Facebook those
graphs are interacting with each other
and I think that we're going to see that
in the exact same way inside of the
enterprise so what I'm going to share
with you is a couple examples of
scenarios of where you might bring
social experience into enterprise
applications and i want to show you how
they might tie into each other across
different silos with inside inside the
enterprise so i'm going to start with
one that's more consumer facing because
that's where i've been working for a
long time and then show how social
technology is basically being driven
into the enterprise through the
marketing channel so imagine that you're
on amazon.com right you know that you
trust friends more than the public and
you know you trust the public more than
you trust brands but that's why you use
the ratings and reviews on Amazon to
figure out which three TVs you might
want to buy but now you're ready to
actually engage one of your friends to
help you figure out of those three which
one you're actually going to buy so
imagine that amazon.com launches a new
kind of wish list and on this which
question can put in those three TVs and
you can push it out to Facebook Twitter
Linkedin wherever your friends are that
you want to connect with and you can ask
them to vote on it tell you which TV is
the best now you're giving the brand
great exposure to additional consumers
and the brand might be willing to give
you in exchange for that a small
discount on the product or a discount to
you and your friends in exchange for
sharing it out and you have a really
compelling social shopping experience
right there's also this amazing social
data that gets spun off by this
experience though it's very relevant
inside of the enterprise imagine a
product development team that wants to
understand better or a marketing team
that wants understand better how to
position products and show them more
effectively this allows them to test
things in real time or imagine you've
got a product development team they can
take this exact same experience except
instead of it being live on
mazon calm they can test products that
might not exist yet they can talk test
the products that they're going to be
developing for next year so you can take
an experience that really is very
effective for engaging consumers and use
it for product development so that's a
good segue into the product development
team will there are lots of
opportunities to do over social
applications for them as well so
developers tend to gravitate to merit
based systems and although they may be
less social than us marketers they love
feedback one interesting application of
social technology that's been quite
popular in the consumer space is the run
badges so if you're a developer maybe
you're iterating on a backlog and there
could be lots of interesting ways of
rewarding developers for doing things
like having really great story estimates
right that's always a challenge on the
development side of the house is
estimating your stories so what if we
can use badging in the same way that we
have to shave consumer behavior to to
get our team's better at doing things
like estimate estimation and maybe it's
not just individuals maybe it's teams
maybe we can foster healthy competition
between teams inside of our organization
through things like this so you could
have leaderboards and allow people to
have some transparency and have better
awareness of what's happening across
their team now I'm going to go to an HR
example here it what if it turns out
that the HR notices that the folks who
engage most on the development side with
this badging tend to be the folks who
are the the mentors inside the
organization and tend to be the ones who
stay at the company longest right so
socially we know this interesting data
in the market about how social
engagement builds a tighter fabric and
inside of the organization and improves
things like retention right so maybe the
Human Resources team is focused on not
only improving retention but also
supporting growth as their company grows
so they want they know that hiring
within network
increases retention right they want to
get people to come in on recommendation
they also know that when they come in
that way they they tend to be higher
more highly qualified candidates so
there's an example on the left hand side
of the slide of a application called
punch tab an interesting experience that
encourages sharing so with applications
like punch tab there are rewards and
discounts that are given to consumers in
exchange for sharing across social
networks so what if HR could have could
use that to get better distribution for
the jobs that they're trying to fill
right really leverage the employee base
of a company now if you were at a
company like Oracle you can imagine the
reach that that could provide so really
interesting application there that could
be a lot of fun you could create a
rewards program with this and again
maybe you know just even engaging with a
program like that with an application
like that drives retention so what's now
shift to the sales world so maybe HR
finds out that one of the folks who
engages engage with their application or
the sales team and they're trying to
figure out why well they might discover
that sales converts best when they've
got a close relationship to the prospect
so folks on sales teams are always
trying to find how is there any way that
I'm connected to a prospect right so if
we could create a social application
that gave them more visibility that
might produce some real benefits so
there are great applications on the
market linkedin is a good example has
one where you can load up your sales
team into linkedin and you can see the
closest connection through somebody
that's actually on your sales team now
what if we took that piece of
functionality and we added show me how
close am connected on Facebook or
Twitter or other social networks right I
can add even more visibility and give
the sales team an advantage and
help them meet their goal which is
improving their clothes rates okay
another interesting application on the
sales side my experience working at a
couple startups where our teams grew
sales teams are all we had weekly
meetings we were comparing what was
working and wasn't work what was not
working in the field and this would
typically take the form of objections to
a sale and responses and we would think
we would sort of talk about those common
objections and then work with each other
to share what really worked what were
the best practices I'll imagine an
application like uservoice which has
been in the market is a place for
consumers to provide feedback to
customers I mean to companies where they
can say hey this is here's what I think
about this product here's an idea for
how you can improve the product and
other consumers can vote those ideas up
and down and it's a great channel for
driving insight into a product company
will take that same concept and put it
inside the sales team and you have as a
sales person basically they're putting
up their common objections other
salespeople are saying hey here's the
thing that that work best against these
objections let's vote them up and down
and you've got a living archive of what
really works great for a sales team and
I can tell you from my experience
working in a small company they grew up
quickly we used to keep a wiki that had
this we were trying to meet this same
goal and as we scaled our team across
regions it became untenable to maintain
something like this could allow you to
really stay actively engaged and have
the most relevant information at your
fingertips so going from there to
community support if salespeople are
identifying interesting objections there
may be a tie-in between what objections
are during sales and common customer
support issues so maybe the support
group is looking at the graph or the
social data produced by
the sales group and using that to stay
out ahead of the market and stay out
ahead of potential concerns so they can
use tools like get satisfaction which is
a community support experience to
empower folks in their community to help
them control the cost of managing
customer support right so one of their
goals here is to scale customer support
without incurring significantly more
costs one way to do that would be to
create a social support identify
influences in the community who are very
engaged enable them to answer some of
the support requests for you again you
can see how badges would fit in this
context you could also see how there
might be a connection to HR tapping into
this data set because maybe they want to
retain some of the people who are most
active in the community and again
rewards are interesting opportunity as
well so when you have a social
application like that inside communities
more you're generating a lot of
interesting market intelligence that's
sort of bringing us back full circle to
the marketing side of the house so as a
marketer I'm very focused on demand gen
going back to sort of the
personalization bit up top I'm always
trying to build trust with my community
if we think about I'm thinking about
ways to get the community engaged
actually in product development so we
talked about the example on amazon.com
where you give you're engaging your
friends to help you make a decision
between three products let's reframe
that concept and think about maybe we
can actually engage our audience to
create the product for us so nike did
some interesting work here where they
engaged the community to design some
sneakers and then the community got to
vote on those sneakers and nike actually
ended up producing one of them so again
interesting inputs to product
development here as well okay so that's
kind of a range of different use cases
of where social could start
based on models that have worked already
inside of the enterprise so one of the
things that I want to you know just
highlight is it these are really just
sample scenarios to get you inspired
these aren't recommendations of what you
should actually do the way that I think
you know you should approach building
your first social integration inside of
your enterprise is to take an agile
approach of building an a Minimum Viable
Product try to integrate some social
functionality see what sticks and
iterate and improve and validate so I
think that's how I think about building
social experiences so let's talk about
the social developer because I think
part of the part of this track is about
reaching out to folks in the Oracle
community who are interested in finding
ways to integrate social into their
applications so one of the questions
that I get is well is a social developer
a new kind of developer or is this
really just a skill set that's being
layered on top of what I already know
and the answer is really the latter I
don't think that there are that many
people in the market today except for
folks who are exclusively building on
top of one platform who would think of
themselves just as a social developer I
think this is a very much an emerging
discipline but it requires that you
understand a popular social api's and
work inside of your organization to
build the framework for potential for
your own social graph so if you think
about Facebook actually recently
repositioned their preferred developer
consultant group as a preferred
marketing developer one of the reasons
why that is is that social social
development is really being driven
through the marketing organization we've
seen some pretty significant budget
shift from CT 0 sse iOS into the
marketing area that doesn't though mean
that social is going to be
stay inside of the marketers silo in
fact I don't think that's the case i
think the marketing organization is
really going to be just the doorway that
bring social technology into the
enterprise so as you think about you
know where how you're going to bring
social into your enterprise you know you
might want to think about partnering
with the marketing group initially to
sort of build on the transformation
that's being driven through that
organization so when I talk about social
developers I think there's a pretty big
range also of who might be referred to a
social developer Oracle is very
interested on the folks who are on the
left side here who are more on the Java
end but you know at involve ER and
Vittra recent acquisitions from from
Oracle we built visual authoring tools
that made it possible to build social
experiences we built SML which stands
for social markup language which is
designed for front-end developers to
build social applications and today
we're building solutions for Java
developers who want to build social
integrations inside the enterprise so if
you think about the technology sort of
trends that are a backdrop here you know
I think that one of the pieces of
feedback that I've gotten from the
community as I've come into Oracle is
that they don't necessarily think of
Java as being an environment where
you're going to do social development
and they point to things like you know
Facebook has been that their tools that
focus more on higher level languages
like Ruby and PHP and so on but the
reality is is that I think that that's
really changing I think that there are
more and more tools being made available
on the Java side and I think we've also
seen some of the biggest applications on
the market like Twitter which recently
went back to Java and LinkedIn that are
built on Java that really proved that
it's a great environment to be building
social obligations and social experience
i'm looking to
enact more with folks in the community
to find how we can work together to
remove some of the barriers to make it
easier to develop social integrations
into your applications using Java so
three quick takeaways I think of social
data and the data that's going to get
spun off by these applications inside of
the enterprise as the data that's really
going to complete our data set just as
social data completes the data set on
the consumer side so it's this data
that's really going to help us improve
our business practices moving forward so
starting to build the social graph
internally today I think is really
important social is also a layer that's
going to run across your applications I
talked about the way that social i think
is coming through the marketing
organization but ultimately it's really
going to run across the organization
that's going to be integrated into
everything that we do inside of the
enterprise and i think part of the value
is unlocked actually when you run across
different silos i tried to point to that
in my examples to show how one area the
enterprise might benefit from some of
the social data produced by other areas
and finally i think that so i used this
term social graph a lot i think that as
you think about bringing social into the
enterprise you're really going to be
building a social graph of your own and
i think that's really important concept
to take home with you so we'd love you
to get involved with us as we go on this
basically a new journey for Oracle into
the world of social experiences and
social development we're trying to build
a community we want to learn from you
about what you see is your challenges
today where you see opportunities where
you feel like you need help there's a
couple ways for us to get involved
working together the first is we've
built a community page on Facebook which
is just at facebook.com forward slash
Oracle social developer you can start
the conversation with us there by
posting on our page
we'd love to hear it there's also a
listserv you can sign up for we also
have a small project that I want to tell
you about we started something called
the Oracle social developer lab this is
a small group that's designed to build
some tools that make it easier for you
to integrate social functionality into
your Java applications so i mentioned
that there aren't that many tools some
of the tools that facebook is created
for ruby and PHP those don't exist as
much for java so we're stepping we'd
like to step in and try and fill that
gap we'd love to hear your suggestions
on where you think we can do that best
so there's actually we're running a hack
for the for the next week and we have to
basically sets of technology that we're
making available to you one is built by
the Oracle social developer lab the
other is something called dolly core and
at the end of the track today the last
presentation will be up on these two
technologies and how you can use them
over the next week to build an
application the winner will be profiled
in java magazine so thank you for coming
i'm very excited to really kick off what
I see is the start of a new direction
for Oracle and a relationship with the
social development community so thanks
for coming and we've got some great
content look forward to talking with you
