to mean the same thing for example right
now uses the text US for the United
States country code however Eloqua uses
United States and HCM uses USA all these
different applications need to share
country information so each needs to
understand what the other one means
another example our currency and gender
codes the solution is to create a lookup
that associates values used by one
application for a specific field to the
values used by another application for
the same field
this way you can map values across
applications here we see the lookup
created for mapping country codes you
may have several lookups for one
integration depending on the number of
fields that require mapping lookups are
also reusable and can be used by
multiple integration they're based on
aesthetic definition meaning you create
and populate them during design time and
do not change by runtime activities
these tables are used for looking up
values only as a developer hard-coding
look-up tables in your applications can
be a challenging and time-consuming
proposition but using them an
integration cloud service is fast and
easy
when you map data in your integrations
you can reference previously created
lookups with the lookup value function
you simply drag and drop the function
then select the lookup to use now your
integration knows how to map data coming
in from one application to data being
sent to another application once you
create a lookup you can clone it to
create a new look up quickly and export
it to a CSV file for use in other
integration cloud service
vironment so that's how easy it is to
create and use lookups to share
information between applications in
integration cloud service
