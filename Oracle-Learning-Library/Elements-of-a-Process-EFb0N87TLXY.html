travel request process
to start a travel request you need to
submit a travel request form with
information like date of birth employee
ID as well as other travel expense
details based on the approval amount and
purpose of visit the decision determines
whether the request is auto approved or
requires sequential or parallel approval
and who the approvers are if the travel
request is approved it goes through a
cost and compliance check which is
performed by another process otherwise
the request is returned to the employee
for resubmission the travel request gets
fulfilled by another process if it
passes the compliance test if not it
gets cancelled an error in the request
fulfillment results in an invalid data
business exception which also counsels
the request now how do you turn the use
case into a process in process Clyde
service using flow elements there are
four types of flow elements for creating
a business process task event gateway
and sequence flow tasks represent the
work performed by a business process
human tasks are used when a process
participant performs the work this can
be a simple interaction such as
submitting the travel request in the
travel request process submitting the
travel request is a submit human task
approving a travel request is also a
human task but with a more complicated
workflow that requires input from
multiple process participants system
tasks define interactions across
business processes in the travel request
process the cost and compliance check
can be implemented by using send and
receive tasks to communicate with a
system or process outside the current
flow there are two types of events start
and end events define the start and end
point of a process for example the
travel request process starts with a
form start event and ends with a nun
type end event intermediate events
either occur within the typical flow of
your process or can interrupt your
process
in the travel request process example
you will need an error type intermediate
event to catch the invalid data business
exception from the fulfillment task
gateways determine the flow of your
business process when there are several
optional or conditional tasks that need
to be performed at the same time you can
use an inclusive gateway when there are
several required tasks that need to be
performed at the same time you can use a
parallel gateway in the travel request
process the approver will either approve
or reject the request that's when you
need an exclusive gateway because only
one of the paths out of the Gateway is
taken the last flow element is a
sequence flow sequence flows connect
flow elements they also show the
direction of a process flow for the
travel request process you need to
define who are the requesters and who
are the approvers in process cloud
service swim lanes associate actions
with different roles for example one
swim lane for the requester employee and
another swim lane for the approver
manager each swim linda's plays the role
of the person responsible for performing
the tasks within that swim Lane now can
you design the travel request process
for your company here is one possible
solution
thank you for watching
