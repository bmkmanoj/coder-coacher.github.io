anytime from anywhere by configuring
multi-factor authentication or MFA in
Oracle Identity cloud service you can
protect data access and secure your
business applications MFA is a method of
authentication that requires the use of
more than one factor to verify a user's
identity when a user signs in to an
application they're asked for the
username and password with MFA
configured the user must provide a
second method of verification this
process is called 2-step verification
the two factors work together to add an
additional layer of security by either
using additional information or a second
device to verify the user's identity and
complete the login process to configure
MFA on the multi-factor authentication
settings page select the factors that
you want to be available for your users
factors that you don't select don't
appear as options for the user during
enrollment login or on the self-service
console 2-step verification page you
must select at least one factor in order
to create a sign-on rule for MFA next
will customize the factor configurations
on the individual factor tabs the mobile
OTP and mobile app notification factors
use a mobile device to verify the user's
identity the mobile app generates a
one-time passcode that the user enters
on the login screen or a notification is
sent to the mobile app on the device for
the user to approve the login request
use the mobile app settings page to
configure protection policy for the
Oracle mobile Authenticator app or OMA
app including how users can access the
OMA app when to require users to unlock
the OMA app and the OMA app lockout
policy use the compliance policy section
of the page to choose which operating
system and which versions are allowed to
use the OMA app you can also configure
policy for detecting the use of a rooted
device and whether a device must use the
screen lock feature these settings
affect both one-time passcode and push
notifications through the OMA app the
text message factor sends a one-time
passcode as an SMS to the users selected
device that they then enter on the
2-step verification page
to verify their identity adjust SMS
configurations such as the number of
digits that the system should use when
generating the passcode and for how long
in minutes the passcode is valid in the
message template section you can edit
the wording that is sent in the SMS
message to the user the email factor
sends a one-time passcode in an email to
the users primary email address the user
then enters that passcode on the 2-step
verification page to verify their
identity the configurations for the
one-time passcode sent in an email are
similar to the SMS configuration you can
specify a number of digits that the
system should use when generating the
passcode and how long in minutes that
passcode is valid when security
questions are enabled the user is
prompted to provide answers to pre
registered security questions to verify
their identity before gaining access to
an application when configuring security
questions you can change the minimum
number of characters required for a
user's answer and change the number of
security questions that a user is asked
clear the checkbox for questions that
you don't want to be available to the
user you can't edit or delete the
default questions but you can add custom
questions select add question and then
enter the question in the out of
security question window the custom
question will be at the bottom of the
question list the ability to generate a
bypass code is available to the user
after they enroll in 2-step verification
they can generate a bypass code and
store it for later use or request that
an administrator generate it for example
when a user has forgotten their phone
doesn't have cell service or can't
access their computer at the 2-step
verification page the user can contact
the help desk to have an administrator
to generate a bypass code the user then
enters that bypass code to gain access
to the application to generate a bypass
code for a user access that users
account in Oracle Identity cloud service
select more and then click generate
bypass code there are additional
settings on the multi-factor
authentication settings page use the
enable trusted computer option to allow
your users to mark their devices as
trusted during login then define how
long a device can be trusted and how
many devices the user can mark as
trusted you can also define how many
factors a user can
and rollin and the maximum number of
times that a user can provide incorrect
verification using an mfa factor before
they are locked out after configuring
the factors that you want you must
define a sign-on policy and rules for
your applications to create a sign on
policy access a sign on policies page by
expanding the navigation drawer click
security and then click sign on policies
click Add enter a name for the sign-on
policy such as PCI applications policy
and then click add rules to create one
or more rules within the policy in the
add rule window insert a name for the
rule like prompt all users for mfa then
define the conditions you need for
example selecting the group that the
users belong to or the IP range from
which the application is accessed in the
actions section of the window select
prompt for an additional factor specify
if MFA is required or optional and then
define how often you want users to
provide a second authentication factor
after you define the rule you need to
assign applications to the sign-on
policy add one or more applications to
the policy for example HR application
and CRM application after you create the
policy save and then activate it you
have now configured MFA for the HR
application and the CRM application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
