the use of application roles which
control access to functionality and
Oracle analytics cloud by providing
authentication you use the console to
create and manage application roles
there are two types of application roles
predefined and custom predefined
application roles are sets of privileges
that determine what users can see and do
in the cloud service your own custom
application roles enable you to secure
folders projects and other contents
stored in the catalog the first step is
to create your own application role next
search for and change the privileges of
the new role to assign the user parent
application role privileges are
inherited from parents so someone who is
a member of an application role inherits
all of the privileges associated with
the parent application role this enables
any member of the new role that is
provisioned by the parent roles to use
all of the functionality such as create
projects and data visualization now add
two members to the new role select Jaime
black and Jill Jackson two members are
assigned to the new role the final step
is to set access permissions on catalog
objects for the application role
navigate to the catalog object and open
the permissions dialog catalog objects
can include folders projects and so on
search for the new role set the level of
permissions when you configure catalog
permissions for your own application
role the members added to the role will
also have those permissions to ensure
that your changes work properly
sign out as the administrator and then
sign back in as Jamie black a member of
the new role navigate to and open the
revenue downturn project in the sales
analysts folder in this video I showed
you how to create your own application
role associate users with the role and
configure catalog permissions to objects
for the role
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
