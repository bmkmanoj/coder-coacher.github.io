can actually leverage the accelerator
Express cloud service to run their
entire business on we have here at Combe
a coffee shop startup called the
Brooklyn bean they have retail stores
throughout the u.s. that sell coffee and
as of as of that they don't want to have
any on-premise IT or do just want to
sell coffee do you want to have any
service at all however they still have
to store their coffee sales somewhere in
a database to them do further analysis
on this so they decided to go with
Oracle Exadata Express cloud service
now how's dieter generated these days
using mobile devices tablets essentially
right so they just want to be able to
send restful service calls over the
Internet and then just sending JSON
documents with those which allows them
to give the schema flexibility and have
this independent e of the individual
retail stores throughout the US so first
thing for me to do is for them to be
able to send those rest quarters to
login into the service console and
create one of those restful services so
log on here in the accelerate Express
service console I have your three
different areas that I can manage after
web access here the client access and
then the administration so a year ago
and to define the rest data services to
define those rest services or that rest
service for them to be able to send this
via the mobile devices if a
pre-configured rest service here coffee
shop which I have to set to your status
published which allows it to be
accessible over the web so that those
tablets can send those rest calls so
just set this to published apply changes
and that's it the coffee shops are now
all good to go they can all now use
those tablets and send coffee sales
orders across the web into the Oracle
database and exited Express cloud
service so now here's the interesting
question so now as we have data coming
in and Andy would ask me well this is
all great now but what's actually the
revenue that we have made here well last
thing I want to do is go ahead and say
well here's your rest call or your
sequel query just fire that off and you
will actually see what you got
what you really want to do is give him a
really nice simple UI at the dashboard
that shows him the actual coffee sales
going in now as Andy has just said we
have application Express also available
in the Excel data express cloud service
so you can actually just build a very
simple dashboard
in x-ray the Express and then give that
to Andy to run so all I have to do here
is go into this application and click
run and here we have our sales coming in
and as you can see this is periodically
refreshing the bars are growing and I
can use this dashboard just to drill
down here for example how did the cities
in the individual state do or can here
go from sales by state through sales per
city and back again the last aspect of
this demo is also very interesting
interesting thing to talk about is as
you load data into databases databases
grow and then data loads usually get
slower so there's a couple of ways how
you can remedy that but we have
in-memory technology also now for our
JSON document support so you can see
down here at the bottom this response
time of the application refreshing 350
milliseconds and I can actually just go
ahead and load this into the memory
columnist store and this response time
over here on the right will now drop to
a couple of milliseconds while the data
is still being loaded live in to enter
the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
