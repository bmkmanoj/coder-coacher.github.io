curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I'll show you how to
provision the service in Oracle service
bus service consumers include end users
and applications that use enterprise
functionality service producers provide
a service for example you could have an
insurance portal the consumer that
requests a quote from the rate quote
service the producer Oracle service bus
exposes proxy services which appear to
its consumers as the service producer
proxy services route messages to one or
more underlying business services which
define the interface and connection
information for the service producers
this architecture hides the actual
service producers from the service
consumers this shields developers from
changes in the endpoint services and
also prevents these services from being
overloaded with requests from consumers
in this demo the service producer is a
credit card validation service which is
a composite application residing on the
solar server note that even though we're
showing the provisioning of a web
service you can provision any type of
native endpoint for example restful
services and so on so let's get started
here we are in the Oracle service bus
console in project Explorer and the
first step is to create a new session as
in service bus all changes are performed
in a session now let's create a new
project to store our service bus
resources called credit services and in
this new project will create three
folders resources business services
and proxy services now we're going to
import some resources from the solar
server but before we can do that we need
to get the wisdom L of the credit card
validation service this is so service
bus knows how to access the service and
what operation will be executed so let's
go to Enterprise Manager from the home
page will navigate to the credit card
validation so a composite application
that's deployed to the solar server on
this composites home page we'll click
the show was still an endpoint URI icon
and here you see the URLs for the
endpoint URI and the wisdom we'll copy
this Earl here for the wisdom now let's
go back to the service bus console here
in the resources folder we'll create a
resource and we'll select resources from
Earl now we'll paste the all of the
wisdom into this Earl path field and
we'll give it a name and we'll leave the
resource type @ wisdom and click Next
here you can see it's going to import a
wisdom and an XML schema we'll click
import and make sure the import was
successful now that we have the
information on the service producer we
can create the service bus business
service
let's go to the business services folder
and we'll create a resource of type
business service on the general
configuration page we'll give it a name
and a description the service type is
wisdom web service and we'll browse
let's move this window over and select
the wisdom for the endpoint service that
we just imported and for the ports we'll
select execute PT and submit there are
more configuration screens but we'll
leave everything else at the defaults so
we'll click last and on the summary
screen you can see all the configuration
options let's scroll down and save and
here you can see the business service
now we can create the proxy service
based on the business service we just
created
let's go to the proxy services folder
and we'll create a proxy service or give
it a name the service type is business
service and this browse and we'll select
the business service that we've just
created and submit we'll leave
everything else at the default so we'll
click last and then let's save our
changes and here you see our proxy so
now that we're done with creating all of
our service bus resources will activate
the session and the change center and
we'll enter a description and submit the
changes now let's test the proxy service
so in the proxy services folder next to
the proxy service we just created we'll
click this launch test console icon and
let's move the window in the test
console we'll enter a valid credit card
number and execute it
let's scroll down a little so here in
the response document we can see that
the status returned is valid let's go
back and perform one more test with an
invalid number we'll execute it and
scroll down and now we can see the
status is invalid so we can see it's
working correctly we can now have our
external customers use this proxy
service to mediate access to the credit
card validation service so that's it for
provisioning a service an Oracle service
bus
