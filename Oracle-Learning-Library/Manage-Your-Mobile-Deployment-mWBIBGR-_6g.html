coded into your mobile app development
is only part of the process you have to
be able to manage the app as it moves
through the entire lifecycle development
staging and production not to mention
managing multiple versions of the app
simultaneously as you respond to the
ever-changing demands of your business
Oracle mobile cloud service brings
together all the lifecycle and version
management functions you need under a
single integrated user interface so you
can coordinate your development QA
post-production and feature enhancement
efforts to create a successful and
sustainable mobile strategy let's take a
look at life cycle after your team
finishes a development and testing cycle
you need a way to migrate it into
production systematically with mcs you
can publish your mobile backend and
deploy it along with its artifacts like
api's and storage collections to the
staging or production environments let's
go through deploying a mobile backend
when you deploy a mobile backend MCS
checks all the dependencies
automatically and generates an impact
report to let you know if any other
assets are dependent on it after that
the mobile backend is ready at any time
you can see which versions of an
artifact are deployed to the different
environments for example you can quickly
see that version 7 dot one of the API
implementation is in production while QA
is testing version 7 dot 2 in the
staging environment and the development
team is working on version 7 dot 4 in
the development environment now let's
take a look at version control for
enhancements and upgrades successful
apps are constantly being improved and
simultaneous development efforts ensure
a continuous stream of upgrades for the
app
mcs enables multi-phase development
cycles by enabling you to create
multiple versions of the same mobile
backend side-by-side to serve multiple
versions of a mobile app in addition
each version of the mobile backend can
expose different versions of api's to
the mobile apps the MCS versioning
strategy lets you decide how different
versions of an app are supported you can
define different versions of artifacts
such as mobile backends api's and
connectors and you can specify whether
these are backward compatible the
various artifact versions can then be
used to support different versions of a
mobile app suppose you've created an app
for customers to request appliance
repair services when you want to add new
features you can create a new mobile
backend with new api's to support those
new features yet keep the existing
mobile backend in production to support
the existing version Oracle mobile cloud
service provides the lifecycle
management capabilities you need to
maintain fresh engaging apps throughout
your development staging and production
cycles and the flexible versioning
capabilities to support multiple
versions of an app so you can quickly
respond to new features and feature
enhancements you can find additional
information in the Oracle help center
Oracle Learning Library and at Oracle
University thanks for watching
