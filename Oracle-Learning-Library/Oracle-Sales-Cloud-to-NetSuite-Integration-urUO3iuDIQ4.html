and NetSuite to synchronize account
creation quickly Oracle integration
cloud service or ICS enables me to
integrate Oracle sales cloud and
NetSuite and synchronize account
creation in real time efficiently and
without coding in order to configure an
integration I complete a series of steps
in Oracle integration cloud service
create source connection create target
connection create integration configure
data mapping configure data tracking
save and activate the integration and
monitor integration for new messages I
use Oracle integration cloud service to
integrate Oracle sales cloud and
NetSuite on the home page I can create
connections and integrations I can also
monitor active integrations I start by
creating the target connection using the
NetSuite adapter I enter the connection
details a unique connection identifier
is generated automatically I can figure
the NetSuite connection by providing the
wisdom you are l because it's password
protected I also provide security
details once the NetSuite connection is
configured I verify its connectivity the
NetSuite connection is marked as
configured it's ready to be used in my
integration on the connections page I
create the source connection to my
Oracle sales cloud instance using the
Oracle sales cloud adapter I enter the
connection details just as before a
unique connection identifier is
generated automatically
to configure the oracle salescloud
connection i provide the wisdom you are
L for the OSC service catalog and the
username and password
I verify its connectivity the oracle
salescloud connection is marked as
configured it's ready to be added to my
integration on the home page I continue
to create the integration using the
configured Oracle sales cloud and
NetSuite connections I'm creating an
integration to synchronize account
creation screen Oracle sales out and
NetSuite when a new account gets created
in Oracle sales cloud the same will
happen in NetSuite there are three
supported types of integrations I select
the map my data option because it
enables one to one application
interaction I provide the integration
details like name and identifier a
package name can be provided so that
related integrations can be grouped
together to simplify management the
version number is automatically
generated the integration canvas lists
all the available configured connections
I set the oracle salescloud connection
as the source and provide additional
information for the source connection I
provide the requested information while
adding the source connection I need to
synchronize account creation so I
configure the business object that will
be sent from Oracle sales cloud in the
request I verify the selection the
account object should be selected in
both the request and the response the
oracle salescloud connection appears as
the source in the integration canvas
next I continue configuring the target
using the configured NetSuite connection
I provide basic information for the
target connection including the endpoint
name and a description
I select the target object in the
applied operation at the NetSuite
instance endpoint on the summary page I
verify that the settings are correct
before completing target connection
configuration
the integration canvas displays source
and target connections next I proceed
with the data mapping between source and
target connections for my integration
this is a crucial part of the
integration configuration
I start by creating the upstream mapping
that's the one from source to target
connections for some integrations
depending on the source and target
connections combination Oracle
integration service offers Oracle and
customer recommendations inference based
on structure of messages and mapping
based on name matching in this case I
manually map my data I configure the
target to source connection data mapping
for this example I'll configure the
mapping manually but there's always the
option of uploading a data mapping
configuration file upon response the
source account name needs to be updated
with NetSuite account organization name
this mapping does that once the data
mapping is complete I configure data
tracking for monitoring this enables me
to select what data is available when
monitoring messages an Oracle
integration cloud service I select the
fields I want to use to track messages
I'll monitor accounts organization name
before activating the integration I save
it when I activate the integration I'm
offered the option of enabling detailed
tracing that can be used when developing
and debugging on the monitor page I can
review the integrations general
statistics at the bottom the details for
each integration are displayed including
total messages and errors per
integration I've successfully configured
the integration between Oracle sales
cloud and NetSuite using Oracle
integration service for more information
