Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
deploy the JVM Diagnostics in the ADP
agents in enterprise manager cloud
control 12c this video is applicable to
enterprise manager cloud control version
12 point one point zero point three if
you're on an earlier version consider
upgrading using self update both the
application dependency and performance
or ADP and the JVM Diagnostics agents
are deployed to weblogic servers in the
target domains the agents collect and
send real-time data to their respective
engines the ADP engine and the JVM
diagnostic engine from any page in
enterprise manager will go to set up
middleware management application
performance management before deploying
an agent ensure that the appropriate
engine is running here you can see that
both the JVM diagnostics and ADP engines
have been deployed and a running now
let's click manage diagnostics agents
for the operation ensure that deploy is
selected which it is by default now
we'll select the targets where we want
to deploy the agents we want to monitor
a server in this production domain in
this cluster and here we want to deploy
both the ADP agent and the JVM
diagnostics agent in this case we're
deploying both agents but you can just
deploy either one if you wish let's go
to the next page now let's set the
credentials for the target let's
collapse this pain first we'll set the
login credentials for the host where the
enterprise manager agent used to
discover this target
man is running you have the option to
use preferred credentials named
credentials or new credentials if you
select new you can create them right
here save them and then set them as the
preferred credentials but in this case
we'll use named credentials as we
already have those set up next we'll set
the credentials for the target domain
like those used to login to weblogic
administration console and again we'll
use named credentials let's click apply
and go to the next page now let's set
the ADP agent configuration properties
no you can select this remote start
configuration if you use node manager to
restart the target weblogic servers this
ensures that node manager related
startup scripts are edited we don't need
that here so let's collapse us pain now
let's select the engine that the ADP
agent will report to here we can see
which ADP agents are available in this
case there's only one so we'll select
that and you have this option to ensure
that all the ADP agents deployed on the
servers in a WebLogic domain report to
the same ADP engine we only have one so
we can leave it checked you can also
specify an alternate ADP agent directory
if the host credentials you specified
earlier don't have write access to the
default directory we'll leave that so
now we'll click apply and go to the next
page now we'll select the jvm
diagnostics engine we'll see which one's
available and select this engine so
we'll click apply and then next now we
need to enter OMS credentials
this is because for a DP agent
deployment we need to update a DP engine
configuration files and restart the ADP
engine so first we enter the credentials
for the host where the Enterprise
Manager agent used to discover the
domain resides we'll choose our name
credentials and now we'll specify the
credentials for the WebLogic domain and
again we'll use our name credentials
will save these credentials and go to
the next page now we'll check that our
settings are correct on this review page
and click deploy here you can see that
there are two jobs that are submitted
and on this deployment status page we
can click either of these lengths to see
the status of the job let's look at the
jvm d agent job here you can see the job
performs a different operations
necessary in order to deploy the jvm
Diagnostics agent let's refresh this
page and now the status is succeeded so
deployment is complete we see a list of
how the job ran what happens at each
step and so on and as with any job you
can click on these status links to get
the command line output for a particular
job so in the rare event that something
did go wrong you'd be able to diagnose
it based on the output from the job and
there's with any job you can view a log
report here before you start collecting
metrics though you do need to restart
the managed server to which the agents
have been deployed back on the
application performance management page
we can see the jvm d aging count is now
one and the ADP aging count is also one
and if we go to the manage Diagnostics
agents page and look at the server where
they were deployed
we can confirm that both the ADP agent
and the jvm Diagnostics agent were
deployed successfully and that the
status is up and you can also see the
version of the deployed agents so that's
it for deploying a DP and JVM
Diagnostics agents thanks for watching
