to enter a picking type fulfillment
exception on a fulfillment request
record in NetSuite you will also learn
how to resolve the exception and enter
fulfillment instructions then you will
see how to acknowledge the instructions
to continue with fulfillment of the
customer's order
there are basically three steps to
working with the fulfillment exception a
store associate typically completes the
first and last step where as a customer
service representative completes the
second or middle step let's get a quick
overview of each step in the process
first at the store associate when we
identify a problem with fulfilling a
store pickup order we enter a
fulfillment exception then as a customer
service representative we contact the
customer about the order to determine
how they want to proceed with the order
in the last step back at the store we
need to acknowledge the customers final
fulfillment instructions to continue the
fulfillment process either cancelling
the items or fulfilling the items based
on the customers preferences now let's
look at each step in detail in next
week's our demo uses the standard
NetSuite application you can also use
suite commerce install to perform the
sales associate events in our demo
scenario the berkeley store has received
the fulfillment request for two items a
mountain shirt and a trekking hat at the
store associate we open the fulfillment
request in next week both items ordered
by the customer are visible under the
items sub tab we mark the order in
progress to indicate that we will start
fulfilling the order
next we start picking items from the
store shelves however when we go to pick
up the mountain shirt we realize that
the last available mountain shirt is
missing a button let's go ahead and
enter a fulfillment exception for the
mountain shirt by entering the
fulfillment exception we have better
visibility on the status of the order we
can flag inventory problems in the
system and we can keep track of customer
feedback first we need to edit the
fulfillment request and switch to the
source filament exception tab select the
item and enter the exception quantity in
this case 1 note that NetSuite won't let
you enter an exception quantity that's
greater than the requested quantity in
the sales order select an exception type
at this stage we can only select picking
and then select a reason enter
additional comments to help your
customer service representative resolve
the exception later
note that the exception type is
determined by the state of fulfillment
the orders act you can also enter pick
up fulfillment exceptions when the
customer comes to pick up or collect the
order NetSuite will only show you the
appropriate options that apply to each
item when you are done click Save
since you are able to pick the other
items from store shelves you can click
fulfil in the fulfillment request and
select to fulfill the trekking hat
NetSuite creates a store pickup
fulfillment record for that so
everything's ok save the record
now in the fulfillment request the
pickup hold field is set to customers
feedback requested this means that a
customer service representative now
needs to contact the customer and ask
them what they want to do the pickup
whole field is like a secondary status
of a fulfillment request NetSuite
updates the pickup whole sales only when
all items have been picked or have a
fulfillment exception in the second step
in the process we contact the customer
to communicate the status of the order
and ask them how to proceed we enter the
customer's instructions on the
fulfillment request record when you log
in as a customer service representative
open the fulfillment request to view the
reason for the exception if the customer
wants to fulfill the item set the
instruction field to fulfill if the
customer does not want to fulfill select
do not fulfill in this case the customer
decides they no longer want the item so
we'll set the instruction to do not fall
so since there is more than one item in
this fulfillment request we also need to
set instructions on all of the lines in
the request to fulfill after you save
the fulfillment request the pickup hold
field is set to customer feedback
received in the last step of the process
we view the final fulfillment
instructions and proceed with the order
now back in the store we open the list
of fulfillment requests we see that the
status of the fulfillment request is
customer feedback received click view to
open the request
we can see that the fulfillment
instructions for the mountain shirts are
do not fulfill so we don't need to do
anything further for the mountain shirts
however in order to proceed of the order
we need to acknowledge the instructions
click Edit to update the fulfillment
request and then for each item check the
acknowledge instruction box and save
your changes at this stage one item has
been picked the trekking hat whereas the
other item has been rejected the
mountain shirt the picked and rejected
columns show the quantity and the pickup
hold field is set to instructions
acknowledged since we have fulfilled all
items the customer wants to receive the
status of the fulfillment request is
picked the order is now ready to be
picked up by the customer at our store
in this video we saw how to enter a
fulfillment exception and to fulfillment
instructions after receiving customer
feedback and that knowledge the
instructions at the store to be able to
continue with the order more videos like
