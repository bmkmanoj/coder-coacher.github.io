welcome to enterprise manager video
series I am going to talk about
production to taste and taste to
production cloning of SWA domain same
process also applies for WebLogic and
vet center domains let's get started
this is Enterprise Manager 12c landing
page I'm going to log in as one of the
administrators once you are on a landing
page navigate to enterprise provisioning
and patching and we have our
provisioning
first straight in domain cloning is to
create a profile profile is equivalent
of gold image which include all pics
required to create and configure new
domain enterprise manager 12c provides
three options to create profile clone
from install media this option helps
user to create a fresh domain from
install media download bits from OTN and
point Enterprise Manager to the location
and you are done first domain will be
ready for use second option is to clone
from existing WebLogic domain in most
organizations administrators configure
domain with specific parameters and
settings Enterprise Manager can create a
profile from such a domain and keep
track of all changes in configurations
and deployed applications the third
option is to create profile from Oracle
home if Oracle home has various patches
installed Enterprise Manager can capture
all patch versions and binaries and
create new Oracle home with patches
applied in this video we will see how
administrator can create a profile from
existing domain then we will also see
how administrator can provision exactly
similar new domain based on this profile
to create a profile click on this create
drop-down and then select option to
create a profile from WebLogic domain in
this wizard to create Fusion Middleware
profile enter the name of the profile
enter description of
file then select the reference target of
the existing so our domain I have this
or domain configured with all my
configuration changes so I'm going to
create a profile based on this sort of
main once you select a so our domain
enterprise manager picks up all the
information about a domain and in
populates it here do not forget to
include Oracle home in your profile so
that you can directly create a profile
and then also create Oracle home when
you are going to provision a new domain
select appropriate Oracle home
credentials unselect WebLogic ad
stated potentials for so our domain you
can schedule the creation of the profile
either immediately or some point later
in time you can also configure a
customized software library upload
location I'm going to keep the default
values at easy as it is now once this is
done you can click on create button to
create a profile on the single page you
will be able to capture the entire
profile information from the domain
including all your data sources and all
existing applications on the domain
since I already have a profile created
for you I cancel this wizard and then we
can explore the existing profile let me
click on the existing profile which is
created using a similar wizard as you
see here we have created this profile
from so our domain it contains Oracle's
so a product of Warren eleven point one
point one point seven point zero the
platform used is Linux x86 64 bit now as
you see here it contains the entire
information about a domain and also all
the configurations which is captured as
part of all these xml's
if I move to the next type of servers we
see all the servers that were part of
this domain we see one administrator
sour and one so uh server which is
managed server in this case we also see
the listen port for administrator server
and so a server captured as part of this
profile but when you are going to
provision a new profile the Enterprise
Manager deployment procedure
automatically picks up the free port and
then you can configure those ports for
new domain alternately you can also
configure different ports while
provisioning a new domain if I look at
stop I see all the data source captured
as part of this profile which are
required to make a domain fully
functional so our domain as we see here
we are also on frog data sources
captured and MDS data sources are also
captured
moving on to Jeremy's server tab I also
see all the Janus server information
captured as part of this particular so
our domain as you see this profile which
is equivalent of gold image has
collected all the information from swor
domain now let's see how we can clone a
fully functional so our instance from
this profile to clone a new instance
select the profile and click on
provision pattern a provisioning wizard
opens under hosts section add the host
where do you want to create a new domain
select post credentials enter Java home
entered administrator username and
administrator password the insulator
database target which contains the
schema for swap you can also enter here
vector information including your OHS
targets and OTD targets I do not have
any weight is configured in my
environment so I'm going to keep all the
default options as they are now this is
all about basic information and this
goes ahead with our typical installation
of the domain but if you want to
configure anything specific in this
particular domain you can always go to
the Advanced tab and then choose
middleware tab you can configure domain
name here you can change the domain name
you can change the domain identifier you
can also change domain directories and
application directories you can
configure clusters all the machines that
you want to assign a different machine
to different server you can also change
the node manager listen port here under
service section you can change the admin
server and so our server settings on
what host you want to configure admin
server on what host you want to change -
ever you can also change the different
ports as I mentioned earlier here you
can also configure your JMS servers and
again configure pepti if it is available
I'm not going to change any advanced
parameters so let me go back to the
typical configuration and once I
formation on my configuration page I
will go ahead with the next button on
next button
I see the deployment procedure details
so this is going to be the name of the
behin procedure and it is scheduled to
run immediately you can configure to run
it later in point in time you can also
configure all the notifications that you
want to receive as part of deployment
procedure run and you have analysis mode
as well
wherein you can pause the procedure
after all necessary prerequisite checks
have been completed so that you can
check what ports has been picked up and
what other pre requisite parameter have
been picked up by deployment procedure
since I already have a domain created
for you let me skip the domain creation
for now and we will explore the domain
that has been created using this
particle of desire to see the existing
domain go to Enterprise Manager targets
middleware targets I see here CRM so I
instance is a domain that I have created
and CRM so I instance 0 1 is the
WebLogic domain that is part of this
form this is my WebLogic domain landing
page and i see all the configurations
for this particular domain here I see
one had been severed and one managed
server that is created as part of this
domain configuration I also see
Oh options available on this very logic
domain as to I can monitor all the
metrics and then I can also have the
diagnostic feature enabled but for this
particular domain I can deploy JVM the
agent to gather more diagnostic
information and have some runtime
diagnostic on gbm's I can control this
particular domain startup shutdown or
create blackout and in blackboard on
this particular domain I can also create
new very busy data sources which might
be required for my new applications that
are going to be deployed on this
particular domain as I see I have
several templates and machines
configured here and I can also
administer this particular domain with
JT parameters and EJB web applications
parameter as we see here we have the
continuous metric collection on this
domain which can be controlled on this
loss collector and compared with other
domains as well from provisioning minim
I can create a database provisioning
profile for this particular our data
sources or the Blodgett domain profile
for this domain now I can also scale up
and scale down this particular domain
here and deploy and deploy to Hawaii
applications on this domain as well I
also have the option to deploy a
regional so what composites here so as
we see in nutshell this particular
domain is fully functional so our domain
which I can use for my entire squad
Halloween cycle this concludes the video
