Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demonstration is the
second part of a series of two while in
the first part we show how to create
administration groups and hierarchies we
are now going to look at template
collections creation and how to
associate them to your administration
groups
so once the administration group
hierarchy is created move on to the next
step which is setting up our template
collections so click on the next step so
here is where we build our template
collections the template collection is a
collection of different types of
templates as you can see we've already
built some template collections as an
example so if you click on any one of
them for example the development
template collection you'll see it is
consisting of a few monitoring settings
we've put in in monitoring template for
databases we could have added compliance
standards and cloud policies so you can
create as many collections as you need
and once you've created them you are
ready to associate that to your
administration groups we have another
template collection for production and
another template collection for
prediction sales with additional
monitoring settings for the targets
within the sales subgroup of the
production group so let's go ahead and
do the final step which is associating
the template collections with the
appropriate admin groups so click on the
last tab here we see our admin group
hierarchy let's associate the template
collection one at a time click on the
dev in the score group then click on the
associate template collection tab and
then select the template collection we
created before for the development
targets click on select what this means
is that once you've associated at this
level the settings of the
template collection apply to all the
groups and an eve this level so they
apply to dev finance as well as dev
sales now let's do the association for
the prod group select prod group and
click on associate template collection
tab and then select the template
collection we created before the
production target what this means is
that once you've associated at this
level the settings of this template
collection apply to all the groups in
the subgroups now let's do a last
association between production sales and
prod in the school sales so click on
prop sells and then click on the
associate template collection tab and
select the template collection for
production sales what happens is that if
you have hierarchy with minimal template
collections then the bottom most one
will override if there are any metrics
in common between a child and a parent
and the bottom most will always override
the topmost you can think of it as the
target in the plot sales group will have
a template collection from the
production template collection first
applied to it followed by any setting of
the production sales template that's in
seconds and for monitoring as far as
compliance standards and cloud policies
are concerned it's going to be a union
there is no search of a writing it's
only the monitoring scenario where you
can have only one setting at a time
where precedence occurs so if you want
to find out what the aggregate settings
are for prod sales for example click on
prod sales and then on view aggregate
settings it will give you a summary of
all the total settings that we apply to
prod sales if you are a host target in
that group then you will have the
settings with the production host
template applied follow
by the settings with the production
cells host template and etc now go back
let's select the prod sales group again
and click on go to group homepage if we
have any targets in this group when you
do an association of a template with a
target this means that we will start
scheduling the synchronization of the
application of these monitoring settings
of the template collection on to those
targets of the group so here we have
seven targets in the group and a
synchronization status region that tells
you whether or not targets in this group
are in sync or out of sync with a
collection templates as you can see here
we have seven targets that are pending
synchronization because we just
associated the template collections to
it now we can wait until the
synchronization scheduling will start or
we can click on the start
synchronization button right now it will
do an on-demand sync which means it will
start applying the templates right now
let's wait for the seam to complete and
once completed the synchronization
targets column shows seven confirming it
is all synchronized whereas the pending
targets column shows zero this is the
end of this demonstration thanks for
