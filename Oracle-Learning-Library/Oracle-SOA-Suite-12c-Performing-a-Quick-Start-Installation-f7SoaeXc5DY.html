run start server instance here is the
integrated server the first invocation
of start server instance initiates the
creation of the server domain you can
control the complete lifecycle of the
integrated server within JDeveloper the
integrated server works with Java dB a
development database that is installed
with the solace wheat and allows
development within the so sweet you will
be prompted to fill in your password for
the integrated server click the drop
down for listen address to see the
available addresses click the
technologies tab to see what runtimes
are included in the integrated server
notice that so a developer and service
