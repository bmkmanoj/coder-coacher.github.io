is asif benjamin and i have here
moti tal we are both from interactive
moti is Interactive's CTO based in tel
aviv israel
my name is asif and i run business
development and I'm based here in our
San Mateo office and we're here to talk
about a little bit about mobile
advertising and how does it really
generate any revenues these those things
calls called apps so just with a show of
hand how many are developers app
developers here but I saw you know any
app developers here a little bit the
others are either business or anything
else pretty much all right so we'll run
a session which is basically focused on
mobile advertising and how to generate
revenues from your mobile applications
and we'll talk about the challenges but
also about the solutions and I'll tell
you a little bit about interactive but
interactive is not the case here it's
not the most important thing the most
important thing is to talk about the
mobile app monetization arena which is
hectic crazy you name it but let's start
with trying to figure out what do the
application developers really want and
the answer is really easy app developers
really want to develop apps they don't
want to be focused on any or anything
else but developing their apps they want
to make sure that they generate revenues
they want to make sure that they
optimize and maximize maximizing
maximizing their potential but they
don't really want to deal with them now
when we talk about mobile application
developers we talked about you know two
guys in a garage with a good idea and
all the way to Zynga and EA and Pandora
and the big guys big platforms
most of the time they all shared the
same vision they want to make sure that
they have the best apps out there and
not necessarily making sure all the time
that they're optimizing their potential
they need somebody else to do that for
them and so there's been a lot of hype
around mobile advertising and mobile
monetization for apps and web in the
past three years what we've seen in the
past - two years two or three years is
that there are so many players out there
so many overwhelming number of
opportunities of third parties players
approaching developers asking them to
just download my SDK and you'll be
monetizing like crazy and we've seen all
kinds of numbers running around coming
from pretty much anyone in the industry
so the few here over on the screen but
let me ask you numbers are coming out
from coming out from our system how many
apps are being downloaded per cost with
the cost and what is the equivalent
number the ratio between those and those
who are downloaded for free let's say
this for every app that is being
downloaded with the cost how many apps
do you think are being downloaded for
free today
any idea what's the ratio one two sorry
four times
anyone else ten anyone else fifty so
these are formal numbers coming for
Gardner what we see from our network and
we have a pretty vast network is that on
every paid for application that is being
downloaded we see 300 apps that are
being downloaded for free the question
verse which is should I go free should I
go with a paid for business model
is not really the question anymore vast
majority of the developers that we've
been working with again the biggest guys
and the smallest guys have already
understood that basically the money is
with the generation of the revenues
basically comes with the free
applications and it's a whole it's a
whole huge segment that we can go into
let's not do that but that's basically
what we see today now if you go free how
do you monetize your mobile apps before
we start let me tell you a little bit
about interactive so you get the context
of things interactive is a
cross-platform app exchange monetization
platform which means we are able today
to deal with any type of any type of
platform Java j2me
iOS Android bada Symbian you name it and
we create we've created an advertising
network to start with we started back in
2007 we started as an ad network and
somewhere in the beginning of 2010 we
thought that being an ad network is not
going to be an easy job because there's
not going to be a lot of ways to
differentiate and that's pretty much the
standard the the situation today ad
networks are you know being an AdWords
ad network today is a bloodbath and it's
very challenging and we also took a you
know we gambled and we thought that free
are going to be free apps are going to
be much bigger than paid for apps and so
at the beginning of 2010 we shifted the
entire focus of the company and we
started building a very robust app
exchange platform which allows us to
integrate today any type of ad network
into the exchange but also any type of
monetization solution whatsoever on one
end that's the demand side and on the
other end the supply side we work with
developers some again some of the
biggest some of the smallest we are 55
employees today with five offices around
the world
traffic that is around 10 billion ad
requests a month and keep rising our
capacity is closer to 40 billion ad
requests a month
and we are we're doing good with very
good with with regards to sells we have
been working with some of the Tier one
publishers EA Zynga digital chocolates
and others and also with big mobile
entities like Nokia Samsung Microsoft
we've been chosen to be the monetization
solution for guys like Appcelerator
Corona Labs live code marmalade unity3d
etc so we are very much focused on
mobile application revenues and how to
generate revenues for for the developers
a little bit about why we have become in
an exchange in Y exchange is the
platform today starting to be the
platform today for developers to
monetize on their apps I'm going to
describe a little bit about you know
what we call the evolution of
monetization however a lot of developers
are still today in you know in those in
those in each one of the steps of phases
of evolution because it really depends
on how big you are what kind of an app
you you're managing etc so it's not
necessarily that everyone started with
phase number one and already everybody
you know
elevated themselves to phase number two
or three we started with a lot of with a
lot of people just working with the ad
network with a single ad network a lot
of the developers that we work today
that shift to to a mediation or exchange
still work with one advertising network
and the idea is that an advertising
network works with the advertisers the
advertisers are the coca-cola the Nike
and the you know and the BMW of the
world they get the campaign's from them
and they would go to to you guys to the
developers ask them to download their
SDK the ad networks SDK and that's how
they monitor and control the part of the
application that runs the the ads
and we're talking about pretty much 24
to 36 months ago when mostly that the
only monetization to we had were mobile
ads coming from advertising networks so
big advertising networks you might you
may know may heard of our guys like in
mobi AdMob millennial grace Drive jumped
up these guys we are looking today at
close to 200 different advertising
networks around the world that's a lot
it's not gonna it's not gonna this
number is not gonna stay like this I
think we're going to see a lot of
consolidation in the next two years we
already have more than 120 advertising
networks integrated into our platform
and so that's where we started and
working with an ad network still has a
lot of challenges first of all it's one
single source you need to be downloading
as an SDK and then you will you will
enjoy you will get the campaign's coming
from one single point of source and you
can't really monetize globally with it
there are not a lot if at all
advertising networks that can actually
source out campaigns from Indonesia when
we get an ad request coming from your
Indonesian user or same if you have a
user downloading your application in
Germany and he now seeks for a campaign
six for a monetization tool which you
want him to click and convert on most of
the ad networks will not be able to find
you in real time a good enough campaign
in Germany in Germany speaking German or
using German and also addressing the
user with the exact same demographic
targeting messaging etc you don't really
have a resource to work with multiple
networks you know you work with one and
that's already overwhelming so if you
wanna multiple your choices and work
with a lot of them it's already a hassle
that's how we started seeing mediation
platform coming in
and the biggest challenge today or one
of the biggest challenge today is the
low fill rate just to make sure we're on
the same page feel rate is the
percentage of AD requests we get the
advertiser or the ad network or somebody
like us the demand partner the
percentage of net ad network ad works
sorry ad requests that we get from the
application user and we actually able to
fulfill or fill with an actual either
banner rich media ad or what have you
any monetization - so any idea today
what is the average fill rate of an
average Network somebody has been is
there anyone that has been working with
an ad network everybody okay great so a
lot of people would tell you I hear that
these guys are giving our providing me
with 85% these guys are talking about 90
percent somebody are some some of the
players out there are not the big guys
but a lot of players out there would
tell you we have 100 percent most of the
time the truth is that the average that
we see coming from a field for a
favorite for an advertising network is
around 35 to 40 percent if the reason we
know it is because we have tons of
advertising networks integrated into a
platform we see their performance on a
regular basis which means only let's say
40 only 40 percent of the potential that
you have in your application to be
monetized is really fulfilled and we're
not talking about whether it was
fulfilled with all kinds of free
campaigns that you are shown but you are
not getting paid for house ads etc it's
a mess filler it is a really really
tricky number so a lot of people
understood that they want to be working
with a few ad networks to be able to get
more filler 8in better deals however
instead of dealing
me the developer instead of dealing
directly with multiple ad networks in
trying to figure out how to manage the
day-to-day with them you remember I want
to sit on the on the beach and design my
new application so a lot of people
decided that well mediation is going to
be the next big thing I'll have somebody
in between me and the advertising
networks somebody who is outsourcing the
management to day to day of the
relationship with the advertising
networks however and we've seen the
mediation layer coming place coming play
pretty much 12 to 18 months ago guys
like ad Marvel guys like Moe pub great
you know they're doing good job and we
are integrated into most of them the
offering is challenging the offering is
challenged because as a developer you
still need to manage the day-to-day with
the advertising networks most of the
time you'll have to register and open an
account with each one of the advertising
networks you want to you want to work
with most of the time you have to deal
with invoicing filtering you know
something goes wrong a millennial just
released in us decay you have to upload
it again embed it refresh it with your
users it's a mess with also a lot of
challenges with the billing and also a
lot of challenges allow us to challenge
with adding new networks the mediation
the biggest challenge of a mediation
platform is is it's not really
optimizing on your performance on your
inventory it's just a hub just a
switching board and so we see a lot of
developers interactive is coming from
the developer side half of the company
are either current or former application
developers and so the developer once
created an app he starts thinking well I
need to monetize on that and I want to
look at what we call the display segment
we at the moment so far we've only just
talked about advertising
networks so think banners banners may
not be the best solution moving forward
but it's still the biggest chunk of
monetization of mobile applications
today cross-platform any platform on any
platform you can think of so we see a
lot of guys like you know we mentioned
jumped up and AdMob a New York I don't
know if you know York but York is one of
the biggest agencies and ad networks in
Germany and so if you're a developer
based here in the US and you're not
familiar with these guys there is no way
you're gonna really maximize or optimize
your offering and inventory in Germany
and again only three but we are pretty
much 200 around the world but on top of
that we now start looking at rich media
because somebody told us a year ago that
rich media is going to be huge and I
remember talking to third-party
companies with all kinds of great
technologies regarding you know with
regards to reach media and they were
saying to me you know eCPM the average
cost per mil is going to be much much
higher with rich media we think it's
gonna show 50 to 60 bucks eCPM and I was
you know very happy to hear it but I
always you know calmed them down and
said I want to see it create 15 bucks
let's start with that but still 15 bucks
15 dollars eCPM is much much much higher
than the average that we see today on
our network and worldwide so rich media
is a huge segment rich media has today
at least 40 to 50 different players that
are able to help you monetize your
mobile app but on top of these two there
are plenty more segments that are
including that includes all kinds of
monetization tools location-based
virtual currency in app search offer was
again reach media behavioral all kinds
of behavioral stats all kinds of
analytics audio ads you name it there
are plenty more take into consideration
that all of these guys at the end of the
day
Vaness decay and they want to offer you
to work with you guys
and that's how we got this now if you
start looking at it and it's the first
time you look at this this is what we
call the mobile monetization landscape
it's a jungle it's a mess but if you
start from the right side where we wrote
advertisers remember the Nike the
coca-cola the BMWs and you move to the
left towards the publishers that
developers those who at the end of the
day earned the dollars that the
advertisers spend then this makes starts
to make sense you see the big box the
advertising networks we just put a few
samples there you see to the lower to
the higher left you see the exchanges
lower than that you see the mediation
platform and each one of those
categories are all names of companies
that are what we call a monetization
tool to be a developer trying to work
with not everyone here with three it's
overwhelming and it's actually
impossible and the whole they all have a
great idea they all have a solution
which is targeting something that you
need but in order to work with these
guys you have to implement each one's as
decay and start having a relationship
with each one of those that's a mess we
we sent this to we released this
landscape I think a month ago something
like that the feedback we got was
overwhelming overwhelming amazing
because this is the first time that
somebody has literally took a few of the
major players put them on one slide and
under the ecosystem of mobile
monetization and so we're already
working on the next next
you know phase two of this slide a lot
of people called us and say why I'm not
here I need to be here an SVP of of one
of the biggest a mediation platform
today called us up and say I want to
know why my logo is that small we're
more important so we understand we are
in a nascent phase of mobile
monetization and still we've been you
know we've been around for five and a
half years and still we learn something
every day so this starts to make sense
into you know put some sense into the
mess called mobile monetization today
and that is why we start saying in the
past few months the big guys the Tier
one publishers are always the early
adaptors because they have the most you
know the the biggest needs and the
biggest issues that challenges to deal
with we start seeing people moving into
private exchange which means you're able
to control your own data you're able to
control your own profiles and you're
able to control whoever the ad networks
slash rich media players slash
location-based services slash all of the
rest who are the ones that you actually
want them to be onboard you decide what
kind of content you are going to get you
to utilize from them and you're the one
to decide how you want your private
private information to be held and to be
handled give you an example
in-app purchasing is a huge issue today
is a huge segment today within the
in-app monetization segment a lot of
people want to do in app purchasing but
in order to target to best target the
offering coming from the advertisers you
really need to expose some of your users
profiles and some of the your users data
if I understand that I have a user doing
something or behaving in a certain way
and I understand or my algorithm
understands that this guy needs to be
offered with a $500 virtual sword then I
need to make sure this profile gets into
the hands of the advertisers but that's
not something I really want to do I
don't want to do that that is why we
came up with a private exchange we are
widely billing our solution to
publishers to big publishers in order to
allow them to use their data but we are
using it with in with them and we're not
releasing it to the advertising networks
a lot of a lot of cool stuff around this
around around the private exchange but
basically the idea is that you own it we
run it that's the model of a private ad
exchange I think most of the developers
today midsize and also starting looking
at starting to look at the smaller guys
already understand that mediation is a
solution but it's not a good enough
solution and starting thinking about
exchange platforms and you know and
that's that's how we got to this this
current phase of of the evolution of
mobile monetization one more thing about
that we decided long ago that we want to
we don't want to compete over price or
over a feature we want to do something
which is more of a building block kind
of a structure the private exchange
means you can build your own offering in
your own exchange based on the partners
you want to work with if you need to add
somebody from the audio add arena or a
segment it's there it's it's it's
available if you want to work with these
ad networks and not these networks you
know you go to our dashboard and it's
pretty much transparent you can see
exactly who's doing what and and how you
want to control it so a lot of still a
lot of open issues with mobile
monetization mottier is going to
a little bit about the challenges
drilling into the technology into the
standards and I will let him either let
him to you know to drill down to that
feel free with any question if there's
any question so far feel free
hello there so Asafa it was some kind of
evaluate the posters you know the
magnetization exchange flow and now we
were going to talk about the technology
challenges we are facing when we coming
to implement set it such as a exchange
many we're a lot about the vertical rich
media off the wall and stuff like that
but when we you integrate with just one
ad networks it's easy just one SDK and
you finish with it but when we talking
about monetization we see many problem
for example if we talking about of a
wall we don't want to see to show the
same banner a twice offer wall if we
talking about rich media first of all
you know what is rich media it's do you
familiar with it it's interactive ads
which interact when a user do some kind
of interaction like video or games we
can see an example later when you click
on a small banner on the Left you get a
game some kind of game that leads you to
a landing page the many vendors that
creates such an ads and each one of them
created some kind of protocol a papaya
papaya teri protocol do you familiar
with any standard did you wish something
about rich middle standards nobody so
like I mentioned before each one of the
vendors created its own proprietary
protocol and you and developer needed to
spend a lot of time to learn
and implement each one of them which
means that you needed to release a new
SDK or a new version of your application
to the market whenever a new company
showed up and error and I forego a Chris
media which which one of the leading
rich media provider started within a
standard which called Alma which later
on replaced by the M raid which was
which is the leading standard now and
the market which released by the IAB is
a Interactive Advertising Bureau which
try to consolidate all the vendors that
are releasing rich media ads but still
when we coming to implement rich media
ads we need to we have some issues like
for example rich media is required html5
campaign compliance browser when we
develop an application we can see here
that the right side we see mobile
application of the CNN and it's not
mobile it's a mobile web and the left we
see we see the CNN application that you
can take for a you know Dowland for the
market and the in app need to get
notification whenever something happen I
will never you know user press a click
or something like that you need to get a
notification about it and expand the web
view that we use in the web all the web
is you know it's a it's a browser so you
don't need to get no notification so as
an in-app advertising you must have some
kind of protocol they tell you that
there is some kind of interaction on the
screen additionally you want to get you
know event and track all the track you
know a click
span collapse if you shake the device
and stuff like that you want to track
all this stuff and and get some
analytics and you understand what the
user do all this stuff are a big
challenge for us as we are in a j2me
session there are some challenges there
as well first of all there's no webview
component which means we can't display
rich media ads additionally you have
many user experience issue because
whenever we open a connection to display
in ads we see a pop up you know network
pop up that ask us if we allow to open a
connection external connection and the
last one is targeting the most important
thinking advertising is targeting and we
the problem that we're facing with
targeting inject ome is first of all
with that we can't get the user agent we
can guess the user agent based on the
screen size on other parameters but only
when the user actually pressed one of
the ads we get the real user agent for
the buzzers and we need to audit it the
last one is the IMEI it's the unique
identifier and network required unique
identifier for each one of the requests
because they need to track the
conversion in j2me there's no standard
way to get there Mei and each one of the
vendors required a different API to get
it so those are the challenges that we
are facing when we coming to implement a
j2me SDK we are walking with the Oracle
team j2me a group which may be in the
neck in the neck next few months we will
see a better API for all the stuff just
to give you an example about JT mclubbe
global traffic as we see it as you
considers its spread around in mostly
Asia and
Europe and no single ad network and
provide us with such an air coverage so
if we're talking about coverage let's
see what are the challenges with the
demand partners first of all it's how
fast you can add a new demand partner
for example you just signed a big
contract with one of the campaigners
coca-cola for example and they are
serving dates from each server that you
don't integrate it with it yet so you
need to be able to integrate it as fast
as possible when a demand partner
counted sorry
one of the main problem is when the
demand part accountant impression when
you ask in a request you get a response
back and now you need to you need to
understand what is the protocol with you
between you and the network because
sometimes the county impression as soon
as there is send a response sometimes
you waiting for tracking pixels
sometimes they're waiting for a response
for a window request this is lit for a
big discrepancy between the your
application and the ad network and if
the ad networks see a big discrepancy
the ECP meb get lower and they will see
less conversion and which lead you to
get less mmm not the best compare that
you can serve you add restriction when
you're talking just with one I'd
networks it easy you just call your
network ask them not to show Nike ads in
your application and that's it but when
you're talking about multiple ad
networks you need some kind of an API
which
send the request all of them there's no
nothing like that available in the
market and we need to amend it stuff
like that
additionally as we are exchange we need
to find a way to identify each ad coming
from each providers and stuff like that
other stuff that importance our
reporting API not all the ad networks as
reporting API and as for that you can't
know the yield per head you can know in
advance what is the a CPM what is the
CPC specific CPC or CPM for the ad
itself and you need some kind of
algorithm behind it to understand for
which one of the network you need to
reach lately yes sir
mm-hmm
trixie big picture twerking yes
especially compared to I totally true
most of the ad networks are traditional
ad networks and they do not have
tracking pics that they don't use
tracking pixel most of them usually this
you know the unsolved that they use the
unsold to sell it to other ad networks
and because of that we see a lot of
redirects for each one of the clicks
which leads to discrepancy lately
because of the html5 compliant and stuff
like that so they started to add the
tracking pixel but it's mostly for the
RT B's less for the old ad networks you
know the traditional ones yes this is
and don't know the numbers but mostly
it's about redirects and less in
tracking pixels so real-time bidding do
you know what what does it mean you
familiar with it
okay so understand some of some one of
you support it you know how its work
okay so RTP allow real-time bidding in a
we allow real-time bidding between ad
networks in real-time
it's mean that if we get an ad request
we need to understand which one of the
ad networks I need to send a request to
get responses with the CP CPC for each
one of the ad requests and decide
according to some criteria which one I
want to use you know to display that
it's to the end-user today there is only
one standard available which called open
RTB again leads by the IAB borrow but
all the traditional ad networks don't
support it yet it's a small market
we see that the market go to this
direction but it's will take time until
all of them will move to the RTB some of
the traditional ad network has some
internal protocol which allow us to
differentiate between the ad request and
the win request so how can we do an
auction when the RT b ad networks and
non RT b ad networks this is a big
question because ad network traditional
ad networks when we send a request to we
receive the response and they expect us
to present it to the end-user the
account is counted as an impression and
so if we don't find display you know
display the ad they eventually they will
see a lower eCPM and like I mentioned
before they will give us a you know less
pain campaigns which bring us to the
solution that interactive developed and
maybe it can give you some thinking
about what you can do with your
application we developed something
called super auction which allow our TVs
and on our TVs participate on the same
auction
they are TV networks we know according
to we audit all the events from the last
few months for each one of the advocates
that we send to the ad networks and what
was the response
what was the restate the response time
what was the discrepancy what was the
price for each one of them and we keep
ago getting the result using the latest
Big Data technologies and according to
that we know if we would like to add a
traditional ad network to the auction we
first of all send it to all the ad
network that you use our TV
we get the responses we calculated we
calculate the eCPM and then decide if
there are additional traditional network
that can get higher result that the one
that we got from the RT be the ad
network that participant in the RT b
auction and we decided if we go to the
traditional ad network we do that with
like I mentioned before with many Big
Data technologies but we also developed
multi agent technology which allows us
to go to the markets get more
information about the applications to
better you know identify it
additionally we strap we do web
scrapping for the network consoles and
get specific information about a X so
that is you know has been sleigh has
been observed in our servers and we get
you know specific eCPM for specific ed
for specific country etc and because of
that we have all the information and
real talent can decide which one will be
the winning ad response yeah sure the
latency okay so according to the spec of
the open RTP all the exchanges need to
response within 120 milliseconds and
because we are in exchange with some
additional latency because we need to
response back to the end-user but that's
what we're talking about the traditional
ad networks are serving it's take them
much more time it's depends again where
the server allocated you need to spread
your server around the world to get you
know to reduce the latency to be closer
as much to the demand per day your
demand partner
and again you need to be closer to the
end user as well so the number it's
about 120 we serve around 200
milliseconds 250 it depends this is the
numbers that we familiar with the
traditional ad networks can you can wait
for a second sometimes and more today
how many are to be partnered do we have
how many we require it
it's depends you know about user
preferences but if it's from the states
it will be much more in states with the
Android it will be much more than you
know j2me application in Indonesia so
usually we do around five five requests
to our TBS and then we decide if you
would like to go to traditional and
network so it can be up to three more
those are the numbers okay so we need to
finish so just talk briefly about the
last few slides we allow developers we
know the developer of free control and
they want to control about everything
they do and we allow them to to manage
the first of all to see all the
performance for each one of the network
that we working with you can see the
fill rate at the eCPM for each one of
them and you can decide if you would
like to opt-in opt-out some of them
additionally we allow to set a floor
price for each one of the requests and
we are because you can see you know each
one of that network you can go and
negotiate with them and get a better
deal for you without you know you can
you know because it's because of days
called hybrid mediation it's you do it
without us
all this can be done using a single SDK
let's see how it is how easy it is first
of all you just register register with
our service download SDK and with just
one line of code this example is the
j2me example you are implementing it
with your application I know that you
are that many of networks as single line
of code but look how it easy it is it
this slide I've been asked by this guy
to show up that you can earn a lot of
money and this time we can if you have
any question we will be happy to answer
yeah
sorry oh it's depends because the most
of the mobile are connecting using Wi-Fi
not just you know 3G networks the
latency is not affecting the service
it's affecting you know the the time
between there is I think most of the
netbooks keep the ED for about 10 to 15
minutes so it shouldn't affect the
performance because you'll get that in
few seconds the most it doesn't matter
if it's triggy or Wi-Fi
I won't had a general comment about
about our TBR TV as being a huge hype in
the past year or so we share the opinion
with a lot of players that eventually
RTP is going to be the way you know the
most important way to actually bid and
you know integrate with other partners
third parties that can enable you with
any type of advertising in real time and
with much better targeting opportunities
however we strongly believe and from
what we see in the market today that
were far from it's not already happening
it's you know everybody talks about it
but it's not there yet there is only one
player today in you know in the arena
which clearly wants to take the lead for
that and we are you know and we're good
relationship with these guys but the
biggest challenge is that is coming from
the demand partners out of those around
200 advertising networks that we see
today maybe four to five some like that
really implement RTP and that is still
far from the good old RTP that we know
from the online world so we have to take
that in consideration a lot of people
talking about it a lot of people a lot
of advertising networks say that they're
going to support RTB and I know that
people are doing
you know taking steps towards that and
we're optimistic but we're still far
from they may not implement it the open
RTB but they have a property protocol
that look like open RTB so we have more
than four and five just clarified it
okay if you have other questions so
thanks a lot thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
