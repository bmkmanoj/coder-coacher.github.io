media data management hello and welcome
my name is Tom Hagen
I'm a senior sales consultant at Oracle
data integration solutions Damian team
in this session I'm going to give you a
brief introduction about Oracle
Enterprise needed data management
following that I'll be doing an
interactive demo to show you the main
functionalities that make Oracle
Enterprise Community data management a
truly unique solution let's talk about
the definition of maintain data and
metadata management according to
Wikipedia in the data is data about data
according to Wikipedia if the data
management involves managing data about
other data where by this other data is
generally referred to as constant let's
give an example to make this more clear
if we look at a database system we have
schemas and under those schemas we have
tables and each of the tables we have
definition the definition includes a set
of columns and those columns has data
types
they have data link and other properties
as well this is metadata in describing
how the data will look like now if you
look at the records under a certain
table then then this is the other data
or the context why do we need a meter
data management solution and
organization it's important to have a
metered data management solution to
answer different questions how do we
know what we know about our data is the
main question community data management
solution shall help you to know what is
the impact if a certain change occurs
community data management solution shall
help you to achieve
governance it should give you answers
when you want to know how a certain
figure was calculated it should Excel
reduce the risk of changes happening to
your data structure what will happen if
this column is change or this table
section has been change who will be
affected what kind of reports will be
affected what kind of application and
users as well it doesn't stop there it
should cover the whole architecture of
your organization from bi development
from system admins to application users
to executive levels and data scientists
as well
if uncle has introduced Oracle
Enterprise need to data management or
OMM OMM is solution that will help you
to harvest and catalog the meta data
from virtually any meaty data provider
that you have after you catalog and
harvest all limited data in one single
repository for all EMM you'll be able to
catch those meaty data together the
stitching will help you to see the full
architectural view of your current
environment that means you'll be able to
see the full full of data from different
models databases analytics tools ETL
engine and so on OMM is equipped with
interactive searching capabilities and
browsing capabilities for the meta data
and that you have it will provide you
with full data lineage and effect
analysis for any given source that means
that you do not have to know how the
system or applications or databases are
running from business perspective you'll
be able to go through browse automated
data underlying those systems without
physically accessing those you're just
browsing the meta data that Oracle
Enterprise mix data management have our
vistas and catalogs
Oh a NN is not only an Oracle based
solution is truly a true genius you'll
be able to harvest different kind of
databases from different vendors you'll
be able to harvest mediated from
different ETL providers from different
di applications and from different
modeling applications and so on Oh
EMM is part of Otto's data integration
solution portfolio I complete this Creed
offering for enterprise data integration
with Oracle data integration solution
you'll be able to cover the whole data
integration aspect and mean for your
organization as you can see from this
slide we've got Auto data integrator
this one is for both data movement
complex aggregation and transformational
functionality we have Oracle GoldenGate
which is our real time leader location
synchronization is that the recovery
solution and then we have oracle
enterprise data quality or data quality
solution to help you Clint
these applicate stars and do different
quality tasks for your data and of
course the introduction of the newly
minted data management solution Oracle
Enterprise community data management and
at last the Oracle active Data Guard or
disaster recovery solution for auto
enterprise database those technologies
are truly heterogeneous
they will allow you to connect to cloud
services to application to different
databases from different vendors and
they are big data enabled as well so you
will have yourself covered from data
integration perspective and data
governance as well the solution our
future already will give you the maximum
possible performance and of course they
will give you the fastest time to value
let's have a look at Oracle Enterprise
3d data management logical architecture
on this slide on the right side this can
be any given organization architecture
as you see from the bottom up we've got
the data sources those be the sources
could be styled based they could be
cloud
it could be Big Data relational
databases or applications on the second
or the middle wire we could have an ETL
tool data quality data screen
integration obligations and data and
richness and on top then we have the
actionable information that is being
saturated by data discovery and
analytics tools as you can see those
tools or definition that integration and
data sources could be Oracle and non
Oracle on the left side we have the
Oracle Enterprise mega data management
and there is two hours
there is one porting from bottom to top
and other one from top to bottom if you
want to one and in fact analysis and see
what will happen if a 30 change happen
on our application on our analytics data
integration tools data discovery etc etc
then this is called impact analysis so
with OEM M you may want impact analysis
on any of the sources that you see on
the bottom the effect Alice's can do one
at any fish actually
but it makes more sense if you want to
see who will be impacted if a certain
change happens and those changes
normally happen on
data sources the physical data sources
on the data layer and add the data
integration layer as well now if you
want to trace the lineage how data was
created and the full flow of the data
then we call this data lineage for
example and a certain Oracle bi report
you want to trace how that report was
generated I was certain KPI was
generated then you may simply run a
digital image on that report and it will
show you the full data flow through
different system from the BI perspective
to data integration through different
data sources
OMM have any - data repository which
will collect all those meaty data from
different easy data providers that you
select after that it will do the
stitching in order to facilitate the
impact analysis and the data lineage
analysis as well on the top of a mmm you
can see that there is a business
glossary and this is something that
shipped with OEM and it's not a separate
product with business glossary you name
those groceries definitions terms
billing and such from your current model
or you can create brand-new groceries
for your definition with the business
glossary you'll be able to do also what
we call thematic linking so a business
glossary terms can be linked to a
physical basis store for instance that's
way you can run also data lineage and
impact analysis to your business
glossary which will make more sense for
you what a certain column for example a
certain table mean
Oracle Enterprise we data management
physical ex sector is very simple
as you can see we have limited data
repository this is a central repository
for OMM heads up so it will hold the
metadata for OMM and it will have you
have visited me data from different
providers that you will harvest from on
top of that we have the OEM engine and
this engine will have the repository
manager they meet the data browsing and
searching capabilities the business
glossary and of course the lineage and
the impact analyzer to access all EMM
you need a browser so virtually from any
supported browsers you can connect to
the HTTP of omean on and then be able to
do different kind of activities that oml
settled it for you
and you see also on the slide we have
the data sources the ETL or Realty the
VI and analytics business small stories
enterprise and such about model has loop
as of course other sources as well which
will all feed the Oracle Enterprise
metadata repository with their meter
data let's have a quick look on the new
features Oh Ian and it ships with women
has a graphical browser for data models
their graphs you'll be able to easily
navigate through models that you harvest
in OAM and you'll be able to see with
advertised view the metered data
underlying the harvested model you'll be
able to do zooming and do math and
moving around complex MIDI data model
evil in Ireland we will be able also to
do keyword based search and all metadata
that you have harvest for example if you
have our vistas assist of models say
from
our DNA and di and ODI and other tools
as well and they are all under one
configuration then you'll be able to
search easily for any related term Oh
EMM will do full index for all the terms
that has been harvested inside the
metadata repository all the events also
have the versioning capabilities so
you'll be able to easily compare a
version of a model with another this
will give you a clearer view of what has
been changed so you'll be able to see
exactly the change and the friction of
the change between two different models
in only an M there's also social
collaboration for stewardship for
deputies so different team will be able
to be romanced they will be able to give
importance by started starting systems
they will be able to set that status of
a certain term and in a business
glossary for example or any command and
the facilitate for lifecycle management
will be able to see an end-to-end data
flow of architecture reviews of the
whole architecture in your organization
so if you have harvested databases if
you have our preferred ETL tools bi
analytics etcetera structure and then
stitch them together or EMM will
automatically draw a diagram that shows
the architecture and the flow of data
between different systems you'll be able
also to do an annotation and we'll be
able to have labels and we'll be able
also to get footmarks to make things
easier to share with a different theme
and to have wizard diagramming and
modeling capabilities and only then
you'll be able also to do drilling into
formulas and calculations that ideally
be harvested from ETL and bi reporting
engine
so for essence if you have visited and
all the I mapping and you want to see
what is the formula or the aggregations
or the maybe the filtering or joint
happen inside that's nothing you will be
able to drill down it's like Oh a mmm
capsule to see what's happening work
with Oh a mmm you'll be able to find the
data
chauvelin from little pliers today that
you have fully visualized coulomb and
population level dependencies across
systems databases and reporting views
and at last the business grocery which
is a built-in and not a super add-on
you'd be able to go beyond the database
and extremely link business
terminologies across new data models and
system you'll be able to give
definitions to define keywords to update
the status of a certain term for last
record management such abbreviation and
even have documentation and relations
felt inside the business closer itself
so in summary oracle enterprise mobility
management with healthy fabrics need to
data from different midi data providers
it will help you to explore those media
data in order to achieve fully truly
basic governance the main point is the
rich textures emigrated browsing
capabilities
oann has simple and clean user interface
to make it a smooth user experience it
has model and diagram visualization
capabilities it will show you full
end-to-end data flow and lineage between
different systems it has civil ship and
team coloration capabilities to have
more efficient rejuvenate organization
and different team it has metadata
tagging and labeling to make things more
easier to find
has against collaboration capabilities
such as multimedia attachments so you'll
be able to upload documents videos
presentations film to a certain object
to this OMM OMM make it easy to make URL
link repentance for emailing blogging
and social it's working
ohmmm is industry compliant so you'll be
able to be compliant to a different
industry standards and also enterprise
media management as Oracle integrated so
you'll be able to easily integrate with
most of Oracle technologies and harvest
metadata in order to run the delineation
pact analysis and so on
OMM has the for football popular flash
runs from different vendors as we can
see we needed we can connect to
Microsoft to IBM to MicroStrategy to SAP
to Hadoop Teradata
EMC informatica and much more even with
no native connectivity to one of the
vendors he'll be able with simple bbbc
ODBC connection to connect virtually to
any big data provider and harvest its
meter data let's now jump into the demo
and see how om and looks like and what
can be done via OMM itself me login
screen for Oracle Enterprise you need to
data management
so let's use my credentials to login
into Vietnam as we can see this is the
landing page after you login into OEM M
for the purpose of this recording I have
created a small project and I called it
demo so let's try we'll be able to see
the repository the repository is where
everything that you work on will be
stored so you can create as many folders
as you want that you can rearrange them
you can have different structure for the
folders in order to make things more
need to deal with and on the right side
we have the properties panel which will
display the properties of any object as
you select so let's open the demo folder
that I've created as you see I have
harvested the old models and those four
models is the dimensional data warehouse
this is basically and also dimension
this will house database and I have
listed all PP schema from Oracle
database as well and I have her busted
Oracle data integrator and it's called
his multi-dimensional data warehouse and
at the end I have harvested that bi
reports which is coming from Oracle
business intelligence Enterprise
position let's have a look at one of the
models that I have her best solution the
dimensional data we're not if we double
click on this model with the able to see
all be harvested objects underneath so
for this one I have harvested a chemical
bi sample and you can navigate through
the schema and see all the tables that
have been harvested if we go to the old
TP source you'll be able to navigate to
the same but of course we have a
different CMS for OLTP source the third
harvested source is the ODI
which is multi-dimensional data
warehouse as you can see I'm able to see
the full repository of all the I and it
looks pretty much familiar to what it it
looks and feel inside for the eye itself
so if you're authorized ever perform
this will give data Camellia and you'll
be very comfortable in navigating three
different objects within this model so
we've got the connection the physical
connection and we've got the model we
got the project and I
have visited a particle lineage demo and
if we expand that we will see that we
have three mappings that been harvested
if I want to see any goes graphically it
very simple so if I want to see the LV
orbit in graphical way I tend to double
click on it and you'll be able to see
first the content in a list format which
is tell me the sources and the target
and the function aggregations happening
in fiber mapping and if you want to see
that graphically you simply click on the
data flows over to you and it will show
something like this so in this case we
have the sources but is being aggregated
inside o di and it is being loaded
eventually to some target table in my
dimensional different house to the base
so we have here for example become
amount if I click on it I'll be able to
see any information happen there so and
as you can see here we have from
operation between multiple columns and
then multiply it by another column if
you go to the join in you will be able
to see the condition which we have shown
in the columns of this case we are
joining if RC underscore orders wicked
as we understood all the lines and the
joining is under column order ID so
you'll be able to keep all the details
the same menu able to see them inside
all the I but it will be summarized it
will be more that's a business-oriented
view so even have all those different
aggregation for the over work they are
all gathered in one simple aggregation
less in order to make it more easy to
study to look at to gravitate to as well
so let's close this model let's go to
the last motion the di reports again if
if you are di dead looper if used obiee
before
you know this will look familiar to you
you would have the same look and feel of
how objects look like inside o Diep
itself so I've got the connections and
you can compute that they Forks folder
and we've got a report such as movie
report and products report which I
selected and harvested through the model
if I want to see things in a graphically
or a much more detailed I simply double
click on that and you'll be able to see
the criteria the report is using you'll
be able to see the report itself from
layout perspective 0 CD title table from
sound all the components that that makes
that report and the presentation wire AB
slow if you want to feed it graphically
very simple we simply click on the data
flow over here and you'll be able to see
that in a graphical way all right this
is very good so in order to start
building analysis around those models to
see the range and impact and everything
we need to create what's called
configuration so configuration is like a
container for all the models that you
want to stitch together if you want to
link together in order to make fertile
analysis of them and for the purpose of
this demo I've created the Sales
Reporting application - one
configuration so if we open this
configuration we'll be able to see the
models that I have selected so the
process is pretty simple you just create
a new configuration and then you drag
and drop the models that you want so in
the States
I drag and drop the dimension on this or
house those could be sourced the local
dimensions that we have VI report and
there is also Health application
business glossary optimizing mapping so
the business glossary which I will
describe later
so let's only focus on those four
abdomens after I drag and drop my models
AI system together and basically what I
get is
full actual diagram of my cannon and the
structure organization architecture so
as you can see we have the rotating
source it's being you know Auggie is
extracting the data that resides salty
sea salt there's some transformation
happening and na VI and then it's
loading data into dimension get their
help and then we have some VI record
which will build on top of this I
mention on this other house so I am it's
very simple here to understand the whole
flow of my architecture and I can I can
easily see how this is moving from one
place to another
what you can do with OMM is analysis
from me to be the perspective so you can
do a lineage you can do impact analysis
as well so let's start with linear
analysis and we'll do that in our bi
before so let's open the BI record model
and let's go to the report that I want
to show you Mini 4 which is the product
record let's see this graphically so
it's no visual for us and let's get
complex to make the ability more clear
alright so in my report I have the
layout
I have see the one I have been asked by
some person in the organization to see
the lineage for the stable how the table
was built the answer to such questions
very easy with go here then you could be
right click on the object
I'm clicking the table you can go
through the column with them as well but
how for this demo I will just go to the
table object level and I go to trace
lineage oh-seok trace data range and I
select the options that I want you may
be able to see it in text let's format
or black flow
let's see them yeah local map and click
on trade you can see out him I'll have a
little description of the lineage so
this bi Ford is taking data from my
dimension bit over half and I mention a
little health is being fed from my OOTD
source sub that before we open a label
if I don't expand its me I simply
thought expand logic that I have if I
started by measuring the house I would
be able to see all the objects that are
involved and created this report inside
my dimension desire house if I were to
go to fit back to be the original source
I can stand back as well and as you can
see I see that there are three tables
from the old officials involved
integrating the supports if I expand
those tables
I'll be able to see the columns within
the table that are involved in creating
the supports with it's not all the
columns it's just one column from each
from each table from the OTP schema on
my Oracle database if I want to see
further you can simple the tip expanding
and see what happened what's being
involved I don't think you notice here
that we have some bolded line and both Y
means there is some kind of ETL
happening behind pink if you want to dig
down deeper it's very simple with early
events and caretta click and go to
phrase ETL details and it will go
directly to the mapping of ODI and show
you a verse or the column all the date
is being aggregated inside ODI and
eventually it's being loaded into that
dimension data warehouse if you want to
see the operation we can expand the
properties panel we click on the column
and you'll be able to see all the
properties that's happening
with that column so let's go back so
this is show me a full data link for the
report that I have just showed you and
you can go to the report in a graphical
way as well you see all the objects that
involved for this range if you want to
do this in the other way which is impact
analysis it works pretty much the same
way but reversed way so if you open the
old CP source here and we go to one of
the schema theory and we go to another
table let's say I want to see the table
for the line and I want to track the
column amounts and the impact that has
on other objects so to do that I think
you like to lay underneath a rocket face
with the impact and we want to see that
graphically again and I click on train
having that will show me all the objects
to be impacted if I simply change
anything to this column for them so I
opened it a mesh on little house and I
see that there's some tables of being
built behind the column which is the
devenir The Grocer veneer the ribbon
again and from sampling tables in some
sequel conditions here
if you open a bi report will be able
also to see the end object that will be
affected if I do any change to my column
which is on the table 1 and I see that
do it sales tax revenue ecology that
could be affected if I do anything there
the same thing here we can also trace
the ETL detail so this some ETL
happening so I simply right click and
I'm going to create ETL details if I
trade the ETL details you'll be able to
see the amounts and will be able to see
the operations being happen
so let's close all the deaths that I
have opened here and see some other
feature of or EMM let's look at the
grocery for the purpose of this
recording I've created a sample business
closer and called sales a business
glossary if we double click on that
you'll be able to see the content of
that cool Serena in this glossary there
is a bi sample which is being populated
from dimensional digital house so what I
did is basically dragged and kelp is not
a type of grocery and it was populated
automatically if we dig down into the DI
sample we'll be able to see for the
terms that we have within the BI sample
you'll receive the definition the
keyword and return status for the
purpose of the civil I have made some
modifications to two terms we should be
Fanta we the new F and it's all fixed so
if we double click on the satin ribbon
you have we're able to see more details
about that term so the definition is
saying revenue fact tables and the staff
is currently candidate and the type is
entity so this is a table if we scroll
down to the relation with relationship
you'll be able to see all the columns
that is contained by this entity so on
this interview we have the cost X was
variable etc if you go back to the VI
sample and directly from the cost X you
will be able to see also more
information about the term and the
definition here is saying fixed cost
component and the fatal so candidate and
this is attribute and as you can see in
the relationship here it changed
contained by natural rhythm risk you can
easily navigate through those by simply
clicking on them and it will maybe get
to appropriate objects and definition
see more details about that terms
basically I've also created some new
folder and I call this generalization if
we double click on
that you see a term called old code and
the way I did that in basement
electively came to add and I said new
term and then called it's for school if
I click on that term you'll be able to
see the definitions or saying this is
all costs related terms and currently
the status candidate and this is a
business so it's not an entity and it's
not an attribute that is the business
turn so to be more specific about this
new term new business sir
I said okay yeah I wish I'd gone to the
relationship and I said I want to have
all the attributes that have the word
cost in them so we have a cost effect
cost variable fixed cost and variable
stuff and those are recommend to
automatically map to the physical
attributes that have been populated in
the grocery from the model so if I click
on the prospects you'll be able to see
the original term that has been
associated with that turn and in the
relationship in C okay more general and
it's all posts which is again that you
know life business term that I have
created to update the status of Anakin's
very easy you simply you know counter
the status and you say
reviewed and that you've got your
business glossary current status updated
and it's ready for the next row so let's
close this distance closer II so the
last thing that I want to show you the
semantic mapping that can happen between
business 203 and physical models inside
Orion and so automatically
OMM have created this semantic mapping
from sales app business rotary to the
dimensional physical house and basically
what happens here is mapping the terms
that you have in the business glossary
to the actual model that or the physical
model that we have harvested inside OMM
as you can see we have all the
Abel's here and inside the business
glossary if you open the VI example they
are full mapped into it so this icon
means that this object has been linked
and be linking in has happened
automatically so see if we look down and
we open BBB entity and you deta that we
also get column underneath so we have
monitoring field and all these things
are being snapped into the physical
model that we harvested earlier this is
very helpful in case you want to do a
semantic lineage or what we call also
add vertical lineage which we open again
the business story as I have showed you
earlier and we go to the VI example
again and we go to one of their
definitions such as the sample revenue
and I right-click on that one I say
trace semantic usage you'll be able to
see the actual physical lineage for that
film if you want to see this graphically
you can simply click on show lineage
graph and you'll be able to see that in
in a graphical way it works the same way
if if you go to the actual physical
model so let's go to the dimensions is
our house in this case let's go to
scheme and VI example both of the tables
so it's called sample revenue app so
let's look for that one right here we
click right click and we say okay a very
semantic definition and if you want to
see this in text format we can do that
click on text and we will be able to see
the definition so saying he is a
definition of giving you a fact table
and this is very easy
the traits within OMM he was able to do
the same in a graphical late so if you
want to see graphically think if I
select a somatic you select the graph
world he clicked on trade and it goes
you'll be able to see the physical
connection between be the entity the
term entity inside the business glossary
and the actual physical entity or sable
in the middle that we have harvested and
this marks the end of the interactive
demo summarize everything this recording
and to give you a better overview of
Oracle Enterprise into data management
we have mentioned the main features of
so EMM such the ability to do the
lineage do answers for the impact the
business culture and the value of OD mmm
and for organization we found through
