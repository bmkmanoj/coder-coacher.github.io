called neo technology every once in a
while they left me out from the office
and let me go to conferences like this
or let me work on cool things like what
I'm gonna talk about today maybe you
don't think it's cool but I hope you
think it's cool because you're here but
I think this is super cool I live on the
internet here
various places these slides will be
available somewhere if not if you can't
find it through Oracle find me as phobe
on SlideShare and it's gonna be there
I'll upload it there after the
conference yeah and the recently let me
out to do this is because I say things
about it and like I put their logo in in
here and say how much I love working in
the air technology what we do is we
build a database management system we
just kind of contains quite a few bits
of really cool technology in there which
is why I loved working there and if you
want to know more about that stuff I've
got a talk on non-relational databases
on Wednesday and new near 4j our product
is going to be featured in there enough
about that let's get down to it
so these are the things that I'm gonna
be covering today a few of these you
might know probably you know the Java
debugger interface I'm assuming if
you're written code you use the debugger
I'm gonna be doing things you never
thought was possible with it and then
I'm gonna be looking at some things you
might never have seen or maybe you have
but I'm gonna be putting them all
together and make crazy things with them
so let's start with java.lang
instruments
it's a package in the JDK it's a
standard package included in the in all
JD case it contains a few interesting
things like what
the things when I got to Java from from
other programming language I was missing
the size of operation not because I
needed to I needed it for the things
that you needed for in C such as
allocating data of appropriate amount
but because I I wanted to introspect
these kind of things
how big are my objects just that relates
to to the to the heap usage I know that
I know how big my heap is but how large
are my objects how many I'll B's kind of
fit in me so the size of operation is I
thought I was missing I found it in
juggling instruments granted it wasn't
added until few years after I declared
that I missed it but so it's there now
it also contains a few other cool things
that allows you to introspect with the
VM is currently doing like getting all
other classes getting all initialized
classes initiated classes from a
particular class loader there's a slight
difference between loaded and initiated
initiated plus the differences that the
initiative class has had the static
initializer run from it
so all these static fields and such
things are populated then it also
contains really cool things on
redefining classes so you can take any
old plasm with this instrumentation API
so this class isn't isn't actually what
I wanted I'm going to redefine it at
runtime so we define methods
I don't field whatever which is kind of
and a cool I haven't used this much but
I I know that there are for example
testing framers that use this I just
wanted to let you know that it's there
I don't you do us no information much I
prefer to do class for transformation on
the actual class file before they're
loaded if I need to do that but if you
want to do it at runtime with some
mocking frameworks and such things do
this is how they do it by using
java.lang instruments how do you get to
these things how do you get to the java
instrument that's where where we get to
the hidden bug parts so you know how
there's a magic method in java programs
with the signature public static void is
the name name and the that takes a
single argument of type string array
there are a few more of those magic
methods one called pre main which is run
executed in something called a Java
agent so Java agent is a jar file
containing class files we all know jar
files contain quite faults those are so
simple we also know that there's a meta
in m-f file then meta in life manifest
dots MF file we should seen some
information about the classes in the jar
for example the main class which
contains the main method so if you just
run the jar they will run that main
method in that main class there's also a
few other directorates that can use for
agents for example the pre name class
which is essentially same thing as the
main class for things that have a main
method but it's for for the pre main
method and this premium method is public
sallyboyd again how pre main it takes a
single string arguments and optionally
an instrumentation of it which is the
entry point to the Java line instrument
api's when I say optional you can
declare this method both with and
without that instrumentation parameter
so just declaring it a single string is
also valid but you don't get to do the
good stuff if you do that you can also
define extra things to add to the cost
path for the agent and define the
capabilities that you want the
instrumentation API to provide to you if
you wanted to redefine be able to
redefine classes
transform classes and fifth native
method prefix not very interesting you
can read up on that later I'm gonna post
reference this at the end the
interesting part is you get to the
instrumentation audio through this you
load it by specifying on the on the clap
clap saying Java regular parameters on
the command line then I specify that if
you want to load this Java agents that's
Java agent :
and jar file and then you can say
optionally you can say equals and then
some options and those options are going
to be passed at as that string agent
arts arguments so it keeps you something
an entry points to getting to
instrumentation there are cooler ways of
viewing this so that means that you have
to start your you have to start your JVM
knowing that at some point I might need
this instrumentation I want to start it
with instrumentation and enabled which
is good if what you want to do is
redefine and retransplant transform
classes such as those marking framework
so hard about do but you can do even
cooler things there's something called
Java agent so SSS so as you saw in the
command line paint in there there this
is called a Java agent but there's
another kind of agent which has an agent
main method in the difference between
premium an agent main is the pre main
gets executed before the main method
gets executed if you specify agent the
Java agent on the command line the agent
main gets invoked when an agent's visits
the JVM so you don't specify it on the
command line instead you have the you
have the agent discover the VM and enter
it after the fact
and it can still do the kind of things
that you can do with with
instrumentation the pre-made stuff and
get slice of objects but what you can
but what this allows you to do is uh and
that I use it for it work is for for
adding code to my running application
after the fact for example in in our
database we have a plug-in architecture
where I can where I say that so this
database is started it's running
actually I want to start I want to add
some capabilities to it so I started a
small Java program that all it does is
bootstrap into that JVM with an 8 inject
an agent and that agent discovers the
database running inside the JVM and adds
capabilities to it so I load an ad code
on the fly by using Java agents so I was
like laughs sorry this for example is
also how have some of the
functionalities in JDK in the JDK itself
works for sample if you've ever used the
J console application you know that you
can use it for attaching for
introspecting JMX
variables through a long and complicated
connection string you can also you
specify a process ID you just connect to
a process running locally on your
computer that thing uses Java agents so
what it actually does and I think I have
yes on the next slide
there's a hidden API it's it's so this
is where we get into some proprietary
guys some doesn't exist anymore say it's
Oracle proprietary API
I think at least a few the other JDK
specify this API as well
if not they should have equivalent api's
this is the the API for attaching to a
JVM and injecting an agent in this
example here if it's a complicated it's
actually from the actual J console
source code I've simplified just a
little bit but that is essentially what
it does for starting the starting the
jmx agent that allows you to do
connector it through through J console
so when J console is started with a
process IV or when you specify process
ID in the interface what happens is that
it uses this calm fun tools attached
virtual machine API to attach to that
process ID
I used 1337 as placeholder process ID
here and it reads the properties of that
virtual machine also kind of a cool
feature I mean one Java process reading
system properties of another Java Perl
and Java process quite funky it gets the
Java home of that so it gets the
location of the system libraries for
that VM so you can load the management
agent jar from that that's supposed to
go with that p.m. so it gets that agent
then says load the agents and gives it a
parameter so this again the same kind of
thing as with the pre name we specify
Java agents on the command line we give
it the location of the agent state into
our file and a and the options for it so
this is the location of the agent to our
file and this is the options so we do
that we were attached to the VM we know
the agent in the appropriate location
and then we were done we don't do
anything more in the in this process
because the rest of this stuff is going
to happen
in the process into which I injected the
agent so we just detach and then what's
going to happen there in the case of IJ
console and that's where the bulk of the
code is and is what happens inside the
agent instead it's gonna open up and
listen to this port that it's been
specified I think five thousand it's
actually the default of uses for this
although I think it might allocate ports
at random but the thing is that it's the
say if the processor starts the agents
or than Jets the agent that decides
supports so actually they touch now we
know that the that there's now going to
be a port opened on that I can can
connect to and get the JMX parameters so
it didn't have didn't have game x JM x
server started before i injected an
agent that started the JM x server and
now i can can get to the JM x beans so
that's what j console works if you
didn't know that previously you know it
now also JPS if you ever used that come
on these lists java processes that also
uses this same api so it's possible from
from this virtual machine api to not
only attach to a virtual machine given
this process ID you can also list all
running Java processes and attach to
them so I do that with with the plug-in
capability that I mentioned if I have
multiple databases running on the same
server I connect to all of them and say
I want to add this much not at all it's
kind of handy and usually the
functionality add is a is also I start a
port that where I can I can get a remote
shell access to it I guess the database
doesn't start with that normally here's
the trick I use for that for listening
to a port I using are mi and are mi is
crap don't use RM I
it's but for for stable environments
like communicating between processes on
the same machine where you don't really
care about the performance of the
protocol and such things it's really
simple to do suck with RMI if you just
define your interfaces share a class
that extends unit cost remote objects
and influence your interface and then
you're ready to go the hassle with RMI
is the thing with registries so if you
want to do RMI first of all use it only
for four things on the same machine
because it's not really something you
should use for distributed systems and
don't use registries they're a mess so
what are my registry does is that it is
essentially a list of or it's
essentially a half strap running in some
Java process that I can connect to that
has a hashmap from a an identifier to a
serialized are my stub so I go into that
process go into the hashmap get the stub
that I'm interested in and I have
deserialize it in my process and I
connect to it super simple so the are in
my registry doesn't actually do anything
it just holds these serialized objects
so all I really want to get to is one of
these serialize objects so how about I
just pass that along straight away then
I don't need to mess around with
registries that are hard to maintain and
I need to have them running on a known
location known host known port I have to
make sure that it's something is up and
running there if it's in I have started
some mess with registries don't use
registries
um so instead you can just serialize the
object and pass it on on your own so as
you saw with the agent conviction you
can pass an arbitrary string as
parameter to the agent so why don't you
serialize the an RMI stub in there
pass it on so you guys it's just string
which I usually do by but you
serializing regular Service agent or
byte array and then base 64 encode
that's a string simple enough that means
that you now have a way to talk back to
from from the process where the agent
was injected you now have channel we're
talking back to the processes started
the agent pretty nifty and then of
course you can you can for forgetting
away to sending for talking from the
process that started gauging through the
process that it was running them now
hosts the agents you can of course how
how to just send a callback to the food
initiator and now you have a two-way
communication link Oh code mm not this
code other code
Kovach agent so this is coded bus that
and a few more things the main thing
here is the inject into that's why pick
them here's what it does is that it does
the same thing as the as the J console
example I showed it connects to attaches
to a virtual machine then deploys an
agent to it
why do here is I load the agent by
getting the jar file of it and then
serializing it right yep the jar file
that contains the agent closest and I
get the serialized version of the agent
and I send it to it
that's my API sterilize same basics for
a code encoding and serializing is of
course a simple white Arabic and binary
object output stream wrapped in a object
output stream
so I write in my objecting that get a
battery simple but what is it I actually
serialize but this agent is something
that contains other sliced objects
actually a stubborn an invoker so this
is very generic white this is a library
that you can pick up and use on your own
it's available on the Internet's on my
github account you can play with this if
you want to so what do you do here is
you have a you create a callback agent
you give it a callback which is
something that he spends a the RMI
remote interface and then a callback
invoker which is just an interface that
invokes the callback then it gets a few
objects from the from the target VM you
can use like the instrumentation and
also something that's gonna safe because
I like to live on with unsafe
so what happens is that you it calls the
agent and then in the agent name here we
deserialize the agent and we load with
the instrumentation so yep
you see realize the agent so we packed
two things into the same model you can
see your license together deserialize it
get the callback and evoker and then
just invoke the the callback in the new
target VM and that gives you that is a
generic way this generic code I wrote
for deploying your own are my interface
into a separate VM so you can have your
your code in the invoker you can do
whatever you want to get whatever states
from the target VM you want and pass it
into to the callback of your choice I
mentioned that I was going to look at
the debug interface here's something
that I built using the debug interface
so I had a problem once thank you this
in treatment I had we had some some
issues so it was an average a the
database that I'm working on has been
around was built in 2001 first they've
been working on it since and at some
point we realized that we didn't have
enough test coverage on a few
concurrency cases and the code wasn't
written for opportunity I was this was
before
way before TV was built in-house in 2001
but so external users do things a bit
differently which we need interesting
you use cases and interesting new issues
and many of those are around concurrency
since 2001 what before TDD was very
popular so it doesn't have a full test
car it didn't have full test coverage
and it was a one big monolithic code
base it was I didn't have components I
could break out and and test separately
and is that most tests were done on the
full database it was it was mainly just
in the tester were wearing the code base
where were essentially integration tests
and I wanted to test very specific
concurrency case and I couldn't break
things apart quick enough to actually
get turnaround on the on the issue to
help our customers in time so what I
what I ended up doing was I wrote a test
full integration that could reproduce
the problem and I guess this is what
most people do when doing concurrent
when debugging transparent issues and
then there I of course is certain there
at just covering the current behavior
and then I change the code well right
that's how you do testing many of these
issues are around we're on concurrency
and the thing about concurrency issues
is that the only manifest if all
conditions are just right or wrong as it
may be and so some way we have to
control the internal behavior on the
database in order to get to that right
state for the boat to manifest and
that's hard when you when you've got one
big monolithic code base so what I did
was I used my debugger
set up thousands of knots and lots of
breakpoints and step through in a very
particular order making sure this thread
got that board and that thread gets that
far and then this other thread gets that
for us and now it's in
a weird enough state that if I tell this
thread to progress it's now going to
enter bad states which means that if the
old feds continue things are gonna break
aha it's hard work just remembering all
those steps in in in the right order
it's insane I was sitting with
20-something breakpoints some just four
from making sure that I was at the right
point and then over spec and then a pen
and paper to make sure they were okay
and now I'm here in this state what
should I do now enable this breakpoint
to disable that breakpoint run it was
insane
so what I did right so we this we
reproduce the condition in the debugger
but what if that the bugger was my test
case what if I could automate the work
that I did with my debugger all that
serious stepping through in breakpoints
and so I did I created a J in the test
Runner based on the Java debug interface
so regular J unit test Runner and this
is roughly what it looks like in the
near four Dakota but if I started
breaking this out into its own separate
library so the second generation of this
is code it looks a lot nicer now but so
this is what it looks like in every day
it's normal J in the test cases but the
twist is that they execute in a
subprocess
so the actual test case is these methods
execute in a sub process that I've
attached a debugger to or that hosts
processes attached there and automated
debugging soon another host process run
handlers for breakpoints in in that code
so that's essentially what a test case
would look for it could look like and
that solve the immediate problem for us
and that we had to quickly within days
find and reproduce fix an issue make
sure that that we had fixed the
concurrency issue ship it to customers
in just a few days so no time to refresh
through the entire code base to allow
for proper testing and it worked so that
was one thing that I thought could be
useful to share with people so I wrote a
library for that I published publishing
that as as an open source library for
everyone to use and the API looks a
little more like this now which I
believe is a bit simpler unfortunately
not everything is ported yet so it
doesn't their period case it doesn't
quite work these with these break points
yeah so what you say is I have a regular
year in the test case and I say that I
want this to run in the sub process with
the sub process test runner then you say
you just have your test code as usual
then you say I wanted to bug this
there's no pointer I wanted to bug this
using the breakpoints defined in some
class I need to find break points by
specifying that this method is a handler
for and then specification of the break
points and the so far I've found that
it's good enough to only to be it's good
enough to be able to break point on
method entry and method exit I don't
really I haven't really had the need to
to break on a specific line in the code
I've used because I a specific line
usually it's the entry to some other
method so I can just break point on the
entry about method instead so that codes
available on github as well
now use this library that I published
there for testing all the other code
that I've written here it turns out the
testing things in a subprocess I
particularly controlled sub-process is
useful even if you don't have the need
to debug it testing things in a
subprocess and specifying parameters for
the process like I want to run in an
environment that has a very particular
memory setting it's also use also useful
so some process test runner is quite a
useful thing I think next cool thing
this is where it starts to get really
scary and I should have mentioned that
so this is so far it's been 100% pure
Java from now on it's going to be 100%
unpure Java so there are few things you
can do in the JDK and it's still
standard JDK ap ice they're just not in
Java so a few cool things that you can
do if you venture outside of the comfort
zone of Java managed code and the JVM TI
interface is one of those API s-- that
is it's actually a C API for the for the
JVM and standardized supported by all
JDK vendors it has some pretty cool
abilities so you can you can do you can
in walk the heat by following references
you can start a root object and follow
references kind of like the same thing I
said garbage collector does and in fact
in in open JDK and I guess hotspot as
well because they're essentially the
same code base
this actually piggybacks on the same
thing as the same code path thus the
garbage collector uses there's also the
ability for tidying up the pieces also
incidentally what the garbage collector
does mark-and-sweep
garbage collector is to do exactly that
they tag objects and and discard the
abuse turn are intact so you have to be
able to the for reference
Stiga objects try classes but also the
ability to collect all five classes so I
can say give me all the objects that
I've tagged with a particular tag in a
enlist or iterate through all reachable
objects in the entire heap or iterate
through all objects in the entire heat
regardless of whether they were
reachable or not so you can actually get
two dead objects through this API and
you can iterate through instances of a
particular class like all instances of
runnable for example or all instances of
string in your entire heap and of course
the same things is you can do with with
the Java line instrument getting object
size and getting also getting more
object monitored usage I have some polls
demo for this I think I do I have the
first case for this I can show you so
what this does is boringly it gets all
instances of the tests class itself and
then inserts it gets this it's the same
way of testing that this works and not
very interesting what's more interesting
is for example getting all runnable x'
then get all instances of java.lang
runnable in the in this JVM which is
kind of cool and I can do this with any
class so I've created this API call that
I call tooling interface which is
essentially a Java representation of the
JVM ti so TI is for tooling interface
which is why I call this cost to
interface
so this this is pretty a pretty simple
guide on the Java level all it does is
it just hands up to some C code just
stands up to the C code some native code
implement in J and I the cost of gbmt IJ
v mt is an extension of the j and i you
never thought you'd hear someone talk
about J and I and 2012 video so this
allows me to to walk to even get all on
instances of this object and actually
the C code for this isn't that horrible
either all it does is that he uses this
JVM TI interface for iterates over
instances of class so iterate over the
heap give me call this callback method
here called tag object for all instances
of class that I specified and what the
tag objects callback does is just that
it sets the tag on the instance and then
after that's what I do is I get all
objects with tigereye specified and then
I create a Java array after that so so
up to this point C this section is JVM
VI then the rest is just regular J and I
for creating an array and populating it
with with the obvious I found
so that's pretty cool what's even more
interesting that you can do with the JVM
CI interface and what got me into
looking at the AVM try in the first
place it's the ability to introspect the
the call frames of a running method so I
was five years ago that was that I first
looked at this I was working on a
project called - just say an
implementation of the Python programming
language for the JVM and one of the
biggest overheads there is managing call
frames because Python has this nasty
ability to that lets you in inspect any
call frame and getting the local
variables
Wi-Fi by telling telling you what's with
the name of them is by it as a string do
it for any old method and managing extra
call frames on the heap is quite a big
overhead in Gotham so I wanted to look
at is there any ability that I can use
the actual JVM internals for getting to
this and so I did I talked to I talked
to one of the JVM developers who said
well just you can just drop down to ten
native code write an extension for for
the JVM build your own custom JVM and do
it through there I was like oh that's
gonna be a mess to deploy I don't need
to I don't want to maintain my own JVM
version so found JVM ti and found that
they've had some abilities to do frame
introspection which meant that I could
do this as a regular dynamically loaded
J&amp;amp;I library so I did
so create a job API for accessing the
live call frames or the current thread
could be extended to other threads as
well but so far only to the current fed
and forgetting forgetting for
introspecting the live call prints and
this builds on the frame introspection
abilities on the jib in time which
allows you to get the method but that is
executing in that kaprun get the
bytecode of that method get the offsets
in that bytecode where where the JVM is
currently executing you can pop the
frame and rerun the method popping the
frame means go one step up in the call
stack to just before you enter this
sculpt ring you can also and this is the
interesting part get the get local
variables from a from the call stack
from the from a frame and set the local
variables you can also register a an
event hook in the JVM sky interface for
for getting a callback when the when the
frame is popped through through normal
means so when it exits through a return
or throw so forcing a pop frame does not
trigger that event so I don't use
forcing problem and getting that
notification is actually quite crucial
for knowing whether whether reified call
frame objects in my Java library is live
or not so whether it should it it could
go down to the to the underlying call
frame and gifts get obvious from there
or whether that call frame is no longer
available again this case for this
so here's the first discus I wrote for
that she taxes live call frame of
current method so it defines a bunch of
local variables of various types because
I want to make sure that I can get to
all of those different types and I get
the call frame a depth zero so I get the
current call frame and then I I assert
that if I get the local variable a from
from the frame it is equal to the local
variable a but also if I change a I
should still get the same the new
changed value from from my refile call
frame objects and this case work or do I
have to run it no it doesn't work when
running through the ID because it has to
load the agent and where various weird
ways the capture is running thank you
runs from the command line the code for
this is slightly more involved than the
code for for walking the heat the
actually most of this C file on weighs
in at just under a thousand lines of
code is is for managing call frames but
we can look at the the Java side of
things is actually quite simple
yeah so for for those for managing
whether a frame is LIBOR not all I do is
I have this callback in the in the
native code in the JVM sky but when the
frame you gets popped when the frame is
exited I get this callback and then I
call them to Java again
and say hey if you have a frame object
to refi frame are we for this please
make it please kill it it's not live
anymore it's just a simple manager for
this can push frames and paw prints no
and really since I don't really care
about the pony for this I'm just
implemented it as a simple hash map
that's also available in my github
account this is where it gets really
cool putting all these things together
and running a live a this javascript
engine attached to another process with
the ability to do all these kinds of
introspection if I here I have a Java
process running and C process ID here
we can attach a remote shelf to that
it's gonna rebuild because I when
developing I like to have scripts to do
the full rebuild so I always have the
latest write the succeeded and now I
have a remote show connection for this
so here I can do this is just regular
JavaScript let's copy its property let's
go and bootstrapping create a connection
Wow look at that
something happened let's start this with
some property
now
that's why I rebuilt
okay so it's running that's my new
process ID you just uncommon this there
get proper you get could get the
property from the remotes p.m. so I have
this VM running here and I've got a
another JV I'm running here which is
running a script engine that's connected
to to this VM for the script and it's
actually running in this process but I
use the script engine from this process
which is kind of useful for debugging
live systems but have a system running
live in production and I need to look at
some of the state of it that's also
available on github there as interest
rate from this builds on on all these
other libraries anything else you'd like
to look at here questions yes yeah
okay so what's the overhead of using
decisive method to get the silent object
because if you have a large heap and you
want to get an accurate view of the heap
usage you shoot for example do that by
dragging through all and getting this I
sob I would say that the main overhead
there would be iterating over the heat
getting the size of a object is it's not
that expensive but it's not something
quite quite often you don't want to do
you don't really want to have a an agent
running in your live code you don't want
to depend on having that so I what I do
what I use decisive method for is for
verifying that my pre computed sizes are
correct so I have where I need to know
the size of an obvious or knowing how to
how much of a heap I'm using I have data
structures that keep track of but Adam I
didn't removed from a counter of what
the current sizes and each object knows
its own size and I can just be a static
aside field on that and then in my test
cases I verify that that field is
actually the same value as if I would to
would get the size with the size of
method down there
so if you do kind of stuff like this are
there any special security concerns this
is completely insecure
the only things I've done to secure it a
bit is that I do shake on that
tooling interface the get tooling
interface method actually shakes the
security manager to verify that you have
permission that's all I do
really just to make sure that you can
install a security manager that doesn't
allow you to use this interface but of
course using it is completely at your
own risk and completely insecure however
it is not I I have made since I just
like playing with things I have made
that check impossible to circumvent
which is not the case for son Mis gun
safe with son miss Gunn save it is
actually possible to get the the unsafe
instance by by just using regular
reflection if you if your security
manager permits commits to reflection
and there are security holes that allows
you to use reflection in any and
imaginable case what are you what I've
done this that I actually stored the
reference to the instance of the swing
interface in C code so it's not
accessible through the reflection ten
minutes so okay but we're in QA so it
doesn't matter
excuse me
is what working on another machine so
the hard part with remote processes is
how do I inject into the VM so so the
the agent attached api's our VM local
are our four local machine because it
uses so what it actually uses for for
attaching to to a vm is a shared memory
buffer that all JVMs share so that's how
it finds out how to get into and inject
the agent so that's not possible over
over a network but what you could do is
of course have a small process running
on on a host where you could go through
that process and say hey can you inject
into the other VMs on on my behalf and
then in person since our Maya will work
over the network that of course again is
completely unsafe if you do open up
holes in in your security like that you
you've gotta have holes in your security
but it's fun and for for debugging
purposes you often are on the same local
machine and that's what I use this this
stuff for what did you want to look at
it on this light yeah so here's the
links to through the code samples there
are they're all under my github account
but here's references to the API
documentation of da guys that I've used
so when building this stuff I I was
constantly flipping through the JVM
tooling interface documentation as well
as the j'ni documentation even if I
you're gonna hate me for this but I
actually like Jay and I I think I'm one
no ma it might be the only person in the
world who likes Jane I but even if I do
like it I I don't use it that often so I
don't remember all of it so having these
resources available when building this
stuff was what's crucial and also from
reading this these api's I found it
would be possible to forget call frames
of of other threads than the local
thread as well we just have to suspend
those threads file accessing them which
is a bit of a pain and I haven't done
that yes yeah it's the same case that
shared memory buffer that I mentioned is
so UNIX systems don't permit you to
share memory between different users
that's why so you can't inject an agent
into a JVM running as a different user
so that's that's really good actually
because that means that even if we just
do screw up our security in in the JVM
in these ways we can still rely on UNIX
security to to save our back yes
license I haven't decided on license
well I was thinking something very
permissive bike MIT license maybe I
really disliked the the apache license
because it's for some reason it's become
like a seal of bad quality i really have
a beef with the patching i hate them if
you're with apache
fight me later
anything else thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
