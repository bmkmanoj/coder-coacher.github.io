Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series and is focused on chargeback
which is a new feature in Enterprise
Manager 12c the videos are playable to
chargeback 12 104 if you're on an
earlier version of chargeback you should
consider upgrading using self update
chargeback uses Enterprise Manager
monitoring and configuration information
to provide metering of Enterprise
Manager targets an assignment of costs
to metered resources so that usage in
charge reports can be provided to cost
centers
this puts consumers in control of their
IT costs as by changing their behavior
and moderating their use of resources
they're able to lower their IT charges
chargebacks are fully integrated into
Enterprise Manager 12c the chargeback
feature within Enterprise Manager can be
accessed by navigating to Enterprise
chargeback from the enterprise manager
global menu the chargeback home page
enables the chargeback administrator to
see setup information and high-level
usage in charge details the bottom-left
panel helps in the setup and ongoing
maintenance of chargeback and the bottom
right displays summary information
related to charge plans cost centers and
charge back targets in order to start
using chargeback the chargeback
administrator needs to do a small amount
of configuration first of all they need
to define the rates that will be charged
for various resources the simplest way
to use chargeback is with the universal
charge plan this enables the
administrator to set the race for three
Universal metrics CPU memory and storage
this charge plan can subsequently be
applied to any target type within the
chargeback application once the rates
for these resources have been set the
administrator can define the cost Center
hierarchy for their organization the
cost Center hierarchy can be sent up
manually by creating a set of parent
cost centers and then creating children
under each parent these call centers are
used for assignment of charges and
report aggregation and roll-ups here I'm
creating a new child call center called
olguin a under the org wan parent it may
be that you have a call center hierarchy
already defined in an LDAP server in
which case you can automatically import
it into the chargeback application by
specifying details of your LDAP server
once the charge plans and cost centers
have been set up
enabling charge back on enterprise
manager targets is very simple to bring
targets into the chargeback application
simply navigate to the targets tab and
click on add targets here I can select
the targets that I'd like to add to
charge back in this case I'm adding a
database target
on the next screen we can specify
whether the target
shared between multiple cost centers or
dedicated to a single cost center only
this is a dedicated target meaning all
charges for the target are assigned to a
single cost center the final step is to
specify which plan should be used to
calculate the charges and which costs
enter the target belongs to I'm going to
put my database on the universal charge
plan and assign it to the org one a cost
center from this point on a daily job
will extract information from the
enterprise manager tables for this
target and will calculate the charges
based on the assigned plan chargeback is
really all about reporting so that users
can understand how their usage of IT
resources affects what they get charged
the chargeback administrator can view
summary and trending reports for usage
in charge from the reports tab
the summary report shows a breakdown of
charge and resource usage by cost center
target type and resource the trending
report can be used to track the charges
and resource usage over time this can be
used by the IT department for planning
purposes for instance here we're viewing
the CPU trend over a number of days in
the detail section various different
roll-ups of the information are
available as well as filters from here
it's possible to export the data to
excel it's also possible to access these
reports from bi publisher this means
they can be delivered to users in PDF
Word Excel PowerPoint or HTML format bi
publisher can also deliver these reports
on a scheduled basis chargeback
information is also available to
enterprise manager self-service users in
the self-service portal as we've shown a
universal charge plan can be used to
charge for CPU memory and storage the
universal plan can be applied to any
type of target in chargeback there may
be cases where the chargeback
administrator wants to apply some target
specific charges for example a charge
for a particular OS on a host or charge
for a database option for charges that
apply only to a particular type of
target an extended charge plan can be
used here we've created an extended
charge plan that contains rates
for Oracle databases WebLogic servers
and hosts the database is on this plan
will have a base charge of 200 dollars
per month and an additional charge of
$50 for the partitioning option they're
charged at the universal rate for CPU
and memory and at twice the universal
rate for storage hosts on this plan will
be charged at the universal rate for CPU
memory and storage in addition as a base
charge of $100 per month and a further
$50 per month for Linux OS the WebLogic
servers on this plan will be charged at
a rate of $300 per month plus an
additional one hundredth of a cent for
each user request processed there are no
charges for CPU and memory for WebLogic
servers on this plan
