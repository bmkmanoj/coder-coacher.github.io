in this video we'll demonstrate the
steps required to setup and configure
schema as a service this is a new
feature included in Enterprise Manager
12c database as a service schema as a
service allows users to consolidate
multiple applications in a pool of
shared databases each application user
gets access to their own database
service and one or more database schemas
typically there are three challenges
with consolidating multiple applications
in a database these are data isolation
resource isolation and security
Enterprise Manager provides a framework
to address all these concerns using
quotas retirement policies and
chargeback plans administrators can
enforce governance of how resources are
being used the CPU usage can be
controlled via database resource manager
while for additional security the use of
data vault can be enabled customers
using this framework can not only save
on resources via this ultimate scheme of
consolidation but they also minimize
their administrative overhead and need
for compliance additional improvement in
efficiency can we achieve due to
automated provisioning and
de-provisioning of resources now let's
dive into the product we are now looking
at the Enterprise Manager console all
actions in this video are performed by a
single user called DB cloud underscore
admin this user has the e/m cloud
administrator role assigned to it the
setup process starts with the creation
of Baz infrastructure zone to do this go
to enterprise cloud
middleware and database home app as
infrastructure zone or zone for short is
used to organize cloud resources either
by geography that is east coast or west
coast or by function there is sales
product management development or by
life cycle of the application which is
development stage and production click
on the number against the path
infrastructure zones label this will
display a list of all the zones in the
system let's look at a zone a zone
starts with the meaningful name and
description this is important since the
zone would be exposed to the
self-service user next we define the
placement policy constraints these
constraints provide a fill factor for
all the hosts that are part of the zone
so no data bases will be placed in this
zone if the the constraints of CPU and
memory have been exceeded next we select
the targets or the hosts that would be
part of this zone click on the test
credential button to verify the selected
credentials the visibility of this zone
can be restricted to a set of
self-service users this is done by using
roles finally review the settings and
click Submit for the remaining steps we
go to setup cloud database
this page lists all the steps that are
required to complete our schema as a
service setup first up we start by
creating database pools database pools
are a collection of databases that would
be used to host our schema as a service
offering to create a new database pool
go to create and choose the option for
schema so let's look at a pool a pool
has a meaningful name and description
pools are purpose-built and they utilize
a portion of the resources available to
the zone all members of a pool are
required to be homogeneous homogeneity
is controlled by the target type which
is either clustered database or a single
instance database the platform and the
version of the database software
homogeneity ensures provisioning
consistency once the target filters have
been selected you can choose to add
multiple databases additionally provide
the credentials to the Oracle home and
the credentials to the database for
operations like data pump export and
import system beer privileges are
required for these databases next we
provide placement constraints now these
placement constraints are used to stage
database schemas and services within a
pool of shared databases the placement
policy can be of two types first a
simple which is essentially the maximum
number of database services that you
wish to deploy in this database second
workload based in this option we look at
the CPU and memory allocation for each
workload that is placed in this database
to guarantee CPU usage you can also
enable resource manager for these
databases click Submit to complete the
wizard next we look at request settings
there are three kinds future reservation
request archive retention and the
duration of the request next we
configure quotas now quota is assigned
to each and every self-service user the
quota assignment is done at a roll level
and any user who inherits this role also
inherits the quota attributes for
example in this case we have a sign 10
gigabytes of memory 20 gigabytes of
storage the user is allowed to create 3
database requests and 20 schema service
requests next we look at profiles and
service templates a service template is
a standardized service definition in
this case it defines the workload
characteristics and the schema details a
service template can be generated with
or without seed data to create a service
template with seed data we need to
capture the information that is required
this is done by using profiles profile
is a mechanism to capture interesting
bits of information from a source
database to create a profile click on
the create button and select the source
database
there are two options one is to export
the schema with data contents or second
to export just the definition and not
the data disable the option to export
Oracle home next we provide the
credentials required to connect to this
database we need the credentials for the
Oracle home and sisty ba credentials to
the
database a list of all schemas available
in the database are listed select the
appropriate one select the degree of
parallelism for the data pump export job
provide a dump location with the
appropriate size and a location for the
log along with a meaningful name
finally provide a meaningful name and
location for the profile this will be
required when creating a service
template and review the summary and
click Submit on clicking submit a data
pump export job will be submitted for
this demo we'll use an existing profile
for the rest of the demo we'll make user
profile called schema SOE profile now
let's create a service template using
this profile to create a service
template click on the create button and
choose for schema in this case we look
at an existing service template a
service template requires a meaningful
name and description
a collection of service templates form
the service catalog which are exposed to
the self-service user in this case we
plan to create a service template with
seed data
hence we'll use the second option which
is import schemas from profile select
the relevant schema profile nominate a
master account next we define certain
workload sizes workload represents the
expected CPU memory and storage
requirements for each service you can
define small medium large sizes for your
workload next we define the privileges
required to create the master account a
new role is created in the database for
every request next define the tablespace
details like initial size auto extent
and the increment size finally the
maximum size can either will be left to
unlimited or can be limited to the size
specified by the workload
custom actions can be performed by
plugging pre or post schema creation
scripts next we map these service
templates to the zone and the pool that
can serve them since the data pump
export was done on the source database
it is important to stage the export dump
files on a shared location that is
mounted on all hosts or database servers
that are part of this database pool
finally the visibility of the service
template can be limited to a certain
class of users this is done via the use
of roles review the summary and click
Submit the final step is to configure
chargeback this is covered in a separate
video this concludes the setup required
to enable schema as a service thank you
