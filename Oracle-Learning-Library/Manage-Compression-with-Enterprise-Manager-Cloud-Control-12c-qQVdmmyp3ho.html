Manager cloud control 12c demonstration
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum in
this video I'll show you what's new with
compression in Enterprise Manager cloud
controller release 3 and I will go
through the steps outlined in the slide
navigate to the compression homepage
which shows you compression and
information on the database level if you
have more than 100 table spaces in your
database
it takes the top 100 by size the summary
section shows you the total size of the
database the segment count and the total
number of segments compressed raishin
and the number of compressed and
uncompressed segments on the right you
see the space usage for the entire
database by compression type so there
are 4 shunt charts that show the
different types of compression that
apply to each category such as that the
tables can be compressed in six
different types and when there is no
compression none is chosen the indexes
have three different compression types
lob the large objects in dbfs the
database file system have also each
three compression types let's look at
the bottom part of the screen
the compression advice area is a summary
of what you receive from the nightly run
of the segment advisor by nightly run I
mean the activities in the maintenance
Windom so here it shows you the number
of segments for which there is
compression advice the ratios and then
the size before and after compression in
the potential savings that you could
achieve the top of the page gives you an
overview over the entire database and
now in this section on the bottom right
you see the breakdown by tablespace you
see the size
the tables piece how much is compressed
the compressed and uncompressed size now
I select the tablespace and click show
compression details to drill down
further the layout and functionality of
this page is very similar to the
database level one only now we look at
one tablespace and here in this section
with see the details the tables that I
in this tablespace notepad forecast
adjusting it a little select a table
that you wish to analyze and click
estimate compression ratio select or
enter a tablespace type and choose the
type of compression advanced in our
example then provide a job integer
description belief the scheduling
information is is and now scroll down
here you see the database credentials
and the host credentials they are the
ones that we want to use so we click OK
we receive a confirmation that the job
has been successfully submitted to view
the job select Oracle database job
activity and here you see the job that
it succeeded you can select the job and
show the details the output log shows
you various values comparing compressed
and uncompressed data typically
organizations can expect to reduce their
storage space consumption by a factor of
2 to 4 when they're using advanced row
compression so that means that the
amount of uncompressed data will be 2 or
4 times larger than the amount of
compressed data so the ratio here of 6.2
is a very good ratio indeed return to
the compression homepage we drill down
to the tablespace and then the table
select the table in compress and the
editable page scroll down to the
compression options and in this example
we are using the OLTP compression
we also want to move the existing data
in the table so we live select this as
well and for those who are interested in
sequel The Show sequel shows you the
commands click return and we want to
apply it so the table has been
successfully modified let's view the
results you see now on this screen that
it the table takes only three megabytes
and uses the advanced compression so
here's the summary of the video that you
just saw thanks for watching this
