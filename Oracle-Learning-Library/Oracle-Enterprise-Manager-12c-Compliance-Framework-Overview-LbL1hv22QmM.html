Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series Oracle Enterprise Manager
12c allows users to quickly and easily
validate their targets against industry
best practices Oracle recommendations
and internal best practices as well by
using the all-new compliance standard
framework here we're in the compliance
library and we can see the hierarchy of
compliance objects that is a compliance
framework can contain one or more
compliance standards and a compliance
standard contains one or more compliance
standard rules and if it's real time the
compliance standard rule can contain one
or more real-time monitoring facets
likewise from a reusability standpoint a
compliance standard rule can be a member
of one or more standards and the
standard can be a member of one or more
compliance frameworks a compliance rule
is nothing more than a single validation
of a particular configuration setting or
property that's specific to a particular
target type and is responsible for
reporting violations of that validation
of that rule the ones with the padlocks
or anything with a padlock on left-hand
side our Oracle provided and shipped and
there are thousands shipped out of the
box and users can simply use these
directly or they can create like and
modify them to tailor them to meet their
needs in their specific environment
there are three types of rules in
enterprise manager 12c there are
repository rules which validate data
against data in the database enterprise
manager database there are real-time
rules that monitor in real time and
weblogic signature rules which are the
integration of the be a garden
in health checks in this view that we're
just going to focus on the use of the
repository rules so again a compliance a
standard rule can be a member of one or
more compliance standard but a
compliance standard is essentially a
grouping of compliance standard rules
however it's still applicable to a
single target type and but can contain
one or more compliance standard rules
let's take a look at the inside of one
of these compliance standard rules here
we can see a hierarchy here and it can
supports fol during mechanisms for
organizational purposes and you can see
that this compliance standard that's
called basic security configuration for
oracle database contains a number of
compliance standard or compliance rules
as well a compliance standard is the
only object in the compliance framework
that can be applied to a target instance
so by selecting a particular standard
and clicking on associated targets I
then can have that that compliance
standard and all the rules validated
against the specific target in this case
you can see on the right this target
this compliance standard has been
applied or associated to three targets
and finally just to complete the
hierarchy here we can look at the
framework and here we've created a
corporate compliance Apple compliance
framework the main difference between a
compliance standard and a compliance
framework is that a compliance framework
can contain standards that span target
types so I can have a single compliance
score spanning compliance standards for
our multiple target type so pretty much
for my entire enterprise let's go take a
look at a compliance standard results
and see what we get go to enterprise
compliance results to see the results
here we see a smaller list of compliance
standards because this is the list of
compliance standards to which their
targets have been associated likewise in
the compliance frame
area we would see the same and here we
see just a quick high-level grid of all
the compliance standards the average
compliance score the target evaluations
which means how many targets scored in
the compliance range how many were in
the warning and how many are in the
critical range and then the number of
violations and the reason these counts
can be much higher in the violations is
that a single rule violation can result
in multiple violations so in other words
if something like checking for the
number of open ports below a thousand it
could have more than one violation for a
single rule let's drill into one of
these rules to see what more detail we
can find out about the violations in
this case so as we drill in here if we
click up on the standard we can see that
we get a high level scorecard of the
number of the number of targets that are
and there's their scorecard the rule
evaluations and the numbers that are
compliant than the number that are in
warning and I can view the results
either by target down below apply and
you can see the each of the three
targets and the violations that they had
the number of violations and the last
time that they are evaluated as well as
the results of x compliance standard
rule I can also use the hierarchy on the
left to drill down and see more
information if I click on this for
slogging disabled you can see that the
three targets are below that each have
one violation I also could see trend
overview if this has been applied for a
long time as well as violation events
and when I click on a specific violation
events you can see all of the great
information that i get about this
specific event I not only get the
general information that was available
in the configuration or set up of the
rule itself I can also get recommended
resolution information that Oracle is
offering for these out of the box
compliance standard rules I can also
interact directly with my Oracle support
knowledgebase that searches
automatically for any of these for the
issues related to this compliance
violation and I can see history
these and updates that have been made to
this violation as well so pretty much a
complete knowledge of information at my
fingertips to help me resolve these
violations if we were to quickly look at
the results at the framework level we
could see how we can look across not
only a single target type but multiple
target types to gain a single compliance
score for all of my compliance efforts
for my entire data center and I have a
cliq score here and I can also track
this over time to see how I'm doing
against my compliance standard efforts
thank you for watching this is the end
