Oracle Enterprise Manager 12 sees
business-driven application management
capabilities can manage fusion
applications on Oracle engineered
systems from applications to disk
applications power many critical
business services so it's very important
that I t manage those applications from
a business perspective here we see the
new SLA dashboard for business services
which is a new feature in enterprise
manager 12c it allows us to define
monitor and manage SLA s what we see
here is that there are several SLA s
defined and at least one of them is
having a problem down below we can see
that this service level agreement
consists of several service level
objectives which can either be
performance-based or availability based
in this case the contract created
service level objectives seems to have
been violated drilling down we can see
that the contract created per our
business KPI has fallen below the
minimum acceptable threshold so clearly
we have a business problem let's see how
Enterprise Manager can help address that
first I'm going to look at the
application topology which provides a
nice visual way for me to assess what's
going on in my environment here we see
that the CRM service is running off of
the fusion CRM product family the
product family in turn consists of
several products and components as
indicated by the red x's and the yellow
warning sign we have quite a few issues
in this environment my main objective
right now is to go and fix the SLA
violation to do that I need a quick way
to ascertain which of these problems is
the root cause of the SLA violation I'm
going to drill down into the incident in
the guided resolution section Enterprise
Manager is offering to analyze the
problem so to summarize so far we have
one place to manage all the way from a
business level KPI down to the
infrastructure and then use a guided
resolution we're going to automatically
correlate figure out the root cause of
the problem and corrected this is
possible only because we understand the
entire stack underneath it so let's see
what enterprise manager tells us in this
case
here we can see the business KPI trend
as well as correlated metrics from the
underlying infrastructure at a quick
glance I can see there's something very
interesting the contracts created / our
first spiked and then it plunged request
permitted have doubled and so have
active sessions as well as the request
processing time this clearly tells me
that the system is overloaded it looks
like a lot of people are trying to
create contracts so we have a capacity
problem in order to address that I'm
going to use the provision automation
capabilities of enterprise manager
fusion applications are very
sophisticated it has multiple components
there are complex dependencies and
associations to manually keep track of
those associations and try to figure out
which components to scale out can often
be a huge challenge however Enterprise
Manager can solve that problem for us we
can see that enterprise contracts
depends on the contract management
application module which in turn depends
on the contract management cluster so
that's the cluster I need to scale out
I'm going to do that now I'm asked about
credentials which are all predefined and
I can pick a server since we're running
on exalogic we have ample capacity so
I'll add this server and I will apply
this and my scale out is now in progress
let's go back to the topology viewer as
you can see here a new server has been
added as indicated by the clock sign
hopefully very soon it will get
completed and if we wait for a few
seconds we'll see that the incident
which violated the SLA has now
disappeared in this demonstration we
showed you centralized business-driven
application management we managed
business key performance indicators we
drill down through the technology
infrastructure to identify problems we
quickly and easily correlated and
identified root cause of those problems
and we leveraged guided resolution to
fix the problems thank you for watching
this demonstration
