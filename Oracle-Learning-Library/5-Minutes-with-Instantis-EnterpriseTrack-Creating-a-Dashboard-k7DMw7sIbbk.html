hi I'm John of the Oracle Primavera
curriculum team today I'm going to show
you how to create dashboards using
Oracle and stands as enterprise track if
you've ever thought about creating a
dashboard but were afraid it would be
too confusing or complicated you'll want
to watch
hey we all love dashboards they provide
a real-time interactive view of project
data in a graphical format that's easy
to grasp today we're going to create
this dashboard begin by clicking the
manage dashboards icon in the upper
right corner the manage dashboards page
opens it's divided into three panes the
tree pane the list pane and the details
pane their youths will become clear as
we create the dashboard now you can only
create dashboards in your my dashboards
folder so begin by clicking my
dashboards in the tree pane then click
the add' icon in the details pane type a
dashboard title we'll call this one my
new dashboard then click the Save icon
click the Edit icon and the sharing tab
to specify sharing options when you're
finished with a sharing tab click the
Save icon
okay next task is to create the
dashboard layout click the Edit icon on
the list pane header the layout grid
opens select a category and a
subcategory and then scroll through the
dashboard component templates select a
template and drag it onto the layout
grid let's select another subcategory
and drag a second template onto the grid
use a green box in the lower right
corner of each template to resize the
templates as desired
when you're finished click Save layout
back on the manage dashboards page of
two components are now displayed in the
list pane click done to check the layout
click the manage dashboards icon in the
list pane select project bubble chart
then click the edit icon on the details
pane header in the component display
title field type a title for the bubble
chart we'll call this project analysis
next click the filter tab click the
maximize icon and scroll through the
available filters to set which filters
will be visible to users which filters
they'll be able to edit and which
filters will be in line
for the inline filters you want to
select just a small subset of the
available filters in order to be able to
quickly change the data displayed the
editable filters will still be available
for use when you're finished setting the
filters click the Save icon click the
restore icon and then click done to
check on the progress of the dashboard
okay it's coming along but we need to
change your labels on the horizontal
axis which we can do right from here
click the Edit filters and display
options icon on the project analysis
header the Edit dashboard component
settings window contains the same filter
general display and chart display
options available on the manage
dashboards page except that the filter
tab contains only the filters you
configured you can always go back to the
manage dashboards page and reconfigure
the filters click the general display
options tab this tab controls static
display elements such as type fonts and
labels scroll down to the bottom tick
section and change the angle from 90 to
30 click Save okay the bubble chart
looks pretty good
click the inline filters icon to quickly
change your data display
okay repeat the process with the other
component chart click the edit filters
and display options icon on the filter
tab let's show planned and locked
finances to date and a chart frequency
of monthly on the general display
options tab let's mark the disable
header checkbox since the header is the
same as a component display title and
let's change the angle of the bottom
ticks when you're finished click Save as
with anything the more you do it the
easier becomes so practice creating a
few dashboards and experimenting with
the options on the various tabs or copy
a shared or global dashboard to your my
dashboards folder and view the option
settings on the various tabs soon you'll
be able to create dashboards with
multiple elements in well as little as
five minutes
