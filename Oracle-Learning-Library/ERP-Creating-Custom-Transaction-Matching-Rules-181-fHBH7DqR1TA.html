would want to create a custom matching
rule and how to do it step by step to
give you some context for this video
when you import a bank or credit card
statement file internet suite
the intelligent transaction matching
feature automatically matches the
imported statement transactions with the
GL transactions in NetSuite NetSuite
identifies matches by running the system
default rules no default rules cannot be
modified but they can be deactivated
after observing how many transactions
are matched by the system rules and how
many are left to match manually you
might start to notice some patterns and
want to create some of your own custom
matching rules so let's see an example
of how to create a custom transaction
matching rule with multiple conditions
in this scenario I want to make a rule
that will automatically match
transaction IDs to IDs in memos ignoring
any prefixes like leading zeros or
letters and the transaction date within
two previous days I also want the
amounts to match and I want this rule to
run for all accounts except for the
payroll account so we begin by going to
the reconciliation matching rules page
go to transactions bank reconciliation
matching rules here you see the current
list of much in rules so far I only have
the default rules and no custom rules
yet to create a new custom rule click
new rule under the custom rules heading
the custom matching rule window pops up
there are two sub taps accounts and
rural conditions the account sub tap is
open by default this is where we're
going to specify the accounts on which
our rule will run and on the conditions
tab we will define all the conditions
for our rule in the custom rule name
field enter match on memo and dates
within two previous days I want to make
my rule name as descriptive as I can in
the open account sub tab none of the
accounts are selected yet I want this
rule to run for all accounts a
set the payroll account so I checked the
box in the column header to include all
the accounts and then clear the box for
the payroll account role I can switch
from viewing a list of all accounts to
only included accounts by clicking show
included only note you can also filter
the list by account type here for
example if I select credit card only
credit card account types show up in the
list to start specifying conditions for
the rule I click on the rule condition
sub tab the first row in the grid is
going to be the first condition for my
rule keep in mind that all custom rules
will automatically include the criteria
to match on equal amounts or the amount
sum by default so I don't need to
specify that condition here from the
transaction type list I could specify a
transaction type but I'm going to select
all imported my selection here will
determine which options are available in
the primary field and the other
transaction type lists it also restricts
what you can select in this list for any
additional condition lines below
remember I want this rule to match the
transaction ID from imported
transactions to the IDS in memos from
NetSuite transactions so from the
primary field list I select transaction
ID this further filters the options that
are available from the rest of the
fields as we make selections the
description automatically updates from
the operator list I select equals ignore
prefix I want the system to disregard
any zeros spaces or letters that might
be in front of the number in the memo so
for example if the transaction ID is 1 2
3 and the number in the memo field is N
1 2 3 or has other text in front of it
NetSuite still makes the match notice
that because I selected all imported
transactions is the first type the
system automatically selects all
NetSuite in the other transaction type
list on the other side it's the only
option in the list
from the compare field I select memo I'm
now finished with my first condition
line in the description at the top is
updated accordingly I want to create a
second condition for this rule so I
click the Add icon ok now you can see
that there is a second row and a system
is still update in the description the
transaction type options are restricted
based on why I'd select first in the
previous condition row I'm going to
select all imported again from the
primary field list I select date again
this selection determines the options
are available in the rest of the fields
I want to specify a date range for my
match so from the operator list I select
within X previous days off with this
option a matching date can be the same
as or up to the specified number of days
before the other date so I've selected
an operator that requires a value
because I want my rule to match
transactions on date within two previous
days I enter two in the value field
notice again that because I've selected
all imported is the first type the
system automatically selects all
NetSuite in the other transaction type
list on the other side it's the only
option in the list also because I
selected date and within X previous days
the system automatically selects date in
the compare field for me and I'll finish
with my second and last condition line
now that I'm done creating my rule
conditions I click Save now I can see my
new rule on the page under custom rules
NetSuite always runs the active system
rules first in the order that you see
here then
NetSuite runs my custom rules in the
order in which they appear I can create
more custom rules and then drag and drop
the rules in this list to specify the
order in which I want NetSuite to run
them
