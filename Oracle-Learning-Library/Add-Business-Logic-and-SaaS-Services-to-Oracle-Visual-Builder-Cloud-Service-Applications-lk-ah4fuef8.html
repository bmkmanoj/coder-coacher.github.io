Now I want to add business logic and SaaS services to the application.
I go back into the development environment
and switch the view to look at the designer
for the business object.
I can see the Expense and Types objects and
I can modify them.
For example I'll add some business logic
to the expense report to check if an expense
item is too costly.
This will happen every time I insert a record.
If I edit the new trigger, I can define a specific flow.
I start with a condition.
In the condition, I check whether the cost
is excessive.
I give it a name.
I define the condition.
I'm using a basic condition here, to check
if the cost is greater than a specific amount.
I choose a hundred dollars as the limit.
I want to define an action if this is the
case.
I set up a name for the action and add the logic.
I can choose from a list of options.
If this item is too costly, the approval field
will be set to TRUE.
I go back to the page designer, and run the
application again.
This time, I create a new expense and I make
it expensive.
This is a lunch with a value greater than
$100.
I choose a type.
Notice I'm not checking the approval field.
I click Save and Close.
In the table that's displayed, the business
logic has been invoked.
The approval field has automatically been
set to true.
This is the implementation of business logic
in the application.
The user interface can scale to show on different
device sizes.
I can tune the look and feel of the application
even further.
For example, I can choose the table and say
that on a phone in portrait mode,
instead of a table, I want to show a list.
I can even eliminate some of the fields from
being shown on a smaller device.
Here I have a short list with a few fields.
If I switch to a bigger device, I can see
the full list of fields in the table.
I go back into the page designer.
Again using the live preview, I go to the
Edit expense page.
I'm adding a field that gets data from an
external service.
In the data designer, I look at the service
catalog.
The service catalog includes a list of services
that were prepopulated from an Oracle SaaS
application and other services.
In this case, I select a service from the
Oracle Human Capital Management System.
This is related to locations.
I choose the location object.
I can choose which field I want to show.
I can choose the authentication type that
I want the application to use.
I just added another source of data to the application.
I can drag a new field into this page and
hook the field up to the new object and a
specific field within it.
This creates a new field in the expense report.
I name the field Location.
I go back to the homepage and run the application.
Again, I edit one of the records.
Now I can choose a location with the values
coming directly from an Oracle SaaS application.
That's how easy it is to extend the application
to use Oracle SaaS information.
Once the application is ready to get tested,
I use this stage to create an instance of
the application that users can test.
Once the tests have passed, I can publish
the application to create a real live instance
of the application that people can use.
That's the development experience with Oracle
Visual Builder Cloud Service.
