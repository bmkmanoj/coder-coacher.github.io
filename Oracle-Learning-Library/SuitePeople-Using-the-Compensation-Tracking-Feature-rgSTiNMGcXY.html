is a great tool to use for tracking
basic wage and salary information for
your employees with this feature you can
save compensation data directly in
NetSuite for your employees on their
employee record in this video I will
show you the basic setup steps required
to track an employee's base wage and if
you are looking to integrate NetSuite
payroll with compensation tracking I'll
be showing you the steps required for
the integration before we get started
you should be aware of the following
prerequisites for using compensation
tracking you will need to have Suite
people available on your account as well
as have the compensation tracking
feature enabled you'll also want to make
sure your administrator has given you a
role in that suite that has access to
the compensation tracking feature and
lastly employee records must be created
in NetSuite I'll now show you how to set
up compensation tracking which involves
entering the salary information for an
employee
I'm at the home page of my NetSuite
account to enter the salary information
for an employee first navigate to lists
employees employees this will display
the employees list page from here click
Edit next to the employee you want to
enter salary information for this will
take you to their employee record scroll
down and click the compensation tracking
sub tab it's important to point out the
compensation fields on the employee
record are supported by the effective
dating feature this means you can make
changes to these fields that are back
dated or future dated to a specific date
first select the currency used for this
employee from the compensation currency
list next select the base wage type
choose from annual salary hourly and
monthly salary and lastly enter the
employees wage in the base wage field
and that's it we've just set up
compensation tracking for this employee
click Save to save your changes
and now I'll go over integrating
NetSuite payroll with compensation
tracking when NetSuite payroll is
integrated with compensation tracking
any updates you make to an employee's
salary or wage information on their
employee record is automatically copied
to NetSuite payroll you have the
flexibility to integrate at any time for
instance you may only want to integrate
once you have loaded salary information
for employees in the demo I'm about to
show you it's assumed that NetSuite
payroll is already implemented on your
account to get started first navigate to
setup payroll setup payroll this will
take you to the setup payroll page if
required select a subsidiary click on
the compensation integration sub tab
check the copy compensation tracking
data to payroll box select a default
salary payroll item and a default wage
payroll item from the drop-down lists
the default payroll items are used when
compensation data is copied to payroll
and when a wage or salary item is not
already associated with the employee or
when the employees base wage type has
changed from salary to hourly to finish
click Save
now that the integration is set up I
want to show you a demo of integration
and action let's enter the salary
information for an employee again and
then see how the data is reflected in
payroll to start navigate to lists
employees employees select an employee
from the employees list page from their
employee record scroll down to the
compensation tracking sub tab you will
notice that when an employee is included
in payroll the compensation currency
automatically defaults to US currency
and cannot be changed from here we'll
select a base wage type for this
employee and enter their base waived
to finish click save now select view
beside the employee that we just entered
compensation information for scroll down
and select the payroll sub tab you'll
see that the information entered on the
compensation tracking sub tab is
automatically copied to the payroll sub
tab and it's that simple to integrate
NetSuite payroll with compensation
tracking thanks for watching this video
I hope that has helped you understand
how to use the compensation tracking
feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
