and ServiceNow applications to
synchronize data such as cases to
incidents or vice versa Oracle
integration cloud service or ICS enables
you to perform this integration and
seamlessly manage your Salesforce cases
from within ServiceNow with a
bi-directional synchronization of case
to incident the integration creates
configuration items from a sales force
cases product the Salesforce case
contact will be synchronized with a
ServiceNow user record for ease of
management similarly ServiceNow can post
updates to the Salesforce case when
changes are made to the related incident
to complete this integration follow
these main tasks create the Salesforce
and ServiceNow connections and I see us
create the integration and set the data
mapping between the previous two
connections save and activate your
integration create a new case in
Salesforce and verify that a new
incident is created in service now based
on the Salesforce case create the
integration between Salesforce and
ServiceNow applications in Oracle
integration cloud service start by
creating a ServiceNow connection by
using the ServiceNow adapter as you
provide the connection name the
identifier is automatically generated
based on that name as a part of the
ServiceNow connection specify the domain
name if it's password protected you'll
also set the credentials for the
connection once the ServiceNow
connection is configured test the
connectivity and verify that it's
successful the ServiceNow connection is
marked as configured it's ready to use
within integrations on the connections
page create another connection this time
use a Salesforce adapter just as before
the identifier is automatically
generated based on the connection name
after the Salesforce connection is being
created configure the connection
properties to the Salesforce endpoint by
using a wisdom file that contains the
endpoint details this wisdom file was
created when configuring the object
outbound message in the Salesforce
system the Salesforce endpoint is
password protected so I add the required
credentials this password is a composite
of the password and security token once
the connection is configured in ICS test
the connectivity and verify that it's
successful the Salesforce connection is
now marked as configured on the designer
page continue with the creation of the
integration between the configured
Salesforce and ServiceNow connections
provide information about the
integration putting a name and an
identifier the integration canvas is
displayed with all the available fully
configured connections start the
integration by setting the Salesforce
connection as the integration source
provide a meaningful name to the
Salesforce endpoint reference because I
want to receive notifications about the
case object I select some of the case
fields from the list I build the field
conditions by setting the reason field
as performance I also want to receive
notifications when the case gets created
so I configure the event notification I
verify my selections for my Salesforce
cloud connection configuration the
configuration summary displays the case
object and its selected fields as well
as the condition to trigger the event
notification the Salesforce connection
appears in the canvas as configured as
the source connection now continue
configuring the integration by using the
configured ServiceNow connection as the
target enter some identifying
information for the ServiceNow endpoint
this time I select the insert operation
because I want to insert an incident I
verify the selected table and operation
in this case incident and insert the
ServiceNow connection appears as the
integration target
I continued mapping the data between
these two connections I map the case
fields from the Salesforce connection to
the incident fields on the ServiceNow
system once the data mapping is complete
save the changes so the integration can
be activated now let's take a look at
the ServiceNow system first I filter the
created incidents from today and verify
that there aren't any results for now
then I create a new case in Salesforce
by using the basic case information and
setting the performance reason so it
triggers the creation of the ServiceNow
incident after the Salesforce case is
saved it triggers an event that creates
an incident and ServiceNow I go back to
the ServiceNow system and filter again
against the recently created incidents a
new incident appears based on the
Salesforce case the integration is
completely configured and synchronized
between the Salesforce and ServiceNow
applications thank you for watching for
