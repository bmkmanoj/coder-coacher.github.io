infrastructure Ravello hi
I understand migrating my data center
applications to the public cloud is very
painful due to re-platforming and re
networking can you recommend a solution
sure Ravello is a cloud service that
enables enterprises to run their VMware
and KVM workloads with data center like
L - networking as is on the public cloud
without any modifications to the VMS
network or storage some of the features
of Ravello are clones in the cloud data
center like networking in the cloud
increased agility geographical reach and
infinite resources
Oracle cloud infrastructure Ravello
cloud platform enables migration free
cloud environments that are high
fidelity clones of complete multimedia
Center workloads as said everything
about the VMS stays the same
the same operating system para
virtualized drivers application settings
network settings VMware tools etc with
Software Defined Networking Ravello
exposes a clean isolated l to network
environment for the users application
enterprise's can create any network
topology that their application needs on
Ravello in addition the fenced network
enables l to constructs such as VLANs
multicast broadcast etc between guests
and from the internet that might not be
supported natively on the underlying
clouds with the increased agility that
Ravello offers provisioning time can be
reduced from weeks to minutes you can
deploy exact replicas of any environment
on demand over and over again with one
click or API call with revell O's rich
REST API users can automatically spin up
complete application environments using
the blueprint feature Ravello enables
users to deploy environments in any
cloud region spanning regions from
Western San Francisco to Sydney and
Singapore you can get as many
environments as you need on any cloud
globally and tear them down when not
needed Ravello enables enterprises to
deploy their VMware workloads on twenty
nine regions globally across Oracle
cloud infrastructure Amazon Web Services
and Google cloud platform
that's great can you tell me more about
the benefits of Oracle cloud
infrastructure Ravello Ravello uses
hardware-assisted nested virtualization
and in addition supports the ability to
run directly on bare metal servers this
offers near native performance Oracle
cloud infrastructure Ravello is a
production grade infrastructure as a
service it enables vertical scaling to
32v CPUs per VM it has enhanced network
services such as VPN fast connect an
internal connectivity to Oracle paas or
is it provides host anti affinity to
spread mission critical workloads across
availability domains
how can Ravello improve my business
Ravello enables production and
pre-production use cases throughout the
enterprise application life cycle
including POCs
development test IT ops security testing
running production environments and
training what are the economic benefits
of running VMware virtualized on-premise
applications on Ravello on Oracle cloud
infrastructure the economic benefits are
no migration costs with Ravello
customers don't need to modify the
application in any way to run it in the
public cloud capex savings no need to
purchase and provision new servers
storage and network appliances epic
savings no need to pay for power cooling
real estate servicing and human capital
to manage a data center no VMware
license and support needed with Ravello
customers don't need VMware licenses to
run VMware apps in the cloud right-sized
infrastructure savings customers can
provision data center like environments
on a public cloud on demand eliminating
spend on underutilized resources that
was an interesting overview now I can
seamlessly run my applications on Oracle
cloud infrastructure Ravello
