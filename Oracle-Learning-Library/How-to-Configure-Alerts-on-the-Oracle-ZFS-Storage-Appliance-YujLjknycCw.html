to talk to you about alerts how to set
alerts on the ZFS storage appliance the
place you go is configuration and then
to the alert sub tab there's two types
of alerts in the system there are alert
thrash alert actions and threshold
alerts you simply create one by clicking
the plus on either of these when you
click it there's multiple categories of
events that you can alert on you can
only run all events these other actions
are primarily set for if there's either
software hardware issues or just general
informational status that you want
information on such as success of
replication sex success a phone home any
sort of issues like that cluster things
that happen within the cluster so on and
so forth so you can you know get pretty
custom on what you want to get events on
and then with those events you can do
many different actions so you can do
multiple actions first of all you can
send an email you can send an SNMP trap
you can send a syslog message you can
also the next four down here resume and
suspend data sets and worksheets those
basically have to do with the analytics
so you can resume a single data set
which is a single analytic probe that
you wanted to start recording or you
want to stop recording you could do that
same with a worksheet which is a set of
analytic probes you can do the same
there and then finally you can execute a
workflow which is basically a echo or
JavaScript that lives on the appliance
so you can have some action kick off a
workflow and we'll talk about that more
when we get to thresholds so threshold
alerts these are primarily based off of
analytics themselves so here you can see
here I can monitor CPU ization if it
exceeds 95% for at least five minutes
I could do those same sort of things
semi alerts there's also in here besides
the analytics performance analytics
there's also capacity based analytics so
tell me
when any storage hits 95% you can also
drill down into a specific pool down to
a specific project as well as all the
way down to an individual share so I can
pick this share the GL 2013 if it
exceeds 95% I could go out and do any of
these different actions like I talked
about you could even have a workflow for
instance in this case that say you had a
quota on here in the GL 2013 when his
95% you could have it go out the work
flow could go out and quickly add say
25% so that would be pretty easy to do a
little bit of scripting work but not too
hard to come up with some rules that
would let you automate things automate
provision growing things like that
within the storage array as well as
doing other things right whatever it is
you could pretty much dream of you can
do with workflows and the threshold
reports so that's it for reporting thank
you so much for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
