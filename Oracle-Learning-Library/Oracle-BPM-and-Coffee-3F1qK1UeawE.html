coffee can teach us a lot about BPM
let's imagine we're in Starbucks anyone
- grande latte the first step would be
to join the queue while you decide what
you want once decided when your turn
comes you can order your grande latte
next the cashier will take your money as
you pay and will hand out your empty cup
to the server then your grande latte is
prepared in the back once done you
receive it and decided everything is as
you ordered if not you can go back and
notify the server or just prepare it
yourself further by adding any extra
variable ingredients now that everything
is okay you can enjoy your latte in
peace actually what we did here is a
starting point of a BPM model let's see
what it takes to actually implement a
BPM solution and which is the life cycle
the first step would be the modeling
phase once the Process Model is done we
are ready for the implementation lastly
the analysis step looks after each part
of the process which should be changed
and solves any issue so the life cycle
can start again and a sure continuous
improvement now let's focus on the first
step modeling we just need to do some
very quick and simple additions to our
process in order to be complete firstly
let's clarify the steps we have the
start event which is marked by an oval
then we have the three activities marked
by squares then okay which is a gateway
is marked with a diamond shape the end
event is also an oval as the start event
now let's illustrate the roles of the
participants involved in this process
for that we need to draw some lanes just
as the swim lanes in a pool we have you
you're the client then we have the
cashier and the server each role has its
own activities now we're done we just
use the BPM notation in order to design
a process Oracle BPM suite delivers a
very easy to use web interface called
process composure for modeling processes
just as we did now
for implementation developers use a
desktop application called BPM studio
the collaboration between business and
IT and these two tools is done via a
shared repository called metadata
services this way both types of users
work on the same process model let's go
back to our process and see how the
implementation is done the first
activity order can be implemented as a
tablet application which customers use
to enter themselves the order will have
to create a simple web form using the
implementation tool and drag and drop
some fields like name coffee type and
size
the next step can be automated in order
to send the payment data inside the
database for that the tool offers an
out-of-the-box adapter which connects to
the database of your choice and sends
automatically the data from your process
let's now imagine that in the prepare
step the coffee machine is in fact a web
service which will deliver the coffee as
the output for sending the input we use
the implementation tool to set up the
address of the service the operation
name in our case prepare latte and the
size is the input parameter will receive
the coffee and the process goes to the
next steps all these actions are done in
BPM studio and in order to actually be
able to run the process in production
you should deploy it on your server this
is a simple step triggered inside studio
for the analysis phase let's hear a
short story once and I was at Starbucks
there was a very big crowd and the
payment step became a bottleneck in the
process the supervisor then took action
and designated an employee to make a
list with all the orders so that the
coffee will be prepared in time and
after payment all the clients could
enjoy their lattes faster this is an
example of real-time monitoring and
actionable insights this kind of
analysis and reporting is available in
the Oracle business activity monitoring
tool a web tool designed for business
users we've just seen how a good process
can be transformed in a better one by
using the right methods and the right
tools take a minute now and think how
BPM can help you stop doing monkey work
and start becoming a super man inside
your organization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
