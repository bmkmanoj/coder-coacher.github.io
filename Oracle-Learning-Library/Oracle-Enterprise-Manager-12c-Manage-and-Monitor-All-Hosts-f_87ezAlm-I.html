relate to monitoring and managing all
hosts for which you're responsible so we
first explore the hosts overview page
then we customize this page which you
can do to maximize your work style and
next we use it as a starting point to
execute operating system commands for
multiple hosts of course you could just
as well execute them for one host only
logged into Enterprise Manager is the
atman user navigate to targets and then
host on the host overview page you see
the hosts for which you are responsible
in our example 2 you see that there are
links where you can click and
individually manage a host details from
that are covered in the demonstration
monitor an individual host you see the
status here in this example all hosts
are up you see no values on the pending
activation because each of the hosts has
been already activated and is monitored
by Enterprise Manager here in the
incidents section you can move your
cursor over the icons and see the
severity level of the incidents in this
example we have one incident and and it
is a critical one
so normally of course you would move
directly to that and analyze it in
detail we have several demonstrations
that cover details about incidents and
the black one is a fatal one by default
you also see compliance violations
many organizations find that they must
adhere to best practices and standards
about a variety of things like storage
configurations security and you can
develop and define these standards in
Interpol
manager after you do that you can then
use cloud control to test for compliance
so the compliance scores provide an
overall evaluation of the behavior of
your target against your own defined
compliance standards so 100% means that
the target is fully compliant to your
standards definitions if the percentage
is lower than 100% the target is not
compliant in other words the lower the
score the verse is the client compliance
of your target to you define policies
here you see CPU utilization percent and
memory utilization percent you might be
alarmed by seeing the warning sign at
memory utilization percent but know that
our hosts are Linux or UNIX systems and
there it is quite common that this
parameter has close to a hundred percent
utilization we cover these details in
two other demonstrations monitor a
target and administer monitoring
templates so it's really nothing to
worry about and then you see here the
total IO per second I mentioned that
this display shows default layout but
you might actually never see this type
of display because it is very likely
that the page has been customized to
customize a page we click customize
table columns here you see the selected
columns that are on the page but if you
find for example you do not wish to see
the pending activations you can remove
it or let's say you don't care about one
or the other of these values you can
just remove them from the list then
let's see instead you want to add some
other available columns such as the
contact and the location
then you can select and with control
click select them and move them into the
selected columns now we click OK and you
see that the display has been modified
according to your wishes the host
overview page provides also an entry
point for running host commands on one
or several hosts on the run host command
page we first select named credentials
in our example the NC Oracle named
credentials we enter sample command such
as PWD then look at the bottom of the
page you see already one host the DB
target p21 but we want to add hosts so I
click the Add button on the select
search and select targets page click
select all and with all targets selected
we click the select button now that we
have selected the targets that we wish
we just click run to execute this simple
command you can see that it tells you it
is executing two of two and the screen
returns when you finished execution so
let's look at all the details of the
command we click show all details and
scroll to see the path of our two hosts
so let's just execute another command a
list of the files and then click run
it's executing again and we select show
all details scroll down to see the list
command of the directories so I hope you
get the idea of what's can be used for
so this concludes our demonstration
about the hosts
overview page and how you can customize
it and execute operating system commands
for multiple Linux hosts thanks for
watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
