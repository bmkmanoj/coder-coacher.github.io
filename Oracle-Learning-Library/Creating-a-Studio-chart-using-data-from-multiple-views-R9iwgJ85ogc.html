Endeca information discovery studio
using data from multiple views if you
are new to studio then you should
probably start with the getting started
with OE ID 31 screencast series before
viewing this video you should know how
to greet applications and data sets how
to add components to a studio page and
the basic configuration for a regular
chart component
in this video I'll briefly discuss how
refinement rules allow you to link
attributes from different data sets
studio uses data sets to create based
views I'll then show you how to
configure a chart to display data from
more than one view and show how studio
uses refinement rules to help select the
chart dimensions this video is intended
for users who create applications using
multiple related data sets and who want
to be able to show data from those data
sets on a single chart why use multi
view charts multi view charts allow you
to directly compare metric values from
different data sets such as in this
example where a chart shows both sales
numbers and tweet numbers otherwise
bringing these metrics together would
require you to create additional custom
views to create a multi view chart the
views must have dimensions with the same
data type and values refinement rules
allow a refinement from one data set to
be replicated for attribute in a
different data set for example when you
refine the sales date by a specific date
range the tweet date is also refined by
that date range
multiview charts can use refinement
rules to help determine whether two
views should be used for the same chart
for attributes to be linked by a
refinement rule they must have the same
data type the all single value oral
multi-value and have the same refinement
behavior
when you add a data set to an
application studio can automatically
create refinement rules between
attributes that have the same name and
that meet the other refinement rule
requirements for this video we've create
an application that uses data from a
fictitious bicycle manufacturer the data
is made up of four datasets which
contain sales records product
information employee information and
reseller information the sales records
reflect information from the other data
sets the data sets are linked using
refinement rules on the refinement rules
page for the application you can see
that the data includes refinement rules
for several algebra including product
category and product subcategory let's
go to the application to see one of
these refinement rules in action on this
page the sales page the available
refinements component shows the
available refinements for sales we also
have to select and refinements
components one for sales and one for
products
let's refine the sales data by the road
bikes product subcategory
because of the refinement rule you can
see that studio has automatically added
refinements to both the sales data and
the product data when you remove the
refinement from one data set the linked
refinement also is removed when we
configure our multi view chart you will
see how this refinement rule helps with
the configuration let's configure the
default chart on the sales page to
display both product and sales data on
the chart edit you to indicate that you
want to use multiple views check the
enable charting across multiple views
checkbox the radio buttons for each view
change two checkboxes the sales view is
already selected to add the products
view to the chart I'll check the
products check box when you are using
multiple views studio displays the list
of selected views at the top of the edit
view on the other tabs to remove a
selective view from the chart click its
delete icon you can use multiple views
for any type of chart I'll leave the
default chart type a basic bar chart
on the chart configuration tab the
attributes list contains the available
attributes from all of the Selective
views each attribute name is followed by
the name of the view it belongs to you
can filter the list to only include
attributes from a specific view for the
chart dimension list each dimension is
actually a dimension group for each
dimension group you must select a
dimension from each view let's start by
adding our metrics I'll filter the list
to only show the sales attributes I'm
selecting the unit price metric from
sales and setting the aggregation to
average now I'll filter the list to only
show product attributes I'm selecting
the list price metric and adding it to
the same metric group as the unit price
metric when you add both metrics to the
same metric group they're displayed at
the same time on the chart because these
are both currency values I'll configure
the metric group so that the values for
both metrics are displayed as currencies
you can also display attributes from
different views as separate metrics and
allow end users to switch between them
I'll also add the list price and unit
price metrics as separate available
metrics for the chart
you
for the dimension I want to use the
product subcategory i'll start by
dragging the sales product subcategory
name dimension from the sales view
when I expand the dimension group you
can see that studio has automatically
added the product subcategory name
dimension from the products of you this
is because these attributes are linked
by a refinement rule if a refinement
rule isn't defined you can also manually
add the dimensions to the dimension
group for dimension groups you can
customize the display name by default
the chart uses the name of the first
dimension that you added I'm going to
update the display name to be products
of category which works for both views
let's save the chart and exit the edit
view on the end user view the default
chart metric is the combination of both
the unit price metric from sales and the
list price metric from products you can
see on the chart that the list price is
generally higher than the unit price and
often by about the same percentage you
can also see where product subcategory
is missing one of the values I can also
switch to one of the individual metrics
that I added when I change to a metric
from a different view studio switches
seamlessly changing automatically to the
correct dimension for that view
now I'll refine by the components
product category in the sales data
because the refinement rule for that
attribute studio adds refinements for
both the sales and product data note
that if your dimensions are not
connected by a refinement rule then only
the one view is affected the chart is
also updated accordingly with the
correct subcategories shown for each
metric
so to recap refinement rules allow you
to link refinements to attributes from
different data sets refinement rules can
help with configuration of multi view
charts for a multi view chart you can
display metrics from different views at
the same time or allow users to switch
between individual metrics each
dimension is actually a dimension group
with a dimension from each view for more
information on refinement rules and
multi view charts see the studio user's
