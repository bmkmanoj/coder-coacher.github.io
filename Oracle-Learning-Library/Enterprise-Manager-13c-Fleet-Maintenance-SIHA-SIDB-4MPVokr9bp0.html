demo series today I am going to show you
how to use feed maintenance the patch
Ecija or Oracle restart environment and
it's also SATA data base to a new patch
level let's start by examining the
environment first current environment
has a good infrastructure running on
Eleanor - with no patches or PS use and
I also have a database running on 12
more to running on telemetry with no
patches or PS years we intend to take
this environment especially the gradient
environment to Telenor - running on PC 1
and the database - Telenor - running on
KC 1 so we will accomplish this in three
steps and the first step let's create a
gold image for both grid infrastructure
and database using the reference
environments the reference environment
information is available here since you
know it takes around 20 minutes to
create a gold image I've already run the
CLI commands to create these images but
I will show you how those comments look
like for the grid infra
we'll run this command e MC Lyte DB
software maintenance create software
image input file and we provide a file
that contains the list of you know
parameters that we will pass to the CLI
command so let's look at the contents of
this as you can see it provides an image
name and here it also gives you a
version name for this image a an image
can have multiple versions so in this
particular case we have you know adding
PLC one on top of this so that's the
version name that we're going to use and
we can describe this image in more
detail and what reference environment
are we going to use to create this gold
image and then where this image will get
stored within software library we
provide a directory structure there and
then the credentials for that host where
the reference environment
this now that's you we would do the same
thing for the database as well except
the parameters would change as needed
now if you want to look at the existing
images that already got created wait on
this command DM CLI DV software
maintenance get images let's run that so
if this will list us all the existing
images that I created for our demo as
you can see I have gi home table no.2
gold image like I was talking to hear
about so this is the image ID that we
need to keep in mind because that needs
to get used subsequently so this is
spread between two lines so we have to
make sure we pick both parts of that
image ID now a since there can be
multiple versions in an image we can
actually look at all the versions of a
particular goal image let's try this
command and it show you all the versions
for this demo purpose I've already
created a single I've created only a
single version of this image so as you
can see for and this is a version ID of
that version if you have multiple
versions you might want to make one of
them to be your current version that all
the subscription databases will consume
so this is a command that you would use
to make that particular version current
so you run that it actually converts
this into the current version now that's
how you take care of the old image
creation and making one of those
versions to be correct the next step is
to subscribe targets to these images and
move to the next step from there how do
you subscribe you use this command DB
software maintenance subscribe target
provides the name of the target so in
our case we are going to use this the
target name and which is the same one I
provided here it's a cluster type
because it's pretty intra and name of
the image ID which we created a clear
here using this and we were verified
using this here and so let me show you
have already run the subscription for
you so let me show you
how the subscription looks like MC Li DB
software Minton's getting eight
subscriptions and we provide image ID
now as you can see this the one that we
subscribed and as you can see that's
already available here similarly I also
subscribe the database to the database
image ID of Tolono to PSU one so let me
quickly run that for you so the target
that we are looking for you see how
one-to-one say here it is I've already
subscribed that to this image which is
basically tell them not to running on PC
one the next step is to deploy and
update our targets to the shadow homes
so let's deploy the C high image to the
target host to this target host as a
shadow home using the CLI so iam CLI
Divi software maintenance perform
operation you give the name for this
operation the purpose is to deploy the
GI software target list includes the
target that we intend to pax today and
the type of the target is cluster and we
provide the credentials we also provide
an input file that contains a single
parameter so that is the location where
the shadow home will decide so let's let
me show you the content of this file so
as you can see here the new or go home
list this is a shadow home is going to
reside here right now I've already done
this deploy for you because it takes
around 20 minutes once you submit it the
next step is for us to switch the grid
in for environment running here to point
to the shadow home that we deployed
using this so let's run this command
here so let's let's go through this
first DB software maintenance perform
operation purpose is to update the
reading from target is exactly our
target that we are trying to patch today
the target type is cluster and we
provide the credentials so let's run
this command
to update our grading track moment say
it got submitted successfully so if you
want to check how this is running you
could use this link that is forward to
here good go to the browser and provide
that here to see the status of what's
running again so this is how you
actually look at how things are
progressing
so let's look at how to update our
database
let's first deploy the database into the
shadow home so the command here is TV
software maintenance perform operation
and purpose is to deploy DB software the
target list Ecija 121 and the target
type is oracle database which basically
means it's a single instance and we'll
provide the credentials they also
provide again the location where the
shadow home gets created
so let's look at what this parameter
says so we've specified a location for
the you know for the shadow home this is
already done for you again because it
takes something between 15 minutes to 20
minutes so the next step is for us to
switch the database that's running to
the shadow home that has already got the
talu node to be PSU one on it so how do
we do that we submit this software
maintenance perform operation update s
ID be one-to-one is the name of the
operation that we provided and the
purpose is to update the database in the
target list and target type equals that
and provide some credentials
so let's submit this command
again we can use this link in the
browser to actually check how this
progresses so this will complete in
about a couple of minutes both the
updates will complete in about couple of
minutes so that concludes this demo
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
