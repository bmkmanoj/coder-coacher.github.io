developer with server technologies
curriculum development in this
demonstration I will show you how to
create and use a restful web service
with an XML response and a bind variable
in the URL in the example I will show
you how to pass a customer ID into the
web service in order to show customer
information the application has already
been created you want to select the
shared components option and then under
logic select web service references
here's where you're going to click the
Create button you want to select the
rest option and click Next
you want to specify a name in this case
we'll call it sequel rest and then
specify a URL that contains a bind
variable for cust ID which will be
creating later and then specify a proxy
server and then click Next we are not
going to have any input parameter so you
can go ahead and select next we do want
to specify a X path of slash customer
and then specify some output parameters
in this case first name last name
Street and City then we can click create
now we're ready to create a reform and
report on the web service that we just
created so click that option then we
want to select the service force equal
arrests that we just created and click
Next and then we'll go ahead and do the
operation do rest and click Next and
then take the defaults click Next to
create the new page with the regions we
don't have any input parameters so we
can just click Next and then specify
that we want all of the output
parameters and then click finish we need
to add the item for cust ID so we want
to edit the page so click that option
and we're going to right click on the do
rest region and create a page item
select the text field and then click
Next or just select the text field
option and then you want to replace the
item name with cust ID which is the
parameter that you're going to pass into
the URL and click Next and then we're
going to change the label to something
more meaningful customer ID and click
Next and we just want to accept the
defaults here so we can go ahead and
just click Next and then click create
item
going to go ahead and run the page now
you want to specify a customer ID in
this case one two three four five six
and then select submit and what this
will do is pass that cost ID through the
URL to produce the results we can go
ahead and change it to another cost ID
in this case 40 and click Submit and
you'll notice that you have different
data you have just seen how to create
and use a restful web service with an
XML response and a bind variable thanks
