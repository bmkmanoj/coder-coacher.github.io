of the SCA developer tools is the local
server it lets you test locally before
deploying changes to your site the local
server is primarily used to test
front-end changes any back-end services
called by the application or run on
NetSuite therefore any local changes you
make to services your back-end models
must be deployed to NetSuite before they
are accessible on the local server so
during this video I'm going to show you
how to view front-end changes on your
local server before you deploy them to
NetSuite the first thing we need to do
is start the local server and you do
this by issuing a command from the
command line or terminal window first I
change to the top-level directory where
my local SCA source files reside next I
issue the following command gulf space
local
this starts the local server and deploys
any changes to it when you see these
messages you know that the server is up
and running and these messages tell you
three things the URL for the local
server the folder being watched and the
commands to close the local server which
is ctrl C to view the local site you
need to enter the URL for the site on
your local server and there's one piece
of information that you will need for
the URL and that is the account ID if
you don't know the account ID you can
get it from your live site so just go to
the live site and view the source for
your home page and scroll to the bottom
of the page and here is mine right here
after I have the account ID all I need
to do to view my site on the local
server is to open the web browser and go
to the URL and this is the local URL for
shopping notice that it goes to shopping
- local SSP and you also see the account
ID that I just looked up and of course
it goes without saying the easy thing to
do is to bookmark this URL you can also
view my account and check out on the
local server with these URLs just be
sure to replace the domain the account
ID and the version of SCA
another great thing about the local
server is that it monitors your local
files and if you make a change to a file
it is immediately published to the local
site all you need to do is refresh the
browser to see the change here's an
example I'm going to change the discount
code message from the home page of the
site I'm going to change the SCA demo to
new code
and when I said the file I'll see the
changes reflected immediately there in
the terminal window if I go back to my
web browser and refresh it I'll see my
new code in the message when I'm
finished working with the local server I
just press control C it asks if I want
to terminate the batch job and I tell it
yes and that stops the local server
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
