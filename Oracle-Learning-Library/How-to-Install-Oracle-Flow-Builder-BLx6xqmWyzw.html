installed in functioning Oracle database
11g
Enterprise Edition version 11 to 0 3 0
running on Oracle Enterprise Linux
version 5 here are the steps for
installing Oracle flow builder there
should be a running Oracle database 11g
Enterprise Edition database if you
currently have this database running you
don't need to install it from scratch in
my case I don't have the database so I
will go ahead and download and install
it
now 7-zip files for oracle 11g database
we will go ahead and download all seven
of them after the 7-zip files are
downloaded it should be installed and
configured so that the database can be
accessed from a remote machine here are
the steps for installing Oracle database
11g Enterprise Edition we've already
downloaded the 7-zip files we will go
ahead and extract the 7-zip files to the
same directory
we have completed extracting all seven
zip files the next step is to run the
database installer
the Oracle Universal installer will
appear the instructions were step four
says to clear that I wish to receive
security updates checkbox however if you
do wish to receive security updates
please leave that box checked for step 5
assess to skip software updates the next
step is to select create and configure a
database and click Next select
desktop-class and click Next for the
next step we need to specify the install
configuration enter the Oracle base path
as follows and replace the user name
with the actual user account you are
using
once you have the Oracle based path
populated the Installer will
automatically populate the software
location and database file location the
database addition should be Enterprise
Edition and the character set should be
Unicode make sure you have the correct
character set selected because unicode
is not the default the OSD be a group
should be DBA for the global database
name and administrative password you can
make it anything you want it to be make
sure you note then password somewhere so
that you remember it if this is the
first time you are installing an Oracle
product on the server you will be
prompted for an inventory directory
check to make sure there are enough disk
space at the path specified you can
point this path to anywhere you want it
to be as long as there are sufficient
disk space
on prerequisite checks if there are
errors click ignore all and click next
on the summary page confirm your entries
and click install
the installation will take some time for
the purpose of this video I will pause
here and resume when installation has
completed the database creation has
completed in detail log files can be
found at this path you may want to note
down the information on this screen
before proceeding to the next step a
pop-up window will appear prompting the
user to run some scripts as the root
user if this is the first time you're
installing an Oracle database you will
be prompted to run two scripts however
if this is not the first time you've
installed an Oracle database on the
server you will only be required to run
the second script the pop-up window will
indicate how many scripts you need to
run please note that there is a typo on
step 13 in the documentation and that
the path for the following script is
incorrect please look at the path in the
pop-up window to find the correct
location for the first script the
documentation says to run the script as
root user and we will go ahead and do
that
when prompted for the password please
enter the password for the root user
let's go ahead and run the second script
for the second script you will be
presented with some questions hit the
enter key if you would like to accept
the default or I'll specify another
location for the local bin directory
installation of the database is now
complete and we will go ahead and
configure it for remote access in order
to do so we need to modify Tina's name
style or file and change the local host
to the fully qualified domain name of
the machine to find out what is the
fully qualified domain name enter
hostname - f from the Linux command
prompt let's go ahead and copy this set
command and paste it into notepad please
note that when you copy into notepad you
need to delete the hard-coded return key
after the underscore in the orca home
path
let's replace machine name company comm
with the name of the server that you
have installed the database on and here
we are getting an oracle home undefined
variable error if you receive this error
verified that the oracle home
environment variable is set or manually
enter the full path to or go home
directory in place of this variable in
our case we will go ahead and set the
oracle home environment variable now
that the environment variable for oracle
home has been set we will go ahead and
run the command again
the next step is to modify listener to
aura and change local host to the fully
qualified domain name again we will go
ahead and copy and paste this path and
update the Machine name with the actual
fully qualified domain name
now we are ready to stop the listener
and start it up again
optionally we can restart the database
however we will go ahead and skip that
and continue with the installation of
Oracle flow builder since we have
completed the database installation we
will go ahead and close the Oracle
Universal installer window instructions
for installing the Oracle flow builder
applications as follows download Oracle
