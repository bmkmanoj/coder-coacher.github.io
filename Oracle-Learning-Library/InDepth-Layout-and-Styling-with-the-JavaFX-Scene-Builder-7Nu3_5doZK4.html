you for joining this bluff
my name is Jean Francois Denise I am
part of the Jedi fixin builder
development team I am based in France
and today I'm going to do a very
detailed presentation on the sim builder
actually I am going to do a general
session on the sim builder tomorrow the
schedule is a bit reversed I would have
preferred to have my tomorrow's ation to
be today because I will cover general
topics today I will try to do my best to
focus on some technical aspects of the
sim builder so I will not do a lot of
slides I have two or three slides just
to load you with some context and I will
jump directly on some demos so the safe
harbor for me to be safe with this
presentation and the content of it so
one slide to quickly present the sim
builder
I guess that now you saw it in the
values presentation yesterday and and
this morning some people presented the
sim builder to slide just to load some
context on F XML and CSS that are really
the two legs of the sim builder and
finally I will I will do some some IAP
interesting demos so what is the same
builder so the sim builder is a visual
tool to help you create java fix UI so
the one total release has been issued in
August this year working on Mac and
Windows and today we start to put our
next two cameras one on one release on
OTN so you can download the latest
greatest sin builder release that works
on Linux Mac with the addition of
mountain lion and window 8 beta so one
sentence to summarise what is sin
builder it's a graphical effects ml
editor this is really what it is so I
take the opportunity of this
presentation
to tell you that we are looking for
participants for a usability study that
will take place in October so if you are
interested I put there the URL but come
and see me give me your business card of
your name and the people that are
organizing this will contact you ok
so for a quick introduction so this
survival kit 2 slides to to give you
some some some background so as I said
the input and output format of the sim
builder is FX NL so FX ml now is a
popular language in JavaFX world so
really what it is it an XML language to
serialize javabeans but in the context
of Java FX it has been a bit reduced and
it's used to serialize portion of your
sin graph it is very good at that so
obviously all the structure of the Java
fix libraries and now the containers so
values elements are good are compliant
with F XML so you can reference all your
Java FX classes from an XML document but
you if you extend the platform by
extending containers buttons whatever
and if you follow some design patterns
that are well documented on the web but
it's quite abuse some public
constructors getters and setters you
will be able to reference your custom
type from F XML and there is a new kind
of pattern that we are currently in the
process of discovering is what they
should be in order to load your custom
type in sign builder so I will show you
some it's the beginning of this so I
will show you how to do that one notion
I want to introduce is the notion of F
XML controller class so Enzo ethics ml
you have your layout I would say the
static layout the structure of your UI
and there is a bridge between this
aspects and the application logic and
the bridge to connect your event handler
to inject your node inside your Java
code this is the role of the XML
controller class so I will show you in
in demos some very simple controller
class to get to get the point but it's
it's quite straightforward one important
point that I will not demonstrate today
but we'll cover tomorrow is the ability
to include F XML file inside the XML
file and it's obviously a great
requirement we don't want to duplicate
our layout you want to reuse some others
some footers so you can construct your
layout like a template and fill with
some included XML file so ethics ml very
important for the sim builder second
aspect it's CSS so in the scene builder
we are not editing CSS we are using your
CSS editor
we are not generating CSS but what we do
is that we render CSS it's an important
aspect of it because you will see that
perhaps you are already doing some CSS
with GFX and to see what is the impact
of changing the value of a declaration
you need to go the world development
steps compile run observe that the
padding is not right change the rule and
do it again within builder we have image
rendering of your CSS rule as soon as
you save them so I just want to give you
some magic knowledge of CSS in Java FX
and we will see that in action in the
sim builder so all the controls of the
platform comes pre styled with a default
 look and feel that is named
Caspian you as a developer or as a
styler you can add your rules
located in files you can add them at the
scene level or you can locate your CSS
files you can look at your rules inside
a given container so it's a nice way to
easily to rule
according to the containment of your
application another ability another way
to set style on a node it's by inline
styling it each node as a style property
similar to the web where you can
directly add CSS declaration so we can
already see that we had three origin of
styling so default that can that come
out of the box the CSS files you can add
and the inline you add directly to the
node so there is an order of precedence
between these three in line that is
stronger saw style sheets that override
the theme so in this CSS overriding
model where does being property fits a
lot of property in JavaFX can be set
thanks to CSS or funks to api call so
keep in mind that all CSS you do is
overriding your API call so the API
calls sitting between the theme and the
stylesheet and this is really what we
want we want to be able from a CSS file
to change the behavior or at least the
style of the application but you will
see that in builder help you figure out
from where your style come from we can
see that it can become quickly very
complex okay so I'm done so now demo of
the sim builder
so for this demo I am using NetBeans 7.3
or you can use the dev build the beta is
not yet out it will come out in few in
few days or hours I don't know but it
will come quickly so I have selected I
have seven patterns I would like to to
cover and there is some that are very
important to that I will cover tomorrow
so if you come tomorrow to my session it
will be it will be not the same contact
so the first topic I want to cover is
CSS so there I have the main window of
sin builder I'm not going to introduce
it but mainly on the left you have a
library from where you can drag and drop
content in the middle and according to
what you have selected on the right you
can set properties of the of your
currently selected element so let me add
a button and one way to change the look
and feel of a button is by setting a
property so in order to change the text
of a button
you can use the text field property so
now I have a nice pink or purple a text
field so the the second way is the style
sheet so I have written let me show you
a very very simple rule and that is
going to style any button located in my
portion of sin graph so why any button
because I am using as selector the
button stylus any button as by default a
button stylus so there I am redefining
the background color the text field and
the font size of my button ok so I'm
going to add to my design it is tied
sheet so I am selecting the parent of
this button it's container and set style
sheets property
so as soon as you add style sheets we
apply CSS rule so that's why the button
has been immediately rendered so you can
navigate from the scene builder to the
CSS file so for my CSS edition I am
using - code but according to your
system configuration it will start your
CSS editor so the files that opens your
CSS extension so if I am changing in the
file and the color of the background of
this button you have immediate rendering
so this is what I wanted to tell you is
that it's very efficient to style
incrementally your your content so the
last way to style its by over by using
the style property of the node itself so
there I'm going to change the text field
to be a nice green okay so now if I ask
if someone sorry
look at this content it's quite
difficult to understand from where this
green come from from where the yellow
come from and so on
so we try to help user engine builder
first of all by in the inspector it's
where you find the bean properties each
time a property is rooted is overridden
by CSS we make it read only and we offer
you a button to navigate to where it has
been defined so the font if I am
clicking on it I am going to navigate to
the file because the font has been
defined inside the demo dot CSS file but
the text field I'm navigating not to a
file but to a property because what is
overriding the text file is the style
property so it can start to become a bit
complex so that's why in sin builder 1.1
we have just introduced a summary review
that provide use a
an exact view of what is rendered and
from where the value come from so you
get it from view shows ESS analyzer so
in this panel that is just display now
what do we have we have this big table
and this big table is composed of a
first column that contains all the CSS
property you can set on the currently
selected node for each of them if you
click on it and if you have access to a
online CSS documentation mainly if you
are on the on the web you will be
directed to information on the syntax of
the property so we've seen build a 1 dot
all you wear habit alone now I am going
to style this stuff what are the rules
that apply what is the syntax so now
from sim builder you have much more
information now so this was the first
column then we have our for origin of
styling so default so the caspian style
the inspector this column is actually
what you have set from the inspector of
what you have loaded from your F XML
file style sheets that what come from
the CSS files and finally inline styles
so there we can see that the yellow
background is winning because it has a
blue background the cell as a book as a
blue background on it and it is
overriding the gray radial gradient
oriented Caspian you can feel so
something that is interesting is that
you can filter the the table according
to property name and I want to focus on
this one there so ethics text fields
that are actually the four property set
so
it has a default color I have set funks
to the inspector I'll ever overridden
fines to stylesheet' and thanks to
inline style so I have a kind of good
view synthetic view of what is going on
there and this table is dynamic if I am
removing the style there you have inline
styles that I've been removed from your
table and everything tried to keep in
sync with the CSS runtime so what you
see there is what you get at runtime we
are not evaluating the rules in a
different way this is exactly the way it
is done at runtime ok so I am done with
this first half suspect of the CSS
analyzer there is also a second issue
when you want to style CSS component
sometimes the skin structure is a bit
difficult to understand so if I take the
example of a scroll pane the skull pane
is composed of two scroll bar so how do
you do to style sub-element of it how do
i do - what is the rule I need to write
to style this corner there this done
this track this arrow it's not very
obvious to do what to do that so we are
the tool in the sim builder that is a
CSS peeking I click on it and now each
time I will click on a node first it
will select it make it a yellow and it
will update the styling ball path so the
style able pass this path there is if
you want a selector that you could use
to style this exact node so what I'm
going to do is to use the CSS analyzer
menu and copy this tie label path I
don't even want to know what it is I
just copy it oh by the way I can remove
the filter there and when you click on a
node you see all the properties that are
linked to this node so I have
the stile I will pass I am going to
navigate to my CSS file and I'm going to
copy it in my file and add declaration
to it so I see that I can set the
background color of it so let's change
to be a nice pink let me save and
instantaneously you have the part of
your skin that is styled so it's a nice
way to understand our skins can be
styled so you can do it with the CSS
peeking tool but you can also do it by
discovering it using the style able pass
navigation feature so there I can
discover all the style able nodes inside
my skin so let's select this vertical
scroll bar and there is this decrement
button that contain a decrement arrow so
now I can copy this tie label pass in
order to change the color whatever of
the arrow so okay so you get the the
capabilities of this feature so it's a
new feature just went out waiting for
your feedback on the forums give us what
you like what you don't like and we will
try to make change according to your
valid use case ok so it's done for this
first demo so I'm going to do a smooth
transition from CSS to structure and
layout so something that I really like
with CSS it's the ability to set
background image there I have this root
on copains that is composed of a motif
one fingers that has been replicated if
you wanted to do that with nodes you
wanted to align them to up the image to
resize when you change the width and
eight of your container it will just me
imply a lot of logic so
if I am opening the CSS analyzer we can
see that on any region you can set an
ethics background image let me navigate
to its syntax so the value of a
background image its URL that is a
relative to the current CSS file so
there I have a simple icon and by
default there is a repeat X&amp;amp;Y so all my
background is covered with this image so
nice way to add image to your layout
second way and you saw already eaten
values demos it's by importing image so
as soon as you import image now you have
a node so you can select it duplicate it
transform it you have much more you have
much more control on your image
something that you can't do obviously
when it's a background inside a CSS rule
so a quick patterns but nice to see that
you can you have multiple way according
to your requirements choose the right
the the right way don't try to cover the
backgrounds with thousands of nodes how
I wanted to mention that the scene
builder is written in Java FX so this
pattern there you see it's in fact the
background of this region that has been
replicated just mentioning okay how to
add menu to your application menu bar so
this is a design I want to create so I
don't know if you notice but each time
I'm creating a new a fix ml document
insights in builder I have a default
container and by default we have the
uncle pane I will cover in detail the
good features the good properties of
Uncle pain but sometimes this is not
what you want some time you want to
start with a V box with a border pain
according to your knee
so there is multiple way to do it but
one simple way it's to create it
directly create a new document with a
border pain let's say why am i should
think about the pain because it does
work very well with menu bar I take this
Pony bar and look at the content you
have the drop target according to where
I can drop it and if I am dropping it
and to the top of my border pain my menu
bar is automatically stretched to fill
all the width of my container
furthermore if I preview in a window
previewing in a window it's a way you do
when you want to play and see out your
application is going to resize it so now
if I am resizing it I can see that the
menu is properly following my window and
this control free with the border pane
so what can we do with menu you can
obviously change the name of menu one
very interesting property I want to
notice is the ability we have in Java
effects to make your application to look
like a native application and move the
menu to the system menu bar on Mac
systems you never see application with
embedded menu bar okay so it's delegated
to the operating system so there is this
property use system menu bar trust me
it's a bit too small there and now if I
am previewing in a window my menu has
been moved there to my system menu so
that's very cool that's the way we do in
Singh builder to have our menu be in the
system menu on Mac we don't do that on
Windows obviously we keep it inside the
night just the way it is so a nice
little properties that do a lot so to
add content to a menu take some content
drag and drop the
clean the menu you have separate oh you
have check menu all the API or the sorry
all the knowledge you find in the FX API
you can drag and drop but really a menu
what it finality why do we have menu
it's to fire actions so I'm going now to
show you how to call some Java code from
sim builder first I'm going to save this
file inside my NetBeans project inside
this NetBeans project I already have an
XML controller class we will see it it's
very very simple in my case so to set a
controller class to attach this
controller class to your F XML you
select the route of your layout go to
code and there you have this controller
class property you can type it by ant
full name package and class name but we
do our best and look in your folders
around the xml where you saved it and if
we find some compliant java source file
we don't work on class we just work on
your source file we do some pattern
matching to extract the name and so on
so you can set it once you have set this
class you can select your menu attend
and set an event handler on on action
this is what will be called when you
click on the menu so there again we look
at the java source file and try to
extract some methods that are candidates
to be called from an action or on mouse
event on all your contenders so there
let's assume i am cause calling close I
can save it let's look at what I saved
so here this is a part of ethics NL so
here you have this an action attribute
that contains the name of my method I
will show you that it is emitted and at
the root of my element I have this
controller class that has been set so
the FX controller attribute is all the
time set on the root of your UI menu
controller so very straightforward it's
a simple class that contains limited
each of them being annotated with an at
effects ml this is only requirement
there there is another requirement
actually you need to have a proper
signature or you have an empty signature
of you have an event that is of the type
of your event handler I was an own
action event so it's an action sorry
action even parameter so you get it
there is nothing special there except
this at the fix a mellow notation okay
pop up controls what are their very
simple divisor its tooltip and context
menu everybody or a lot of people
actually are adding tooltip and context
menu so how do you do that it's a matter
of so in the library you will find the
tooltip you can drag and drop it
directly on the label or in the Yaqui
once you have added the label to any
control you can add to any control you
can then set your text and the only way
to visualize the tooltip is by
previewing as I did previously because
the mouse event in your content view are
not reaching your note we are trapping
all the mouse events in a in order to
design to design your layout so we will
see how the mouse event are reaching
your note in preview
but lets me add the context menu again
just simple drag-and-drop and you have
the same structure you can add menu item
to it and you carry on so let's preview
it tooltip context menu okay so there is
straightforward but worth mentioning
peps is the kind of thing we don't see
at first when we we starts in builder so
charts what can you do with charts in
Sim builder so first of all you you will
find all the charts in the library so
I'm going to drag and drop a pie chart
so first thing you can resize them and
let me add a line chart going to put one
on top of the other so the first thing
we mentioned we can see quite quickly
that a chart without content is not so
cool at design-time it's even worse
because all the interesting properties
you can set to tweak the look and feel
of your chart do I have a legend do I
have a title what does this color what
are all the behaviors the look and feel
of the chart is only available with data
so in the scene builder we took that
into consideration and we have a feature
to inject sample data inside your layout
so to do that you go to view and show
sample data and this feature applies to
chart but it also applies to table view
table column tree view list view
whatever data oriented containers or
controls that make sense when they are
filled full of data so now I can change
and I am appiy these to be on the Left I
can make the legend to be visible not
visible so you get it some things that
you can't do
without this sample data so sample data
is not stored in your Iife xml only the
properties you set in the inspector are
store so it's just runtime information
so at preview you get again some data
that is generated just to get a feel of
what is going on and tomorrow i will do
that with tree view Eastview one to
create a kind of Business Forum
application okay now I am and what time
is it
that's why I still id' 15 minutes so I'm
happy because I have a very important
topic to cover now it's custom type and
I have time for it so custom type so
with one dot oh we have two we've seen
builder one dot oh we have added the
ability for you to load your custom type
inside Singh builder so it was there it
was working we have fixed some bugs and
now in 1.1 we consider that the feature
start to be more nature but it's just
the beginning of the feature so you will
see that you can't yet import directly
or custom type graphically from sin
builder I will have to update my F XML
file but sin builder cups with your
manually did no problem so in this demo
I have written very simple custom types
that is composed of a list of labels
each of them having values font and
colors and the custom type exposed one
single property so custom text property
when you set this property all the
labels are going to be updated with the
content of the text it's really simple
context to Twilight the custom type
feature furthermore I'm going to
demonstrate two thing first thing is how
to use in builder to create your custom
type today you have multiple paths to
create custom type
do you go the control and skin way there
is no control SDK to dates so what do i
do do i extend VBox and do whatever I
want in my debug so it's a new land
there so I'm going to show you a pattern
on how to create the UI of your custom
type using same builder then we will see
how to using custom type engine builder
so my custom type so it is composed of
an XML file very V box that contains
five levels what we can notice is that
the I have named the container so with
this FX ID property with a Netflix ID
property you can provide a name and this
name as to match exactly a private field
annotated with a traffic signal inside
the controller class so this is a way to
set to say to the XML loader this node I
want once I'm injected in my controller
class because I will use them at runtime
so I want it to update my levels and
that's about it actually I'm just going
to do something a bit special when
saving this layout I'm going to use this
menu there and ask to use FX root
construct so the ethics root construct
if you are a fixed ml expert you already
know what it is but mainly it's a way to
tell to the effects ml loader that the
root is going to find Enzo F XML file is
not the actual root the root of the
design will be set at runtime by the
Java code so you can see it as a
template of root ok we will see that so
I can save my design and let's look at
the custom type at the sorry at the
ethics ml of it so this is what is the
ethics root construct is really a
template of the
root element there is its type it has to
be of type V box but it can be a
subclass of D box and our Keystone type
will subclass V box so then you can set
all the property you can generally set
on a V box what about the custom type
itself so it is extending V box in it
has this property to get and set its
custom type its custom text sorry and
when you set the text it has a side
effect to access to the controller class
that is Association kid to the XML file
and call also a set custom text to
convey this text to the UI layer how do
we get a reference on to the controller
I'm going to show you that now so when
the custom type is created I am calling
the load method that is a method I just
wrote for this demo and this is where
the the interesting piece is actually is
I'm creating an XML loader and I am
telling that the route now is this
instance so when the FX ml loader is
going to load this layout it is going to
fill the list of children of this
instance with all that has been loaded
from the XML file so all the labels are
going to be put inside this custom type
one very important call and that will
become a pattern to have proper custom
type engine builder you have to set the
class loader that loaded the custom type
inside the loader because the loader by
default is using the system class path
and when and you will see that when we
are going to load your type in sign
builder so system class pass doesn't
contain your class it contains the class
of the scene builder so we are creating
class loader with your jars with your
class and attach them to each of your
loaded custom type so in order to
resolve this a fix ml file we need
it to set the class folder on to the XML
loader then we set the location we load
quick a section to check that the route
that has been written is actually this
because this is what I have asked to the
I fix ml loader and to get a reference
onto the controller you get loaded get
controller and you have this reference
we wanted to get so I am done with let
me clean and will it clean and will
sorry so the step I want to cover now is
how I am going to reference this custom
type inside a an XML that is my main
layout if you wish that we use this
controller this component so as I said I
can only do that by end so when you want
to add your custom type you need to add
a processing instruction import with the
package of your custom type the same way
we do for Java fix runtime classes then
you can use the name of your class and
use it as an XML element so there in my
list of uncle paying children I have
this custom pane custom type sorry XML
element and that's it let's see house in
builder is going to react to this
content okay so as soon as we detect
that there is some custom type in your
XML we prompt you with this huge dialog
that ask you a lot of things that
provide you a lot of information but
mainly is asking you for your binaries
so I'm going to set up the class pass
you can add jaws or folders according to
your packaging and in the district
Therese er I should have my custom type
job change Li named
and then I'm going to apply the class
pass and I can see now perhaps you you
did not notice and I didn't show you
actually that before to apply the class
pass my hierarchy there was empty and
when you successfully load elements they
appear in there so I see that as a black
box that acts actually so this is my
constant type it's composed of a set of
node but I can't navigate inside it it's
a leaf it's really like a button so I
can move it and you can change property
you it works exactly the same way as any
ethics node and what is interesting in
Sim builder is that we introspect your
your custom types and all the properties
that we can't put in some sections that
we know we put in the miscellaneous
section there so we offer the ability at
design time to configure your custom
type so there I am going to change with
this well-known sentence and if your
custom type is well designed it should
react a design time also according to to
your requirements it's not mandatory but
in this case we have contained a custom
component that has some design time
capabilities so let me save the XML and
show you what did we save so now the
custom type has has been extended with
some properties so the custom text
properties that I have set and layout
text layout why because I have moved the
custom type inside my own copy so your
custom type are treated the same way I
others so it's just a matter of
following some design patterns
what do we see also there we see and
seen NetBeans will fix this
we have some special not too much 3/4 a
sim builder specific processing
instruction that are completely ignored
at long time by the XML order for us to
persist information you set design time
so next time when I will reload this XML
file I will prompt you for security
reason I know sorry so sin builder will
prompt you for security reason to accept
to load this custom type but you will
not have to set the path we start
relative all the paths all the image CSS
file you can add with save them relative
to the current XML file and what I
wanted to say it's today consider by
NetBeans as an invalid processing
instruction but in the 7.3 release it
will not it will be just in your ignored
quick highlight we have done 7 the tree
we have this nice completion inside the
XML editor it was not the case in 7.2 so
now all Z attributes all the static
constraints you can set on a given node
you can do that manually inside so XML
editor and as you saw you will do your
development in some sometime in the sim
builder and sometime in XML because
sometime we are very effective at just
copy pasting XML element changing
attributes values and Constantini
loosely the sim builder is reflecting
your change so do manual change save it
sim builder reload that in your in your
content view okay so since that I have
time to show you and this one is very
important but there is a lot of samples
not a lot but few some some
numbers that are present with sin
builder 1.1 and this one is one of them
so I really advise you to go and have a
look to the code of this sample it show
you how to create an application that
load multiple of XML and replace the
content of the theme because an
application is never or not often
composed of a single page you want this
workflow where you from one page to go
to you go to the other one so we add a
lot of questions saying we have XML how
can I do that we've seen builder how can
I do that you don't do that in sin
builder you create part you create
multiple XML and with few line of codes
you are going to sequence your life XML
and many replace the content of your
thin stage the window you can replace
the scene of your stage at runtime so
it's really straightforward to read so
just I want to show you the workflow
this is first XML done with the sim
builder I'm logging in I go on to a
second F XML that I've done and I can
log out and come back to the first one
so this is taken into this is how to say
the application that deals with that so
I have one minute I can't really start
peps I wanted to show you something that
I had forgotten actually you remember I
in the chat I have loaded my charts with
sample data but what you are going to do
in real life it's you are going to set a
fix ID on your charts and when your F
XML file is loaded you are going to fill
them with some actual data so I show you
that in your chart controller class so I
observe my pie chart and line chart to
chart I have used let's assume I upset
an ethics ID on each of them and if your
controller class is
implementing initially sable initially
sable is part of the affixed runtime api
you will get a callback when load is
done so you have a post load if you wish
a callback where you are initializing
your content and typically there you
will access to it chart and whatever
your application go to your data
provider ask for a data for this chart
and set the data of this given shuttle
this is very typical pattern you will
use when feeding your charts or or table
or whatever so thank you very much for
for your presence and you have been let
me go at the end okay if you have more
information go to Java fix comm we have
a lot of documentation log bugs create
your own account on Java ethics can I
create a Kenai project there is a nice
video done by Angela one of my colleague
on YouTube we have some demo on the
booth and tomorrow I have my general
session where I will present I today I
have been very quick at presenting use a
fix ID and the event handlers so
tomorrow I will take my time and I will
cover the complete workflow on how to
use an IDE whatever your ID I will use
NetBeans and cin builder and will show
you with more more time more peaceful
presentation thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
