Cloud Control 12c demo series this
demonstration will explain the bi
publisher security model and roles and
show you how you might map those roles
to cloud control 12c users bi publisher
has a hierarchical security model for
Enterprise Manager cloud control users
at the bottom of the hierarchy we have
the am VIP viewer role Enterprise
Manager cloud control users with this
role can log into bi publisher and run
the out-of-the-box reports and
potentially any other reports created
for your site next we have the EMB IP
author all enterprise manager cloud
control users with this role can create
reports within beyond publisher the EMB
IP author all automatically includes the
mbrp viewer role so authors can also run
reports the EMB IP scheduler role sits
to one side of the hierarchy Enterprise
Manager cloud control users with this
and the EMB IP viewer role considerable
execution of any of the reports that
they can view within bi publisher at the
top of the hierarchy is the am VIP
administrator role in a non ldap
Enterprise Manager cloud control
environment super administrators
automatically receive this role to allow
them to perform initial setup tasks all
of the other roles are included in the
am VIP administrative role in this
demonstration we will work with for
Enterprise Manager cloud control users
and their privileges against to manage
database targets m12 rep and target DBA
I am user one has that am user role in
cloud control and the view any target
privilege and we will give them the mb
IP view our role only am user to has the
am user role in cloud control but with
the view privilege only on the target DB
database instance and we will also give
them the am VIP viewer role only PM
reports has the am or viewer roland
cloud control and we will give them the
am VIP author all so they can create
custom reports bi publisher honors the
target privileges that each user has
within cloud control so that reports can
only be executed against targets that
the user can access finally a.m. admin
has the am or administrative role in
climate control and we will give them
the mbrp administrator role so they can
also administer bi publisher bi
publisher roles need to be explicitly
granted to enterprise manager cloud
control users without them cloak control
users can login to bi publisher but are
unable to execute any tasks as we see
here when logged in as am admin
in a non ldap environment the mapping of
bi publisher roles to enterprise manager
Cloud Control users is managed through
the weblogic server command line utility
w LST first because in this
demonstration we are using the
out-of-the-box enterprise manager ssl
certificate we configure our environment
to instruct w LST to trust the
certificate will receive from enterprise
manager cloud control then we start w st
and connect to the weblogic server
administration port once connected we
can start managing the bi publisher
roles we use the grant app role
directive to grab the bi publisher roles
to Cloud Control users use the command
to grant the am BRP administrator role
to the am admin user note the use of
upper case for the cloud control user
name newly granted or revoked am VIP
roles may take up to 15 minutes to
become effective and will not apply
until the next login now that we have
explicitly granted the am VIP
administrator role to the am admin user
let's revisit bi publisher to see the
effect as we can see now when we login
to bed our publisher as am admin all
possible tasks are available to us as we
expected because we have the am VIP
administrative role back in the w LST
utility we will finish mapping the bi
publisher roles to our cloud control
users will grant the mb IP author role
to the PM reports user and the am VIP
viewer role to am user 1 and also to M
user to that's our management of the bi
publisher roles finished so we can exit
the w LST utility
let's recap by looking at what options
are available within bi publisher for
each am VIP role first logged in as a
madman who has the am VIP administrator
role all creation tasks are available
plus we have the administration link
that gives us access to the VIP sure
administrative pages next will login as
M reports who has that am VIP author
role all creation tasks bar the ability
to schedule a report are available
logging in as am user one who has the am
VIP viewer role we immediately notice
that no creation tasks are available or
we can do is navigate the catalog and
open reports finally for completeness
will log in as a user called a.m. rpt
shed who has the am VIP scheduler role
join us that this user can schedule
report jobs thanks for watching this
