Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series similar to the configuration
drift analysis capabilities DBA s can
take advantage of the change management
capabilities to do
annal to analyze differences or changes
to the database schema as well as the
database data itself users can take a
baseline of a schema and save that any
Enterprise Manager repository and use
that as a source of comparison on an
ad-hoc or regular basis to compare
schemas together and they can also use
that as well as the comparison between
two repositories to synchronize the
schema objects Enterprise Manager 12
introduces the capability to also
compare data between two repositories
and also the concept of change plans
which is a repeatable deployable object
that it can be generated from comparison
are also from data gathered from sequel
developer of the developers of the
application so let's look at some schema
comparisons here and see what those look
like you can see we have basically two
different comparisons done here one is
to from a baseline and one is to between
two databases let's take a look at the
HR baseline comparison first so again
what was what happened was this was a
baseline taken prior to an application
upgrade and we now car comparing the the
baseline prior to the upgrade to the
current schema and we can see that
what's changed is that there's a bonus
new table added to the Scott schema
let's go back and take a look at the
comparison results of the dev to
production
database to database compare schema
comparison in this case in the latest
run we can see that there were 49
identical objects one of them is not
identical and for right only which means
only exist on the right hand side or on
the source so you can see here that the
Scot bonus table is actually not the
same between these two so it's been
changed let's see if we can see what
that difference is
and here what it's saying essentially is
that we have a comment column that
exists in the HR version but not in the
SVC repository and the results of this
comparison can be used to create or
generate a change plan which basically
allows me as the DBA to deploy the same
object over and over again rather than
doing it through sequel scripts so let's
look at the data comparison here we can
see that we compared a reference in a
candidate database the HR to the SVC and
let's see if we can see what the results
of the differences were so here that the
reference scheme of the Scot employee
table and the candidate and Scot
employee table are not equal there's one
not identical row let's see what those
what the not identical row is and again
and what it is here we can see that the
employee seventy-nine 34 the salary has
changed between the reference and the
candidate so that particular value
within the database has been updated
Enterprise Manager 12 collects patch
information and through its integration
with my Oracle support offers patch
recommendations to see recommended
patches as well as create patch plans go
to the provisioning and patching patches
and updates screen here we see the patch
recommendations broken down by
classification or by target type the
upgrade planner the patch search and
pache plans let's take a quick look at
the recommended recommended patches here
we can see a list of patches recommended
by Enterprise Manager for targets or
databases that are already under
management by Enterprise Manager to take
advantage of one of these recommended
patches I can select one or more patches
and click Add to plan and I can add to
an existing plan or create a new plan
using the selected patch a patch plan is
nothing more than a one or more patches
to be applied against one or more
targets in the same job let's take a
look at a patch plan to see a little
more details about that an Enterprise
Manager 12 offers a five-step wizard
walk the user through the process of
creating a patch plan to begin with
would the user can create give it a name
and a description and then we can see
the patches that come from the
recommended list like we were seeing
before or I can implicitly add patches
here manually and I can see that this is
going to be applied against three
different database targets I then get an
option to pick how these patch is going
to be deployed and Enterprise Manager 12
offers a new option for patching that's
now recommended which is the out of
place patching option and out of place
patching reduces the downtime required
to apply patches to a databases because
essentially we copy the Oracle home and
apply the patch to the Oracle home the
copy of the Oracle home and only after
that patches excessively applied to the
copy do we switch the running databases
from the old to the cloned date the
cloned Oracle home this significantly
reduces the downtime of the database
during the patch cycle once I have
completed successfully completed the
deployment options Enterprise Manager
we'll run an analysis of this patch plan
which essentially validates things like
prerequisites and that ol patch is up to
date on all the hosts to ensure the
highest possible likelihood that this
patch or these set of patches will be
successfully applied to the targets that
are part of this patch plan once
analysis is successfully completed I
have the option to deploy it directly or
schedule it for a later date and I can
also save this as a template this gives
me the option to reuse the configuration
in this patch plan for use for again two
different targets again helping
standardize the patch deployment process
as we have seen Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c contains a complete and
robust set of features to help customers
manage their databases throughout their
entire lifecycle this includes the
ability to automatically discover hosts
and targets including databases
standardization of deployments by using
deployment procedures including
provisioning profiles it includes change
in patch plans for applying multiple
changes with minimal downtime and a
sophisticated set of configuration
management features including new
advanced features from acquired
technologies it's a comprehensive
solution for compliance management now
including real-time change detection and
with its integration with my Oracle
support provides centralized and in
context information to the DBAs thank
you for watching this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
