application named say hello and I want
to create an Oracle service bus
application that will virtualize the
composite I start by creating the
application giving it a meaningful name
then I create the project within the
application in service bus use folders
to organize project files I create one
in my project to store whizzed all
documents service bus will need a copy
of the whiz doll for the say hello
composite to interact with it at runtime
to import the wisdom I provide the
location where the so application is
deployed and the wizard retrieves a copy
of the file service bus tries to include
any dependencies named in any artifacts
it imports hear the wisdom references a
schema file which is included in the
import next I create a business service
the business service defines the end
point at which the service bus
application will communicate with the
ssoas service this is one place the
imported wisdom file will be used the so
a service communicates with soap over
HTTP so to create the business service I
add an HTTP adapter after naming the
service I associate it with the say
hello wisdom file this time I point to
the local copy of the file I imported
earlier the transport and endpoint URI
have been automatically filled in
configuration of the business service is
complete pipelines define message
routing transformation logic and other
message handling options a pipeline can
be given a meaningful name like the
business service the pipeline references
the imported wisdom creating the
pipeline also triggers the creation of a
proxy service the proxy service provides
the interface that service consumers use
to connect with back-end services
through service bus the soul composite
communicates with soap over HTTP but
service bus can be used to provide a
rest interface to the so application
default resource paths and rest
operations
to find but I can edit these defaults or
create new ones as needed the operation
binding request can also be tailored
I've given the input parameter a more
meaningful name the response can be
tailored to I've configured the response
message to use JSON instead of XML when
the configuration of the rest binding is
complete the application exposes both
soap and rest interfaces it's time to
test those interfaces I provide sample
input and execute the test I examine the
output because it's what I expected I
repeat the process to test the rest
interface I again provide data and I
observe the expected JSON result both
service bus interfaces work as intended
