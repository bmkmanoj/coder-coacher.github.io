and after all the troubles so I hope
this will be a great presentation and I
am Suseela bored so we're going to do
this joint presentation on we're going
to talk about open UDK onboarding how to
get more developers on it how you can
help get more developers on board and
I'm gonna talk about about different
things that we're doing and in what
direction we're going so we'll hope that
technology is with us always there could
you help me find out turn the slides so
I'll I'll go first
oh and before you even know me yeah I
have this perfect slide to just let you
know that you shouldn't trust anything I
say or at least face purchasing
decisions on it no so this is what it's
about
kind of a bunch of dukes wanting to help
out this is what we're at and I don't
know what you see when I show you this
picture but I get mixed reactions from
some people like Ben and martinis like
great we'll have a lot of help for
people in the community and we're be
able to do anything for other peoples
kind of working heads down getting JDK 8
out on time it's like oh is there more
people that I need to help out and how
do I do this getting really stressed
about everything and that's kind of what
JDK onboarding is about handling the
expectations from both sides making sure
that we can handle newcomers that feel
that contributing to Java is out of
reach with the documentation and saying
what are the step by steps you should
take to contribute to Java and then also
help people inside to see how can I help
the community without it affecting my
kind of everyday work so this is a Java
developer onboarding
this is where we run and get at kind of
a structured way in anyway and they we
like to use the pyramid the three of us
this is a way to kind of make sure that
we structure the tasks that we have that
are all about contributing to Java to
the Java platform making sure that we
structure it and label it is this an
easy task
it's a isn't a complex task is it a
super advanced task and then make the
same things with the people that are
contributing are you a skilled what
competence
do you have what experience do you have
and then kind of mapping them together
making everyone see where should I go
how should I help and helping each other
to to do that so I'm Cecilia Borg and I
work for Oracle and I've done that for
the past ten years or I've been working
with Java for the past ten years anyway
I'm based out in Stockholm I am work in
donald smith's organization in product
management and working with open JDK
onboarding the past ten years I've been
working with jaebeum's I just recently
moved over to product management I've
been working on our code a rocket in the
Stockholm office they're having a great
time the past two years two or three
years I guess with the addition of
hotspot so that's kind of the world as I
know it from the JVM and about looking
looking up from the JVM
yeah this is also something that I do
I'm a scout leader for girls and boy
scouts are mostly for Scouts leaders and
that's one of my passions
I got a passion for work for Java that's
why I'm still here after 10 years
contributing to the largest the software
platform in the world and I know that
the ones of you who are here tonight
also have a passion for Java I come from
kind of closed the closed side of this
I've been working for BA on j-rock and
I've been working for Oracle on Jan
rocket and hotspot and then suddenly
we're an open JDK open source so in my
team so my manager Don Smith has an open
source background with eclipse for seven
years he knows everything about open
source deliver tapash with some of you
people know have a deep passion
enthusiasm and genuine understanding of
open source
I'm the closed source person yeah I
understand the engineering organization
and Oracle so I kind of standing in
between trying to see what can we do
what should we do and how can we get
that done what makes sense for the
internal organization and how to get
that out so I'm kind of an enabler or
facilitator so that's that's my rolling
and the whole of this
so talking a bit about some things that
I guess you think is evident you won't
even know why I'm telling you this but I
just want to say how I think we should
approach some of this those hundreds of
thousands of Duke coming in if they if
they want to help they need to they need
to do that in a way that scales and we
know that in the top of the pyramid
among the advanced users and reviewers
and everything they're not that many
people and if they're going to review
and test and help out with all the
changes we're going to run out of time I
will never get JDK a doubt that we'll
never get anything else out either what
we want is for the reviewer to get top
quality changes to make sure that it's
easy to review everything that's coming
in for the contributor that means that
they should have the test results and
test logs to make sure that their their
contribution is okay and correct
mistakes and everything so they need
kind of an infrastructure and
information that we this is something
that we need to do these are kind of the
first steps in order for this to scale
at all
so what we're doing now in looking at
and what's on everyone's mind right now
is infrastructure infrastructure
infrastructure everyone knows that kind
of bug system wiki's building testing
everything that's where we're at so I
want to show you kind of a possible open
JDK scenario that we have yeah that we
could be thinking about in the future
it's it's a rough high-level one and on
the left side you see what what's in the
open and on the right side you see kind
of what's distribution specific what's
at Red Hat or Oracle or IBM or whoever
has a distribution so starting at the
top well we should have a bug system and
it should be in the open so we know that
so hopefully we'll have the JIRA bug
system in the open as the next step
that's the kind of the first one then
you need to kind of configure to be able
to configure and build easily on your
machines on your local machines and we
have the build in for a project for that
who has been working very hard the past
year and a half or whatever it is to
make sure that it's fast you can fast
configure and build both full builds and
incremental build as you develop so
that's also going to speak into the
future the building for project and then
you need local tests something to just
make sure that you to sanity test your
code changes right now we have the JT
red suite and that will be complemented
with other frameworks wherever we find
them and decide and what makes sense
performance testing JVM testing whatever
we think is needed after that you'd
probably need somewhere to build on
multiple platforms assume that you don't
have a test form or something
but you'd probably kind of need to get
get help on that so building and test
firms on multiple platforms in some way
somewhere just to make sure that it
builds and is that it that it works
depending on what technology you're
building and then when when you have a
code fix each of these steps this is an
iterative process so for each step you
can find out that you have some problems
in your code and might have to go back
again back and forth so you go up and
down on this most probably you won't
kind of have a clean go through this for
the on the first time but when you have
a conflict when you're confident that
you have a clean code change you have to
send it in somewhere to get achievements
tested with security tests and you know
whatever the closed and features are
somewhere so somewhere we need to kind
of cross the line to the distribution
specific things so send it in for for
additional code testing or whatever you
need for your for your code change but
when you passed this now the time is to
kind of send it in for a real with you
to someone who actually can and can look
at this and that's when you come to the
code with UI and will probably have a
good tool for that in the future as well
we don't know what it is yet but it's
probably good after that we'll submit
the code and the great regression tests
and all the good things that you've done
we'll submit it into mercurial or
whatever a source code system that we
have then and after that it will go into
some kind of distribution specific to
testing with some QA system for the
distribution that you want to deliver it
into so this is the workflow this is
kind of its drive of the workflow that
we're looking at and we haven't
identified all the pieces yet but that's
you heard on other talks this is what
we're discussing right now with everyone
and a partnership partners and IBM
redheads and this is what we're
discussing this is what's happening for
everyone laying the ground structure of
open dedicate right now yeah yeah I
think so since we're having so much
problems with a projector I think well
I'll just finish off this yeah okay so
next let's see what that is okay so for
the building for a project if you're at
all interested in building front you
should go and see this man
this is mr. built in front his name is
Frederic ashram and his session is
tomorrow at 11:30 building large Java
projects faster multi-core Java and make
file integration so this is the place
and he's the one who's been designing
and working for this for a long time
okay and this is just the building for
the local thing that it's so that's so
simple to use that's going to be
available on all platforms by the end of
the year so right now it's on our
separate branch but it's moving into JDK
8 as we speak and it will be finished
and it's available on Linux Mac and all
the supported platform so this is an
example of Mac and where you see kind of
first download the code and on the next
slide configure and it will help you as
an interactive process to make you
configure your machine and we'll do it
automatically and download whatever you
need a new configuration has been
successfully installed and then make
images and it will quickly build and
we've made sure that it's much faster
than before and really anyone can handle
it both on Mac and Windows and Linux
Linux is kind of our main platform so if
you're on Mac Linux then everything will
work immediately but the other ones work
as well and then you see well in the
seven minutes we've built some images
that shows you open data key runtime I
thought this morning
and we're going to have a little press
later so we can skip this line now the
infrastructure focus of 2013 so as of
Wednesday we have switched over the bug
system to the Future bug system that's
JIRA and finally so next year it's going
to be that focus of getting this into
the open and that's a huge project I can
tell you and not only that we're going
to connect all the tools and processes
that we have we're going to connect that
into this bike system and it's written
in Java so anyone can kind of develop
plugins or to its and that's what we're
going to do to make sure that we adopt
everything to it yes
yeah so whenever we go open on this yeah
I'm sure that there will be plenty of
room for help from the community on on
JIRA as well
Thanks
and also we're going to have a new code
review system to make sure that we don't
have to send e-mails back and forth then
upload the diffs and so on so to make
that easier and that's the kind of
primary focus of infrastructure for next
year the quality focus of next year is
just to make more things open in summary
we're doing intense discussion with
everyone else with all the partners and
how to make what tools what testing how
should we do this what is the right
thing and inviting the community as well
so yeah this is the main focus for
everything okay let's get this yes so
what I'm saying now is I've given you a
brief overview of what onboarding is
about and what we're trying to do you
trying to make this in a structured way
to make sure that we set expectations
for all sides know that newcomers know
where to go experience know how to level
through this system and for everyone so
we're not wasting anyone's time and how
to do this and welcome a lot of ideas
and anything that you need anything that
you kind of see is important so let me
know and this is my twitter handle and
my email address so let me know if
there's something that we can do so with
that I have invited Joe Darcy to just
show you a demo of the new bug system
just to see if it's real it does exist
even if it's not in the open yet
all right thank you so my name is Joe
Darcy again for JDK 7 I did project coin
but the last six months or so I've been
working on getting us off of the Sun
internal legacy bug system onto JIRA so
now we have this sending you juror
instance that we're using as the system
of record internally since most people
are familiar with JIRA we're organizing
the bugs into a number of projects so
out of the gate we're having the code
tools project that corresponds to the
code tools open J open JDK project that
was approved a few months ago so once
the system is externalized open JDK
project all the option of having a
corresponding bug tracking project
created for them in the open JDK JIRA
instance the second project Java
incidents that will be one of the
replacements for the facilities provide
by bugs EPS uncom so incoming incidents
will come into the incidents project
will they'll be triage there and one of
the terminal States after that triage
will be moving them can be moving them
into the jdk project and will set up
again when it's externalized roles so
people can do that we previously had
external community members expressed
interest in helping the triage so once
that externalize we'll see how that goes
to help review the incoming stream of
bugs and we will try to put systems in
place to screen out the minecraft
crashes minecraft is very popular we
know this because there are over 40,000
crashes filed with us it's mostly bad
graphics drivers and things like that so
it's not directly related to job and
we've tried to work with the Minecraft
people to let people know
please stop filing isn't this issue
finally we have the jdk project i
blogged about this last week there are
approximately 150,000 issues
going into this project so this is the
project most people will be working on
most the time as you can see the
projects have little theming so each
project gets thrown a little Duke these
are crazy Jeff Dinkins helps tell things
apart likewise for the JDK project and
if you've used your uh there's a very
nice shoes navigator see so we can find
my bugs helpful autocomplete equals
Darcy type the system let me make this a
little smaller so it
there comes back past you know there's
about thirty hundred bugs that I worked
on over the years so we have a few
customizations I'll just mention one
briefly we have components that's a
built in facility in JIRA most of our
components correspond to broad library
areas for instance core lives and we
also have a sub component feature which
is custom plugin rheton and the sub
component names are generally the
package names so it's very easy to find
where a bug goes in the new system you
know the broad product area and then if
you know the package name that's pretty
much where it goes so for instance we
have the Java outlying component for
bugs up some comm assume we've all seen
this over the years I certainly have to
find information about both publicly
currently this system is backed by the
legacy bug tracker within the your
nearest future we will replace this
being backed back by the JIRA system
instead but so the page will look
roughly similar but some of the
terminology will change to your eyes it
and the bugs in JIRA will look as you'd
expect and the customizations you'd
expect so instance the components up
with the punc component are displayed
next to each other so although I've been
biased by leading up the project I do
think the system is easy to use and has
lots of features and I'm looking forward
to the time we can have it available
externally outside of the firewall there
any questions about that I don't know
when it's going to happen
yes
and
if the jsr has wanted to use a project
it was a jdk related jsr and they wanted
to use an issue trap a project that that
would be an acceptable use for that if
they one or two of you specific tracker
so let me just add something to that
so um sometimes people aren't always
clear about the way that their cells
work
the majority of jail cells are not
platform dinosaurs so when people think
about Gesell's they think about things
which modified the java language itself
and that's actually the rare exceptions
so the things which bundle up into the
jars which become the jars which
describe se7 or SCA or SC 9 or actually
only a tiny fraction of them most Jets
are actually implemented as libraries
and so this is specific infrastructure
for the open JDK project so while there
is an overlap and probably quite a
confusing one it isn't necessarily that
large general generally speaking I mean
I think you you might see more like that
between a specific mercurial forest or a
mercurial project and a JIRA project
that might be if that might be a better
capital character characterization and
it might well be the case that for
example a future platform JSON but we
have landed stay for example that there
will be issues around around lambda that
went into their own sub project but
that's really a function of the way the
source code repositories work role in
the way that the chair salsa structure
right will
yes well well that getting some more
documentation about the system is one of
the many things that's you before we
externalise it more to answer those
questions yeah I don't know I think
there might be some volunteers if such a
mayor were offered thank you very much
for showing us that
and we know what to
and everything so that's why I think
that it's really important that we
listen in now it's been a Martine talked
a bit about what they've done with my I
found said their experiences and what
they found from it and I really hope
that we can get their products to kind
of fly off and we can spread it to more
jag some best people know what it is
because it may be good
yes it's been interesting process so
this all came out of us in London
because we were we could have got a seat
on the JCPS committee which is
outstanding flooding and that need us to
wanting to look at Genesis a particular
developer involvement all right that's
better so yeah so we quickly found that
we had an awful lot of developers who
wanted to work on Java itself so you
deny and a few others who have some more
experience on the open JDK or at least
looked at it decided well how hard can
that be right so we sat down and tried
to build the JDK several emails with
Delabar and others later and about two
or three weekends later we finally
managed to build the damn thing and so
we realized that although we wanted to
participate with lots of developers and
submitting lots of little bug fixes it
just simply wasn't technically feasible
yet we were then made aware of the the
new building for project rolling in and
we swapped over to using that and and
with some other feedback that we put in
and fixes other fixes made we ended up
now with a virtual machine that we have
and a set of instructions which means
any developer who's has never even heard
of the open JDK before can get up and
running it about I know under an hour
anyway so out of the back of that we've
been running in conjunction with
Cecilia's help and other folks as well
these buggers on hack days basically
where we you know get about 20
developers in a room we've given the
virtual image all the instructions to
build on their own operating system if
they're so inclined and so brave and we
just go and tackle really really small
things so Java Beck warnings
using some of Joe's great new job as
different features on Java itself right
so using the diamond operator using the
it's been a very long day try other
resources that's exactly got kick
thinking of the Blum and c-sharp name
for it which is evil and wrong to say
they using clause is bad well we're just
and and even applying some of the older
features in Java so enhance for loops
generics those sorts of things so in
order to get people familiar with was
fairly complicated code base we have a
whole host of these bugger films and
theory planned out we are starting to
find that we're now heading the next
barriers of pushing patches back to
various open JDK projects learning which
patch goes where what what lead and that
project to contact etc and being good
programmers we're trying to automate all
that so our next real projects before we
run the next set of bag of thorns is to
script an Automator a whole bunch of
that type of stuff yeah I mean to me did
the the really interesting thing is it's
just to to realize that that a lot of
developers are really intimidated by the
Aquajet kick at the keiko base I mean
they want to help and they want to be
part of it but they're they're kind of
scared and on the other side you know we
know that the people that are actually
you have commit bit and have commit
status a very finite bandwidth so on
both sides of this problem you know you
kind of have to manage expectations as
Cecilia says but you also need to figure
out how you can how you can actually
work with the dynamics of each group
it's the whole point of the pyramid
model is that at each level you know you
kind of lose a lot of the people you had
at the last level so you are not gonna
get you know someone who's Brian gets or
John Rose status they will be hacking on
the VM completely off the bat everybody
needs to kind of level up and not
everybody who starts down that process
is actually going to complete it and
that's okay I mean that's that's the
nature of open-source development
people find their own level and they
scratch their own itches that's the way
it works that's the way it's supposed to
work and there's nothing wrong with that
so instead of which by having you know
things like by the thongs and these
warnings act days where you can just get
people to get over their fear of rooting
around in the codebase yeah the number
of people that have never even opened up
the implementation of hash map and just
seen how hash map is implemented inside
the libraries I mean it's pure Java code
there's no scary C++
there's nothing in there which is which
is very far beyond the means of the
average Java developer and yet very few
people have done it and so you know to
to reignite that curiosity to get people
to just you know to just dig a little
bit deeper and actually find out what it
looks like and to get over that fear and
from there to start doing things like
just fixing your warning it's it's quite
an interesting process to watch people
going through that and but from that
what you find is that there's a there's
a filtering out and there's a certain
you know smaller percentage of people
that go on from being able to just fix
warnings to do something more we go
through JDK but at the same time if it's
if it's correctly managed and correctly
set up you're still getting value you
know you put the individual developers
that are contributing feel like they're
contributing they feel like they're
doing something interesting in being
useful and that means they're re-engaged
with the platform they're re-engaging it
for the universe they're finding what
they're doing in their their work with
the couple interesting again so that's
in that game and we're getting a small
amount of benefit from the community and
then you also start to get to know that
smaller group of people who are
potentially gonna be able to go on and
mate make more and larger changes and
that's how you have the next level of
the pyramid and so it goes on so from
that it's just a filtering process to
find the people who who are gonna be the
next generation of technical leaders so
in us in some sense it's it's no
different to managing any other
technical community which has has
potentially large appeal but we're
actually you need you need people at
different levels now I think you know I
think we are starting to make some some
good progress with it I think one of the
things we definitely do need to do more
of is to figure out how to make it more
replicable we want this thing to be
easily spread to other
scripts around the world and to also to
be able to embed it inside corporates
you know why not I mean a large
corporation in a user booth you know
many times logical questions have
internal communities and it's just a
question of learning how to access them
and learning huge dirty I think there's
an awful lot we can we can do with this
I guess you know we just have to figure
out how we have it spread it out beyond
the initial groups that we that we have
it's quite fun actually because we can
you know challenge the java user group
members to find find as many of mark
Reinholds bugs as possible and fix them
and blog about it sir
he's not here it's a shame you know
where that one we yeah we we've we've
we've we've abused just Joshin up over
the last couple years okay
yeah i guess the only other thing to
comment and I think both Ben and Celia
mentioned as well we ourselves have been
fear that we don't want to flood the
openjdk with a thousand enthusiastic
Java user group members and you know
have Brian Gertz sitting there answering
999 individual emails asking them how to
compile the open JDK so one of the
things we're trying to be very strict
about is to filter out all those sorts
of questions with us ourselves and the
community up front before we before we
go flood busy you Oracle and other
vendor people who are getting Java but
but my earlier point I mean that that
really is no different from any other
logic and source project I mean you know
the number of committers with as a ratio
compared to the number of active
community members is always vanishingly
small you know it's not like there isn't
prior art that we can use for this kind
of community management that totally is
it's just a question of making sure that
we have the right structures in place
you know to make sure that both the
community is encouraged and continues to
be engaged and to participate but also
to make sure the connectors lives aren't
made difficult by other people's
well-meaning over-enthusiasm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
