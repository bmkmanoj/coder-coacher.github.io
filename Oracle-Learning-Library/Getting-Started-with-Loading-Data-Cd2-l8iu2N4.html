several tools are available
download and install from Oracle
technology Network and use Oracle bi
cloud service data sync to load
relational tables and flat files from
on-premises sources you can create a new
project or open one that you've
previously created a project is a
workspace that defines and organizes the
source files or relational tables target
tables and indexes multiple projects can
be used to isolate data loaded to the
cloud the first time that you run data
sync you should set system properties to
customize how it will work
in your environment and configure email
notifications for data upload success or
failure you also need to define the
source and target connections the source
connections direct data sink to the
on-premises data sources to be uploaded
the target connection is the connection
to Oracle bi cloud service you load data
to a project workspace that contains
relational tables or views sequel query
overrides or comma separated values
source files for relational tables all
column attributes and index attributes
are loaded data sync supports relational
sources that include oracle oracle x 10
DB 2 ms sequel server my sequel and
Teradata
data can also be uploaded by using a
sequel query for example if your
underlying data contains a large number
of detailed records that should be pre
aggregated prior to uploading
a comma-separated value file is the
third type of data source that you can
load select the CSV file and the import
options for the attributes name the
table and select the columns once your
data is loaded you can use Data Sync to
create jobs to schedule execute and
monitor load processes schedule
additional jobs monitor a job as it runs
and review job history you can use
programmatic methods for loading data as
well use the Oracle bi cloud service
REST API to define or customize your own
API and programmatically load
on-premises data the REST API supports
typical HTTP methods for objects such as
get put post delete and timestamp sequel
developer is an additional tool that you
can use to load data from an Oracle
database sequel developer employs a
series of restful web service calls to
expedite the bulk loading of relational
data you create connections to the
relational sources drag and drop the
relational table or view into the cart
and then deploy the source to the cloud
if you use sequel developer to create a
new table then you must use data modeler
to add the new table to the model before
creating reports from the data if you
load data into an existing table then
the data is available for immediate use
and reports such as those created by
using visual analyzer and on dashboards
now you know how to load data to the
cloud using Data Sync the REST API and
sequel developer thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
