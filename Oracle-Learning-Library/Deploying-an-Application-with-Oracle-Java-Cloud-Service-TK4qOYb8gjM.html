users to learn more about their benefit
options with just a few clicks they can
query their holiday schedule and see
information about their health care
providers this portal is a web
application running on an Oracle Java
cloud service instance today I'll show
you how to use Java cloud service with
the Oracle WebLogic server console to
deploy and test applications like this
I'll deploy the effort
from a WebLogic server console for this
particular Java cloud service instance
note that in this example I have a load
balancer enable
to login I'll use the WebLogic server
administrator credentials created when
the service instance was provisioned
before I start with deployment I want to
prevent other users from modifying my
session while I'm working on it so I'll
lock it next I'll display all currently
deployed applications and begin the
installation process I'll upload the
application from my filesystem
with the benefits application uploaded I
can proceed I'll verify that benefits is
being deployed as an application and
ensure that it will be deployed across
my cluster I'll accept the installation
defaults and install it once benefits is
on the list of deployments I know it's
available I'll start the application and
activate my changes but then if its
application should be deployed running
but just to be sure I'll test it before
I go any further to test the application
I'll first need three pieces of
information the load balance for content
endpoint for the service instance the
application is deployed on and the
context group for this application which
I can find on the benefits application
settings page on the web logic server
console to test it I'll just copy the
content and point into a browser and the
context root
and here's the benefits page I'll just
make a few selections here and I can see
that the application was deployed
successfully to learn more about
deploying applications and other aspects
