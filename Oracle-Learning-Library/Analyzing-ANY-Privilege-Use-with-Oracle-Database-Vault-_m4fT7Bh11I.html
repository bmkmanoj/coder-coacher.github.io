for oracle server technologies in this
video you see how to analyze the use of
the read any table system privilege by
following the tasks outlined in the
slide the product documentation also
shows this tutorial step by step let's
meet the team and understand their roles
and privileges beatrix is the DB void
account manager and she has been granted
the DV account MGR role Pat Smith is the
DBA with privileges to ground roles and
system privileges to other users pet has
been grounded the owner authorization
for the Oracle system privilege and role
management we are paula has been granted
the capture get min rule so that she can
use the DBMS privileged capture package
for privileged analysis and finally ape
he works for each arm and has access to
the employees table which is the target
of this privileged analysis login to
Sigma plus is a user who has been
granted the DV account manager role
create user accounts for this tutorial
next login s the DBA user and provide
privileges and roles for the users the
PA admin user will create the privilege
analysis that will analyze the read any
table of the app user as the PA admin
user create the privilege analysis here
type specifies that it is a
context-based condition the condition
specifies a condition of a boolean
expression that must evaluate to troll
so that the policy can take effect in
this case the condition checks if the
session user is the app user then un
able the policy connect as the app user
who has the read any table system
privilege and execute a query of the HR
employees table
you must disable the policy before you
can generate a report that captures the
actions of the app user generate the
report clearly the DBA used proofs view
and you see that the read any table
privileged worst used in this query
still connected as the PA admin user
dropped this privilege analysis policy
and this database account manager drop
the tutorial users this concludes the
video accompanying the tutorial
analyzing the any privilege use thanks
