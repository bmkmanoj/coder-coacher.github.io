and today i'm going to show you how to
create your own application using the
Java ME SDK
choose file new project from the menu or
you can click on the new project icon in
the toolbar the kind of project we want
to create is a mid P application type in
a name for your application and uncheck
the create hello midlet checkbox later
on we'll create our own midlet
click finish
the Java ME SDK creates an empty project
for you the application is going to use
the fluid user interface toolkit and so
we need to add that to the project
control click on resources choose add
library select looat from the list and
click add library and if you go expand
the resources you can see that Luud is
now part of our project
the next thing to do is to create a
midlet class which is code that actually
makes up our application control click
on source packages and choose new midlet
here we need to fill in the human
readable name for the midlet class name
and the package where the class will
live
the Java ME SDK creates the source file
for us and fills in a trivial midlet
implementation this will build but it
doesn't do anything so we're going to
add some code so that you can see
something on the screen first we're
going to import the LeWitt API s and
then in Start app we're going to
initialize little create a simple form
and show that form on the screen the
next step of course is to build this and
run it but before we do that I want to
show you how to enable the output window
so that you can see what's going on as
the project is building from the window
menu you choose output and then output
again or you can use the keyboard
shortcut F for now to build this midlet
build this project and package it up and
run it in the emulator all you need to
do is press on the Run button or you can
use the keyboard shortcut f6
the application shows up in this
clamshell feature phone emulator now you
can probably see the whole thing on your
screen and you can see here's our simple
forum title on the screen so that's
great
I would like to run this on a different
emulator so I'm going to ctrl click on
the project and choose properties and in
the platform pane here there's a device
combo box and you can choose different
devices to run on using the emulator so
I'm going to choose default CLD CMS a
phone one
say okay and run this thing again this
time it shows up in the emulator we
selected which you can see has a larger
screen but still our code that we wrote
is running on the screen here and the
simple form title is there this example
is not too exciting so I'm going to
replace this midlet with the sample code
from the Java ME SDK getting started
article which you can find online and
then I'll just run this again it
compiles it packages runs in the
emulator this example shows off some of
LeWitt's capabilities really only the
tip of the iceberg you can see we've
added some color and right here there's
a menu of options that demonstrate new
its animated transitions I'm going to
use my arrow keys to navigate through
this menu and the enter key to simulate
the select button so that shows a slide
transition to go back to the menu I'm
going to press this soft button here but
I'm going to use the keyboard shortcut
so the shortcut for this button is f1
the shortcut for this one is f2 so I'm
going to press f1 let's go back to the
menu and then I'll just show you fade
transition the cube and the rotate so
there you have it you now know how to
create your own project using the Java
ME SDK and how to run it in the emulator

videos available online and the Java NDS
getting started document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
