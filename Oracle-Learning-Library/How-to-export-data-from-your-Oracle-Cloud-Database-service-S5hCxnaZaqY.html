when we created the SFTP user account in
this demonstration will show you how to
export data from the Oracle cloud
service so let's start out from the my
services page there's various tabs the
overview tab tells me information that I
need for this exercise and that is the
service SFTP details so I'm going to
need several items from this one is SFTP
host yeah there's the port number and
I'm going to need the username so here
we have this user name I can go ahead
and copy that I want to point out to you
for instance one the reasons you might
want to use SFTP is to conduct data
export so you can click on the data
export tab I've already requested some
data exports here that I'll walk through
that again so you click on the export
data and go ahead and make your
selections here whether you just want
the data structures or the data as well
click create data export and that will
process for a bit so give that some time
and then while you're waiting on that
you need to have a filezilla or a win
SCP file transfer protocol client setup
to go ahead and download the export from
your database cloud service ok so I went
ahead and pulled up my filezilla ftp
client here remember I told you knew
that information so here's house we'll
go back to the overview tab
also shows up in the email when you sign
up for the service some of this
information but when you're already in
to service you can just pick it up here
from overview tab so SFTP host and I
copy and paste that here and then use
your name again while we're going to use
this trial a 32 so I can just go ahead
and copy and paste that here okay so
remember i reset my password in the
previous demo so I'm going to use that
reset password here and port number
should be 22 indeed 22 so i'll just type
that in then we'll connect to the DB
service password is case-sensitive this
shows you the remote side I'm connected
to you so this is my database cloud
service and over here is my local
machine so what I can do if I can go
ahead and click on the download folder
here take this DMP file that was
exported from the cloud service double
click on that to initiate the transfer
take just a moment here you can see the
progress of that transfer which is
occurring right now I just have it set
to download to my desktop
okay so that finished successful
transfers one and here it is right here
so it did indeed transfer to the DMP
file from the Oracle cloud service to my
local directory specifically a desktop
and that's it once you have your SFTP
account user setup you can export data
you can also import data from your local
to the database cloud service so let's
recap first locate service SFTP user
account details you can perform a data
export from your service then use FTP
client and your SFTP account to download
your data export locally and please
remember to share the SFTP user name and
password with designated administrators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
