I am going to show you how to deploy and
undeploy an application to an Oracle
Java cloud service instance using the
Oracle WebLogic server to get started
with I have an Oracle Java cloud service
instance up and running with a
configured load balancer and a java web
application archive as a war file on my
local machine
to start with I open the WebLogic server
console you might get an unsafe
connection warning but proceed anyway in
the login page I provide the credentials
that I specified when creating the
instance this locks me into the Oracle
WebLogic
administration console I click lock and
edit from preventing other accounts to
make changes when I'm editing my session
under the domain structure
I select deployment where I chose to
install a deployment I click a flurry of
files to upload my java web application
as a deployment archive
and proceed I see that my application
has been uploaded
and I choose to install this deployment
as an application I'm making my
application available to all the targets
on the cluster I choose to leave the
default deployment settings as is and
click finish I see a message that the
deployment has been successfully
installed and in the deployments table
the status of the application is
distribute initialized and I activate
all the changes after activating all the
changes when status of the application
turns from distribute initializing to
prepare I would like to start the reason
on the request for this application
and see that the start request have been
sent to selected deployments now I'd
like to test if my application has been
properly deployed I navigate to the Java
cloud service console under which click
on my instance and save an IP address
for the load balancer and I'm from the
port 8081 I should ideally have my
benefits application deployed I can see
my application deployed successfully now
close the benefits tab now I'm going to
show you how to under fly the
application click lock and edit if not
have done already select the application
and click on for stop now proceed with
stopping the deployment
and see a message that selective
deployments have been requested to stop
after the delivery application
check the confirmation message that the
Selective deployments were deleted and
activate all the changes now the
application has been unemployed this
brings us to the end of the tutorial on
deploying a web application to Oracle
JCS instance using WebLogic server thank
you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
