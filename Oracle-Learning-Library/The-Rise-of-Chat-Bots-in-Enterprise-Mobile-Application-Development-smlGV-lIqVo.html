online in this session I'm talk about
chapters in enterprise mobile
application development I will start
with the introduction of the topic which
is chatbot to then go into details on
how you build chat bots with the Oracle
platform my name is Ron infuse and I'm a
product manager from the Oracle mobile
platform team in our team we're building
a platform for building chat BOTS as
well as mobile back into the service and
a cloud product for this it's mobile
cloud service or in short MCS this
session however is purely on chat pods
so sit back and enjoy my demos in this
session are all based on the new
platform that we're going to release in
2017 so chances are that by the time
that you watch this video this product
hasn't yet released in 2009 Steve Jobs
went on a stage and says there's an app
for that
and he said this because it was excited
about 200,000 apps to that time that
have been in the App Store and that was
two years after the launch of the iPhone
so the first considerable usable
smartphone in 2010 eppley decided to
make this a trademark
however times have changed today we have
two million and more apps in each of the
stores in the App Store and in the
Google Play Store and some on Windows as
well
so this means there's a lot of
competition between apps mobile
applications to be downloaded to the
user's mobile device be the tablet or a
phone now based on a statistic the
average mobile user has 25 applications
that they would download or install on
top of those applications that they
cannot remove and so we're pre-installed
by the vendor of the mobile device or
the provider now based on this 25
applications statistic also say that is
10 that you probably will use and out of
this 10 there are five that you
frequently use and out of these five
problem
to which our social media so what do we
learn out of this first we learn that
applications don't make you rich the
business behind it that is what makes
you rich so an application always
supports a business social media is a
good example so the business of social
media of users interacting with each
other that's a good business model and
so the mobile application helped that
model to make it easy for people to
access if you have a banking business
for example and you have loyal customers
then those loyal customer wouldn't mind
downloading the application in which
case there is no competition to that
because the business makes people
download the app for the rest
competition is on Golden Krishna
released a book and an article in March
2015 where he says the best interface is
no interface what he is basically saying
is that we're over engineering our lives
there are applications out there that
Princeton can unlock the door of a car
the way that it works is that you
actually open an app and then you click
a specific menu item and that will
unlock the car now imagine the situation
will come out of a supermarket with bags
of food I don't know how it is for you
my mobile always is in the wrong pocket
so you're doing some kind of limbo just
to get your mobile application out of
your pocket and then oh it's locked so
you have to unlock the screen if it's by
fingerprint you more have it easy if
that fails you have to provide the pin
then you swipe you tap on the
application and then probably in the
menu you have to look for how to unlock
the door you can imagine that there
would be an easier interface for that
one will see a guess Chur with your arm
or with a leg will open up the trunk or
where approach in the car will actually
make it pop open while I don't agree
that the best interface is no interface
I would think a simple interface is what
we're going for
so we should look
mobile for interfaces that are easy to
learn easy to understand and that just
do the work and this introduction
actually leads me to the topic that I'm
talking about and that chatbots fit in
which is conversation conversation is
the most natural form of communication
and as humans we practice this for so
long if you go on a conference on a
training or just if you're in the office
have a look at the people that holding a
cup of coffee or tea immediately they
start chatting people who tend to be
smokers when standing outside and
smoking they talk to everyone yeah so
it's a natural thing for us to have a
conversation it's not a selective thing
for us to work within an application so
the question is how can we take the most
natural form of communication and put
that into an interface or use it as an
interface that allows us to perform
business tasks chatbots
actually do exactly this chat with our
virtual users that are programmed to
assist real users on the conversational
interface so here we use a non
technology related specific interface
but we use natural language just to make
something happen on a remote server now
that could be anything that could be
ordering a flight that could be
canceling a flight that could be asking
for the weather that could be arranging
an appointment that could be anything
because chat pods actually as we will
see can do real work chiapas however are
not replacing mobile applications they
are extending mobile opportunities to
the conversational interface of course
to some degree they will make mobile
application not necessary for larger
parts of your business so they're
extending it they're simplifying it and
they give you an opportunity to reach
out to those users that normally you
wouldn't reach coming back to the two
million application in the App Store now
today
if you have a loyal customer as I
mentioned they would be happy to
download the application but what if the
customer that you're getting into
contact with is not a loyal customer or
it's not yet even a customer of yours so
how do you get to this customers now
today so called millennial generation
they actually don't download a lot of
applications what they do instead is
they chat so we have a messenger client
installed like Facebook or WeChat or
cake or whatever and they're just
texting the text in each other so that's
their way of communication as in
business you have to be where your users
are or your customers now apparently
they are on a messenger client so by
moving your business to the messenger
client you're extending mobile
opportunities and you're extending your
mobile opportunities to your business
opportunities it's just a new channel of
approaching the modern generation that
is more smartphone and tablet oriented
than the digital immigrants with which
I'm a part of as well so everyone born
after the 1987 is considered to be
digital native and now today we have a
new generation which I would consider
chat native so everything they do is
through chatting chat boards use a very
simple interface it's a natural language
the way that you speak the way that you
talk the way that you text this is what
the chat world will analyze and we'll be
able to transform into service requests
and then as I mentioned they do real
work because in the end they would
invoke a service that will do real work
anything that your business wants to do
starting from selling a product or just
providing good service I guess we all
experience a service hotline once in our
lives now how does it work so first you
dial in using your phone and then you
hear music
complain you hear more music it's not
that that's your favorite music because
there was no selection for that
and then you're asked to make a numeric
choice you do that and then you hear
more music and you make another choice
you hear music give you more music and
then
oh you learned that all agents are busy
oh you asked to stay on the line because
there's more music can you imagine how
this user experience can be modernized
can be more pleasant how about this Lara
Anderson is a sales representative and
she made a change in our business could
be a career or just a change of her
position she needs new business cards so
instead of calling a service hotline or
writing an email she just picks up the
messenger and then she taught typing to
a chat bot and she said I want to
reorder cards and the system will
understand that voice recognition or
natural language recognition and we'll
pull up the business card and we'll say
okay this is the cut that we printed
last time do you want to have the same
by the way we recognize that your title
has changed so we update your business
card and she just uses one of the select
option to go that route changing the
title on the business card so the system
now again updates the card information
with what they find in whatever human
resource back-end system they have show
the new card ask for confirmation ask
for the chip anything address and then
that's it when talking about chat BOTS
there are two type of chat BOTS as I
would see it so one is what I call BOTS
on rail which are mainly menu-driven
BOTS this is like the cold center
structure
you're just being following a specific
process and then they're intelligent
chat BOTS which use free text and voice
so this means like it's you as the user
texting and talking to a chat bot that
they don't mind what is a conversation
that you will start and not a menu at
depression
let's take an example of banking there's
an app for that and there are many
applications for banking every bank
probably has one again not a problem
with lawyer customers however there are
customers don't want to download an
application just to get information
about the banking account the balance or
just to transfer money even now some
people would say what banking on a chat
nah no way
well think back we say the same about
banking on mobile applications we say
the same about banking on the web we say
the same about banking and client-server
it's all just kind of the way that we
look at things technology has evolved
banging on the chat BOTS is a possible
solution let me show you that so we're
in facebook Messenger here it's a chat
bot that we created with this banking
scenario I mentioned so to get started
what Facebook wants me to do is just to
hit this get started button here and
this will activate the chat bot so the
chat bot is invoked by Facebook and it
actually will get my user profile
information so my first main task name
this is how it knows that my name is
Franklin fuse and then it processes the
first state which is just a query the
account that it has about me or for me
and as this is a bot on Rails so our
menu guarded boards it then offers me
options of how to proceed so one of the
option is to view my transactions others
is to transfer money and one is to
contact an agent now contacting a gay
agent in general is a good idea as bots
no matter how intelligent they are they
may not be able to always solve the
problem that people have so they may
want to speak to a real person if that
is on a chat or if that is on the phone
that's up to the implementation so in my
case what I want to do is I want to
transfer money so message sent to the
chat bot and the typical specs as well
you have to account which account you
want to transfer the money from
and now it wants to have the ebon number
for the person I want to send the money
to so I could type that message in or in
my case just paste it in again send it
now how much money do I want to transfer
let's transfer $100 or euro the
beneficiary user well what about Lydia
and description that is for babysitting
so what you see this Chapel is doing it
actually guides me through the process
so there's not of room where I can do
things wrong so now what it does just
for the sake of authorization and
confirmation it summarizes all of the
information it has asks if I want to
perform that money transfer and then I
should provide a digital signature that
I have something I own so let's make it
simple I provide this and now the bank
will send me an SMS with a code that I
will have to put in to confirm the
transaction and this is where security
really comes in and
and this is it what you also can see is
that in a message in Wingo I can just
call back and forth so I could no hit
another account and do another
transformation so I don't have to run
through the same process again the one
thing that I would like to show you is
the options I have because this is
simply text and selections but there's a
lot more that I can do on Facebook and
again the messengers are different here
so if I type in helped in my bot comes
back with some options and we put it
that it shows you what are the layout
options here because this chat but as
you can imagine is for demonstration
purposes so I could have things like
horizontal cards now if you are a
retailer you want to have products
listed here so in this case we have the
members being involved in building this
chat bot so we can also have attachments
so you can have audio files video files
attached to a message so that shows you
that a chat bot not only needs to be
focusing on pure text it can also send
attachments as you would have within the
mobile application so what are the
benefits that businesses and developers
get out of jet board so first of all
gerbils are highly available fast and
intuitive to use mobile platform for
business to consumer interaction at a
very low cost chat BOTS don't need any
kind of training because they're
following conversation style that
everyone understands so it's a very easy
entry for mobile strategy I'm not saying
that you should give up on think about
mobile applications but all I'm saying
is that probably a lot of the use cases
that you have that you want to bring
onto the mobile device can be done with
a chat pod and a chat book is really
easy to build usually chat pods up
cloud-based operations of course this
depends on what then know you're talking
to vendors like Oracle will provide you
a platform on the cloud that allows you
to build chat BOTS the easy way
this has the benefit of centralized
administration and monitoring for
example shed bows are easier to build
than apps because you don't have to
think about different platforms you
don't have to code for iOS you don't
have the code for Windows or for Android
you just build for messaging client and
the messaging client in the end so the
vendor of this messaging client Facebook
or we check they make sure that they
support various devices and operation
system so they are cross-platform by
design and default taking a lot of
burden from the developer so you can
just focus on the technology of choice
like for instance JavaScript if you're
an o developer or Java if you're a Java
developer so let me talk about
intelligent chat bots so we've seen the
banking example as a menu guarded chat
bot sort of on Rails so let me talk
about intelligent chat BOTS the meaning
of words is really what makes us using a
chat bot and what the chat bot needs to
do to understand to process on a
specific task so the meaning of words is
the art of distilling user intents and
data from natural language input for
chat BOTS to invoke actions and return
resume responses so that's kind of the
more accurate definition if you think
about language no matter what language
you speak they're all the same so you
all have nouns they have verbs they have
adjectives they do have a grammar that
puts this all into a sensible order they
do have a lexicon of words and the more
words you understand and speak the more
fluently you are in your communication
and in your thinking and then there is a
context now if I would ask you what is
the highest mountain most likely you
will all say well that's Mount Everest
that's true now let's see how this
changes I tell you that next week I'm in
Switzerland now what is the highest
mountain so I'm setting a context to
Switzerland and now that changes the
context of our conversation too
Switzerland and therefore the highest
mountain no longer is Mount Everest in
this conversation so this is what a
machine will have to understand so the
way that we do this is by using modern
technologies that's natural language
processing and machine learning and this
O'Conner is wrapped up in what we call
artificial intelligence so these are
technologies that you would use by
building a chatbot don't actually have
to build it yourself but actually that
will be used under the covers you think
that's kind of a big stretch no it's not
if you think about Java development Java
department we have the same artifacts as
we have in the language so we do have
classes which are announced
we do have methods which are verbs we do
have properties that are objectives we
do have a syntax which is equivalent to
the grammar and we do have a set a
lexicon of commands and as you know as a
developer the better you know a language
the better the program is that you can
write so we use this concept to
programming BOTS and of course we also
have instances because in Java if you
class as an instance that is a context
to context equals instance so you see
it's not so difficult really to map the
conversational style to a programming
style now natural language processing a
Martian learning what we don't want to
do is this oh Siri
I'm bleeding really bad can you call me
an ambulance Oh from now on I call you
an ambulance okay you see that went
wrong that's not what we want
but what we want is exactly this and
that's a true case from Australia where
Syria really saved the baby's life what
happened is that the baby stopped
breathing so the mother who recognized
it just run to the first floor dropped
the iPhone on the stairs actually hold
the baby and the only things you could
do is to call Siri and ask for an
ambulance and Siri happen to do the
right thing now this is an example of
how machine learning artificial
intelligence voice control
apps work to the benefit of the user and
that's what we're aiming for so how do
we do this how do we make sure that we
always get the right response to a
question let's have a look at the sample
here transfer 100 US dollar from my
default account to Lidia for babysitting
you and I will stand the sentence the
machine has to look into that and have
some has to identify areas of the
sentence that it is trained on so the
first thing is the intent now that's the
verb what is it what I really want to do
I want to transfer 100 US dollar from my
default account this is what we call an
intent to get to this intent we have to
train the machine because the Machine
does not have any experience so most of
the time that's what they do is they get
some example sentences or utterances as
I called as well and based on these
example sentences they know that when a
similar sentence comes in a future that
this needs to be mapped in this case to
the transfer intent so what it builds is
what's called an intent model an intent
model is based on algorithm that takes
input data and predicts an intent and
this is how we get to the action that we
need to follow but there's more in the
sentence than just the transfer 100 US
dollar default account lydian
babysitting our information within that
sentence that you and I would understand
immediately now the machine will have to
be trained on that as well and this is
what we do through entities sounds
similar if you're a Java developer C++
developer or any kind of developer an
entity is a kind of a variable that
holds a specific set of information for
transfer and we'll need to know about
the account that the money comes from
and the amount that the we count the
money goes to so you're creating entity
models so what will happen is that as
soon as the sentence comes in the system
tries the best that it can to get all of
the information that it requires for a
remote service call out of the sentence
if it can't find all of the information
that is needed of course it will have to
ask so that you forget
one hundred US dollar so we'll
understand that you want to transfer
money from default account to Lidia for
babysitting but not how much money so it
will have to ask for that and this is
all that it takes to design a proper
chat but experience the way that you
design a chair but experience is within
the dialogue flow now a dialogue flow is
the script that a call agent in a
service hotline would follow so you have
a use case and you know that this
information you need so you have a
welcoming message then the user would
provide an input and then based on that
you will look into the input and if a
specific information is missing you
would go into another state which
actually then would ask for the
information if you have that information
you will skip this case as simple as
that it's like a slow diagram that you
can see here on the screen so let me
introduce you to Oracle intelligent BOTS
to show you the platform that you would
use to build chat BOTS and you see hot
declaratively this is built in the
beginning of this session I told you
that I would show demos based on a
product that's not yet released this is
Oracle intelligent bot cloud service the
user interface which is completely in a
browser as Noah days it's quite common
that you don't need to have
sophisticated development so we don't
need a development environment for
designing chat BOTS in Oracle
intelligent bot cloud service you see a
couple of chat pods already created on
this platform and one chat but that is a
financial bot that's similar to the bot
that I showed you and this bot actually
is using natural language processing
it's not a bot on Rails but it could be
on Rails as you see in the integrated
tester I have the ability to display
lists of values to the user now in this
case let's reset it and first let me
show you the intense so we have balance
send money track spending for each of
the intent I provide example sentences
see utterances and you see there are not
many of them but enough so that I can
train the bots which is by just pressing
the
button that would create the intent
model right now I don't need to have
training here because I didn't add new
sentence every intent is associated with
entities so here we have an account type
as an entity associated to the balance
if I go to send money then you see there
are more entities to that because
there's more information required here
so let's go back to this screen and say
ok much drew or I have in credit card
just to see what my balance there is I'm
sending this and because it's not
missing any information in there it
media T comes with the answer when I
started this demonstration you saw that
there were select list now as soon as it
couldn't detect one of the information
that is required it will ask you for
that and will show you a list of values
to select from but it can do even more
so let me copy this string here and now
we want to go to the intent because we
want to see based on the many intents
that I have in this use case how is the
decision process of the machine learning
and artificial intelligence and you see
that this sentence is good for balances
frequently asked question transactions
however balances are 92% score and for
that reason that was chosen if that was
inaccurate I would use the same screen
to retrain the bots and to add a sense
that it misunderstood so everything is
declaratively and graphic so we can go
to entities as I said entities are
variables that you hold and here we find
account type track spending categories
so we see that track spending would be
gas retail and for each of them I can
even specify synonyms so that I had a
variety of words that could be used
within a sentence and then it will
create the entity model and the bots
will understand that the conversation
currently is held in a xml metadata
format so what we see is that right at
the beginning we do an intent detection
so that is like the information that I'm
putting in as text will run through the
intent detection it has a confidence
threshold which actually determines what
is the certainty for a specific intent
before it's displayed because you always
have the option to say sorry I don't
understand the question to be polite to
the user or maybe direct the user to a
human agent to handle the case and then
retrain the bots so the book is
something that you always want to have a
look at and train so that it's more more
reaches to the confidence threshold that
you would envision to be perfect and the
rest is just States so you have a start
balance date you have an aspirant state
and what you can see is that within the
Oracle intelligent bot cloud service you
work with components system lists to
display a list system intent to do the
artificial intelligence on the natural
language processing the list of custom
components is here so when you register
a custom component and we'll talk about
this in detail then actually this
component will display its properties it
channels it supports and to register a
new component and you can have more than
one component service registered you
just go to the component service and
then you will just specify what is the
rest and URI to access the service and
this sets up the system we also see that
there's a channel tab on this channel
tab you can specify on what are the
external messengers in this case
Facebook to work with then you have
general settings which includes the max
results that you want to have returned
by the chat bot
so everything graphically and visually
will usually available to you and you
build as many chat BOTS as you want
so this is the architecture picture of
the demonstration that you saw so kind
of the core storm stones or core
functionality modules within the Oracle
platform so there's a channel
configurator and a set channel
configurator just allows you to connect
to different messengers I might not have
stressed the fact enough that there are
different messengers on the market
Facebook WeChat cake telegram and so on
they all speak a different metadata
language so you have to apply for that
you have to connect to that you have to
meet their requirements in terms of
security authentication and so on so
this is what the channel configurator is
doing it could work with text-based
messages but also as you see on this
slide with voice hooking up to a laksa
or to Siri or even to a custom voice
recognition that you build in your
mobile application say you have a mobile
application you're a bank you have a
mobile application for your customers
but for students you want to make sure
that they don't have to use the
application the old-fashioned way but
just to chat so you want to integrate
voice then there is the dialogue flow
execution now this is what actually puts
the conversation into a runnable
experience we have the artificial
intelligence engine now artificial
intelligence really is what it takes the
meaning out of the sentence and then we
do have custom components custom
components play a key role within the
Oracle intelligent bot platform there's
an SDK that simplifies the task and
really what custom components do they
allow you to write the code that matters
and not more there are many examples out
there if you look at chat bots that just
make you doing everything in code
writing kind of the utterances or the
training within your code looking in
your code to what probably would be the
best match now this is all that we are
hiding from you or wouldn't say hide but
take away from you so the platform
actually will have off the artificial
intelligence machine learning built in
and all that you do
is you build the logic that is specific
to the use case that you have now this
could include functional logic or user
interface logic yeah all of this but not
more you just focus on what you want to
build and you build it in a way that is
reusable so how does it work
the intelligent chat pod actually will
as soon as there's a state reach in the
conversation that calls out to a custom
component will issue a rest call now
this rest call could go to anywhere in
the internet so you components don't
necessarily need to reside on the same
cloud or host as the chat board in our
example here on the slide the
implementation logic of the custom
component would be written in note which
is very common these days if you have
Oracle mobile cloud service in the
picture then you have the clarity of
connectors to rest services soap
services integration cloud services and
so on that make it easy to connect to a
remote service to query data or update
theta so this architecture shows you how
it works so a custom component starts
off with a custom component service
which can host many custom components
you can imagine this like a package in
Java that has different classes and
functionality so the call is made via
HTTP into the component service the
component service invokes the connector
gets the information that it needs and
returns to assist you in building those
custom components at least for
JavaScript we provide objects like a
shell which is dispatching between the
bot call and the list of components that
you have in a custom component interface
and then we have an SDK now the SDK what
the SDK really does is it makes it
simple to work with a payload that comes
from the chat pod so all of the
information that we get out of the
sentence will be sent to a custom
component to look into that and to
operate on whatever you need to operate
and the component implementation does
then is what you're building that's then
the note code that you have to implement
your client functionality so let me show
you how the code side of a custom
component looks so that you get an
impression of how interesting it is to
build custom components and how powerful
that is again you just build the code
that matters not more this is a custom
component example as I mentioned the
custom component is exposed as a rest
service this code is written with note
so it's JavaScript but node actually has
a melt module called Express and this
module Maps a function a JavaScript
function to a rest method so we have a
get method and a post method that comes
from the bot the get method is called
when you register the component service
with the intelligent bot it will then
invoke the shell object and on the shell
object call get all component metadata
to get a list of all custom component
hosted by this component service so it
will provide the name and the required
configuration the post method is called
at runtime it passes the component name
as part of the URI and then this
function again uses a shell object to
invoke the component by the name the
shell object that is provided by Oracle
exposes a get or component metadata
function as well as the invoke component
it reads its information from a registry
the registry is a JavaScript file that
US developer create if you look into the
registry here my component service only
contains a single custom component so it
has a name so prefix with a name space
and then you use require to look for the
JavaScript file now this will be called
by the get method when the get method
I forget all components but it will also
be used by the post method when the
component should be invoked so to have a
look at the component here is a city
weather component the city weather
component I actually split this into a
client logic part which is in this file
and the UI part which are put into a
separate file so here we do have two
functions one is metadata and one is
invoked so the metadata is called with a
get request so it provides the name of
the fun component which is weather map
city weather and the properties it
requires a city name a country name and
what the unit is that you want to
provide or get the weather provided in
and then there's a fourth parameter
which is a convenient parameter which is
to pass the open weather map Kien when
we work with open weather map you create
an account and you receive a key and
this key means we add it onto every
request for the invoke we pass in the
SDK that comes with the intelligent bot
cloud service as well as a call wave
function the SDK simplifies access to
the payload so here we access the
properties that are sent from the bot
into the custom component this is how we
get city named country name the weather
map key and the temperature unit we then
create the query string and in this case
of this example it actually uses another
SDK which is a mobile sdk it uses
however the bot SDK namespace for that
because in a other section of this code
the two AP is so the mobile cloud
service SDK and this SDK are merged so
this is a way that you can extend the
bot SDK and I did that so it accesses a
mobile cloud service connector which is
a decline
active rest service adapter and then
passes the query string as a request it
gets a result back and then it calls in
my case render render UI normally you
can straight just print out what the
response is I said I want to keep this
separate the SDK transition then the
tells the the bot to transition to the
next state so I have a look at the
renderer so the renderer here just
writes back information based on the
channel that is used so if the channel
is Facebook then I returning an image if
the channel is only the tester then I'm
happy to just return the text string so
that's all I do here I look at the SDK
it's a JavaScript object that is
provided for you and this JavaScript
object exposes functions that makes it
easier to work with the payload that
comes from the bot but also to tell the
bot what to do next to transition to the
next state or just stay where it is so
as you can see for developer kind of
easy to do and that is what I meant like
just do the stuff that really matters
and not more so in summary all chat bots
do the same thing if we look into chat
bots especially if you look into
frameworks they're all kind of servile
is compute so that means there's no
on-premise installation required they
all have some sort of a dialogue engine
and natural language understanding and
processing services they do provide
api's application database security
that's common for a platform they have a
channel ATIS that allow you to hook up
to different messenger clients Facebook
WeChat and so on and there are some sort
of management interface that allows you
to train the system provide utterances
define entities and generate the model
out of this so that
typically what platform will do a lot of
handwritten chatbots out there that are
advertised by individuals but frameworks
that actually are used with an
enterprise type of development they will
all provide this so if they're all the
same
then why Oracle well Oracle
differentiates in many ways here first
of all we think on making things easy
first so we think on enterprise great
champ of development but then chatbots
that are built in a mixed team of IT
professionals and domain experts we
think about an open scalable runtime
platform that can handle million of
conversations we think about a platform
that doesn't only allow you to build one
but Multipla chat bones security we want
to make sure that security allows you to
hook up for authentication into your own
Identity Management
Facebook is okay for authentication but
what is the trust level that you have
between a Facebook authentication and
your company so you might prefer to some
point in the conversation to redirect to
your own login screen and this is what
it can do within messengers and that's
what we're supporting we're looking at
enterprise integration so as we go on
with that product we will integrate to
more more cloud services from the Oracle
platform and from third party platforms
that allow you to have very easy access
and integration from or in your chat box
to those systems we will provide a very
simple bot designer that allows you to
build a dialogue flow as easy as
possible and you've already seen that
what we have in this early build that I
show during the demos we do have a very
component based approach to building
chat boards which allows you to reuse on
a very fine-grain manner that allows you
to even exchange components between
different chat BOTS and that allows you
to just focus on what matters to you and
the business
we provide machine learning with cross
channel prick
analytics and knowledge tax so instead
of you chasing down how machine learning
works artificial intelligence need to be
put together with different systems we
just provide this out of the box so it's
all there it just needs to be trained
I'm inside of that Oracle is a very
powerful relationship to other vendors
including Facebook so Oracle different
shades and that we think big and you
know what if you think big you can
always think small so we're building a
platform that scales for everyone
and this is how we differentiate so with
