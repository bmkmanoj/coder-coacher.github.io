technologies curriculum director in this
presentation and give you a quick
overview of the multi-tenant
architecture so what is a multi-talented
container database the multi-tenant
contain a database that we also call a c
DB as opposed to a non c DB is simply
the recipient for multiple databases
sharing certain resources one of those
resources is an instance that we call
the C DB instance like the non c DB
instance the c DB instance is comprised
of an SGA background processes
foreground processes representing your
sessions and files like the alert log
DSP file and for example a wallet the
mutated and container database itself
and it's instance represent a special
container associated with the container
ID 0 inside a CD B you find another type
of container called the root its name is
CD b de la route and is associated with
the container ID 1 at the physical level
that container contains a set of files
like in the non CD d case that is
control files redo log files data files
associated with the system and c sub
stablish spaces and new files temporary
files and user data files in addition
the root container can add flashback
logs archive log files and change
tracking file if the Associated
functionality is used at the logical
level the root container also has a data
dictionary containing objects metadata
stored in tables like table dollar or a
the value of tables but also diction
we object definitions like DBMS packages
and dictionary views however as we will
see later the new level of abstraction
has been added to the famous deviate
used to have a global view of whole
container objects so in addition to the
deviate views that now show you what you
have in a particular container we add
the cdb views showing information across
all containers if you query them from
the root in addition to the root
container we find pluggable databases
also called pdbs which are the last
level of container a PDB appears to
users and applications as if it were a
traditional non CD be inside one CD
there is always a special PDB called the
seed which name is PDB dollar seed and
is associated with container ID to this
PDB is only used for cloning purposes so
you could come on that seed into another
PDB inside the same CD be very easily
inside one CD be you can have up to two
hundred and fifty three PD beans
including the seed each PDB contains a
set of data files so the seed contains
the system and see Sox table spaces as
well as a temporary table space for the
other pdbs
each will have its own system and seas
of study spaces and optionally a
temporary table space as well as users
table spaces not however that pdbs do
not have control files nor redo log
files these are shared amongst pdbs
through the ones that exist in the root
container of course each pdb will have
its own set of foreground processes
representing sessions connecting to each
PDD another structure that is shared
among pdbs is the SGA for example the
buffer
now contains the new reference for each
block corresponding to the PDB ID that
block refers to same is true with child
castles for example at the logical level
the PDB as a dictionary like any Oracle
database however instead of redefining
all the data dictionary objects the idea
is to create pointers to objects that
are created and defined in the root
dictionary this is done to avoid
duplication as much as possible two
types of pointers exist metadata links
which are pointers to data dictionary
objects definitions like the dictionary
view definitions for the DBMS packages
and object links which are pointers to
data dictionary objects data for example
a W of tables content is told only in
the root the vast majority of the space
savings is due to the sharing of the
metadata this is significant if you
think that the complete original
dictionary definition occupied around
seven hundred megabyte in the world that
represents only 200 Meg in each PDB
because of this point of business
another important aspect of the CD beam
is its particular ET of managing what
are called common users users like c
source system are now defined
automatically in each PDV and in the
corresponding root container common
users perform administrative tasks for a
c DB so creating the common user allows
the CDD administrator to create at once
a user that is replicated in each PDB
some tasks such as storing the Percy DB
instance or unplugging the PDB can be
performed only by a comma new
as opposed to the common user a local
user is defined in the peds own data
dictionary and so it is not known
outside of that PD therefore the local
user can connect only to the PDB where
it is defined a local user is specific
to a particular PDB and owns a schema in
that PDB you can see a local user just
like a user in a non CDV and violent you
can now create common roles that are
defined in every container this way it
is easy to create at once a role that is
replicated in all peds a role in a non
cdb environment maps to a local role in
a PDB a local role is defined in the
peds own data dictionary and so it is
not known outside of that PDB and can
only be used within its PDB the
privileges are commonly referred to as
local or common privileges but to be
more precise the privilege is either
granted locally with the closed
container equal current or globally with
a closed container equal all in a city
beam pdbs might have different levels of
priority you can create CV resource
plans to distribute resources to
different pdbs based on these priorities
the PDB resource plan determines how the
resources allocated to a specific PDB
are allocated to consumer groups within
that PE the PDB resource plan is similar
to a resource plan for a non CD another
important aspect is that a local user
can access data in another PDB using
data as limbs like in a non CD v and
violent however in a CDP environment
Della's link is much faster between pdbs
as it has been specifically optimized
for that purpose the last thing I'd like
to show in this architecture is about
the list earner by default the Oracle
database creates one cdb service
corresponding to your container database
and allowing you to connect to the root
container in addition one service is
automatically created for each newly
created pdb in your environment you can
have a complete list of all the services
served by your CDV by looking at the c
DB underscore services view at a high
level you could see a multi-tenant
container database and its associated
pluggable databases AZ database
virtualization the multi tenant
container database being the VM server
and pdbs being VMs this is the end of
