architects or work for oracle consulting
in germany and and kindly want you to
listen to my presentation about using
the invalidation with the common data
model in SWA just short introduction i
copied from java one site to save time
so and if you'd like to follow or
contact me there are our contact
information information on this slide
and basically be work for customers in
consulting leveraging Oracle products
and as a lot of Oracle products are
based in Java so with you also in Java
and therefore the descenders behind Java
II and we have I prepared a presentation
about bean validation in which is one of
Java e6 standards the agenda for for
today for the session we'll start with
some small overview about challenges in
layer at SWA and the second part go to
the focus on how to use bean validation
to address one of a challenge in this
case a business constraints so let's
start with the challenges and so on how
many of you are doing so are at your
company so okay so I see so I still not
dead because three years ago was some
kind of analysts article about how is
that maybe you notice that and and I
also think it's not that because the
principles behind it they are life
the abbreviation is kind of overused so
but the principles are useful so and if
you're doing so are you you have
normally some layers in in your systems
it's normally not monolithic one but
consists of various parts and layers
maybe not as much as this lego lego
building but at least view so if you
look at this diagram we normally have
some components services processes
scopic they are consumed mobile desktop
clients browser glands your business
function and it gets exposed as a web
applications you might have also some
kind of service bus note that there are
no specific products in this diagram
it's a abstract one conceptual one and
illustrates that there are boundaries
between system components so normally
they are not on the same jvm but kind of
remote so you have to address this issue
in SWA from a beginning and if you don't
do that so might get some trouble and a
way to implement implementation and so
are we just saw it's a smaller picture
of one part and the sample application
is shows implementation of this
conceptual architecture we we have two
services one business process and web
application consuming
our services and business process and if
you look at a service interface what is
needed to define service interface using
Java it's pretty simple you have to
provide a name for your service it might
be one or more service operations and to
one of the patterns and so is messaging
so you normally send some data as input
message and get some data back as a
return message so our system boundaries
so it's kind of simple so normally it's
difficult to understand why are the
challenges and so on but then when we
come to some technology explosion of
services like web services remote so we
we might get some challenges and if you
think about the best practices at the
beginning it's kind of I think eight
years or ten years old so so I was very
over bloated with and focused on web
services exist e soap HTTP but as we
come back to the interface is it's not
always web services not always so it's
just the interface exposing some
business functionality so and as the
name might be enterprise IP I might be
more more sexy name for swap because we
live now in kind of a I economy and the
systems you are building for your
customers or your products if you are a
customer site they need to be open
because of various consumers for example
mobile if you have a closed system so
might be difficult to integrate some
other clients and as a system is kind of
parts or of a whole stack
so they need components need to
communicate so and a trick or there is a
business functionality so business
interface business data and business
constraints which defined our soil and
after that comes I'll technology how
they exposed so let's start to look at
at web parts and a track or we have all
of our RP API we have a kind of service
model which contains our process
definitions they are all simple Java
interface interfaces in this sample but
one sample process processes report
claimed it's from insurance erhs methods
might be familiar for the audience there
are different service categories so
claim activity services one of category
and service operation create claim we
have a common data report claimed input
is if you remember it's a previous slide
it's a message which is sent to create
claim service and it composes two common
data objects claimant person and here
comes a need also to address business
constraints because if you don't do it
in a model they can be expressed in the
model they are part of business
functionality and if you don't do it
they tend to spread across all layers
implementation to enforcement and
validation of them might gets
time-consuming and difficult to
implement here we see some one process
from a sample application for the
session defined in Java Java interface
and it illustrates the idea of service
restoration so it are her hit
orchestrates to business activity
services yeah if we report a claim we
normally have to provide a claim
information about the accident and the
second part in the sample is a person
reporting complain so here we come to a
common data model it's a kind of
vocabulary for our enterprise ipi so the
pattern behind it it's a old data
transfer object pattern and it uses
composition to compose a data to
higher-level objects so at what up at
the top we have a process message report
clip input which consists of person
activity input and claim activity input
messages and some of the objects from
our business domain of the sample is a
person and plane and some types of claim
for example out of blame to report card
car accident &amp;amp; property claimed reports
and damage in your house and the objects
contain o behaviorally are just dump
dump transfer objects to transfer data
between possibly remote components so
the idea is to compose specific objects
to some message service specific or
process specific message because you
can't simply transfer a wholly or
database over wire so you have to
address this issue too it's a kind of
different compared to rich domain
objects with behavior where you normally
have a direct access to your data store
and JPA and caching and lazy loading
in so if you cut system boundaries so
might be no lazy low loading and it's
it's not suitable to transfer all the
objects over the wire so how bean
validation can help help to implement
business constraints in this context and
so on and common data model and the
better show concepts for a session where
is a demo provided I provide a download
link that we enter the session we can
download a sample application and he is
just introduction we have one service
portal at the left side there are
there's our sample process and so this
is exposed as UI components and on the
right side this one is just our IP I
exposed as soap web services so if we
get all the things right we have both we
have IP I for applications or systems
and we can leverage the same common data
model and service definition we work on
the same model also on consumer side and
we don't have to dublicate our business
constraints this diagram is validation
Means War used in this con sample
application so normally we the places
where we have a need to enforce some
business constraints yeah we we have
some business service layer which is
kind of smart Connexus back-end systems
we have a business process layer we
might be a need to enforce process
specific business constraints here we
have normally also present
layer and to provide better user
experience we don't always delegate
validation to a back-end but just to
provide it on a place when a data is
entered and all these components consume
definitions from our selves data model
and there's also one JVM client it's in
a sample simple unit s so we look how to
enforce pin validation using business
constraints using bean validation ipi so
in a more complex systems where as I
need to provide it and for small and
complex and simple business constraints
so we start from an attribute level and
a simple not null or null required
constraints and move to the data objects
then look how to design a service
operation specific and service specific
constraints and Oh some validation which
is also a process process specific so in
the you spin validation so a bean
validation defines basically a metamodel
and I pi/4 in data validation and one
attractive feature it's the IP I is not
tied to a specific application to your
programming model which is particularly
suitable for for SWA because we have so
I was providing consumer layer so we
don't have to we can rely to some
specific application model but we need
usually flexibility on the other hand
bin validations integrated with some
other Java EE specifications like jpa
and javaserver face
in this session I show also example
implemented in a sample application a
usage in javaserver faces version 2
specification not 1.2 but version to let
let's start from one domain objective
person so a bit validation specification
provides also a simple built-in
constraint implementations the simplest
one might be null or not null so
normally when we have one object common
data object which is intended to be used
everywhere and some identifiers in this
case long ID and normally it should be
not null when we already have our person
in the system the person exists and
nulla burns a new person so for to
define this using bean validation the
validation groups can be used and
validation group is nothing else as
simple Java interface here are two the
validation group definitions we have one
group for new data to enforce for
example identifiers which get generated
on a back-end and also update in case of
update we the consumer of our service
has to provide an person with identifier
which tolerate in a system to possibly
update some data so designing custom
application groups to separate those
to address those concerns already helps
to design this those kind of cases in
our model in the complex systems where
I'm normally not only simple constraints
but object graph so our data is kind of
related to each other for example when
we look at the person activity input
class with this which is a message for
all service operations in the sample
person activity inputted its compound
composed from two common data model
objects the person and address so we
just define as a business case when we
create a person or update or do
something with a person so we have to
provide personal information address
information and our inputs message is a
container for person activity service
with two operations great personal
update person and so we already defined
some bean validation constraints in a
person object and we when we send the
data composed to a person activity
message we want to also a person to be
person constraints to be validated so by
by using annotation dalit we delegate we
enforce a validation of the object graph
dependent objects so we tell a bean
validation facility to validate also
person or address to apply all and we
see here also two simple annotations
null and not null so then the second
layer and validation might be in your
business domain you would
like to check some service specific
constraints for example we have a common
data object address which is used
everywhere in our system and for claim
active it's a service when we submitting
a claim also with address we adjust our
business wants to have also address and
city information and for person
informations only zip is required so M
as theirs there is nothing in a
specification which prohibits us to use
Java interface as a validation group so
we have operation so in this case it
might be useful to take our service
operations service interfaces as a
validation group so on this layer you
can specify service specific constraints
so this not null is going to be enforced
only for operations of claim activity
service and add additional person
activity service all operations where
address gets used requires also a zip it
zip out you pronounce it yes zip okay so
we just go back person activity service
and claim activate the service class
it's the same as interface as we defined
with operations but we can use it also
as a bean validation group and we made
some thoughts to design the design our
services to the partition our IP I so so
why not to use it also to enforce
service specific constraints
the second the third case might be we
want to do some semantic validation
which is needs to address information
contained in one class for example we
have a object claim and it contains
animation for supported claim times
which our system is going to accept and
might contain should contain specific
details for auto claim car accident
details or property claim yet depending
on a type so in this case we we can
design our custom bean validation
annotations to to check to check that
your custom constraint claim constraint
how can be in validation constrain BD
how can we define it it's just custom
annotation with where you can specify a
target use some at interface keyword for
annotation time we have to provide
mandatory attributes message groups and
payload and target where notation can be
put on a class and also a validator
validated by the Sanitation the
constraints just only metadata to
specify what we would like to to
validate and the implementation is
provided in a claim validator class in
this case and we basically implementable
the matter to is valid and we get access
to object instance in our case is a
claim so having a claim object we
can simply implement business constraint
with that few if statements one of her
best practices stated in supported beam
validation documents is to do not
validate null values here but use null
not null constraint so just first
statement is normally if claim is null
or type null so we just return true
because we already defined those bean
validation constraints so and bean
validation will the data just has to
return true or false yeah and constraint
is violated so it's false otherwise
through when we move to the next layer
we have when we following the design
principle since s way we have a process
level validation need for a process
level validation there might be some
business constraint specific to some
specific business process like in our
case report claimed report clean process
so processor normally composes all old
data so we when we send the data it
contains all data need is required for
for a process so we we can implement
here some kind of in this example
business rule or constraint that we do
not accept auto claims from a persons
whose last name starts with X so kind of
its not real case but just to show that
we having processed data we can access
all the data contained in it so well
where is a place to implement such kind
of validations and as you see it's a
here is nothing else as a plain java so
because
common our service model is intended to
be portable here we don't want to
introduce heavy bag dependencies to
other parts so which is in intentions to
pack service model as a jar and to
consume it use it on every layer so
possibly to to use it on a process layer
on everywhere chow is used for example
the Oracle so our suite is also java
based product so it's possible to
integrate all those operations which we
implement here also where or we can stay
in jab and to continue to use it so the
process level validation constrain is
for more complex semantic process
specific validations like in this case
and when we move towards complexity of
course there's not always possible to
implement everything shall we not always
simply have all the data accessible so
and there are some functionality in the
backend systems which supports
enforcement and validation and business
constraints and one example of our
session is the unique validation
constraint so normally unique to check
your personal exists we need access to
hold data and when you remember layers
we can't simply get all persons to some
part of a system just to check your her
person exists so we have some how to
delegate the work to our back-end system
a database or cluster or whatever it is
so those operations normally our
resource intensive and so it's a good
practice to define a separate group for
such operations because you might not
want to always to enforce it probably
once on some layer depends on your
business needs but so we design we
to check of a person exists and design
custom bean validation constrain call it
person unique constrain provides a
message for constraint violation and
enforce it the group unique and remember
our model already contains some simple
implementation job but in this case we
without have a possibility to provide
implementation on a model layer because
a model component because model is going
to be used in different environments so
sometimes we have access to a back-end
database directly sometimes we are on
the service consumer side so we have a
remote access so we just define one
validator implementation and use context
dependent injection to inject the
delegate a real implementation which is
environment specific so but in this case
we are satisfied with our interface so
we just use the same interface it's fine
also for delegate validator and in order
to resolve cyclic references put
alternative annotation from context
dependency injection so it's because the
framework would a container would start
to inject all all cyclic references
itself we look to implementation and
here's one implementation for this
interface our constraint will Dayton for
validator for person unique constraint
so it's at the service provider layer
where we normally have some access to
some data store in the sample is a stub
data store stop in memory some simple
Java collections but because we focus on
the middleware in
and so on but this implementation might
be to ask data store or data service
whatever you use it JP I based
entitymanager person exists so the
database checks for us really fast and
using the same valid data on a service
consumer layer we don't have access to
our data store our data service so we
provide another implementation and
inject some service required to enforce
our unique constraint so in this case we
also really refer to context dependency
injection inject the person
identification service and
implementation for this unique
constraint looks almost the same but in
this case it's a remote service call
yeah so when you package our application
and put our model the implementation
gets resolved to environment specific
one on the service provider layer with
direct data store excess and on service
consumer layer remote access how can
validation be enforced and bin validate
the most common cases a simple one bean
validation ipi provides a method
validate we can put a object annotated
with bean validation constraints and a
groups for which those constraints has
to be have to be validated so you get a
list of a set of constraint violation as
a result and normally it's
good practice to kondeh to translate it
to some domain specific business
exception because there might be some
clients which are not not have not not
only Java Klein so normally when you
design services you you design also your
business exception in this in a sample
for the session there is one one generic
business exception which can accumulate
a list of constraint valuations inside
so we can transfer violations from back
into from service provider to service
consumer and to look what kind of
specific business constraints were
violated so and if you would like to
define service operation a specific
constraint so it might be useful to rely
on beam while also on inheritance of
validation groups for example as you
remember you can define custom
validation groups and in this case we
create one interface person activity
update person yeah which extends default
update groups and the second one is
person activity create person which
extends default a new unique interfaces
so we don't have we just defined our
validation group for service specific
operations and here for example we were
we're using this group on javaserver
faces to page
and don't have to specify all validation
groups which we would like to get
validated for whenever a new person gets
created so and in this here is also an
example of integration so bean
validation is integrated with some other
parts in Java e6 and one part is
javaserver faces too so if you using
some Java javaserver faces two based
framework you can use also attack
validate beam specify validation groups
and all value as bound inside from a
common data model in our case all
attributes they they get validated
automatically so we just need to to tell
you would like to have a validation here
and we look also at a random behavior of
the sample applications and application
and how how java surface integration
looks like and if you have any questions
just interrupt and ask yeah okay so I am
demo application so so so a playground
is provided is going to be provided to
the practice on a concept shot in the
session because it's a kind of broad
topic common data model SWA principles
and to narrow it to bean validation i
have to i just created one beam NetBeans
project simple java no dependences just
only play java and java east under
and we have all those typical parts we
have our service model so stops they are
just stopped implementation for services
but normally we have some some
sophisticated implementation we have a
web service provider which exposes our
business functionalities the web
services and on a server consumer side
we have self service proxy which is
completely generated automatically base
with huius huius import and maven built
and web application normally we have
more services and processes or hundreds
but this is so kind of stopped to a
button example of concepts in this
office session so summary okay so let's
let's look at a demo application on it's
a little bit smaller screen but so we
have here service model with our common
data and if you remember slides for
example we can look at one data object
person and in this example is a
personally unique one strain defined
which message person already exists and
unique group service model is structured
also according to a concept shot in this
session we have a package data than
false with one business exception it is
also designed to be reused on a service
consumer side so you doing like this you
avoid the transformations you have only
one modern
you define your business objects design
the messages and reuse them on all the
layers for example so steps is just a
simple Java in namur implementation of
stopped implementation or to store data
and get back and service web service
provider is it's designed to expose our
services as a web services in this case
but as you notice a model doesn't
contain any web server specific
artifacts and dependencies so if we
would like to expose on process the web
service is just as simple as using
NetBeans visit to to create a web
service and we inject a our process
implementation as a gb and delegate all
the calls to yeah really can use
annotations
yeah if you have access tissot you
probably also using a web services yeah
because of exist ease and the concept
here is to use Java yeah just simple
Java and let java ee to generate exists
is for you so exist is not a single
source of true but it's a java code with
your constraints because regarding
business constraints you can't express
all them in xst especially semantic one
so if you don't have ifs if statements
in excess d or delegated so normally you
during the last years with one
interesting essay from Tom John Fowler I
think pattern tolerant reader so the
practice during the practice so I
practice the problem was it was figure
it out that using excess this you can't
all but not all it's the same in our
case but now I wouldn't use xst Servius
tells to designer services but would
start in a plane java and implement this
and let let je make access these files
on a fly there are no access this here i
just showed one but because
if we put the some not knowledge for
example enforcement exists e yeah it
prohibits us in some cases to get a date
at our back end you know a client just
gets a validation it's not null so and
it might be useful to get a lot of us
the commentator model is a vertical
industry standard in this case it's of
course is not possible to start from a
green field so if you don't have to
control about your common data model so
you all normally also don't get
advantage of which a common data model
provides so you have to transform your
data from standard to your specific one
of the questions I raised I think
everybody here is there some kind of an
annotation degenerative xml comment in
some namespaces to the schema itself
right so that it automatically our it
should be possible to write a plugin
even today for Jack's p they are great
annex of all it's it's in some namespace
and I have to design their for its and
sunday gardener
being laughing yeah would really solve
the problem oh and I have most of the
contract just to recapture a little bit
there are some efforts for example if
you design your constraints and bean
validation constraints you it might be
possible to generate also exists e
Connexus dsi it was a types and and so
on but i think it's not possible to
simply express everything unix SD now so
if you can't express everything and
start you have a possibility to start so
it might be better not to start at all
but to use a tolerant exists ease
without any constraint just standard
type it so happens that excess diesel
very rich in terms of the constraints
nillable and Mac suckers remember other
classes coming out of my ears and if I
have crossed restraint validation I can
always use excess editing the next path
to check those things I can check a lot
of things yeah it's a good point but as
I told you yeah first you here you can
check everything so you dublicate some
and and you doing like this you it's not
always success d and we are still that's
a point you can use the same model made
in java also in the single java virtual
machine for normal it's not always
remote usage so we have options yeah
like doing this relying on web service
standard success these it's introduces
independence you normally too so it's
the only way to use it as a
web service ok you can enforce also yeah
yeah yeah you can enforce also emit Java
Sea and second point bean validation
provides a possibility to use
externalize the configuration for not
only annotations annotations a standard
option but the second option is to use a
meta data so it might be alternative to
use as a knitted it but it's the same
but you don't want to modify the class
so you end up just using API only and
not using annotations and just like
validators that I would use a
programmatic Java centric approach and I
would generate java classes with
annotations from a model but used to
exist ease or via cells as one of
options if it's possible if you have a
control about things so so yeah and it's
our experience because we which has also
started with excess decent the last
year's and due to constraints the Nexus
this way sometimes in one project with
one customer we couldn't provide a
functionality needed for because for
example so I see two people process
execution language here it rejected the
messages because of the constraints and
exists ease and we would like to get
onto backends to provide all the other
validations so I would
are a UK address and so you can't apply
necessarily the same validation so the
groups of your business domain we just
like we look to you you can control
enforcement about constraints and user
groups so if you have some groups or
localization so I always it is just so
much but the schema its business so it's
not always one-size-fits-all so I think
if you don't have a control about your
shimma shimma so normally you have some
kind of front end for some service bus
or transforming to your common data
models yeah so this case might be at
your place when you rely on some
external shimmer which where you don't
have a control and the second point
normally those Sheamus are not so I t
friendly they they are like you
mentioned a lot of
also optional so they don't express a
semantic a whole constraints and I I
know for example I business analysts
were just designing common data model in
germany for to define one person which
is immigrating to the country so we
spent one year or and came out with some
shima which is not usable directly which
can't be directly reused yet ain't went
to facilitate data exchange countrywide
between all offices in this subject so
emigration but from a technical point of
view or design or ID point so good
practices of modeling and design it's
not usable so there is a transformation
the normally internally disks principles
are used between the systems but and
there's one one component which
transforms from this not usable shima-ya
would it be possible is it and then you
have to write the antigen yourself and
every time they get what they're saying
is it possible to do it may be at the
higher level because you can sell
different levels oh yeah Taylor it turns
out the problem is actually objective
because suppose you are using an order
oh it's um promote my castor or
something okay in that case you're not
generating it you don't have to do just
mapping your xml foods your object that
means you do have a canonical object
model independent component of people so
you can see at the annotations to your
class as much as you want if the schema
changes we go change the mapping file of
your now this is a fundamental weakness
of XP not necessarily about you say yeah
it's um it's um Jake speech acts vs oh
they are so normally web service or not
only web service but normally used in
soap and web service oh yeah so it's vsl
to Java or Java to SL discussion so in
this case is more so Java to vs tell so
via cell is only a technical artifact
used but like we see we get to your cell
its generated by Jack space
implementation and we have all chimas
but we don't explicitly designed them
and we designed our datum a common data
model objects constraints service
interfaces using a minimal set of to
express information just only minimal
sets the name operation name data object
sent back and forth so
do not you you you you mark your X
America synoptic and then you want to
use GPA to persist eruptive yeah but you
can't put a piano yeah and I wouldn't
put any jpay annotations a model because
i don't know if it's a jpa is going to
be used to persist you know so this this
is phone for a middle aim to go over
layers and to be used everywhere but i
might use some other store like in this
memory or no sequel or not only sequel
or relational databases it's not defined
it might go through a messaging system
so if i would put a jpa or rely on some
spec on this part so i have to to take
dependencies everywhere you know it's it
should be very thin plain java and bean
validation is also thin because of
implementations in java so it's a
portable it's not very heavy weight so
let's say but i can understand also your
your yeah it's just um yeah so what's
the future of the validation like we
have expected the 4.3
happy valley ER before three was coming
there anything new yeah it's a current
state I think Ben validation 1 point 0
final release it's a production end in
newest bean validation 1.1 it's a work
in progress and current state is 1 point
1 alpha 1 early draft available and it's
open so if somebody has to lie to
participate just visit a website
openness and main parts dependency
injection is going to be regulated
because in this sample I just
implemented service provided in the
phaser not sure but if you download a
sample you was find some code which
injects the implementation of the
citizen you in equally data and metadata
also might save but let's answer to your
question
Oh
Oh
oh so you the question was if the object
is not other engines instant 8 about
those doesn't contain all values how how
you provided default values and I would
like to see you you normally you can
rely on some integration for being
validation like in javaserver faces you
can put attack and on a post it is gets
validated but it's not the only way the
most common way to just to call up when
needed here validate and provide object
to be validated here so then you are in
control about a time when you would like
to enforce the validation yes so then
your objects have a state where you
think okay now it's the time to validate
it I don't know if you I or some other
Klein so you just call validate and get
a list of constraint violations so it's
that was
are dependent on the other optional then
the other work on texel that's a that's
a case on a class level of a validation
where you can have access and can write
conditional statements so that might be
a case if this for example there was one
slide with claim type I just go back to
to answer your question may be
interesting when you have a claim time
photo so you require to to to have auto
claim object and it's a property so you
expect to get a property object so
conditional
yeah we can continue also discussion in
case of interest after a session so I
just formally close it and if you would
like to get a sample just provide links
I think the best way just look at
twitter i will post a link with where
that presentation and the sample
application can be downloaded with the
concepts which i just presented today so
thank you also for participating at my
session it was a pleasure to present it
and thank you for coming we can continue
to discuss in after that I have time
thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
