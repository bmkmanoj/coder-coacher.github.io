curry business wait product management
team today I'm going to walk you through
a tutorial on using Oracle e-business
suite business events for integrations
in integration cloud service integration
cloud servers are ICS is an integration
platform as a service from Arkell we
built a business with adapter that will
assist you with securely connecting to
your e-business suite instance and use
public interfaces for integrations with
other cloud or on-premise applications
the main objective of this tutorial is
to learn how to use business event
information from EBS for integrations in
ICS for this tutorial we will consider a
sample use case that is when a sales
order is booked in EBS order management
we will create a manual invoice in
accounts receivable system here is a
snapshot of Isis integration for this
purpose first we will capture any change
in sales order status in order
management instance in EBS order
management there is a business event
that is raised whenever an order is
booked a line item is scheduled or
rescheduled shipped or closed etc we
will make use of EBS adapter connection
to subscribe to that particular business
event then we will check the order
status if it is booked we will face the
details of the particular sales order
from order management instance and use
it to create a manual invoice in the
accounts receivable system in this
tutorial we will also see how to define
conditional mapping for business event
the business event information from EBS
consists of repeating name value pairs
of parameter element the key information
about the business events such as the
header ID and status of a sales order is
available from this parameter list we
have defined excessive base mapping
sista will be if the parameter name
equal to header ID we will assign its
value to the transaction number of the
invoice so let's get started with
integration cloud service
login to Isis you may also see an option
to select the domain this is the ISIS
homepage our first step would be to
create the connections required for our
integration click create new connection
list of adapters are displayed search
for e-business suite adapter
select ebusiness suite adapter to Creve
the connection nemetes order management
and ensure that the connection role is
trigger and in bow because we will make
use of this connection for both inbound
as well as outbound integrations
in order to connect to an e DS instance
from ICS you would need information
about the EBS hosting board and the
security access this configure
connectivity
provide EBS hostname and port as the
connection URL this is where the EBS
rest services are deployed
configure security provide EBS user
credentials here this EBS users should
have access to order management arrest
services for this example we will
provide operations user credentials
for this tutorial I have used an EPS
instance whose red services are directly
accessible from ICS and hence I haven't
configured an agent so I will skip the
configuration step here
test the connection once the connection
is successful you can save and exit
so here we have EBS connection created
for order management system next I will
create a connection for accounts
receivable system
I'll make use of raster data to connect
to invoice service
select rest auditor nimittas receivables
configure connectivity
provide the resource base URL for
invoice rest service
provide user credentials to create
invoice for this tutorial we will again
provide operations as the user
credentials
just a connection save and exit
so now we had the connections created
for both the systems one is the order
management which is the source system
and the receivables which is the target
system
navigator integrations homepage create
new integration
select the integration pattern we will
select orchestration we will name the
integration as ordered to invoice
click read plan campus is shown you can
design your orchestration here the Sol
system EBS order management will trigger
this integration drag-and-drop
order management connection to the map
configure EBS adapter endpoint in this
art will come up give it a name select
business event and click Next
product family and product help you
filter the business evens available for
integration select autumn Anna German
sweet as the product family
select order management as the product
select even for a YP status update
notification
click Next
review the summary page and click done
so we have configured the trigger
endpoint
now if audit status update event is
raised for multiple scenarios but I need
to execute a certain set of steps only
when the order is booked so I will add a
switch operation which will help me
define the routing message rules drag
and drop switch action to a point after
trigger
by default switch ads to message parts
let's define the switch rule
condition builder pages display provide
a name for the expression what you see
on the left hand side under the source
region is the data structure of business
event information expand business event
you get even name key data expand
parameter list
if the C parameter is a repeating
complex element of name and value pair
before defining conditions as that name
equal to status code and value equal to
booked
you
see the condition and exit
if order is booked we will fetch details
of the particular sales order from order
management instance and hence we will
drag and drop order management
connection to the booked order path
EPS adapt our target in point
configuration page appears name the
target endpoint as kate order and click
Next
select Auto management suite as a
product family
and all the management as the product
select process order API click Next
select method get order ensure that the
soap status is ready to use then click
Next
reveal summary page and click done
once we get all the details from order
management instance we will use that
information to create manual invoice in
accounts receivable instance and hence
will drag and drop receivables
connections to the point after gate
order
configure rest in point page appears
limiters create invoice and provide the
end points relative resource URI
but this tutorial we will just post the
request payload to the endpoint select
post HTTP action select the checkbox for
configure a request payload for this
endpoint
click Next to configure the request
payload we will provide XML schema as
the input
the root element is are shown here
select XML as the payload type and click
Next
click done
let's see how the orchestration looks
now how comes the most important step to
define mapping
to edit what to see on the left-hand
side under the source region is the data
structure of business event information
coming as input and what you see on the
right-hand side under the target region
is the data structure of get orders
service we will assign constant values
to the elements that are used to
initialize application context
when you click the element name on the
target side the build mappings page will
be displayed into value and click close
similarly you can assign constant value
to other elements as well to get order
details of particular sales order you
need to get the header ID value from the
business event input this is an
important step let's see how to define
conditional mapping here expand business
even expand parameter list
drag value element and drop it below P
header ID
now to access the XSL elements expand
mapping components on the left-hand side
expand accessory elements
track if condition and drop it on P
header ID
now to define the con
expand the source region on the
left-hand side
try new element and drop it under the
test condition
let's add equals to operator expand
operators
drag equal operator and
but our name element on right-hand side
select left operand and click OK
for right operant
into value header ID
now this if check needs to be performed
for each occurrence of parameter element
hence we will add the XSL element for
each drag for each X is an element and
drop it above if condition
direct repeating parameter element
drop it for select on the right-hand
side
you
see even close
you
as highlighted in the screen notice the
difference in nutrition of an element
that is mapped from source to target was
as if an element for which we have
provided a constant value sieve and exit
mapper
you
let's see the integration as well
now let's define the mapping for create
invoice input
provide values for rest order as shown
here
you
provide value for API portion initialize
message list P commit battles ID as
shown here
now just for this tutorial we will
assign constant values to most of this
fields except for the transaction number
for transaction number we will get the
header ID from the gate order response
dragged header ID from source region
which is under get order response and
drop it for transaction number on the
target site
you
for lying details we will use the values
coming from the kit order response for
the quantity description line number and
the selling price as well
provide empty elements for the
vision and sales credit
you
see the mappings and exit mapper
you
integration is almost ready let's define
the tracking element
we will track each occurrence of
business event using the event key
you
see the integration and exit
you
activate the integration
also to invoice integration is active
and it has subscribed to sales order
update business event in EBS order
management instance
so whenever the business event is raised
in order management instance it will
trigger this particular integration in
ICS let's navigate to EBS order
management instance log in as operations
user
navigate to order management
responsibility
click sales order form
it's first Cree disease order
you
provide align it
and save
notice the statuses entered and the
order number is provided here but we
need to know what is the header ID
the header ID is as shown here pointable
eight three four nine
now let's book this order
order is booked now let's navigate to
ICS and look at the monitoring page
to test cases and that's the reason you
see five as a received number here let's
click on that notice even key as the
tracking element click on it the
instance is shown here and the message
route is highlighted in green
now let's check the invoice in account
receivable instance
you
navigate to receivables responsibility
as shown here
click transactions form let's search
foreign transaction and we should have
an invoice created with the transaction
number which should be the same as the
header ID value in the sales order hit
f11 to enter the search mode enter 1 ee
3 4 9 as the transaction number and hit
ctrl f11 here is the invoice created
from the Isis integration
you just saw how easily and quickly we
created ICS integration you can request
for an Isis trial subscription from
Oracle website and you can try out this
tutorial so that concludes this tutorial
