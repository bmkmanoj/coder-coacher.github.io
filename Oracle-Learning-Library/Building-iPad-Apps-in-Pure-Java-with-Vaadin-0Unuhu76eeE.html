left in and I'm from boarding team and
today's trade days is about building
iPad applications in boarding and
basically how to build ipad application
for enterprise specially fully in java
language so 30 months ago or two and a
half years ago something big happened
basically this device got introduced and
it changed a lot and it you have to
remember that just two and a half years
and what happened during those two and a
half years is huge so i don't know if
you have seen this adaption curves but
this is basically device that has been
adopted faster than any other device in
the history of technology so this blue
line here is iphone and that's pretty
fast but this one is ipad and these are
quarter since the release so today we
are seeing something like hundred
million iPads all around the world and
that's dominating the tablet market sir
so if when you're speaking about tablets
we are mostly speaking about iPads yep
do you hear any better now no could it
turn up the volume a bit
anybody know excellent so our iPad
sentiment of the market share and
interesting studies before an apple from
one year ago was that almost everybody
in the enterprise we are adopting these
iPads Soviet yeah isn't any better now i
canna use not working
maybe i shud should be really really
loud any better now nope it's different
working i'm using that one so where were
we in the enterprise so basically
everybody in the enterprise is now
trying out iPads and the question is how
do you develop for the iPads basically
that there is no question whether you
should be developing for iPad that's
quite obvious the enterprise will be
asking you to develop for iPads and the
only question is how and the recommended
way is of course Xcode so you should be
using Apple toolset for building like
the best of hyper applications out there
and that's way of building like really
nice I publications the challenge is
that this is like quite heavy toolchain
it should be building things in
objective-c and if you don't have team
in place already who can do objective-c
and build iOS application in xcode
that's quite a leap so the next option
is a snow 5 and that's actually really
nice environment so you can build quite
rich applications for ipad with html5
and basically this is what we are doing
today in a way but with the 805 you
basically are right in your application
in javascript and writing a rich
application especially for a tablet
device handling all those thoughts
events and so forth in javascript is not
the easiest task that you can imagine so
the real question as we are in java one
is good you do or how could you develop
with java for ipad and of course the
obvious answer here is this with warren
and i'm going to introduce a bit how you
could use one for developer for ipads so
a bit of a bottom first
how many of you have been actually using
volume oh wow what if you so you know
that this is actually a Finnish word for
female reindeer we come from Finland
that the main theme is infinite London
we wanted to have a word that this means
something in Finland and actually if you
can see that logo itself is actually
reindeer horns and knows but that you
can also going to turn it around i use
it as cursor in your terminal but it in
the end of the day it means test that
this is a favor will be rich web
applications and we'd reach I mean like
something that resemble desktop or
mobile experience not just web pages so
you can kind of turn to look around and
see that this is actually it's not
hidden behind Java so we're kind of
making a layer on top of HTML with Java
API s and this is the case also with
type but we are kind of hiding 8005
behind Java api's so basically we are
building on top of three ideas so the
first one is that there are rich
components involved in so you have like
around 100 core components for building
different kind of applications those
have been around for a while so there
are basically component for any kind of
purpose that you are seeking for if you
want to see a demo you called the demo
bot income and you can see the more of
those components there then there are
mobile components both of ipads iphones
and these are to work also on on road i
don't know if i can say that word in
this conference but they work on Android
as well but they look like ipad and I
iOS so basically on an iPhone it you can
when you are saving it as bookmark condo
on your home screen it actually looks
pretty much like native application but
we see the ipad version a bit later
there's also a lot of adam components
this is open sore framework based on
apache license so there is a really
active open source community around it
at the one I think we have two hundred
eighty three different plugins for
voting for Adam
components that you can use in your
applications so basically go to
directory seek for a component that what
to use and then look the description
maybe look screenshots how they are
looking how you could use them and then
just download I'll cut and paste maven
palm definition into your project and it
gets integrated automatically do a
project there are different themes these
are mostly for the desktop so this is
the basic theme like for boring business
applications banking insurance and such
things these are the going to maine kind
of area where what insurance boring
business up against a lot of data on the
screen there is also a bit more rich
themes you can also like create your own
things pick the colors that match your
company or then build like totally
customized themes so you can just put a
bit of CSS on top of that your UI
components and you can make the you what
look like anything you want you all of
these are all over the demos or what I
not come if you want to try this out a
notice little components is data
components so basically involved in all
the UI components they have data
bindings and there are three kinds of
data by this we have containers items
and properties it basically means that
item is a single thing like one sorry
property is a single thing like one
filled in your object items a collection
of dough so it's the object itself and
the container is like set of those items
so it can be a like table or three or
whatever kind of set of different
entities you want to handle in your
application and the good thing is that
this a simple interfaces you can
implement any of these and then bind
your own data into UI components or you
could use any of the existing data
binding components there are actually
quite plenty of these like in memory and
jpmc go and so forth and these are
available in the directory so if you are
looking for a certain data binding first
code directory and see if it's there
already second thing about Warren is
that it's kind of hybrid between clients
appropriate model so if you think about
web application you have normally at
least four different layers you have
like the backend server where the data
resides a business degree sites web
server you do something communication
between the client at the server and
then you have your client built with
JavaScript and in case of Google web
toolkit you also have Java JavaScript
compiler in between those layers so that
you can use Java also on the client side
so in case Google web toolkit you
actually are implementing all these four
layers in order to build your
application and the option we can also
write some JavaScript with warning you
actually have the only implement two
layers you are implemented backhand side
and you're implementing that you I on
the server side so this is quite
different you basically skip half of the
layers and I can show a bit later how
this makes a difference with your
billing the application not writing all
of your application obviously speeds
that up you can also involve in write
this layer if you want you as a
comparison in JavaScript frameworks you
are also writing for different layers in
this case you're writing JavaScript and
communications and then the server side
like some restful services and then the
back end layer as well so let's take a
look of the architecture basically good
see that involved you have to build two
parts for application you built the
backhand side that might be any kind of
business core persistency or what have
you there and then you built the UI side
but you run that on the web server side
so you run that unreal jbm virtual
machine on your web server and then you
don't do anything in this layer you
don't have to build anything for the
client you how to build any
communication in between these it's
totally automatic so interesting part is
that you can actually add components
here on the server side as well so in
most cases your application bailed out
of components it will be a custom
components and then you have these Adam
components
and these are test java components like
plain old java objects that you can use
from your user interface and in the end
it gets deployed as a portlet or servlet
but also we have a client side part we
actually have kind of built in the whole
google web toolkit in the warden so we
have the full copy of wool web torg
inside war in and it means that we have
a also a job at the JavaScript compiler
in body so if you need to do something
on the client side like build some new
rich visualization there you are free to
do so just compile from Java in the
JavaScript and put it there and these
are still used from your UI on the
server side so these are going to
automatically bound together then themes
you can add any gonna look and feel on
top of these and interesting bodies you
can also do stateless applications
client-side applications offline
application with warden so you could
actually skip these products altogether
and only program on the client side the
reason why we prefer to do things on the
server side is that you're basically
writing only half of the code lines
comparing two full stack application
very are building the client silent
service for it and the base and lodging
and the communications third thing we
are building everything on top of Java
so it means that basically everything is
just plain old java object whatever you
can do with plain old java objects you
can do with warren you can use any
timing language so it means that you can
use color Ruby Ruby to write your
applications in case this case your iPad
applications so you could write a full
ipad application without the chest by
using your favorite language like
scholar you can use any idea any tooling
available any libraries available you're
running on the server side so you can
use any of those server-side libraries
any of the Java EE library directly it's
super the most almost java servers
portals most clouds and the lies is
upper to light and so you can do
anything you want you
that so that's Warren and now let's go
to the actual topic of the press and
touch get that this kind of add-on
library built on top of body so it's
actually quite simple thing that adds a
layer on top of Baden it's three things
first of all it's a set of UI components
so there are a bunch of components that
model the UI is from iOS like buttons
and navigates managers and so forth then
there is a theme that looks like native
application and third we have built in
offline mode so if you want to kind of
add offline mode for some part of your
application that's also doable with
touch get so what can happen
occasionally you can build with that
there is one example application from
puma it's a product portfolio management
application for for the manager for the
for the product managers so that they
can kind of choose which costumes and
shoes and so forth they offering next
year and you can kind of add quite
sweets layouts and U is for ipod
appliques in this way and the nice thing
here is that all of the data comes from
the service side this is running on the
server side so they have direct access
to all those server-side services built
in Java as well and they can just show
them on the screen we talked on thinking
how to get this client and server side
in sync but let's try to do a bit of
development ourselves and build one
application with boring let's see if I
have connection here still nope just a
second I'll
seem to be happy
just a moment what learn that
conferences are always a bit tricky so
let's try it out again choosing a local
network and try the color of my iPad yes
there we have it so
so there is the application we tried to
build today how did I miss the mic is to
work any better now no oh I'm gonna need
a mic in a while so we are trying to
call this kind of serum application
basically from struts and just to be
Molly the serum application we have like
status paddle on the right here there
are some leads so we can take a look of
the contents of the lid this is just a
mock-up applications of the data is
quite random this is not finished
language it's just random random
generated I could have said that is
finnish language so we have also some
list of accounts here it can actually
put the really long lists its loads more
rows while I'm scrolling I can choose an
account here and then I can edit account
let's say put a new name for it save it
it gets updated here I don't want to
start rolling we have also a contacts
and opportunity so it's like full flats
application interesting side here is
that this is actually a based on jpa so
we have like I think six or so entities
in the obligation so it has a real data
layer in there and actually all of these
actions that I did just go back to the
data layer and back to the database what
else do we have here we have some church
search functionality as well let's shoot
for f and now we have accounts with f
okay so this is something that we try to
build so let's switch to this to eclipse
and see if you can build that
application
great and we have another mic here do
you hear me excellent so the application
that was demoing is actually running in
my Eclipse right now so just going to
show you that it actually running here I
just let's say we had this application
layout here with two panels are left and
right let's comment out the right one
save a refresh and now we have only one
panel so you can also run this
application locally so it makes your
development quite a bit smoother but in
order to kind of build this from scraps
let's start by deleting it it's always a
good idea honor during a demo so we
basically had four views and I just
deleted it also i have this application
class right here full of errors at the
moment so let's delete that as well so
just to have some clean starting point
and i just add unemployed in the middle
so that I get it compile like this so
this is the starting point let's start
calling first we need a window we need
can somebody somewhere where we are
building our application so let's create
a new touch window
let's go away
new touch window like this we set this
Arab as our main window so baby want to
show this window when the user comes in
and what we want to do more we could
actually say add a component new label
and say hello world and now we have a
new hello world application I hope let
refers it here yes it's how well not so
good so that's still working on ipad so
reference it here and it has created
hell would obvious for ipad so that's
couple of lines of code so what's next
we have this view with all those leads
so let's start from that creating a lead
view so in order to do that what we do
first we set up a navigation manager so
that's a component that navigates
between use only case manager let's call
that left now we get a manager as we
have to navigate managers in application
actually good create them both
and then we could just say that our
windows will contain the navigation
manager so the right one like this so we
don't see yet mods on the screen it
should be empty and now we have to start
having views for this navigation manager
so we could say right and set current
component new view so how can view we
need we need a status view but wrong is
that we don't have that yet so let's
implement the status view for us I
should be navigation view like this so
this is the pattern of how you are
building one application you build new
components for the navigation view what
we should be doing we should be showing
those leads right so in a constructor
let's create a bit of you I here oops
sorry
so what it should be showing we could
actually use a layout called vertical
component a group this comes with the
task it as well and it could put this
one in the navigation manager so set
content gee also we could kind of set
the caption for it just to see something
on the screen so let's say this is leads
view like that
what's missing still Oh public public if
you see an error of please help because
this is going to be much faster exercise
if I get some help so now we have leads
view and on the screen but no leads
visible yet so for that as we are
running on the back end we could
actually go to back-end directly and
just ask it so let's ask from back get
some leads so new leads back end get
leads and for its lead what should we do
we should put those on the screen so we
could do a new button here navigation
button and this would call that let's
say lead title and just add this to a
group our layout add component button so
this can be fully dynamic this this UI
so now we have bunch of buttons on the
screen and these also work in a such way
that I going to click something it
actually animate and navigates inside so
we should be showing that description of
the lead in there so let's add that as
well so we could create a new view here
navigation view and for that view we
could add let's say this is a lead
called
title and also we should show something
label inside here new label with the
contents of that of the lead something
like this what I missing here
Oh wrong label sorry could we get rid of
AVT already because it's disturbing is
always out of completing so now we
should be having contamination to lead
view and we also should be putting some
content in there so let's take this one
away and say you set content like this
oh the problem was that didn't navigate
actually do the vu so let's navigate to
the view
yeah and here as well no thank you you
know this is pair programming so now we
can navigate to be okay HTML so we could
kind of fix that one our label just say
label content mode HTML and now we see
like realized my levels here okay that
was one part so we can come generate you
eyes quite easily but as you show i
actually have back in in here so i
didn't start from scratch so let's take
a look of the backhand side so one
proteins actually made into three parts
this is just a multi-modal maven project
so i have this you i pod where we
actually started from scratch with one
plus and i have also this back inside
where i have like full JP a layer with
bunch of entities these are test normal
entities so let's take one of these and
so it like product properties and tons
of getters and setters and so forth and
i also have like small facade for this
entity layer where I can ask like get
all accounts or all leads but this is
just stunning jpa so we don't go in in
there you can use any kind of back and
you watch it whether that's like sequel
watch a PA or mama DPO what have you
there the thermal i have in here is a
widget that model this is something that
I've not absolutely required but as
boring as i explained 12 body has those
clients are widgets and if you want to
add more clients of widgets you have to
recompile those widgets from Java to
JavaScript and put them in a widget yet
so in this case I'm actually using one
of those add on widgets for showing a
graph on the on the status view so I
added one of those widgets here and a
recompile it once and I just isolated
the widget on a separate project
the record ballad one again and again as
you can see now when I'm editing this
the kind of work flow between the making
a change I'm sure seeing that on the
screen it will be fast if I would have
disability compilation here that would
take like one minute or so okay let's
add one more thing we've add up those
entities on the screen so in the using
the face we have this application in the
application we had left and right view
so let's put this on the screen first
let's just create some layout to put
this in vertical layout and put this one
in the window say that it's a full size
layout taking all space and add these to
my screen this panel left and right
panel so I should be having now two
panels sit
yeah sorry about that show I should be
actually saying here
almost there but I don't see anything
new layout that setting that to screen
adding left and right there should be ok
straights so let's do it in such weather
I show you it from the from the project
that theory started from so let's see
yes so now I just pulled in my change
back here and I had the full application
right here so I explained from this
application how we are doing this
connection to the back end so if we go
to account list view this is actually
the view that we are seeing here on the
left side so this is actually quite
simple what we are doing here is we are
connecting to the HIPAA layer with this
champion container so basically kind of
connects warning uicomponent directly in
the result set from jpa so we are
creating curing occurring all the
accounts from JP layer in one line of
code and then we are just adding that on
the screen so let's see where is my
constructor
so there is a saying for this table set
conjure a date data source accounts so
I'm basically test connecting this table
on the screen to back end so we could
let's say we comment these two lines out
and refresh so we have an empty table so
instead of that let's add the data
source like this save and now we have a
table that shows all the entities from
the JP layer and basically now I'm
showing all the columns so I can hide
couple of columns with configuring this
table so this is how you connect in the
back end so what else should I be
showing from here I'll show the axon
listening code so in this table I'm just
adding a click listener so it's time
some item gets clicked I do something
and in this case I actually navigate
into a different view and this is
actually quite straightforward you just
listen for events and do something for
those events on the server side so we
could say that let's say get window show
notification item clicked
like this so let's get back here and
click actually I don't have the evil
references I'm kind of just modifying
the code on the fly one more thing is
how we are billing forms this is
actually quite straightforward us as we
are dynamic generating all those folks
we don't have the gun write this down so
the form stem cells are using form
component so these are done in a such
way that I just create a new form here
put it on the screen and when somebody
clicks this or activates this form we
are setting a data source for it let's
see
yeah so we are basically setting this
form to edit this record and for it we
are testing set item datasource and we
basically derive from this data source
what can properties it contains the
ultimate will create all the fields for
it all the editors and we bind these
back to JP a layer and then they can
commit an answer the comment or discord
this deleted data back to this stable
air so you can do really many things
like really out in in a real automatic
way okay one more thing the white one
more final thing here is how we are
building this or integrating with Adam
components in this case we have this
animated graph component here on the
front page and this is not of stutter
component involving so it just kind of
browse the directory choose one
component that is RT in the right that
and it goes into steps so the first step
to take this in is that we are adding a
dependency to these i'm using maven here
so i'm just using maven dependencies so
I put the dependency here in this widget
that project this is by the way this is
test an empty project with pom file to
kind of grab all those widgets together
so in here right just i'm using ball in
tots kid naturally but i'm also using
this dissipation bar add-on component
from the directory so I'm just basically
cut and pasting from the directory these
five lines of XML here in this pavement
project and after that void and
automatically download it of may
ultimately downloads it from the
repository and then voting compiles this
add-on rough component as a part of my
project and using that from the code
side is just one line of code so
I have it here so I'm creating this new
distribution bar graph so it's ask one
java component and then I'm just for
looping through that my sales pipeline
stages and adding new parts to this
graph so that's quite straightforward so
that was the ipad application I'm not
going through all the details as you can
take a look of this yourself so
so the source code for all of these is
online at github you could go to
github.com / yola / iran demo and pull
the pole project to your computer right
basically test maven build said Iran and
you can get it running or you can import
it to your eclipse and start editing it
but please experiment around with this
project so how does that we work behind
the scenes how does it how is it done
when we were writing this code on the
server side let's be put that's a text
field and a button on there on the
screen and out of edit listening God in
here what happens it goes in such a way
that basically your browser downloads a
bunch of HTML CSS and JavaScript from
boarding from the server side this is
quite a pile of of these and these come
built into the product the good side of
the story is that this get built
compressed to maybe 120 k 200 k
depending on how many widgets you are
using and this is a one-time download so
first time the usual look-see no tries
out this application downloads the
widgets at the second time when he comes
in it's cached in each browser so that
bootstrapping gold basically grows the
components of the screen and when you
had the components the screen you can
start interacting so frightened by
filling some details click a button this
basically sends an asus request back to
the server side and this agent request
has the details that i have changed on
the screen basically butter click and
this name that i wrote there and that's
first hundred fifty bytes of code so
this is like really lightweight
communications it goes to your code on
the server side so basically no one in
roots all of these back to your event
listening code on the server side as
here you are proximal showing something
on the screen and notification on the
same go call the result order it returns
a bit of chasin in this case 500 bytes
of chasin that describes that hey please
show not
J'son on the screen and then bar in
widget that draws the notification on
the screen it should be noted that this
is not HTML it says kind of sends
instructions on what how to modify the
components on the screen so this is like
term EULA adapter in in that sense and
basically all of the user interactions
go back and forth you can also sometimes
say that hey I don't want to send this
user possible user interaction back and
forth it gets sent when ever the
application goes to server side anyways
so how do you get started with this
first of all you could go to vote come
there are plenty of demos that you can
take a look of easiest way of getting
started it's with maven archetype so you
can just create a new empty project from
archetype and then it generates a
project that has like one button for
your touch get application then you just
pack it and run it all of these are in
the slides so you get copy this URL from
there there is also a full book about
this it also has a chapter about Warren
touch kit we have a boot on into expo
area with tons of these books so you're
going to get a copy from there if you
want you it's also available online so
as a PDF one way of getting started with
Warren is this a red card it's really
nice way of kind of showing how to build
hello world and answer the concepts in
incest couple of pages i think it's
seven pages or so and one one thing that
before going in the questions is that we
are actually arranging a meet up to
tonight here in the next hotel next to
java one so it's hot as air are not
hundred yards from from hilton that's a
kilometer for voting users and google
web too
users as well so we try to kind of
connect this user and on the bay area we
have really nice speakers Korea Cromwell
from google basic the lead of Google web
toolkit my broad from Red Hat lead of
awry project I'm give apprentice or
about how to build like hybrid client
server applications and how to do
offline mode there is some other case
demos us as well so you all welcome
there is a pretty price in url so if you
have to reserve your place in in there
but do you have any questions about this
yes
it does it does yes this part of
application I'll just put two panels
side by side so it looks a bit small but
if you just put one panel one navigation
manager on the screen it looks just fine
and I Python yes we don't this is
actually built on top of html5 so all
the rendering all the code you see is
just html5 and JavaScript the trick here
is that we have been using a lot of time
in optimizing how it gets rendered so
basically in different iOS versions
different things get hardware
accelerated and yeah how come Friday
really hard to make everything harder to
write it in in those but of course if
you want to build the best user
experience you should go native with
native applications uh yeah that's a
really good question I attached it is a
tpo licensed so it's free for free
projects but it costs a couple hundred
bucks for for commercial projects that
said actually all of the UI components
involved in work in ipad so you don't
really need touch getting oil built ipad
application but if you want it to look
like really nice on my pad then touch it
is a pretty nice component for that
runnin on what so sorry I didn't hear
you oh yeah yeah these actually run on
Google App Engine so there is a built-in
support for Google App Engine yeah that
that's actually one limitation google
appengine it has a lot of limitation on
what you can actually run in there they
are not like a related to vote in but
you cannot put all kinds of libraries in
the google app engine but if you are
living within the limitations google
have set forth at bens in body itself
and untouched itself is running on on
App Engine yeah sorry
the che loj a container that's a one
atom component to botany so it's not
part of the coral library yeah I would
say so the Brahma model is really swing
like or desktop like so you're building
with the same similar API so if the team
is already found a swing and you have
code based on swing it the conversion
should be quite straightforward that's
it you basically have to rewrite the UI
layer because the components are the
different but because both are state
full application in such sense that the
UI state is preserved and it's it's more
of a kind of desktop like application
time than a web page it should be quite
straightforward
that the table component itself is quite
customizable so it has like here are
keys and drag and drop and column
handling and and so forth so you should
take that look of that first and most
probably you see or hold a feature you
got try to file in there any other
questions yep we have we taught you that
at the moment is in version 2 and the
version tree is coming out with one and
seven in in a month or so we have been
releasing major version of touch get I
think a little more frequent than once a
year and then we are adding like minor
releases with some minor extra features
in there so you should be expecting like
yearly major releases and maybe one or
two minor release per year and of course
bug fix releases get get really spent
then we find box okay thank you much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
