now we from Oracle are very well aware
of the fact that there's been a lot of
noise about this in the press lately and
we would like an opportunity to talk to
you about how we work in this area and
what we're doing to improve the security
of Java now one of the things we have
made this has been a plan that we
working on for a very long time is to
hire a number of people to help us
strengthen Java security and one of them
will be talking to you here today so I'm
not the speaker I just like to thank you
for being here today and I hope that you
will find this worthwhile and with that
I'd like to introduce Milton Smith
Milton alright thanks Heinrich ok
okay so a good morning and welcome to my
session making the future secure with
Java so as Hendrick said the purposes of
the session is to provide some
background on what we do in security our
policy and our program and also to
discuss some of our plans on how we're
going to improve Java against a new sort
of attacks and things like that so this
right here unlike a lot of sessions here
going on at javaone is not a technical
session per se and we're not really
going to discuss any vulnerabilities or
that sort of thing but I think at the
conclusion it's my hope that you'll get
a better understanding for what we do in
in our group and also some of our
security plans for Java ok so just a
quick for my own benefit how many people
are full-time security practitioners
here ok few people Oracle doesn't count
okay okay how many with significant
responsibilities and security ok all
right
so this right here is you've probably
seen a few of these at different
presentations okay so Who am I so I'm
responsible for the Java security
program which is basically all the all
the java stuff except for EE which
includes vision and features and I
helped with the internal and external
communications and things like that my
background you know there's a lot of
different expertise in security and
mines mines programming that's my
background and then I switched over to
security some time ago and it's been
kind of me ever since so I joined Oracle
not too long ago from yahoo where I
manage the security program for user
data analytics group it's probably not
as well known as email or IM or
properties like that but it's not
infinitely important because it's the
knowledge of where the money and clicks
come from
so we're going to talk about a number of
things and this is just a little agenda
to kind of show you where we're going to
cover so not everybody has the same sort
of skill set so we're just going to do a
little level setting about security in
the industry about some about risk and
risk choices and then do more cover more
on get away from industry and talk more
about working and what work was doing
for security and what we're doing in the
Java group and then finally we'll talk
about some of our security improvements
that we'd like to make for java and then
provide some actionable things that that
you can do as well as us okay so I got
these from the Java one site and I
notice they're on posters around here
and things and I you know to me it just
it seemed pretty interesting a lot of
times we're we're deeply engaged in
making Java and building Java better we
don't sometimes that we're not as in
touch with how people use it and some of
these numbers so I thought they were
interesting i figured i'd i'd put them
up there in case anybody has not seen
him but you know if you look at some of
these numbers ninety-seven percent of
enterprise desktops on java a billion
downloads a year 9 million developers
worldwide three billion devices so to me
that means Java is highly relevant and
pervasive
so a lot has changed you know Java was
introduced around 1995 and a lot has
changed in the world since then you know
around the 80s and 90s data destruction
was pretty popular you know it's kind of
cool to format your hard drive or like
do pranky little things like endless
rebooting at your computer that you
couldn't break out of and things like
that hacktivism but i think that's
that's kind of the key the attacks were
were pranks and and for the purposes of
demonstrating the technical prowess of
attackers but what we see today is
really far different you know today
there are a lot of worms and botnets
that are popular actually was able to
get some bots code on some of the dark
channels and kind of pull it apart to
see what it looks like and it's
amazingly sophisticated the code that I
happen to be looking at looking at is a
popular bot and it includes a basically
a dynamic analysis which will scan
computers looking for vulnerabilities
and then it contains several different
payloads to inject itself when Ana
vulnerability is found and then also
contains a cadre of commands about the
one that i was looking at had about 50
different commands that it could check
to unsecured IRC servers and a wait for
commands from the bot herder and some of
the commands were pretty interesting
they ranged anywhere from of course
format the hard drive to all sorts of
other things like look for quick book
files all sorts of things and I think
the main point to keep in mind here is
that there's there's a shift you know
the shift is that instead of just
destroying the target well now it's been
realized that the target is valuable
it's nice to run quietly in the
background we like your computer and and
will do things to it too to evade your
notice it's valuable the other thing
that we've seen is a state or terrorist
sponsored cyber warfare like Stuxnet and
things like that that is of course
that's very different we've seen
intellectual property theft is a concern
now it used to be you know twenty years
ago that the borders we're pretty solid
everybody worked in the same place the
resources data resources were but
nowadays people work very distributed
and not only are the people distributed
but also the data is distributed it can
be in other countries and unfortunately
not all countries enforce the rule of
law of the same another thing that's
kind of interesting too is so if we look
at like modern game like World of
Warcraft mmorpgs they have a concept of
virtual currency and virtual currency
actually has like an exchange rate like
other currencies and you can convert
real dollars to so much virtual gold but
one of the things that's interesting
about that that I find is that the laws
are very gray in some of these areas so
for instance if you were to game the
system and and make lots of virtual gold
and somehow evade you know everybody's
notice it might be a breach of lizards
terms of service but it's not
necessarily against the law so here you
go you have an opportunity where you
know where money can be made but it's
not necessarily against the law so it's
an area where laws perhaps having caught
up
so I think you know today everybody is
definitely more security conscious
virtually every organization and user is
concerned about security today but one
of the problems of security or the
challenges is that strong versus poor
security is difficult for users to
evaluate today if you know if you're
missing an enter or submit button on a
form it's plainly obvious but if you
have strong versus weak security it's
not so apparent to the user it's harder
to evaluate in fact it takes highly
specialized skills and tools to evaluate
two different products that provide the
same features right not easy to do for
users so so what we're talking about
here we're going to kind of segue into
risk a little bit and risk during a risk
versus rewards and risk is really how we
as humans function every day we make
risks risks and so I devised a small
test to test your risk awareness it's
pretty early so bear with me okay so
when animals go to a watering hole there
may be other animals with big teeth
present do you drink well the answer is
depends how thirsty you are right if
you're not very thirsty well you might
want to avoid the watering hole with all
the big teeth animals but if you're
highly thirsty and haven't had a drink
for a long time well maybe you're going
to take the chance okay so the second
one everyone that's been treated by a
doctor has or will die so the success
rate is precisely zero do we continue to
see doctors well yes of course
we do doctors are still the benefit life
is risky so we do do we visit a doctor
every day for a checkup and the answer
is no right so you know I'm being
humorous here to make a point but we all
have we all make risk decisions every
single day and making risk choices and
focusing our resources for the best
possible impact is what we do so just
like the animals at the watering hole
our appetite for risk governs our
behavior and we use informal risk based
approaches but sometimes not everybody
makes the next step right formalizing
our thoughts about risk and how it
governs our behavior so risk as applied
to software isn't necessarily a perfect
process you know we've learned a lot of
things along the way about our risk
areas and just like medical a technology
and improves over time so it's still
worth the doctor's visit so to speak so
risk methodology helps drive security
decisions fixing the wrong areas has no
impact fixing low risk areas provides
little impact the key is to focus on
what matters so what's so plainly
obvious in our personal life also
applies to our business life so here is
to kind of bring things to a more
concrete level you know we're used to
dealing with platforms here at java at
in the Java group but an example that
might be that you can relate to would be
web applications and you make decisions
about securing your web applications all
the time so some of the questions that
you probably answer would be for example
how important is the application to the
business is it real important or is it
not very important if the application
goes down is
at a high dollar loss or you know or is
it just an inconvenience are there
compliance requirements to this system
so if something happens and you lose
evidence to somebody go to jail that's
important right or large fines also
internet-facing applications you know
what sort of interfaces does the web
application provide are there are their
web pages that are visible are there web
data services things like that so
forward facing things on the internet
would be would be riskier perhaps also
any sort of unauthenticated interfaces
so if you have an application that's
visible on the web and there are
portions of your application that the
Internet at large does not have to
authenticate to see that means everybody
can hit on those things anonymously so
that's kind of that is a concern and of
course those are just a small sampling
of risk factors applied to the web
application security space and platforms
definitely have different concerns but
the approaches is very similar
so now that we've talked a little bit
about the industry at large and level
set it for a bit now it's time to talk a
little bit more about what we're doing
here closer to home so first of all why
is why is security important to Oracle
so for starters Oracle produces Java
technology but Oracle also uses it as
well there's a lot of products here that
that use Java technology just like you
guys use it so basically the product
teams here demand you know have the same
sort of demands and concerns that that
you guys do and confidentiality and
integrity availability very important to
the Java ecosystem so one of the things
that helps us drive our decision process
is policies we have a number of
different policies that are that are
relevant we're not going to talk about
them all we're not going to talk in
depth about them but we are going to
take a look at a few because we've seen
different questions in these areas and
stuff and one of those is communications
so we have several different ways that
we communicate news to the communities
one of those is security alerts you
might have seen those before and those
are technical documents that provide
information about impacted releases and
risk as well as remediation based
information there's RSS feeds that you
can subscribe to and things like that
another is critical patch update
advisories so we're going to talk about
the CPU process in a minute here but
basically it's how we how we do
remediation for for Java in the CPU the
CPU basically so it's a binary that can
be applied
the idea is to not include features and
just include the remediation so that way
it keeps the the risk of you know
stability problems low so another thing
that comes up here is why don't we
respond to published reports of alleged
security vulnerabilities and Oracle
products so there's a lot of reasons and
so one of the things here too is you'll
see in the slides you'll see little
policy links down there so you can
actually go out to Oracle's website and
take a look at the real policy so the
bullets that I'm providing here a pretty
high level so one of the reasons why we
don't respond to allege vulnerabilities
is that you know correcting or
corroborating articles provides more
information two attackers if it were
real vulnerability we were discussing
and we really just don't want to do that
also you know many times reports don't
provide the required engineering details
to really do an evaluation a lot of
things are purposely sensationalized and
are really kind of light on what we
would need from an engineering
perspective to to say that this thing
really matches the alert that we just
released or whatever the you know so
technical details preconditions impact
remediation mitigation details
everything is not there also if we
selectively communicated to some people
and not other people then what would
happen is information about
vulnerabilities would get out into the
social media and it would force
customers to and the communities to have
to go to social media in order to find
out information about Oracle products
and that's just not a that's not a good
way to operate so what we do is you know
we are very precise in how
communicate and when we communicate it's
actionable and everybody receives it at
the same time so we have very as you saw
before very precise modes of how we
communicate this sort of information so
what we're looking at here again is a
little bit more in house this is kind of
a you may have seen things like this
before a software development lifecycle
this is not any particular cycle it's
just some sort of generic one that I put
together and it basically just shows you
know things go from a concept or
requirement stage all the way to
delivery which is on the second slide
but the idea here is that like in the
early stages of a project we have
security okay so we have security
throughout the whole life cycle and the
idea of having it up front is that early
on you can influence projects in a
positive way it's a lot easier to change
an idea than it is to change a million
lines of code right so get your concerns
in and get them addressed upfront nudge
and influence that sort of thing also we
like to be engaged upfront because you
know certain things are high risk you
know we shouldn't need to spend the same
amount of time that we spend for an
incredibly risky project with a project
that's not quite as risky so for example
an example of something you know going
back to the ax apps example you know if
you have an application on the internet
with a lot of different interfaces well
you're going to want to spend some time
with that app you're going to want to
make sure all the input validation is
being done properly and things like that
versus if you have a appt lakay shin
that is in the deepest darkest corner
your data center and it's completely
firewalled off well you know maybe
that's a little bit different level of
risk maybe it's not handling critical
data so maybe when teams make changes to
that system you don't need to focus on
it quite as much so those are the kind
of things that you can get in the cons
and again this is just this is very
summery level there's a lot more detail
than just a few bullets you can fit on a
slide but it's the idea during analysis
you know you'd review the designs to see
what engineering has come up with make
sure that designs and architectural
choices conform to security policies
during the coding process peer review
things like that manual assessments some
static analysis actually can be done at
that point too and then into testing you
know we have text test security test
cases that are also part of the
functional tests as we deliver new
features and things like that we have to
create new test cases one of the things
that I like to kind of cover too is that
you know the different we have a lot of
custom tools that that we need to use
some lot of times commercial analysis
tools and things like that don't don't
quite work on a platform like they would
an application because a lot of times
we're coating to to new things we'll
talk about that more and I think the
other thing I'd like to say is that
security is much more than just Milton
Smith there's a lot of a lot of folks
that do security there's a lot of people
a lot of engineers that have some
top-notch security skills we have GPS
Bruce here as a member of GPS director
and does the security alerts group yeah
global product security thank you all
right and Eric Maurice from security
assurance is that correct yeah okay so
there's a lot of different folks and
representing different areas and we all
come together to to make Java stronger
product the other thing is that we have
ethical hacking teams that do periodic
spot checks and things like that
we have Spock's that are kind of like a
subject matter experts on security for
their areas as well as different sort of
training security training sessions and
tech talks and things like that so the
so if we start looking at the
remediation process there's some
different things there that are key so
we have adopted industry best practices
for for our scoring vulnerabilities and
we use the common vulnerability scoring
system which is available out there on
the internet you can see but how it
works is you go through a evaluation
process and at the end the vulnerability
gets a score which is a real number
that's positive and the bigger the
number the more risk it is so the
process of evaluating and assigning the
score is what we are well what I'm
trying to coin as triage and one of the
things with triage is we really want
triage to occur quickly so the reason
why I triage needs to occur quickly is
because until you've triaged a
vulnerability you know well for one you
don't really know if it's just a
spurious report or if it really is a
vulnerability but even beyond that
assuming that it was you really don't
know what the impact of that
vulnerability is until it's been
properly assessed so a fast assessment
is very important and then after that
assessment the scoring take place you
can then determine and prioritize you
know when the remediation should occur
and it is a very precise process and you
just can't go from reported
vulnerability to jamming it into the
code right it doesn't work that way
there's a lot of impacts when changes
are made
and they have to be vetted properly so
as not to cause more damage so the way
that we handle the remediation is the
critical patch updates which are the
binaries for the Java platform group
they're done three times a year it's not
necessarily that on the same cycle is
Oracle and we're looking at making some
changes there for the future perhaps we
also have emergency releases at times
depending on the risk and different
factors we may decide that an emergency
release is appropriate so this right
here is kind of it shows how the CPUs
are laid out basically every four months
unless there's a little disruption with
security alerts or things like that and
then there are some rules for java cpus
so Java CPUs are the main release for
security vulnerabilities that's that's
how we remediated some and we make those
binaries available to the communities
the other thing that's important to know
is that you know there's different
versions of Java out there that people
are running and we look at we have to
look at all the different releases
because sometimes a vulnerability and
one release is also an another one so we
have to we have to have a comprehensive
approach that covers all families also
on CPUs triggered the auto update
process so if you have the little icon
on your tool tray to update java those
would be security fixes would be pushed
out through that so we do generally
recommend that on dates for cpus are
published 12 months in advance and
security alerts are are released as
necessary and they're very infrequent
and then there's all the CPUs alternate
between the regular releases the non
CPUs and so if you go to the next CPU
you would actually inherit some features
from the previous non CPU but because of
the way the the everything is staggered
if you implement the CPU or you install
it the non CPU release would have been
vetted for some time so there's a lower
risk of doing a security patch and then
having some problems that's that's the
idea of that approach and then we make
those releases available on Java calm
and otn okay so I talked a little bit
about different tools for securing
platforms and applications so typically
an application is written for a
particular route use case but really a
platform has to encompass a lot of use
cases you know if you look at Java it
runs you know runs on devices it runs
you know mobile devices kiosks servers
desktops there's a lot of different use
cases and defending all those use cases
is a little bit different than defending
it out we've had to develop a number of
tools ourselves you know if we take you
know if we just take a typical static
analysis tool a popular one you know
imagine imagine when Java transition to
the introduction of generics or
something so that was new things that we
were experimenting with making changes
to the language and running a static
analysis tool through something that
would use generics at the time would of
course not work it would break because
the tool wouldn't necessarily understand
generic so here where we're at the
cutting edge developing new things and
so sometimes the current state of
Technology were one step ahead so it
doesn't work properly that's not to say
it doesn't in all cases but it's
something that
we have to consider and and also due to
the platform nature we've developed
tools that are specialized for what we
do and the purpose of communicating some
of these differences is just to help you
understand you know how Java and
securing Java might be a little
different than securing a nap so one of
the things that we're going to talk
about now is some of the on-going
security improvements that that we're
making that we've made and some things
that we have for the future so one of
the one of the concerns nowadays is
phishing attacks you know there's a lot
of people that get emails and from
untrusted sources and they and they
click links in their email and sometimes
bad things happen you know why do people
click links from untrusted sources well
I don't know but they do so i think the
responsible thing really is that we need
to be you know what sort of measures can
we implement to help defend against that
keep our users safe and also make java
stronger so one of the things that we're
looking at is when the security baseline
of the current jari is out of date we're
investigating the possibility of putting
some sort of pop up a warning which
would prevent what we would call like a
drive-by exploitation where the user
receives a phishing email it contains
some sort of malware link and they would
just click on the link and it would just
automatically execute the Java Virtual
Machine and what we're talking about is
is as getting rid of that you know
making it introducing a dialogue that
would prevent that from automatically
executing and those features would be
configurable by the user so it would
default to a secured approach so
normally it would run properly but if
the JRE is old
out of date then it would pop up that
that warning dialog if you know this
sort of thing were to occur the other
thing that we're going to do is we're
calling it for a lack of a better name
now and it's we're calling it that best
used before date on JRE security what
what is that really so there are gres
that are deployed out there on
standalone systems that perhaps don't
have access to call back to call back
home and see what their security
baseline is and so what we're saying
with those jerrys is that the JRE will
be aware of when it expires so what do
we mean by you know the JRE expiring at
it's not really that it shuts down it's
just that it knows it's you know it
knows that it's been sitting out there
for six months or whatever that time is
but it knows that it's old and it hasn't
been able to contact to find out what
the newer version of Java is so once it
gets past that set point it realizes
it's old it'll start to make some
decisions a little bit differently it
will understand that it may be
vulnerable so it'll change its behavior
a little bit so an example of a behavior
change and we're not talking about just
shutting down Java when it hits a
certain date what we're saying is once
we've hit that date and we know we're
old maybe we'll pop up that warning
dialog for for a privilege sort of
operation not for normal operations but
operations that would require some
significant privileges and once again
that's a feature that could be you know
I don't know what the interface for that
will be yet we're still working through
that but maybe you know maybe a slider
that could be adjusted that resets
things too low or something like that
so I think you know what I'm just
throwing out ideas here so that's a good
question we don't have all those
questions answered yet yeah we're really
you know if you look at drive by
exploitation here you know we're talking
about a you know virtual machine that
would be on a desktop drive by is
typically a concern you know you don't
probably not going to check your email
on a server or web surf that sort of
thing but I think that we do want to
look into you know how this would apply
to servers to
suspicious and at a high enough level
thing
disabled certain parts of the
applications I think there's a lot can
be done there
okay so some of the other things that
we're thinking about is making it easier
to disable Java you know if there's some
you know if you have a concern about
Java running in your browser well you
know we should just have a little on/off
button or something like that something
that you you don't actually need to
uninstall Java if you you know if you
just want to turn it off temporarily so
we're looking at something like that you
know how would that work you know maybe
you know windows it would be like a
control panel option or on OSX maybe
system preferences but I think once you
get to wherever that spot is on that OS
it should be done in a very similar way
so it's easier to explain to folks so
one of the other things that I'll share
too is so we're going to be starting to
encourage users to uninstall older gre's
the first step is we've just we've
created an applet to help install some
of these older versions i basically java
would for a while was putting it would
put the new version out there but not
necessarily clean up the old one and
there there were good reasons for that
and then i guess starting in 2007 jdk
update 10 started doing the the sort of
patch in place where it cleans up the
old one and puts up the new one but
there's still some people that don't
turn auto update on and things like that
so how do you clean all those users up
we've created this uninstaller applet
it's it's a first step and actually that
we're announcing that today and jeff
hoffman is going to talk more about that
at five-thirty as well as tarea Yamamoto
and the Java user experience team
presents the latest UI updates long
title but so they'll be running that
session and they'll be kind of talking
through some of those screens and how
they look I think so the applets a good
step it's a good step to to help address
this concern
turn but in the longer run I think we
want it more integrated with our
installer and so we're looking at that
as a next step so moving on to JRE
security hardening one of the things
that we want to do is have a
configurable IT policy you know there
the IT policy would be what is allowed
to a long run on the client for applets
and jnlp what are the named resources
what are the authoritative sources
perhaps limiting what you can do by IP
address wild card supports think things
like that so those are some of the
things that we're working through right
now and the idea is to really balance
usability and security and once again
this is another feature that can be
turned off so we're not strong arming
anybody and into using the feature but
we're going to make it available to
sites that want to be able to manage
their IT policy for their organizations
then we have a rehab more we want to do
more frequent security feeds blacklists
and security baseline updates so
basically we can blacklisting is really
a last resort you know so if there's a
jar or something that we know contains
malware we can we can blacklist that but
we have to be very very careful about
blacklisting because of course if we
black list something now it's going to
break somebody stuff right so there's
has to be done thoughtfully ok so we've
discussed a industry in a large and a
little bit about what we've what we've
been doing some of the features we're
thinking about things we're thinking
about and now what are some of the
things that that you can do as well as
us so if you want to record it report
vulnerabilities you can report
vulnerabilities to secular underscore us
at oracle com and you can see our our
policy there if you need more
information if you want to make new
feature suggestions for security you can
report those there's to the bug report
ghassan calm / bug report and then also
so that you have some sort of idea when
the cpu security patches will be
available we've kind of gathered those
up here and and put relevant links there
so there's some things that you can do
for end-users to help keep yourself
secure keep your JRE up to date you know
all the keeping your JRE up to date will
ensure that you have all the latest
security fixes on there also make sure
that you have your auto update on in
case there is something that comes out
then you can get the latest patch and
then of course you know practice defense
and depth you know typical security
practices virus scanners firewalls you
know whatever you think is appropriate
for what you're doing for developers if
you're developing on Java will try to
support the most current JRE that way
your users can upgrade as well right
because nobody likes to try to run on a
version of Java that the app is not
certified on so as a developer if you
keep your apps on the latest and
greatest then users can update signing
applications of course validating
untrusted data do input and output
validation if you're taking data from
untrusted sources you know make sure
that you don't get any surprises that
you're not expecting there's also a
really good project out there probably a
lot of you
here to heard about it already is the
open web application security project
they have a lot of good security
resources and things that you can apply
to what you're doing everything from
coding practices and things that include
Java to how to define test cases for
different security things like
authentication authorization stuff like
that there's also another session here
on Wednesday secure coding guidelines
for java programming and will that will
be right here at the Hilton so yeah so
there's some stuff there you can do and
then we're also hiring so security
professionals engineers so you can come
work with your heroes and perhaps you
can be a hero too that's all I have
