customize and use software library let's
start by customizing the software
library storage locations to do this go
to the setup menu select provisioning
and patching and click on software
library this will take us to the
software library administration page
software library offers two options for
storage number one is the upload file
locations upload file locations are used
when the file is to be stored within the
software library the two storage types
that are offered are OMS shared file
system and the OMS agent file system to
add a storage location of type upload
click on add provide a name and location
and click OK then the software library
location is added for the first time as
seen in the screen it takes about 15 to
20 minutes to upload all the out of box
content that is bundled with the product
this includes the out of box deployment
procedures and other components and
directives that are stored in the
software library the second option is
reference file locations this is new in
Enterprise Manager 12 reference file
locations are used when the actual files
required for deployment is stored
outside of the software library and we
only need to maintain a reference to
this file within Enterprise Manager the
3 protocols that are supported for
reference file system is HTTP NFS and
agent which means you can add a web
server based location or you can add an
NFS mounted location or use any of the
agents for read-only access to saved
files to add for example an HTTP
location click on the button add provide
a name and a location and click ok now
that we have seen and configured the
storage locations for software library
we will go ahead and create components
and directives required for our
deployment activity to create components
and directives we will navigate to the
software library console
select the enterprise menu code of
provisioning and patching and select
software library we will start by
creating a folder in software library to
do this select a folder under which you
need to create your custom folder
right-click select create folder provide
a name description and click OK once a
folder has been created we will add
components and directives to it let's
start by adding a component to do this
we go to the Actions menu select create
entity and component there are
components of various types we will
select the default which is generic
component and click continue
provide name description and other
attributes for the file that is to be
uploaded and click Next ignore the
configure step of this wizard and click
Next here we will upload the actual
files that are required to be added to
this component for our deployment
activity we select the upload files
option specify a destination this will
be the storage location that we just
configured select the storage location
and click OK now we will select the
source file and upload it to the storage
location the two options offered our
local machine which is your desktop or
an agent machine we will choose agent
and select a host which has the agent
deployed select the suitable agent and
click Sling to add the file click on the
Add button and login by providing the
correct credentials for the selected
host we will select name and click OK
now browse through the file system or
provide the path and select search
select the file that you wish to add
and save now that the GRE or the violin
question has been added we will click
Next we don't want to add any directives
at this point so we will ignore the step
and click Next review the details that
have been provided and click Save and
upload to finish the component creation
process at this point Enterprise Manager
will reach out to the agent and upload
the file into its storage location this
activity may take a couple of minutes a
job is submitted for the upload activity
the message for which is displayed at
the top of the page with the job name
refresh the page manually to see if the
upload has been completed this can be
confirmed by looking at the status
column for our component it says ready
now we'll go about creating a directive
the creative director select the folder
and click on the Actions menu choose
create entity and choose the option
directives provide name and description
and click Next to move forward the scrub
to install JRE requires a single input
and that is destination location this
input can be added to the directive by
clicking the button add under command
line arguments and by providing a
property name click OK to add this
command line argument the script is
shell or bash in this case we will
choose the upload file option again
select a destination location in this
case since the script is small we will
choose to add it from our local machine
click Add and browse to the location
where the file is stored and provide a
name for it confirm that the script has
been added and click Next review the
inputs that have been provided and click
Save and upload as before a job has been
submitted to upload this script since
the script was small the upload was
almost instantaneous
now our software library component and
directives have been created and we are
ready to move on with our deployment
