infrastructure object storage hello I'm
having a hard time staying ahead of the
demand for storage I'm looking for a
storage service that can help me store
my growing data durably and
cost-effectively I've been hearing a lot
about the Oracle cloud infrastructure
object storage can you tell me more
about this service
sure Oracle cloud infrastructure object
storage is an internet skill highly
durable and highly available storage
service it's ideal for storing
unstructured data data is stored as
objects in buckets a bucket is a logical
container that groups objects together a
bucket is associated with a single
compartment which in turn has policies
that indicate what actions a user can
perform on a bucket and all the objects
in the bucket
you can access this service via the
Oracle cloud infrastructure service
console SDK or CLI
how can I estimate how much storage I
should purchase upfront
you don't need to make any upfront
storage purchases object storage is
elastic you only pay for what you use
you can seamlessly scale your storage
footprint as your need to store data
scales you can store an infinite amount
of data in the object storage create
thousands of buckets per account and
store an unlimited number of objects per
bucket an object can be as large as 10
terabyte
Wow you can really store large files
uploading a 10 terabyte file can take a
really long time are there any
techniques that I can leverage to
efficiently upload such large files
you can use the multi-part upload
feature to efficiently upload large
files you can segment your file into
smaller parts and then upload these
parts in parallel object storage
supports up to 10,000 parts per file and
a part can be as small as 10 megabyte
using multi-part upload not only
significantly reduces the upload time
but also minimizes the impact of network
failures if a part fails to upload for
any reason you can retry to upload the
part instead of having to upload the
entire file
what about durability how durable is the
data stored in the object storage data
stored in the object storage is very
durable multiple copies of an object are
stored redundantly across multiple
availability domains in a given region
data integrity is monitored using
checksums any drop in redundancy is Auto
detected and remedied immediately
without any customer impact
what about security how secure is my
data in the Oracle cloud infrastructure
object storage
object storage supports server-side
encryption all data stored in object
storage is automatically encrypted data
is uploaded and downloaded from object
storage over SSL endpoints using the
HTTP protocol by default only
authenticated users that have explicitly
been granted access to specific
resources can access data stored in the
object storage the service is tightly
integrated with Oracle cloud
infrastructure Identity and Access
Management for an additional layer of
security you can encrypt objects prior
to sending them to object storage that
gives you total control over not only
your data but also the encryption keys
that are used to encrypt the data
that sounds great how can I share my
data stored in the object storage with
others
you can make a bucket public to share
data with others anyone with knowledge
of the public bucket name and associated
namespace can anonymously read data
stored in a public bucket with public
buckets you can also list objects or
retrieve the object metadata if you do
not wish to make a bucket public you can
use pre authenticated requests or
Identity and Access Management or iam
policies to share data these two options
offer a more secure means of sharing
data with others as compared to public
buckets
when do you recommend using object
storage some typical use cases include
big data backup or archive and content
repository big data object storage
offers a scalable storage platform which
enables you to not only store large
datasets but also operate seamlessly on
it
optimized for high throughput you can
share the store data widely with
moderate latency backup or archive
backup or archive data is typically
written once in read many times the
durability and low cost characteristics
of object storage make it a perfect
platform to store long living data
content repository the object storage
supports any content type images logs
and video you can reliably store this
data for a long time and the storage
scales seamlessly without performance
degradation
you can also access this content
directly from object storage
that's great how about a quick demo on
how to use object storage
sure
login to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
portal in the console click object
storage under storage
the object storage uses buckets to
organize your data to use the object
storage you need to create a bucket
first and then add data files click
create bucket
enter the bucket name the name cannot be
changed once the bucket is created the
name can contain letters numbers dashes
and periods select a storage tier
standard is the default primary object
storage tier archive is a special tier
for data to which you do not need
immediate access click create bucket
the bucket is created either click the
bucket name or click the actions icon
and then click view bucket to view it's
details the service supports individual
files up to 10 terabytes you can use the
console to upload files up to 5
gigabytes or smaller for larger files
use SDK CLI or REST API
click upload object
follow the prompts in the upload wizard
to browse
choose and upload the objects
the object is uploaded once the object
is uploaded you can see a listing of all
the objects that have been uploaded to
the bucket
great thanks for sharing all this
information
you're welcome
please go to the Oracle cloud
infrastructure portal to learn more be
sure to sign up for the free trial and
get started right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
