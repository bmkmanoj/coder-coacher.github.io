in this demonstration we will show you
how a self-service user would go to the
cloud and access cloud resources I'm a
cloud self-service user named John Smith
I'm going to go ahead and log in to our
company's cloud self-service portal here
you can see some of the machines that I
have deployed before when I did some
previous application deployments as well
as my current usage this portal will
actually also allow me to go ahead and
request some databases based on the new
projects that I'm working on here I can
see the databases that I've already pre
provisioned and for each one of these
running databases i can actually drill
into the database instance and look at
performance and availability information
for the database itself however what I
want to do right now is create a new
application deployment I'm going to
request a new server and I can go ahead
and pick from a catalog of applications
that I can deploy to my portal based on
what our cloud administrators have set
up in this case I'm going to pick the
sales order application assembly it will
be deployed into the East Coast zone the
sales order application is essentially a
multi-tier enterprise-class application
and has some cloud components in it such
as a weblogic server a load balancer and
an external database that it can speak
to now I can go ahead and configure
these tears within the application that
I'm deploying for example you can see I
have a soweit ear and this tier allows
me to have a minimum of one server and a
maximum of four servers with an initial
setup of four servers what I'm going to
do is actually set it to an initial
setup of two servers and allow it to be
auto scalable and I will also choose a
small size server configuration what
this will ensure is that I'm not
over-provisioning resources for the
application but that the application can
scale out as it needs to the other nice
thing about this portal is it allows me
not only to request machines and set
them up but configure the software that
is to be deployed in these machines so
here is an example I can go ahead and
pick from a set of product configuration
properties that will be relevant for
this particular application
for now I'm going to go ahead and
schedule this request for immediate use
I'll review my deployment details and
select finish now you can see I have a
new request that has been created once
the deployment is available to me I
could go to the my servers tab and
monitor and manage my deployment much as
i did with databases earlier i could
also go to the storage tab and ask for
additional storage over time and i can
track my usage and metering through the
chargeback tab the portal also allows me
to associate policies within my
deployment as an example and auto
scaling policy but you can see I have an
auto scaling policy group set up if you
look at the bottom of the screen here
you can see that I have a scale-up
policy that says that I should scale up
my application if my cpu is greater than
ninety percent and i should scale it
down if my cpu is less than twenty
percent this will allow my application
to automatically scale up and scale down
in response to workload what I'm going
to do is associate this policy with
portions of my application I'm going to
choose the soweit ear and have it be
added to the policy group now the solo
tier will automatically be scaled up and
scaled down in response to workload
based on my policy and so now I've
provisioned an entire enterprise class
application including multiple tiers and
automatic scale up and scale out
policies we just showed you how easy it
is to allow cloud users to consume cloud
services without IT intervention thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
