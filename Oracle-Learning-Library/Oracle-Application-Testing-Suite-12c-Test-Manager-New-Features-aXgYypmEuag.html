features and updates for application
testing suite 12 dot one my name is
Carolyn cow and i'm a senior product
manager for ats in this recording i will
talk about the new features and updates
for orgo test manager i will also
briefly cover the 80's general features
this recording covers slides 36 through
46 in the 80s 12-1 new features training
slide deck let's start with the oracle
test manager test execution enhancement
slide now for simplicity i would refer
to oracle test manager as otm from me on
the new test execution tab in oracle
test manager lets you define collections
of test cases combined intestine so
testers can select or deselect specific
tests within a test set to execute prior
to starting the execution of the test
this is a feature that a lot of our
users have been waiting for prior to 12
dot one for each test cycle users have
to make a make a copy of the test cases
and this is because we're reporting
there was really no way to differentiate
results for example between a 903 one
test run and a 12 that one test run as
long as the results were saved all under
the same test case in 12 dot one we
introduce the test execution tab and
that solves this problem i will quickly
give a demo for the test execution tab
so say for example you have a collection
of test cases as we see here in the test
tab and you have organized them based on
the type of test that they are although
you can organize them any way you wish
now one way to set up the test execution
is go to the test execution tab and
organize them by release so if you see
here I have a test folder for nine
thirty one and another one for twelve
dot one and within each test voter I
have a test set for each type of test
for example smoke tests regression tests
or performance tests and then within
each test set I have a test list which
contains the list of test cases and this
can be a combination of both manual and
automated test cases that needs to be
run for that particular test set so this
is just an example of how you can
organize your test execution keep in
mind this is just one way to organize
your test cycles you can actually set up
your test execution any way you like so
let's go ahead and execute this test set
to see what it really looks like so
after I click on execute tested a pop-up
window appears you select the system you
want to run on in the version and you'll
see here the list of test cases that
reflect the same as what's under the
test list section here you can do
filtering you know this list is really
long you want to filter for certain
status their name etc you can click on
the filter icon and specify certain
criteria stew meat to get a shorter list
of the test cases you want to run bring
our case in this example there's only
three so i'll keep all three checked and
all of them you can also manually check
and uncheck any of these test cases that
you want to run or not run after
clicking on run you'll see another
pop-up window and it shows that it's
running tests one of three they'll show
you what type of is the name of the test
and the status shortly after that
another pop-up window will appear and if
it's a manual test they'll prompt you to
enter results for each step if this was
an automated test it will run either in
the background or foreground depending
on how you have the agent configured and
then it will automatically specify
whether the test has passed or failed
since it's an automated test case for
our example all three test cases I have
our manuals so I'll go ahead and enter
past for both tests tips okay after you
hit okay you can enter it whatever
summer you want and then another window
pops up prompting you to enter the
results for the second test case so for
this test case let's go ahead and put
warning and password estep
and then another window pops up
prompting user to enter the results for
the third test case now if you want to
mark all the test steps as you know the
same status you can use this drop-down
here
so in the end you'll get a summary of
how many tests have passed how many have
failed how many has warnings how many
were skipped and you'll see here that
I've made one past one warning one field
okay so this is running you test set
within the test execution tab now you'll
also see up here a summary of the most
recent run status so you'll see here
that one past one warning one field it
also shows you the percentage of the
overall pastorate fail ring warning rate
now here in the run history section you
can click on the specific link with the
timestamp of the run no it'll break
things down and display the list of test
cases that were run within this tested
and the results and if you want you can
further drill in and click on the link
for the test case and they'll show you
the result detail and the weather each
step has passed revealed so this is the
test execution tab
and in summary it's a nice way to allow
users to design test sets to reflect
application modules versions or Sprint's
to be tested and in our example we have
we have it organized by release and
again you don't have to organize it the
way that is in this demo you can
organize the test execution anyway you
like a nice thing about the test
execution tab is you can quickly filter
and execute test basis test cases based
on user criteria and you can also have a
link to test cases from the test set so
what you see here in this test list is
actually a pointer to the test case
instead of a copy of it so we click here
you'll see the actual test case in the
tests tab you'll see the test steps you
know you'll see the run history from
that as part of the test that you'll see
is associated requirements and test sets
and then you can actually quickly jump
back to it by clicking on the associated
links on the right hand pink
okay moving on the next new feature in
top one is the Oracle test manager
export project now i will quickly demo
this pretty soon but just the brief
brief explanation of this what this is
so in prior to otm 12 1 there's a
windows 32 client which is the windows
client that allow users to export and
import projects this client was not very
scalable and therefore has been
deprecated in 12 not one in and the
functionality of this project export
import has been brought to the web UI in
12 dot one and i will quickly
demonstrate this project export and
import so say for example we want to
export this project here call empty
project from otm instance a what you
need to do is log in and hover over
project and select export project a
window will appear and you can select
the module or the tabs you want to
export in my case I'll just check
everything including the attached files
and then you just click on export say
you can save this file as anything you
want okay all right once that's done you
can go to another instance let's call it
otm instance be and import that project
and the first thing you want to do is to
create a brand new project on instance
be for this project that you want to
import because if you just log in as a
user you'll end up within a project
that's open and then if you import the
project then you'll basically add to the
existing project that you already have
open so let's go ahead and create a new
project it's empty to begin with and
we'll call this test project you want to
make sure that you assign the user
you're going to use for import full
access to the new project otherwise they
won't be able to do any import and
you'll get an air okay so we create a
test project and the webassign
administrator user full access from the
admin console let's log out and log back
in to the otm console
okay now let's go ahead and open the new
project which is test project and it
should be completely empty because it's
a new project that was just created so
you'll see nothing's here let's do the
import okay you browse to the file that
just lets just exported from Aspen today
and then you click upload now depending
on the size of the project export you
know the bigger the project the longer
will take and once it's done it will
provide a summary of what was imported
an account of the entities that were
imported per tab and I'll show that what
past and what failed so these are
additional logging messages that's
available okay so we quickly hit refresh
you'll see that everything from the
project from this instance here was it
was imported into the distance
okay let's jump back to the slides okay
so in summary the otm export project
feature allows you to export and import
projects from the web UI and the fairly
nice and easy way to export a project
from 10 TM instance to another for more
technical details you can go to the wiki
site below here and here's the URL then
the next slide is actually not a new
feature in 12-1 but it's worth
mentioning because it's something that
was deprecated in 12 that one so prior
to otm 12 dot one there was a great view
available in OT m and this grid view was
taken out in 12 dot one because the
performance was not good and also very
few of our customers were using it and
this is just something worth mentioning
it's also in the release notes the next
new feature in OT m12 one again is not a
new feature but it's actually to remove
all of schedule conflict rules prior to
12 thought wonder thread management of
task scheduling was done differently
hence it was necessary to have schedule
conflict rules so basically you can't
really have more than one tasks running
at the same time before 12 dot one due
to technical limitations and that's why
there were scheduling conflict rules
allowing users to specify what to do
when there's already a task running when
the scheduled task is supposed to start
and the user can specify you know wait
indefinitely for current task to
complete or run immediately an important
current task or wait a certain amount of
time before boarding the task now in top
that one two three management of tasks
can be done in parallel therefore the
conflict rules no longer apply and due
to this they have been ruled removed in
12 one because there's really
no more issues about scheduling
conflicts so one thing worth mentioning
is that since scheduled tasks running
parallel if you would like certain tasks
to run sequentially then the way to do
this is to order the test cases within a
test set inside the test execution tab
and then the test cases within the test
that since they're running sequence what
you can do is schedule a test set to run
instead of individual test cases so say
you have test case ap and see that need
to run sequentially put them inside a
test set and schedule them scheduled to
test that to run as a scheduled tasks
instead of adding the individual test
cases that way you can have those test
cases to running sequential order the
next new feature in OT m12 that one is
the open script result report now in otm
when the date in run history of a test
is clicked you'll see a result detail
display at the bottom of the right pane
in the result detail a summary of the
test is this plate prior to 12 that won
the results were displayed by parsing
the result xml file created by open
script this implementation was a little
cumbersome and caused some issues in the
display result detail so in 12 dot 1 we
implemented an iframe that actually
displays the open script result report
so for comparison I'll show you what a
result report looks like for an open
script replay this is an example of otm
931 open script script I've already
replayed the script on the instance
you'll see that these are the test steps
in the script which is functional and
you'll see that in the run history
there's a link for that particular run
by click on the link here is show
the step results of the particular run
and you'll see that you know it just
shows you the space and the results here
but if you click on the view report link
it will actually open the result report
that is generated from open script so in
here you can you can look at screen shot
and the HTML page so the new thing in 12
dot one is that and this is the otm 12
that one instance i'm showing right now
ok so again with the same script you
know we see the test steps in the test
tab because since this is an automated
test from open script we can run this
from the instance so you'll see here a
run history we click on the link now
instead of showing it in a view like
this you actually see the open script
result report and you can scroll through
it and you can expand this is the sub
steps and you can look at the screenshot
and the contents so it's kind of a nice
way to see the result report instead of
having to click on extra link to see a
pop-up window ok let's move on to the
next feature oh ok so in summary the
open script result report is this play
after clicking on data link date link
under run history the result is display
for all iterations of the run and users
can click on screenshot HTML link in the
result report to drill down further the
next new otm 12 our new feature is
jdeveloper unit testing which currently
works in 803 however has been expanded
and enhanced within 12 dot 1 s a new
test type there's actually a sample jdub
unit test file located within the orgo
ids installation directory and you'll
see the pathing here and that's what
i'll be demoing today
okay so here I am inside an rdp session
for a 12 one instance I've created a
unit testing folder and I will go ahead
and create a new j unit test case with
an otm so what you do is you select j
unit test as the test type give it a
name and then you browse to the location
of the end file now once again there's a
sample file located within the
installation directory for orgo 80s
under the otm j unit folder so i'll go
ahead and highlight the xml file and
click open a sighing and owner and then
click Save now there's not much that you
see here because this is just another
example of a third-party test that you
can run from otm basically in order to
see test steps you'll need to add
conditions using regular expressions so
that otm can parse through the output of
the replay and determine whether the
steps have passed or failed and in this
case the example file provided does not
have that so there's not much that you
can see here but if the file had those
regular expressions added you will see
the test steps and then when you execute
the J unit test from otm you will be
able to see whether the steps have
passed or failed now let's go back to
this life
so in summary or jdeveloper unit testing
it allows you to have a flexible IDE
that supports full development lifecycle
it's also supports unit testing single
unit tests or groups of unit tests and
it's all centralized within a unified
reporting instance that completes our
otm 12-1 new features and updates for
otm the next section I would like to
briefly cover are the new features and
updates for ats general features in 12
not one and there are basically two
topics to cover the first one is oracle
application testing suite support on
linux platform now prior to 12 dot one
the only thing that can run on Linux
platform is the agent and we're talking
about the agent for our court below
testing or oracle test manager now
starting with 12 dot one we've added
support to include the server components
such as or below testing or go test
manager and administrative console
currently open script and functional
test scripts are not supported on Linux
platforming 12-1 however we plan to have
support for open script command-line
interface playback on Linux in a future
release finally the next new feature for
ats 12 that one is actually the
deprecation of data migration utility
inversion prior to 12 not 180 has
provided a data migration utility that
provided a UI to migrate data from
previous versions of the test tool that
didn't use oracle databases this data
migration utility is no longer included
with ats the alternate method for
migrating data from odor Oracle
databases or non Oracle databases is to
use database export and import utilities
these procedures are described in the
orca load testing orgo test measure
online help and the link to the online
health are as follows here's the link
for oracle
testing and here's the link oracle test
manager so basically the procedure is to
use data pump export and we're talking
about oracle databases here and also
data pump import utilities to export a
database them from one database and then
import them into another these links
will bring you to detail steps on how to
do that this is the end of the recording
for the 12 lending features and updates
for otm and 80's general features thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
