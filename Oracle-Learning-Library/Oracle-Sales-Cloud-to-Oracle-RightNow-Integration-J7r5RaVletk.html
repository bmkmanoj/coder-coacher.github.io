salescloud and oracle rightnow do you
need to share incidents between your
sales cloud and right now instances bob
needs to synchronize customer accounts
in real time so they can raise service
requests in both systems Oracle
integration cloud service or ICS enables
you to integrate oracle salescloud
and oracle rightnow to synchronize data
such as incidents in real time to
complete the integration bob needs to
complete several tasks in ICS create the
integration perform data mapping save
and activate the integration and monitor
the message processing of the
integration here bob creates the
integration between oracle salescloud
and oracle rightnow using Oracle
integration cloud service on the home
page Bob can establish connections
create integrations using the configured
connections and monitor the activated
integrations bob has created a set of
connections by using a variety of
available adapters in ICS ICS makes it
easy to reuse adapters for future
connections Oracle integration cloud
service supports a wide variety of
connectors that include social cloud and
on-premise which supports soap and rest
services bob has a set of configured
connections ready to use for his
integrations in the integration section
bob has a set of pre-built integrations
built by Oracle in addition to the
existing pre-built integrations Bob can
create new integrations Bob builds a new
integration to create an organization in
Oracle RightNow when an account is
created an Oracle sales cloud there are
different supported patterns when
creating an integration map my data is
for one to one integrations published
ICS makes a message available to
multiple consumers and subscribe to ICS
is for consuming published messages Bob
creates a one to one integration to
synchronize the account creation he can
group related integrations into packages
to simplify management the integration
canvas is displayed with all the
available fully configured connections
Bob configures the integration by
setting the oracle salescloud connection
as the integration source he provides
meaningful information for the endpoint
reference since bob needs to synchronize
the account creation he configures the
business object that will be received
from oracle salescloud as a request
document Bob selects the same account
object to be sent as a response document
to the oracle salescloud application he
verifies that his previous selections
include the account object as the
request and response the oracle
salescloud connection appears as the
source in the integration canvas now bob
continues with the integration by
configuring the Oracle RightNow
connection as the target he provides the
endpoint reference and a meaningful
description Bob selects the target
operation and the business object on
which to perform the operation in the
Oracle RightNow application in the
summary page he verifies that his
selections are correct just before
completing the target endpoint
configuration the integration canvas
appears with the configured source and
target connections now Bob needs to map
the data that will be exchanged between
the source and target connections Oracle
integration cloud service offers a
number of ways to map the data exchange
between source and target connections
when there's an existing mapping for
this integration Bob can reuse it by
uploading a file
Bob can create individual mappings but
he wants to see what Oracle recommends
and what other customers have done with
the mappings this mapping list includes
options like Oracle recommended what
other customers have done inference
based on structure of messages and
mapping based on name matching he can
also filter these recommendations based
on relevance Bob performed a number of
mappings very rapidly
based on the target recommendations the
mapped fields appear as marked on both
columns Bob can filter the fields based
on whether they're mapped or not how the
fields were defined standard or custom
fields in objects the mapping origin
standard mappings are customized
mappings and the valid mappings mappings
that have syntax problems here Bob wants
to make it easier to see just the mapped
fields on the target side by hiding the
unmapped fields he configures the
response so that the source account gets
updated with the ID of the corresponding
organization in Oracle RightNow this is
needed to allow updates to occur against
the correct organization just as before
bob has the option to upload or download
the data mapping Bob only needs to copy
across the organization ID in Oracle
RightNow so the response is returned
with the correct organization ID to
oracle salescloud
once the request in response data
mappings are complete the integration is
ready to be activated when Bob activates
the integration he has the option to
enable detailed tracing when developing
and debugging the integration between
oracle salescloud and oracle rightnow is
now active it starts to process messages
Bob wants to know how well the message
processing is going in the monitoring
page he can see overall message counts
and success rate for all integrations as
well as the details for individual
integrations bob has successfully
completed his integration between oracle
salescloud
and oracle rightnow thank you for
