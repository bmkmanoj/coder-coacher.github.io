retail company you need to quickly
design an application that can leverage
your company's customer data from Oracle
sales cloud and be easy to use by your
sales representatives to track the
corporate branded merchandise given to
customers and prospects Oracle can help
oracle offers several sample
applications as example patterns for
quick development these sample
applications include source code that
you can review right in your environment
to help you get started with creating
your own custom applications today we're
using the sales merchandise tracker this
sample application allows sales managers
and sales representatives to track
corporate merchandise given to customers
and prospects exploring this sample app
is a good way to demonstrate the power
and simplicity of the Oracle application
builder cloud service for extending saph
services like Oracle sales cloud
let's start by downloading the sales
merchandise tracker from Oracle's public
github repository
next import the sales merchandise
tracker in your Oracle application
builder cloud service instance
the sales merchandise tracker sample
application is comprised of three
modules the customer info the inventory
analysis and the inventory info
the customer info module allows the
sales representative to create update
and delete customers this page obtains
customer data by calling an Oracle sales
cloud service restful service which you
can see in the services page of the data
designer
this is also the entry point for the
merchandise allocation
the merchandise allocation allows the
sales representative to create update
and delete the merchandise allocation
items for the selected customer the
inventory analysis module allows the
sales representative to review the
inventory by showing different data
visualization gadgets offered out of the
box by Oracle application builder cloud
service
the gauge dial gadgets are special
because they are custom Oracle jet
components that you can include in your
application
the inventory info module allows the
sales representative to add update and
delete products from the inventory
now let's explore the business objects
that comprise the sample application the
main business object is the sales cloud
account sto which is based on the Oracle
sales cloud restful service this restful
service provides two data sets one for
the accounts and one for the address is
used by the customer info page and is
also related to the merchandise
allocation custom business object
because the oracle application builder
cloud service and the Oracle sales cloud
service instances are in the same
identity domain you can authenticate the
service using an Oracle cloud account
now let's talk about the merchandise
allocation business object this business
object is a custom object that's used by
the merchandise allocation page it's
related with the sales account object
and with the merchandise object
you can add an input validation rule in
the date underscore issued field to
validate the date range when a record is
created
moving to the visual part of the sales
merchandise tracker let's see how you
can add Oracle debt custom components to
your pages
the custom code editor is divided in
four sections template model application
style and generated page model for this
example we'll focus in the template and
model sections only
use the template section to write HTML
code
this code is pure HTML and if you're
familiar with the knockout jas framework
you'll notice the data bind attribute
use the model section to write your
custom JavaScript code
it's important to use the comments in
the code window as guidelines of where
you should add your custom code you'll
notice that this code leverages from the
knockout.js framework the comments also
provide details on the HTML code and the
JavaScript code you can access the
applications business objects
programmatically by using the Oracle
application builder cloud service api's
now you know how to import the sample
application and understand how the pages
work so you can get started with
customizing it to work for you thank you

today's tighter and find out more about
