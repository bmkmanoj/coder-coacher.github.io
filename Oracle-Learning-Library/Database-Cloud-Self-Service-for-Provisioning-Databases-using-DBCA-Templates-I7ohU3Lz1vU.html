in this video we will demonstrate the
steps required to setup and configure
database as a service using dbca
templates the primary use case for this
feature is to provision vanilla
databases optionally with seed data
first step is to create the path
infrastructure zone
to do this go to any Price Club
middleware and database home Abe as
infrastructure zone is an organizational
entity which can be used to represent
either geography for example east coast
or west coast product life cycle for
example development stage or production
and finally function for example a
business product team or Siebel
applications team to create a path
infrastructure zone or as zone for short
eeehm cloud administration role is
needed
click on the number against the path and
for structure zones label this page
lists all the zones that have been
created in the system let's look at an
existing zone select the zone and click
Edit
the zone comprises of a meaningful name
and description as this will be visible
to the consumer of the self-service
portal next we specify placement policy
constraints which is a maximum ceiling
that can be set against every host or
node that is member of this zone the do
constraints supported our maximum CP
utilization and the maximum memory
allocation as requests come in databases
will not be placed on hosts that exceed
these placement constraints next we
actually add the list of hosts that
would participate in the zone to do this
simply click on the Add button review
the list of targets found and add as
appropriate also provide a credential
that will function across all the hosts
you can use the DES Prudential button to
verify your credentials visibility to
this zone can be restricted to certain
class of users
this is achieved via Enterprise Manager
roles
finally review the summary and click
Submit
the rest of the steps are to be
performed by a user who has the role
eeehm SSA administrator assigned to him
or her to do this we will login as a
separate user we are now logged in as
the DBA s administrator this role is
typically played by a DBA
to perform the remaining steps go to
setup plow database this page shows the
remaining steps that are required to
complete the setup for database of the
service using dbca templates first step
is the creation of a database for a
database pool is a collection of servers
or nodes that have the Oracle software
being provisioned let's look at an
existing pool pool creation is a single
page wizard it contains a meaningful
name and description and a list of
Oracle homes that would participate in
the pool for provisioning consistency it
is expected that all members of a pool
are homogeneous in nature homogeneity is
controlled by certain target filters
these filters our database configuration
which is either a single instance or
rack the platform and the version of the
Oracle software pools are created on a
subset of hosts there are part of it
zone we additionally provide the
credentials to the host which are the
credentials to the Oracle home and root
for certain privileged operations click
Submit to complete the wizard
next up is the request settings there
are three kinds of request settings that
are supported future reservation which
is how far in advance a user can make a
request request archiver attention which
is a duration for which requests are
stored in the system and last request
duration which is the duration for which
requests can be made next up we set
quarters each self-service user has a
coder assigned this helps in limiting
the amount of resources they have access
to let's look at an existing code on
kotas are assigned to a class of users
we leverage Enterprise Manager roles for
this the quota attributes that are
supported are memory storage number of
database requests and the number of
schema requests next we look at profiles
and service templates service templates
are service definitions or database
configurations that are exposed to
self-service users in this feature since
we wish to provision databases using
dbca templates we need to first capture
a template that we like to do this we
make use of profiles profile is a
mechanism to capture interesting
information from source databases to
create a profile click on the create
button
select a source or reference database
choose the option to capture a database
template provide the credentials to the
database home and the credentials to the
database itself
another thing to note is you can either
capture is a DBC a template with data or
you can just capture structure only that
is with no C's data click Next provide a
meaningful name and location for this
profile to be stored in the e/m software
library click Next review the summary
and click Submit on clicking submit
Enterprise Manager would connect to the
database and generate a dbca template
this template would then be stored in
the IAM software library and will be
available for use for creation of
service templates for this demo we will
use an existing profile for rest of the
demo we'll make use of the profile
called DBC a provisioning profile for
reference database now let's create a
service template to create a service
template click on create and choose the
type for database in this case we'll
look at an existing service template
provide a meaningful name and
description for the service template
these templates would be exposed to the
self-service user and hence it is
important describe the contents of the
service template select the profile that
you intend to use in this case we will
use the dbca profile describe the type
of database you wish to create which is
either single instance or rack in case
of rack you can also define the number
of nodes to provide a prefix for the SID
and also the domain named use provide
the listener port
next we select the storage type weather
to configure the fast recovery area if
fast recovery area is configured then
the user is allowed to take backups and
restore their provision databases
provide the administrative credentials
for sis system and DB SNMP specify the
init parameters for example you can
define the various sizes of databases by
setting the appropriate memory and CPU
settings
next you can define custom scripts for
pre and post database creation next we
define the combination of zones and
pools against which this service
template can be executed successfully
numerous combinations of zones and pools
can be added here finally the
availability of this service template
can be restricted to certain class of
users this is again done using
Enterprise Manager roles we review the
summary and click Submit the final step
to complete our setup is to configure
chargeback this is covered in a separate
video this concludes our setup for
database-as-a-service using dbca
templates thank you
you
