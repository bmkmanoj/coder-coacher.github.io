know it's working as expected let's look
at the apps live analytics you'll want
to know the adoption rate for new users
new user signups have increased
dramatically in the last week and active
users are steadily increasing during
this period as well but you'll want to
make sure the added users won't slow
down the system the API response time is
well within acceptable limits the system
is scaling as anticipated they loaded
the app but are they really using it

proportionally to the number of new
users it's safe to conclude that they're
using the app once they've downloaded it

platforms look similar it appears both
versions of the app are being properly
utilized fix it fast recently started
operations in several new states you can
use the group function to view data at
different locations looks like
California has more incidents than any
other states wonder why let's
investigate by drilling down using
filters to see which models are repaired
most often air conditioners it must be

conversion rate of users who access the
knowledge base and eventually call the
