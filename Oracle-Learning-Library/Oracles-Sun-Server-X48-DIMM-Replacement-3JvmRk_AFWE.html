replacing a failed dim important the
complete service procedure for this task
is available in the service manual see
the link at the end of this video
overview to replace a failed dim verify
the fault identify the CPU module C mod
that contains the dim prepare the server
for service following ESD and cold
service requirements remove the C mod
replace the failed dim and return the
server to operation to verify the fault
login to Oracle ILOM and check the
status of the memory subsystem in the
status section of the summary screen the
status column for the memory subsystem
shows that service is required to
identify the C mod that contains the
failed dim click the link for the open
problem screen the open problem screen
shows you the designation information
for the failed component to prepare the
server for service use Oracle ILOM to
power off the server to standby power
mode you can also power off the server
using the operating system or the server
front panel power button before going to
the server use Oracle ILOM to turn on
the server's locator indicator the
locator indicator helps you find the
server at the server for an optimal
cater indicator create an esd-safe
workspace and wear an anti-static wrist
strap the C mod fault indicators on the
front of the server show the group
location of the C mod within the server
C mods are divided into two groups a
left-side group and a right-side group
make note of the C mod location and
group serviceability dibs our customer
replaceable called service components
for cold service disconnect the AC power
cords from the back of the server to
access the C mod remove the four band
modules and the fan frame for the C mod
group use the component designation
label on the front of the server to
identify the C mod designations for all
eight C mod slots are on the label
remove the C mod
remove the sea mud cover to locate the
failed dim use the sea mod fault remind
circuit what remind circuit is a charged
time limited circuit once power is
removed from the server you have 30
minutes to use the circuit to use the
circuit press and hold the fault remind
button verify that the fault to remind
power indicator lights and look for the
dim slot with a lit fault indicator to
remove the dim simultaneously rotate
both dim slot ejector levers outward as
far as they will go to install the
replacement dim ensure that both dim
ejector levers are in the fully open
position aligned the dim with the empty
slot and gently and evenly push the dim
into the slot until the levers rise and
lock the dim to prepare the server for
operation install the C mod cover
install the C mod install the fan frame
and the four fan modules connect the AC
power cables to the back of the server
to return to operation apply full power
to the server when replacing a failed
dim create an esd-safe workspace use a
wrist strap and ensure that the server
is completely removed from the power
source use the fault remind circuit
within 30 minutes of removing power from
the server identify and replace the
failed in return the server to operation
