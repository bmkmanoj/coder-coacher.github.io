unleash the power of the Okla been
processing jdeveloper development
environment for applications that have
been created with the stream explorer
first we log into the stream Explorer we
will select the expiration application
that we want to now enhance using the
features of jdeveloper here i will enter
one of our tutorial for to check and
that was this applications expirations
once are mainly exploration i can check
it has the correct analysis capabilities
i can now take an action publish
unpublish in this case i will export the
application once I select export I will
get a dialog window indicating of our
options and export a export list I then
select and as you can see the jar file
of this application has been downloaded
and is now available for me here I can
see the jar file that I want to use in
my jdeveloper environment for
documentation purposes I will move the
jar file to my own location well keep
all of my stream Explorer jar files now
I can exit from the stream Explorer and
transition to my jdeveloper environment
now I'm in the jdeveloper environment
the first thing I will do is I will take
the file menu option and select import
here I'm giving the list of different
import capabilities for the stream
explore I will import the oep bundle
is okay the first step of the wizard is
to provide an application name as this
is my full check analysis application
I'll use that as part of my application
name next also for the project name
again I will call it full check SX now I
can select the LEP bundle this is the
jar file which has the elements from the
stream Explorer application I can select
the relevant jar file needed press open
and finish the application is now
available to you in jdeveloper you can
see the event process in network
application model that was dynamically
created for you by the stream explorer
in the jdeveloper environment you now
have access to all of the components
that can be used to enhance your
application in various ways and also all
of the source code for the application
has been pre-built and placed within
your jdeveloper application development
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
