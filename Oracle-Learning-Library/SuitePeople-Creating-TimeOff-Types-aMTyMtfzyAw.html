enables employees managers and HR to
easily request approve track and report
on time off activities through a
centralized system without the need for
manual entry in this video I'll be
giving you an overview of the overall
setup required for the time off
management feature and then I'll go into
detail about the first setup step in the
process which is setting up time off
types each of the other required setup
steps are detailed in their own separate
videos I highly recommend checking them
out after you've gone through this video
before we get started you should be
aware of the following prerequisites for
using time off management you will need
to have sweet people available on your
account as well as have the time off
management feature enabled you'll also
need to have the time off tracking suite
app installed which enables employees to
submit time off requests from the
employee center and provides an approval
workflow that routes request to
employees managers for approval you'll
also want to make sure your
administrator has given you a role in
that suite that has access to the time
off management feature and lastly
employee records must be created in that
suite
before you start setting up time off
management you should review your
company's time off policies for example
you should think about the differences
between employees with regards to the
amount of time off they are entitled to
take how unused time off is dealt with
at the end of the year and how time off
is accrued let's now take a look at each
of the steps involved in setting up time
off management the first step is to
create time off types for the different
categories of time off employees can
take for example you would create a time
off type for vacation and another for
sick leave I'll be going over this part
of the process in detail later on in
this video the second step is to create
the time off plans the third step is to
add time off rules to the time off plans
time off rules reflect your company's
time off policies they define how to
handle time off eligibility entitlements
accruals and carry over during an
employee's tenure with the company then
time off rules need to be associated
with a time off type next the time off
plan needs to be assigned to employees
on their employee record as well as a
work calendar work calendars determine
which days are working days for the
employee this is used to calculate the
number of hours to deduct from an
employee's balance when a time off
request is submitted and lastly a
supervisor should be specified on the
employee record this person will
automatically receive any time off
requests submitted by the employee
I'll now go into detail on the first
step in the time off management process
creating time off types time off types
should be consistent with your company
time off policies you can create
unlimited time off types to reflect the
various policies at your company for
example you would create a time off type
for vacation and another for sick leave
I'm at the home page of my NetSuite
account from here navigate to set up HR
information system time off type new
from the time off type page first enter
a unique name for the time off type in
the name field optionally you can enter
a display name which is what will be
shown to employees when they request
time off from the employee center next
enter the minimum increment of time off
for this time off type increments can be
hourly or daily in this example we will
require that at minimum the half day
must be taken when employees request
vacation time you also have the option
to select a color that you want to
associate with this time off type the
color selected here appears on the
request time off page access from the
employee center
if you are integrated with NetSuite
payroll you will want to specify a
payroll item to associate this time off
type with you can optionally check the
track only box if you want to only
record usage for example if your company
policies do not put a limit on the
number of sick days an employee can take
you would mark it as a track only time
off type for this vacation time off
tight we will leave this unchecked to
finish click Save and that's all that is
required for setting up time off types
the first step and the time off
management process I highly recommend
you check out the other videos in this
series which includes creating time off
plans creating time off rules and
assigning time off plans I hope this
video has helped give you a better
understanding of the overall time off
management process and how to create
time off types thanks for watching and
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
