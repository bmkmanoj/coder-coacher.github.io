for having a shot lunch me too to come
John the presentation so today's topic
is Internet of Things IOT m2m and we'll
discuss how we use spot converge gateway
for the smart grid smart energy and also
applied to the rest of the markets in
smart cities so i'm kwok who i headed up
the embedded software in systems at
Freescale Semiconductor which used to be
motorola semiconductor and so assume
most of you I expect with Java and OSGi
and other stuff SC okay so maybe you
guys can help me answer some more
questions okay let me go to this light
mode okay so the outline is we'll talk
about the market trends and
opportunities then we talk about the
basic in smart grid which contained the
smart sensor network and then smart
gateway using both the de concentrator
and in the home gateway then we also
talk about how we can use the open
platform to add the java and java c and
java epics to enable this horizontal
platform so we can add many different
vertical business solutions on top then
we'll also talk about how we can extend
this platform for supporting other
markets such as health monitoring safety
security and so on so this slide shows
the explosion of the internet traffic
driven by twofold one is the wireless
second is video wireless contained more
than just a mobile phone wireless
contained out the
smart sensors that we're dropping in
into the network such as oops such as
whoops such as all these smart meters
and senses that we're putting into the
network both inside the premise as well
as outside the premise so the mobile
traffic is growing five times in three
years and then you can see the data in
exabyte per month and then the number of
connected devices are growing from 10
billion to 15 million
sorry BS in billion 10 billion to 50
billion connected device by 2020 and how
many of you attended the presentation
this morning the keynote speech no too
early it's not at a am ok but they also
talked about all this production
whatever prediction we make will be
wrong because the at show will be even
bigger so the reason of about this whole
explosion would be the adding of all
this connected devices which we call m2m
and then also the Internet's things so
back to the traditional networking so we
have the thing in the center which we
call the communication the telecom telco
the carrier network and that has both
the wire and also the wireless
connectivity like 3G 4G broadband then
on the right hand side you can see we
have a bunch of connected devices
whether is your PC then your handheld
which is your iPhone iPad then as I
mentioned we are adding all kinds of
devices to the network where there is
the smart meters or where there is IP
cameras and so on this prediction that
IP camera will actually exceed the
number of cell phone and mobile phones
because for each home if you have a
premise of four person you have four
cell phone and then they are saying is a
home potentially can have more than four
IP camera
you can have three inside the home and
three outside the home and so on so then
we talk about how we can do the
intelligent or smart networking so if
each of these connected device has to
directly access the core network whether
is through Y or Wireless the core
network will not have enough capacity to
handle therefore at each premise you
always have some kind of smart gateway
the simplest one is a smart router the
most router a single function you only
connect to a computing device it doesn't
connect to a sensor device so a smart
gateway in the future will have the
ability not just doing Wi-Fi
connectivity but also have the sensor
connectivity which we call wsn wireless
sensor network connecting to all the
sensor devices so you will see all kinds
of smart commercial gateway at all the
different premises which is residential
industrial enterprise and offices
industrial cover factory building and of
course my energy which will go into some
discussion then residential I covered
the that mobo I meant the transportation
the car the car if you will is your
second home so but it's a moving home so
you will see all this gateway everywhere
so that means smart gateway can go onto
your buses your train your cruise ship
and so on okay so now we will go into
the energy segment within the industrial
we can have energy set menu can have
medical segments so let's talk a little
bit about the energy segment so before
we do that here's another picture of a
smart connected cities or smart world so
again on the left hand side you see
smart kinetic cars smoking at home and
buildings smart energy they're two part
in this my energy one is the we call the
ami advanced metering infrastructure
then as I mentioned we also talked about
the
health monitoring so all these various
market segments or setters that you can
hook up connected devices and all these
connected devices connect to the cloud
through the smart commerce gateway and
once you have this horizontal platform
which will talk about enable by Java
OSGi then it will make it easy for all
the businesses to add vertical 7
solutions of vertical applications
software so on the connected
transportation on the upper left I
talked about asset tracking as a
tracking can be tracking goods but you
can also track human being like kids or
elderly and so on and then for the
factory and industrial that culture so
you can basically imagine anything you
see in the smart cities can be all
interconnected so we talked about
interconnecting and called inter
cooperating among others objects if you
were any questions so far
ok so let's dive in into this much
energy so that's my energy I will show
that there are three different topics if
you will the first topic is called
metrology in the middle metrology ZAR
meters where there is electric meters
gas meters water meters gas meters and
water meters are called flow meters it
detect the flow of either water or gas
well electric meters is sensing the
consumption of electricity so so again
it's just replacement of different
sensors then the utility company the
first thing they do is to install smart
meters in your home then they started
with something called AMR advanced meter
reading which now will be replaced by
what we call am i advanced metering
infrastructure so the difference is with
the ami you no longer need to I hope
this was long enough you no longer need
to send meet a person to drive the car
close to your meter so it would be all
aggregated automatically by what we call
either data concentrator or they
which usually is installed on the
utility pole in your residential area
and each day a concentrator can probably
aggregate about a thousand meters and so
in the city you can imagine each
high-rise building will also have a cup
of this day a concentrator within the
building so it can be inside the
building it can be outside building but
usually they concentrate ruggedized they
weatherproof waterproof so the enclosure
will be tougher and the components we
put in there are usually extend the
temperature range not not the regular
commercial is called industrial quarrel
rather than commercial core so then so
that take care of the utility company
they installed that their concentrator
helped do the automatic meter reading
but it's a bi-directional interface so
it's not just aggregating meter reading
but they also can assert control which
we call demand control and load shedding
we'll talk about that next then on the
right hand side is when you push inside
premise each premise now has bunch of
appliances that will be all connected
and how does the owner of each premise
be able to do remote monitoring control
of those appliances so I don't see build
gate here I would like to make fun of
build gate so for him it would be
controlling his hot tub Jacuzzi or
maybe Larry Ellison maybe I'd make fun
of him for Larry Ellison it would be
taking care of his swimming pool for
Microsoft it would be bill Gaye is hot
tub Jacuzzi for us usually the
appliances that consume most electricity
will be the expec heating and
conditioning and maybe the washer dryers
stuff like that so really it's only a
limited number of devices you will
control for energy purpose however
within a home you may want to add other
sensors for safety and security so now
you start spending
Ram so four cents for safety security
you can add smoke alarm smoke alarm
sensors are different than sensing
electricity for current so smoke alarm
would be sensing smoke sensing
temperature and if you add additional
security wireless security you can sense
glass breakages for your windows you can
sense motion detection and for more
fancy stuff you can start adding video
surveillance camera video surveillance
camera was in size image sensor so these
are much higher data rate sensor so
we'll go into that so in a smart gun at
at home you see all this multitude of
sensors and so in order to be able to
let the owners to control it you also
need a smart home gateway if you will
aggregating all this data connecting to
a cloud while you're away from the home
you can still do remote monitoring
control not not just again on your
meters or your appliances but a
surveillance camera would be an example
what's your name if tom is going out
partying heaven drinks while party
playing golf whatever he can still use
his handset and he can still connect to
the cloud connect back into the gateway
so gateway it's not just a one-way
routing connecting internet access so
it's a two-way so so a smart gateway is
a two-way platform so it actually hosted
domain name server it hosts a web server
you can connect back in authenticate it
now you can see or your IP camera making
sure
Tom's kids are not having wild party
also while he's having my party so
that's one use case example any comment
any question okay so this is an example
of a smart grid we caught the last mile
the last mile contained those type of
components but of course if you work
upstream you what upstream you have a
lot more networking equipment that will
do all the control of the distribution
and generation of electricity because
you will obscene you be connected to the
substations and so on so this is the
world
rgeous factory view is an open factory
so anything you apply to an open factory
can be applied to a smaller scale closed
factory that makes sense so far okay so
I forgot to mention what are the
challenges here in smart grid does my
energy so we have utility company which
first of all with many utility company
within each of the company they also
purchased many different meters there's
no LED light I guess anybody have a
pointer no point okay that's fine so
since we have so many vendors that built
meters the different meter vendors also
use different devices but is arm devised
some microcontrollers and then you also
have different messaging API because all
this data you are aggregating out too
many need to collect it through the air
concentrator and to the substation and
utility service we are various
transceivers transceivers are RF radios
if you will
sensing receiving or this load area rate
data and then again because you have so
many meters you want to also have the
ability to do remote provisioning remote
installation and ease of deployment okay
so let's dive into the middle circle and
start with the meters start with the
wireless sensor and how this convert
gateway help us to do all the inter
connectivity and the inter cooperating
among all these sensors ok so again as I
mentioned in the middle is the smart
meters why do we call smart anyway
anybody have any comment why do I call
this a smart phone why do we start
calling our TV smart TV okay
so smart means you must be internet
connected that's one thing
so network connected so now every
devices will be network connected
be cloud-connected second is it will
have a lot of software in it that would
be adaptive that means you can low any
different type of apps you want to make
it smart
okay so we have smart meters so it's a
definition it has ability to connect to
the cloud and they also have software to
also automatically connect to all the
upstream network so on the left as I
mentioned is that they're concentrated
in this example is a three scale do call
PowerPC device that can aggregate up to
1,000 meters as I mentioned on the Left
I show two item within a home one is a
smart gateway that as I mentioned can
connect all your sensors your video
surveillance camera and also all your
internet access all your residential
gateway functions of your will so you
can do DLNA media streaming you can do
VoIP phone call you can do video
surveillance everything so not just not
metering so that's a smart gateway there
on the right there's a smart gateway on
the left one is indoor one its outdoor
and then on the lower right is yet
another smart device which sometimes
people call a smart thermostat sometimes
people call a programmable communicating
thermostat PCT so a PCT is an ipv6
enabled device means that device is
directly connected to the cloud even you
don't need a smart gateway so is IP
addressable by the utility company
hopefully it's also by each homeowner so
one of the use case scenario is some
city the utility company as an incentive
in stuff
installing a regular digital thermostat
which usually is free of charge now they
will say hey how about if I upgrade to
the PCT where is IP addressable if you
let the utility company assess it and
let us control plus or minus five degree
let's say whatever is the agreement you
can opt out you cannot beam then in
return the utility company
you some incentive let's say 10%
discount on your monthly usage the
purpose of doing that is so that utility
company when it's aggregating the meter
reading on the left they start noticing
the consumption by your development or
your error how should I say your risk
residential area your subdivision is
what I mean if they notice your
subdivision start having more
consumption than this supply can handle
there's a pending brown out once they
noticed that there is a pending brown
out they have to prevent it because the
cost of having a brown is very expensive
especially in the big city like San
Francisco or Manhattan New York
especially Manhattan New York when it
goes down then all the stock trading
would be impacted so his billions of
dollars of losses so the incentive is
for utility company to prevent burnout
Brown ow
so once they sense that the imbalance
they have to do low sharing when they do
low shedding their to form one is they
can send messages to your meter increase
your tariff rate so that's called peak
tariff rate some cities apply that some
city dome so once they detect it they
can increase the peak rate and then
you're smart gateway can notice it once
your gateway notice that you can defer
energy consumption such as you can be
for using washer/dryer the for using
your hot tub Jacuzzi for an hour maybe
or if you have a smart the most that you
can also allow because sometimes you're
away from home you're on vacation you
can also allow to let the utility
company to adjust your thermostat
darling it down by five degree or
something so that's how the whole
network what so again it doesn't need to
work with human being interruption you
can work automatically by all this
distributed gateways because it has
embedded software there so you can just
do the adapt dynamic adaptive
adjustments in real time any questions
comment so far okay so I I put something
III put am
Avance metering infrastructure on the
left that's the incentive from the
utility company
I put demand response low sharing how we
can handle that on the localized per
premise basis but of course on the
left-hand side since the utility company
are also dealing with a network of
others their concentrator they can also
do some dynamic low balancing of their
upstream not not just local so on the
lowest are I give an example of a smart
thermostat how many of you heard about
nest good good III think this is a very
smart implementation they caught the
Apple light implementation because it's
actually done by someone the left Apple
and it has all the a prototype of user
interface which is very easy to use so
even my neighbors know how to use it and
and so on but it's not cheap it's very
expensive
I think it's $249 or something right but
but you can do a lot of stuff it has
learning ability it can learn your
usages and it can tell you time to when
you set at certain temperature it will
tell you how long it would take to
adjust to the temperature that you want
it will tell you whether you are on
energy-saving mode where a green leaf
will pop on if you are saving energy
other stuff and here's all the beauty in
smart when to save energy by sometimes
that it will shut down the air
conditioning but if the fan on the top
sir so he has a lot of fancy capability
okay so let us talk a little bit about
all this wireless remember I mentioned
that all this sensor devices has to be
interconnected through wireless sensors
so wireless sensor has many form and so
let's talk about the different data rate
which is the performance
the left hand side and then the ranges
which is the distance you can cover so
we are all familiar with the cell phone
which is the 3G 4G it has a long range
distance but it's actually low there
right so you can do two megabit per
second maybe you can sign up for up to
10 megabit per second that's 3G but 4G
LTE is coming so freeze care is involved
with other 4G LTE development so it's
supposed to go up to 100 megabit per
second so that's the cellular broadband
connectivity then on the centre the big
circle is the Wi-Fi connectivity which
has evolved from a o to the 11 a and B
to 11 and a o to the 11 n can give you
100 megabit per second on a 2 by 2 radio
up to 300 megabit per second for 3 by 3
radio and then a low 2.11 AC is coming
which gives you one gigabit per second
Wireless so these are your high
performance wireless local area network
for your premise for your office for
your home and so on
and this one has much higher performance
than the cellular broadband you can tell
it's a 10 times difference in
performance but then is shot shot a
distance that's the trade-off on the
lower lower bottom I show two type of
radio there's the Bluetooth which we are
familiar with dealing with streaming
songs music player doing connection of
the cell phone through us through
Bluetooth headset and so on said that's
the Bluetooth capability of course
people are also extending bluetooth to
call bluetooth for the old Bluetooth low
power that try to lower the power
consumption further but the distance
wise is the shortest distance coverage
then here comes sick be sick be is a
sensors that can range from 2.4
gigahertz all the way down to a hundred
sixty eight or 900 megahertz or he has a
variety of frequency range
and then it gives you a much longer
distance than Bluetooth and therefore is
more suitable for connecting multitude
of different sensors and of course
performance wise is low performance than
your wireless gateway so now what your
ambition is you have all these objects
or devices meters and I don't know what
kind of senses smoke alarm whatever now
need to be connected so it would be hard
for them to connect directly to the
cloud which is up there which we call
the when Y area network so usually then
you can connect through the WLAN
wireless local area network and that
will connect to the went to the cloud
for you so what's the the sensor net
what usually is a mesh network so all
this sensor can be all interconnected
together as a mesh and sometimes we call
it the pan personal area network and
this is basically a wireless sensor
network what why we call Y now first of
all down here this mesh network
sometimes it's also called resilient
network self-healing network so let me
give you an example if I have bunch of
smoke alarm here some in the first floor
some in second floor some in East Wing
some in West Wing
if one sensor detected fire and Paden is
trying to relate the messages to the
controller the controller could be
downstairs on the first floor it will
try to relate but then if you find out
on the north wing the sensors down you
would reroute and go to another sensor
so you find this way dynamically routed
and then it will connect to your
controller which would dispatch all the
messages to 9-1-1 or whatever fire
trucks and so on
so so far so good about mesh networking
okay so it's called an adaptive Network
WLAN Wi-Fi network it usually is calling
hot network so usually is not
interconnected as a mesh network but we
can also interconnect all the wireless
network together
we call them an SS point when you start
in to connect multiple SS point together
you can bridge them you can repeat them
so we can also form a network so in most
offices we have a network of SS point so
that's the general picture so with Wi-Fi
a local area network you usually have
much higher bandwidth you can handle
video surveillance so usually video
surveillance cannot be handled directly
by the census and then there is a third
axis which is called power consumption
so so of course when you deal with
sensors this has to be long battery life
so for health monitoring purpose sensing
blood pressure and all this stuff or the
hot thing you don't want to be charging
up your battery every day and so it has
to be very long battery life same thing
for gas meter gas meter also has to be
at least the battery will last over five
years because gas meter do not have
direct electricity connection and you
know the reason because it works blow so
gas meter will have to have long battery
life also what other sensors you put
into those that make sense so far any
questions okay so we talk about smart
sensors being put into others devices
has to be connected to cloud so we can
do remote monitoring control we can also
allow the utility to put in all kinds of
business applications so what's inside
in the meadow is we caught the smart
commercial gateway okay so Freescale
also offer different type of sensor
devices at the sub gigahertz level as I
mentioned you can do the 800 range 900
megahertz range those lower frequency
sensor can go longer distance can also
penetrate wall so we have the MC 1 2 3 1
1 so is a programmable radio you can
adjust different frequency so if we call
SDR software-defined radio and then we
are also coming up with contacts
zero base SAP gigahertz radio under load
right and then when you move to the
middle you see some transceiver
transceivers are just sensors but no
microcontroller so it just send data so
if you want to have more control you
usually want to buy not just a
transceiver but by a sensor that come
with a microprocessor so that take us to
the top bar the top bar we have an arm
seven base MPU microprocessor integrated
with the sensor called 132 to six but
now we're you walking into the MK w 20
which is cortex m4 base so this type are
called smart sensors now at the bottom
this type of transceiver a mod dummy
just sends the data relay it cannot take
actions when you start doing smart
sensors it has micro process so you can
do localized decision-making it can do
more control and so on that make sense
so far
ok ok so now that we understand the
basic sense of how sends are going to
smart meters and go into all the objects
we will talk about the left-hand side
the levant box is called their
concentrator how it will aggregate all
the meter readings from other dwellings
so here here's a graphical picture so
you have the smart meter which is
thousands of them in the middle and then
there is a their concentrator that is in
your subdivision a grating in the
utility pole so you see all kinds of
connectivity you can have Wi-Fi
connectivity you can a PLC connectivity
power line communication you can have
sick be connectivity at different
frequency eight-hundred nine-hundred 2.4
and then the backhaul if his electric
company then you can have PLC running on
the power line but if you guess me the
water meter you do a 3G backhaul so most
of this meter will have a 3G backhaul
capability to relate their ger
get it data back to the utility server
okay
of course 3G will be replaced soon by 4G
and so on
on the 11 sites what's inside the home
and then as you see interconnecting all
your appliances and stuff like that
now the messages I want to relate in
this picture is twofold we connect all
this thing to a cloud so that we can
allow you to have remote monitoring
control that's important part second
part you notice all this stuff has a lot
of messaging involved the smart meter
talking to their concentrator if you
have a smart gateway or whatever smart
thermostat they talk through a protocol
called DMS D LM s is called device
language message specification sometimes
is also called column companion
specification for energy metering of
course there are other attributes then
that called open ADR so all this
standard messaging API allow you to have
different vendors different meters and
they're concentrated to be all talking
the same language so that later on we
will talk about how Java and OSGi can
help us with that message translation
and so on then as the meter aggregated
the data as to also send back to the
utility server the substation so there's
another standard on the 11 cycle IEC
61850 substation automation interfaces
so you can see that there's a lot of
others messaging API that has to be
involved so at the bottom you have at
the embedded processors doing the
sensing in the middle you have all this
messaging trying to be all translated
properly before you can relate upstream
and then at the top you have the utility
server company trying to add vertical
business applications so that it will
make it easier for us to remote monitor
control okay so here again is our
example of a free scale tool called P
1025 their concentrator you can see the
ter concentrator on the utility pole
aggregating
- per meters thousands of them so that
it can connect to the cloud we call this
a ami again advanced metering
infrastructure it taught all those
languages that we talked earlier on the
OMS and substation interfaces there is a
YouTube thing you can watch and then on
the right you can see all the capability
the employing capability in dare
concentrator is called I try buoy 1588
times them and also IPSec security
acceleration so because all this meter
has to be encrypted and the data has to
be protected and so on and the next
release will add all the sub gigahertz
and power line communication so yeah
yeah so I will show you the example SE
and then for the handset when you want
to monitor then you can have the job for
epochs running on your tablet for
example so let me play play a video real
quick I hope we have time oops so this
way I can let you guys watch
sake coming up it's the sound on hello
everybody this is David Rosato and we're
here to demonstrate the smart energy
data concentrator featuring the p10 25
cor IQ device the smart energy reference
design data concentrator is the latest
addition in the distribution and smart
management of energy in the growing
smart grid era these as you will see the
data concentrator will be capable of
discovering smart metering devices
communicating with them flawlessly via
various protocols and transferring that
information to the utility servers the P
1025 which powers the data concentrator
is a core IQ device with plenty of
performance dual core in a lower power
management envelope and also features
clever capabilities like I Triple E 1588
time stamping and security acceleration
for an encrypted channel without further
ado here is a demonstration of the P
1025 data concentrator hi i'm Kwaku I
have some dmpd networking processor
divisions seven solutions lab today I'd
like to show you the co i QP 1025 data
concentrator using a smart grid I will
show you the functionality and
performance and there are three things
I'd like to show number one is the
real-time energy monitoring whereby the
P 1025 is a high performance Wireless
secure it can connect to multiple meters
which is thousands of meters it can
aggregate the meter readings in real
time such as for example shown here on
the screen you can see all the power
meter readings being sent back in real
time to the utility service and then on
the screen on your right hand side you
can see that as all the meter reading
accumulated the energy consumption
patterns get store and display by the
hours by the days by the weeks where the
consumer can access anytime anywhere all
this
sumption and now i will get to point
number two the p10 25 their concentrator
also enabled the utility company due to
a pending brown out can send messages to
each smart meters which is each smart
home and in addition can also adjust the
tariff rate by adjusting the tariff rate
the utility company can then impact the
homeowners to decide whether they turn
off lighting turn off heating and washes
and air conditionings and therefore
prevent a pending brown outs and also
save the power consumptions number three
I like to summarize by saying that the P
1025 their concentrator is a high
performance wireless 3G but been enabled
router is equipped with IPSec equipped
with ipv6 it handle all the multiple
level of wireless connectivity such as
cig B and then we also plan to add the
PLC power line communication and the SAP
gigahertz RF connectivity for further
information please feel free to contact
freescale comm slash smart energy okay
so let's continue move on so what's
inside the home is a smart home gateway
as I mentioned that can allow you to
monitor your energy consumption by each
appliances control them on and off you
can monitor security safety you can
monitor your smoke alarm on it to your
video surveillance camera you can do all
kinds of home automation so within the
home you can have a smart gateway but
you can have a simple device as much as
on the right hand side just displaying
energy consumption but no control or
somewhere in between which is just home
energy manager like light like the smart
thermostat we look at in the middle here
so this usually record the hem the smart
thermostat control so you can have
different type of energy management
devices so a smart gateway will be able
to perform all this capability
connecting to all your appliances on the
Left connected to the cloud give you all
the local area network capability video
surveillance and all this stuff this is
the box that showed this smart home
gateway box basically it's a converged
give a that can handle wireless sensor
network connection which is sick be
sensors Wi-Fi connections 3G connection
and all them of them combined ok so this
gentleman was asking on the Java demo
what did we do so again it's the same
thing that we have connected with their
concentrator with the media and with
handset device which is an idea mix 53
tablet so the meter is in the middle
again they concentrate on the left a
smart home gateway on the right the
tablet and the top which is away from
your home right so of course all this I
embedded processors so a smart home
gateway is an example like this and add
a concentrator can be as small as this
this is the deal called p10 25 and of
course when you put it out door you put
a weatherproof enclosure and so on so we
worked together with Oracle and Oracle
actually put the java vm and also in a
layer we call a messaging layer which do
all those DMS
cause them and others messaging
translation and no no yeah you you have
to write that yourself to interact with
the specific market you're dealing with
so in this case is energy market so we
have to write those translations so the
meter get aggregated by the tear
concentrator is sent to the cloud then
you can also interact with the Java B DB
which is your database so it gets store
and then now you can access those data
eight either through your smart gateway
or through your smart handset the tablet
and then on the tablet side we added the
JavaFX so oh yeah it's a modified I
mixed tablet so I got mix 53 is the
freescale I'm base tablet it was running
Android and then we basically modify and
then we load that Java ethics unto it
we actually strip out the Android so a
and roy is sitting above the Lidice
right so we strip out the Android so is
there a business offering system and
then we add the chopped ethics the
reason is this way we can have all these
different boxes or interacting and all
talking the same language and messages
that make sense and they can access the
database all this data that we're
pushing out is has to stall in the
utility surface so we can SS ok so
that's the use case example as I
mentioned this hour the different
functions we implement under their
concentrator they're on the top and then
on the bottom is all this
JavaFX that we added for the client SS
and so again you see the cloud
connection you see the database so
basically all this data are being pushed
to the cloud being stall and then being
assessed
this is the type of vertical application
a utility company can write so at the
utility office they can write smart grid
automation software that they can
display the grid they can display how
energies are being consumed they can
monitor if suddenly area has failure how
they can reroute the traffic and so on
so that's another application of Java
ethics for the utility company okay so
in summary in this demo Java VM Java SE
Java fix is used and has been installed
on all the different smart gateway the
home gateway and also install and the
data concentrator so if you will all
this mark gateway are platforms now we
are enabling it with Java I believe in
the open source approach once we have
this platform and a bow is easy for the
utility company or even for individual
to add different vertical applications
on top so again carry on this write once
run anywhere at any time and so on
concept so the the list of stuff that
has been demonstrated is the use of the
Java BD B for pushing the data into the
cloud storage that enable utility
company to do MDM meter data management
do billing services they can further do
later on at other cloud service
applications such as data mining
analytic and so on so this is to analyze
a usage pattern from today versus
yesterday from this month versus last
month if you see any unusual usages you
may have some problem like you may have
water leak if your water bill go up and
you may want to know where is your water
leak for example so all this additional
management control doing demand response
the value-added but now you have all
this embedded device or interpreted
interconnected through this platform
approach so he addresses the issues that
we talked about earlier on multiple Van
Meter vendors using multiple devices
different transceivers different
messages it allow us to make it easier
to do remote provisioning of all these
meters and ease of deployment and so on
and then on top that Java offers the
security scalability portability so in
short someone told me the slide should
be called from Java API to ROI okay okay
so let me talk about how do we now
extend all this m2m connectivity and
internal things to other market segments
because whatever we connect just stand
for the energy and utility can be
extended so this is an example for
health monitoring you can extend to
working with all the different sensors
to check blood pressure check
temperature or this thing so in an
elderly home you can have each other the
person carrier ban walking around and
then the nurse station the nurse is
actually watching video on-demand
Netflix streaming and but then each
elderly person can get monitor still and
and then the doctor out there playing
golf can still watch what's going on
okay so with that I want to refer you to
one more sessions if you interest is to
see how freescale can also help with the
other market so by my colleague Steven
Dean and Robert Thompson talking about
how we apply the m2m and out a
technology for consumer industry markets
and this will be for tomorrow Thursday
1:30 also here hotel nickel at Golden
Gate Golden Gate I believe is on 25th
floor and actually I have one more video
show you but let me see let me go
through the summary then we'll do the
video real quick so again we talked
about the concept that there's no just
one single cloud Co homogeneous cloud
out there there will be many local clock
a cloud in your home or cloud in your
clinic a cloud in your office a cloud in
your car or whatever so all this local
cloud you need to have smart commercial
gateway that can connect to all this
devices through all this sensor that we
talked about so we talked about you can
apply to all this different segments
again the key is how connecting you to
the cloud allows you to add vertical
applications allow you to have real-time
monitoring control you can see all forms
of wireless and why connectivity on the
left so that's how this Matt Gateway
help you handle all this so let's talk a
little about IOT and ioe once you have
the M to M connectivity once the smart
gateway allow you to connect things and
objects so now you want to deploy cloud
services basically so on the lower left
is simple tracking tracking of ss SS can
be good SS can be people like kids and
elderly and you don't want the elderly
to be wandering out shopping and they
cannot find their way home so that's
tracking or asset management then you
can have security safety you can add
something called contacts and
location-aware services so where you go
then you the smart sensor will know for
the way you are going what are the
nearest bang was the nearest gas station
and whatever was the nearest movie and
so on for you so this are called
location based services and context
aware means even can detect your mood
and depend depending by sensing your ESP
I guess you can extend this thing to
call gesture base in the face or it's
called augmented reality so you can
extend this to a lot of stuff basic
then we talk about remote monitoring
control and then ultimately we call this
distributor embedded intelligence we are
talking about kinetic intelligence we
talk about not just having a simple RF
radio in the sensors just transmitting
data collecting data with her about
putting in a cheap low-cost
microprocessor where now you can enable
each of the sensor to do distributed
local intelligence you can do is local
data mining is local decision-making and
so on so that's the trend so this trend
is called pervasive ubiquitous
collaborative computing so we see Java
VM and o OS gir this a basic platform
enablement that allow us to put that in
each of this Mac gateway and smart
devices and allowing us to have into
operating notes or devices if you will
any comments any questions so again I
have terminology IOT and m2m I change it
to uppercase M so it's not just machine
talking to machine is a machine talking
to human being so it's us how do we
interact with all these objects in an
intelligent fashion and again applying
to not just my energy but smart homes
not cosmic buildings and so and so forth
okay so in summary we talked about how a
smart cities might world can apply M to
M connectivity apply our T and then we
added the Java technology to help us
implement connected intelligence we
caught catch to enterprise HR this notes
at the end point enterprises the back
end your utility server or your core
network in telco Telecom so by doing
this connections everything connected to
a cloud then we can enable all these
cloud services which we call B - B - C
means everything connected right
business the business to consumer and
you can now quickly and easily add
different business vertical solutions to
connect all these things together so
that's my prepare a presentation and
I've one more PowerPoint sorry one more
YouTube video to show you if you guys
have time so this one I'll show you the
smart home smart connect at home hello
I'm Nick SAR Dolores I'm product manager
for the NPC 83 o X product family today
we're gonna talk to you about the NPC 80
308 network smart gateway reference
design you see here the actual platform
which allows applications such as home
signal energy communicating over ZigBee
to a smart meter we also can support
applications like home automation where
we're using here a smart plug that has a
ZigBee radio in it communicating to the
platform we use the MP MC 1 3 2 2 6
ZigBee radio and I will be it I can turn
off an appliance using the smart plug
from the network smart gateway by
sending a command wirelessly to the
Gateway to turn off this light which
I'll do right now ok so what you've just
seen is this tablet connecting over 8 or
211 to the network smart gateway the
network smart gateway communicating over
ZigBee to the smart plug which allows us
to control this appliance other
appliances that could be controlled
include things like this washing machine
air conditioners or other devices this
allows the user to be able to control
the demand that they have for
electricity and reducing their overall
consumption using the 802 11n radio that
the NPC 80 308 network smart gateway
features we can also stream
high-definition video this is coming off
of an SD card that is in the summon
Network smart gateway and streaming 802
11 to a google TV you see featuring 1080
resolution for more information about
the
mpca t 308 network smart gateway please
visit www.flexsim.com since my home
gateway there's also the next
presentation tomorrow on the extending
or this m2m IOT to the medical segments
and industrial simmons and consumer
service tomorrow 1:30 tomorrow table out
yes yes they will actually expand my
single the home health monitoring into
more detail aha yes
yeah that's a good question
utility company their motivation is more
driven from the outside so they don't
want to push anything inside the home
they are not good at doing that so they
put the smart meter there so that they
enable them to do a mi so obviously a mi
is a big business is be billions of
dollars so it's not M so they already
are seeing the benefit of implementing
an ami that that because all the senses
people call it neural networks right the
key thing for them is not just meter
reading eliminate the need of sending a
meter person right is for doing demand
response control is preventing Brown out
so it's more political than economical
but I hope it will also bring economical
reason because if you are the mayor of
New York City and Manhattan your
motivation is not to get publicized with
brown out so that would be that some
credit from you when it's election time
so so that that's more politically
driven on the outside that's your thirty
company what's going inside the home
back to your question about what's the
motivation for smart home I don't see
that much dollar economical incentive
for saving your energy for a few dollars
however if there is an increase of
electric bills the the oil prices and
there will be more people using electric
car so if there is indeed there is that
increase in the electric car we do have
to figure out how not everybody come
home at the same time plugging into the
electric charger so there is a certainly
in one form so the other form of smart
home may not be electric energy related
it could be a safety security related in
a smart home so therefore those provider
will not be a utility company it may be
more driven by a
the the ATT ADT is the security company
or B service operator like the AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon so for inside a home you will
see those provider trying to push asmat
home so they will try the incentives try
to add additional services for you
so the telco and the service operator
would not be just offering you IP
Internet network SS or digital foam SS
they will try to sell you additional
services like video surveillance and
other thing services so that's another
form of smart home so I hope that answer
your question yeah okay they are still
evolving standards going on the question
is what's all this messaging API and
standard sim protocol so in terms of the
physical layer we have the pro cost and
at like ZigBee 1.0 sec b 2.0 so i think
we are all converging into a physical
layer of standard protocol that has to
be ipv6 compliant and we all need to
have the encryption capability to
protect the data so physical layer
I think converging but the messaging
layer there still a variety of standards
as you mentioned so there's open ADR
there's the D LMS so hopefully it will
stabilize soon
yeah in fact in many country they
actually disable your home gateway to
read your meter so in many cities or in
many countries they only have the meter
be accessible by the utility company so
they will upload it back to the server
from your home gateway or your iPad you
have to log into the utility surface so
they actually discontentment some
country do that so I guess but back to
your messaging thing that's where job
will come in right because if you have
the we record the messaging layer that
the utility company has to write but
once it get ridden it gives them the
portability and the abstraction to make
it easy to adopt and evolve okay any
other questions thank you very much so
feel free to contact me if you have
further questions and hope to see you
tomorrow also at 1:30 25th floor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
