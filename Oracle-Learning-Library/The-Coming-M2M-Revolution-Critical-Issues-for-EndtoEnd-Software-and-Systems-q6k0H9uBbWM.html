tough being the last one of the day I
was at a conference once in Las Vegas
and I was the last week around the last
day now I know why people went to Las
Vegas was going to they didn't go to see
the conference they went to the gamble
and by that time they lost their money
they were heading home but I have some
interesting topics you trying to do a
kind of a broad range for m2m and on
software development Papa shell with
Hitachi I do the business development
for m2m solutions and what I try to do
is here is and I'll go through the
agenda actually it'd be easier to cut
through it so you really talk about the
mtm landscape and it may be remedial for
some of you but it puts the rest of the
conversation in perspective some of the
dynamics and it's not my data i use try
to use third-party you know data to
substantiate where some of these forces
are starting to come into play some
industry observations I've been around
for for a while not a young kid anymore
but interviewing people so these are the
people's views or CIOs views of you know
what are their issues moving forward and
then get into the architecture for an
mtm solution we know how do you look at
it on an end-to-end basis and obviously
since you're here the solution proposed
is java and i'll talk in more detail
osgi which touchy licenses as a software
layer and then some interesting success
stories on FM how people have gotten
started and gotten more out of it than
they initially started with that's okay
with you I'll get moving and let's make
this informal here because we've got a
nice cozy crowd appreciate everyone for
being here so I like this definition of
em 10 okay so if we read it out for four
people that way in the back like in
church a world where you know physical
objects are seamlessly integrated into
the information network and where the
physical objects can become active
participates in the business process and
personal lifestyle and these are you
know from you know it's really all about
connecting the data that make it
actionable as the definition for Mt and
I've seen all the definitions out there
been for many years here and this one
gets the essence
of you know why do it line out for m2m
and then obviously from the keynote this
morning all the the size and
capabilities of the m10 market in terms
of these are some of the prognostic
haters talking about you know where the
industry is going but the business
drivers you know why people deploy m2m
solutions there's a lot of the companies
that we've engaged with over the years
it's continual pressure to you know
deploy m2m machine to machine
technologies and then initial part and
where you've seen kind of the growth for
all these for the different industries
that have a deploy this technology is
really operational costs i can use
technologies to reduce operational costs
a lot of its remote product management
you have a machine that's broken
somewhere how do I remotely get into it
and diagnose it as mtm 101 and it was
the early days where it's all rs-232 you
connected with computer and then the
first antenna technology is hot i put
ethernet in between the two so i can do
rs-232 from across the globe and that
was m2m but now with with IT
technologies moving forward in a lot of
networking technologies it's a whole new
transition under way that really turns
this industry on its on its head and why
static solutions are no longer the way
to go product performance so you're
collecting this data from these machines
because now you're online all the time
so you just statistical data on machine
your machine could be a medical device
it could be a printer it could be some
sort of industrial process could be
air-conditioning system for a for a
large building such as this and it's
it's as spoken in the keynote it's you
know of all the data getting from
vehicles and airplanes so I heard a talk
from someone from Boeing there's like 22
million sensors that they're there
they're collecting sending in satellite
bringing it down to the to the service
center
when the plane lands you know a lot of
them are you know maybe a broken remote
control for a controller for your
entertainment system you don't ground
the plane but if something critical they
ground the plane so it is ongoing
activity 44 mm and a lot of folks are
then using that for gaining competitive
advantages and then we're seeing growth
for a new business model so a lot of
folks like the big thing bigger thing
going on now in the telecom market is as
people offering new services so you
could call it m2m providing a broadband
gateway in the home and as opposed to
just doing voice video and data with
your cable modem or DSL gateway these
broad being home gateways are going in
for and you're seeing comcast and
verizon launching them for home control
so controlling your door locks looking
at security systems the next spot is
moving forward is energy capabilities
monitoring energy consumption in the
house you're seeing the utilities tying
that with a smart meter and then the
next extension of that is now you have
the digital home what about telemedicine
how can you do medical devices that are
in home bring them back over that same
gateway and then disperse it to the
right for the right folks who need it
and then service contracts for existing
one of the bigger areas for office
automation is printers and copiers are
now becoming a service you don't have to
buy them anymore third parties come in
and monitor them for you and they
actually know you know do the cartridges
you don't even pay for the printer so
they'll bring them as part of the
service and what they do is they do an
analysis they know how much you pay for
printers and copiers per year and say I
could lower your costs but I have to
monitor that and they go in and offer it
as a service because of real-time
monitoring and then once you're
collecting the data and I have the
success stories of folks in their real
time access is in for information gives
unique business insights of your
operation before you have to talk to the
smart person hey what do you think about
this issue now you're collecting data
from your machines your trucks your
devices out there that providing
tactical business insights you can make
better decisions to reduce costs or be
more street
but also besides the real time there's a
repository of data you're collecting in
that data mining the big the big data
moving forward now your star in the city
even in hospital who's collecting we'll
call it machine the machine all this
medical device information coming in
there collecting it there correlating it
to drug therapies going on in there
looking at changes in all this data
that's being collected simultaneously on
the patient looking at the trends and
say hey this drug therapy that this
particular hospital is his is working on
for cardio cardio patients is having an
ad not as good as an outcome as they
thought it was it was it the dosage was
it something else they were doing was in
the wrong patients all that data is now
making real-time analytics across a
variety of different market segments
which leads me into the next one is you
know where does it a pope where does it
apply I miss gas line sorry about there
well mrs. slide Kevin I'll use this one
as the one that goes across the market
segments of industrial that's our
industrial medical security systems
building automation transportation
remote part all the these touch across
where m2m Hampton is and it's really
because of the intelligence and the
semiconductors intelligence of the end
devices so i did a topological a view of
an instance here so we have the
broadband home activity going on what's
going on at home between medical
security and energy wired or wireless
interfaces or industrial where you have
potentially and a medical some sort of
industrial automation plant you're
monitoring the vibration of a large
compressor that's sitting on an oil rig
somewhere in dubai bringing that back
over some sort of network and before
used to be point-to-point so the big
trends going on here are two things
and I'll get into the market data is all
these devices are becoming networkable
they are being shipped today used to be
an rs-232 cable but the growth in either
wireless USB wired or cellular
interfaces and you saw the keynote this
morning the cellular interface getting
down to a low price point and in the
fleet in the fees go along with that are
a low price point allowing anything to
be connected maybe for used to be
connecting a machine to to the to an
operations manager who's just try and
take a look at this but it could be
going to a number of different folks and
you could segment the data to whoever
whoever needs it and to communities of
folks that either third party service
providers who would like to offer a new
service or it's a hospital or healthcare
provider who's who is looking at the
medical equipment here so the
partnerships that are coming as a result
of networking machines devices and
equipment is expanding the scope of mtm
so just let's take medicine print for an
instant there's a variety of different
models being built today of who's
monitoring the person at home is it is
at the hospital when you discharge it so
they can monitor the patient as opposed
to keeping them in the hospital and
reducing insurance costs is it a third
party service that i'll do it in behalf
of the hospital is that a friend or
family who's worried about someone at
home and it's a medical device that
they're just tracking the trends and
make sure people are on their meds and
that their weight doesn't go up where
the blood pressure doesn't go up opens a
whole new set of business models because
now you're able to do a blood pressure
cuff you're going through a broadband
gateway in collecting it in real time
which was never never done in the past
so mtm technologies have evolved to
provide canada so as we spoke about in
the keynote a whole new world of of
connectivity okay for the house of night
leading so for the dynamic so talked
about it the size of growth of the
market fifty billion plus plus or minus
the economists had a good quote on here
they went through all the Economist
magazine went through all these
forecasters and say no matter what
number you
pick any one of them are big but that's
really becoming as a result of
processing power that's being put into
the devices allows for easier access to
data and then the increasing ways to
interconnect machines devices and
equipment to end-users and I'll go into
the list of the technologies and how
they've evolved over time and the
forecast of those technologies that are
all the breeding ground to why mmm is
taking off you so you you have all these
devices that are connected the real
question becomes okay how do I make that
data actionable however so here we've
taken off but here we're stuck on a
launching pad solutions today without
software tools and standards the
complexity putting an end to end system
together is no small task and I'll go
through a couple of examples here and
design and develop and deploy it and
then once you do build a solution if
you're not thinking and to end it tends
to be a proprietary solution a good
software developer just kind of finishes
their code and I said I'm done but if
the data needs to change or has to go to
a different source you introduce a new
networking technology or a new device
that software has to be rewritten so the
cost and tested and deployed so majority
of solutions today without thinking and
tan is a single threaded software and
solution thread between the machine hand
and the data so let's take a look at
they'll mean to make it too much of an
eye chart here when the the several
market groups Beecham was on the show
this morning Harbor research is one that
we look at anyone giving anthem
presentations around around the country
though there'll be a slide from Harper
research so they spend their day their
lives on anthem for a number of year so
they get it they have a lot of market
sources this is a growth across these
are the market segments that that was
struggling with before industrial
buildings retail so retail is
point-of-sale terminals as a machine
digital signage that you see here is a
machine is all part of retail barcode
readers RFID readers are all part of the
retail segment transportation I'll talk
about
a couple of those IT healthcare homeland
security resources was really kind of
oil gas and smart grid residential kind
of the home gateways I was talking about
these are a year after year growth of
devices that are being shipped to those
markets that have networking capability
so these are the printers the smart
meters that the registers are going out
the ATM machines that are being
networked per year and it continues to
grow those are connected through a
variety of different technologies
wireline the old wire connection from
that machine to a network WM which is
the cellular a wide wide area networks
WLAN which is Wi-Fi is becoming a
significant part of interconnecting even
in hospitals as they're deploying
medical devices that you move around and
the cost of Wi-Fi has come down
significantly as high levels of
integration of the semiconductors and
probably an area that you're certain to
see growth is w pan personal area
networks so you have your cell phone you
have bluetooth that's working today but
now there's a whole new set of lower
energy short-range wireless
interconnectivity that's being built in
the marketplace today so it's zigbee
Bluetooth a number of them that are low
power so you can use battery and they'll
be able to interconnect the growth of
these wpn starts being significant we're
getting thirty percent year-over-year
growth of devices that have low cost
wireless interfaces so the good news is
you have a lot of choices to how to
interconnect your machine to a network
the bad news just too many right so we
started in the 60s with rs232 but as you
see in the 70s and 80s started moving on
to a higher speed using some power line
then you start getting more into the
wireless area and then you know this
thing is really starting to take off and
this is a continual effort of trying to
improve bandwidth cost connection
capabilities and there's no shortages of
standards bodies or interesting
companies that are here in Silicon
Valley that coming out to the newest
version
well low-cost wireless that's going to
transform how you interconnect any
device at any time so people are number
one how do you accommodate these changes
into your mtm design number two and this
slide was shown is you know all this is
going to generate data this data comes
it comes from this is from Cisco Systems
kind of the how many petabytes per month
for machine-to-machine expectations they
had put forth and I guess Justin had
talked about you know the work BMW is
doing today of collecting all the data
and the machines moving forward but
that's no data but the problem of
getting the data from a proprietary
system to an application is still a
challenge in the marketplace so for
industrial only this is the industrial
segment only the data protocols that
have evolved over time continue to to to
to move forward in the marketplace
everyone's coming out with a new way to
capture the data make them networkable
these tend to be either industry
specific or company specific was trying
to corner the market but this is the
carriage of going to put the data into
this envelope and this is the envelope
so m10 designs those big market great
opportunity is fraught with you know
these continual change both forecasted
and then perceived so putting the pieces
together is designing an mm solution yet
the physical entity connection which is
wired or Wireless you have protocols if
changing requirements and then that all
creates software complexity and the
solution and that software complexities
from the machine all the way to the
business process application at the
other end of the of the of the spectrum
the VDC research one of the trust of
guys who do a lot of research and the is
anyone here from VDC doing a lot of
embedded projects are approaching 1
million lines of code for for embedded
systems for from
medical device or for a high-end printer
there and and that end that software is
part of its homegrown part of its
third-party part of its open-source how
do you get it how do you bring it
together how to integrate how do you
make it work how do you evolve it over
time so the world event embedded which
look dormant and everything you just
assumed everything worked is evolving
and getting more complex as we speak so
so who puts these together there's a
variety of companies not touch upon it
could be a service provider like a
verizon 18t bud called M&amp;amp;M t'aime it
could be a company and I'll give an
example of like ups it would be a
hospital it could be building automation
so it could be a company that's
monitoring a number of buildings on air
conditioning usage I know 7-eleven has
our awawa and the Northeast has monitors
all the stores from air conditioning
loads to point-of-sale register to
security cameras you know those are all
mm solutions out there in the
marketplace but there's someone at way
that way a weekend I worrying about you
know how do i deploy an FM solution so
the the senior folks that you know we at
hitachi have interacted you know these
are the kind of the common themes week
here keep on hearing you know people who
haven't deployed a solution we've been
studying em temp forever but there's no
perfect solution so they're stalled the
ROI they normally have the base i'm
going to deploy this whole
infrastructure monitoring a piece of
equipment is is is built on an overly
aggressive assumption so i can prove a
payback and 18 months but you really
believe the assumptions going in there
so we don't really understand it we're
studying it we're not quite sure let's
bring a consulting group in we've
interviewed scores of consulting groups
all have their own way to develop so
there you know there's everyone has a
solution out there and but what skiers
trying to find the wrong button sorry
what skiers folks is hate the sea cxo
one of the competitors their competitors
is implementing an MDM solution so what
are they going to do and then as a
result because of their experience m2m
is different than an IT project
specially if you're getting a CIO
involved in this moose
for a solution that you're trying to
build on an m10 basis gartner research
has a kind of good way of calling it
they call it IT meets OT operational
technologies and you get a world of
proprietary c java programmers embedded
on a bit processor meaning a rule that's
evolved with web 20 open standards open
data a number of different things when
you put two together make an intense
system it's different and they're scared
to death of moving forward so I'll touch
upon this lightly I notice is really
worried here okay but historically m2m
designs as I started earlier discussions
were built on doing low cost how quickly
can I remotely monitor some machine or a
device so to keep the cost low they
usually done a lower level language
smaller process smaller memory because
the end of Isis you wanted to keep cheap
you don't want to put a bigger processor
in there but after again as after you
put built the initial solution which you
built in place is not evil and then
industry specific technology i showed
you in the for the industrial market
some of the protocols some of these for
specific markets for medical for
industrial for building automation and
for security tend to be may be specific
in terms of how you built the hardware
is built how the software is designed
how some of the regulatory pressures are
in there and then once you deploy a
system deployment and management system
solid in a hospital area how do you how
do you monitor that the things working
on antenna you could get the data there
well and your monitoring the end machine
but when the application isn't working
to grab the data from the machine yet
the cook all good old Joe to go out
there he's your expert but he's he's
called all the time to go and try to
troubleshoot or that is
so let's go into the system design and
it's so this I had opportunity to do a
webinar over to Oracle so I was able to
grab a couple of their slides so the in
10 designs so this gives a pictorial
view of you know what we're trying to
accomplish so I touched upon medical
devices smart meter smart grid all these
other devices are now coming in with
networking technologies even the
automobile coming into a cloud or some
network and then tying into the
enterprise on the marketplace that's a
goal it looks great on paper the
implementation challenges become less
challenging over time I'm going to spend
a little time on this one okay the goal
and that we've interviewed a lot of
folks and if we get down to the DNA
event m2m it's a path to make data
actionable and these are all moving
parts are you have the machine or device
that generates so this could be any type
of machine out there it goes through a
gateway or an aggregator as a
communication network in place
potentially the cloud or an enterprise
IT center because there's maybe some
additional processing that they've needs
to be done there's the initial
application that is that drives why you
tie these things together so and then to
really make it actionable make it part
of your business process and it tie that
into your enterprise applications so
let's talk about a medical device so the
what's going on in a medical market
today is his significant the government
is is telling hospitals that they have a
certain percentage of medical devices
have to be online and connected to the
health IT systems and they're doing for
a number of incentive reasons they're
also you know can do to be some
penalties if you don't connect to him as
a result this world which was
proprietary used to get anyone from
Philips or GE here actually used to get
a Philips respirator in hospital they go
through a full of specific networking
gear I go I go to hospital it looks like
an ethernet plug it says for Philips a
medical equipment only you stick it in
it goes to their IT centre which baby
convert it in there
displays and they make they make it for
the nursing station here whether world's
try to go through is try to make
standards so you can interconnect any
medical device into the IT system but
these things are changing these medical
devices talk a variety of different
different languages some of them are USB
some of them are Wi-Fi somewhere still
rs-232 so the Gateway has to take police
physical interfaces and then send it up
through through a network there's some
Wi-Fi networks that are specific to
hospitals that are being deployed those
hospital networks have to be locked down
his last things because of HIPAA
compliance you don't want third party so
that network can't be open to go off
into web search serving has to be
segmented for the hospital market it
goes to the IT center which may do some
additional transformation of the data
because some of it may be proprietary
some of it could be new standard i
triple e 11 07 3 structure data to come
in and it goes to the nursing station
great you've made the path so now the
nurse can go in there and look at all
the medical devices in a room for a
particular patient and look and see
other tracking you can look at an
infusion pump and you can see that the
chemical and the way that's going in
being fused for a drug to a patient but
also in a heart rate monitor goes in oh
my goodness is is that person allergic
to the drug you will know them until you
put holly's all this data together in
real time so that's part of the
collection of that data but you're since
you're infusing someone with a drug you
wanted to go to the billing system and
make an automated process so you can go
off and build them for the heparin or
whatever the drug was and then so it
needs to go to the billing system it has
good administration this charge and
transfer function because they have to
know this medical device in this room
goes to John Doe versus John Smith so
all this is part of an enterprise of an
m2m solution I think one more here
vehicles for vehicle market the vehicles
there's no aggregator its aggregated
potentially in the cloud a lot of
vehicles have cellular or satellite
connectivity goes into the network
brought in the initial is vehicle
tracking a good plan i'll touch on UPS
and a second to track their vehicles but
that data also is important for
t'kul maintenance you know is there also
other vibration data you're getting
there's fuel because you're filling up
some of it is going faster for one truck
another needs a tune-up all this data
makes you more efficient so these are
the areas of data aggregation their
industry specific but there's a common
software layer in there that allows
again if you're treating it as data how
do I get data from from point A to point
B to finally to the enterprise to make
it actionable and I won't dwell on this
I'll touch upon the tachi parts and and
since this is the embedded I'll go into
the embedded but as part of the solution
that Oracle is moving forward with
partners such as Hitachi and systems
integrators and even from the outside
looking in for many years I've always
thought that Oracle is a great position
to put all these pieces because from
here here's the machines you have the
embedded Java that sits either on a
machine or the gateway brings up in
their cloud ties it into the initial
application and then integrates it into
the enterprise so the pieces are there
the real part is how do you build a
software infrastructure or design the
anthem system for that particular market
segment to make it happen
so I'm going to talk a little bit on
osgi how we do for tunnel okay osgi is
is a is called the open services gateway
initiative it's delivered by the OSGi
alliances and industry consortium of
folks like itachi and others who are
part of the Alliance that develop an
architecture and a dentist but other
parts are there but the initial intent
was to provide a modular architecture
for Java for embedded that breaks the
application into meaningful modules for
deployment the the biggest the biggest
capability of of osgi is the ability to
dynamically load into an embedded
application one of these bundles to
install it uninstall it start stop it or
upgraded dynamically without taking the
process and I'll go through we have
several customers and the telco one is
is one that is is of importance you
could have a home control energy
monitoring application and a
telemedicine application running
simultaneously in a single gateway and
you can change out a functionality you
can change out services it's a perfect
tool and that's why they're all moving
toward an osgi java deployment for the
home this has similar capabilities i'll
go through a couple examples of where
it's also applicable to more traditional
m2m solutions so how does it look like
on the client device so this could be a
gateway or a higher end machine you get
the devices you have the embedded Java
you have the Java tools there yeah the
Java card and then the osgi layer sits
on top of Java as as a value add I'll
get a little bit of what it does and
then there's local services so these are
really the applications that could run
on a gateway or or on a the machine
itself
so what is osgi provide for m2m it's
really using Java as the foundation it
provides the portability of application
it finally gets us from you know in the
mtm world for embedded when they move
from c to c plus plus it was or no from
assembler to see there was a great great
revelation got higher level languages so
and then using java for portability the
ability to break them into bundles gives
a structure at software and modulation
there's portability it now brings I
think the intent of this conference the
access of a large community of Java
developers into the embedded world and
makes a platform where business-critical
applications are remotely manageable so
if you look at traditional designs today
for an embedded you have the hardware is
the Linux kernel there's native programs
and someone writes an application
usually in C C++ or whatever here the
applications are usually tightly coupled
to the hardware so that the hardware
could be sensor so this is an infusion
pump for our medical voice the hardware
is is is looking at the drips you're
sending through infusion collecting the
data if it's if it's a printer you're
looking at you know running a cartridge
you're looking at the printer diagnosis
there's a number and when the hardware
touches the software you know it's where
the magic happens but if someone changes
needs to upgrade a software normally
it's you have to roll someone out do an
upgrade work and I'll go into where are
the advantages of osgi but if you change
some of the hardware your software that
you've invested so much time and you
look at a lot of the m2m applications
people are for the studies you've seen
more than fifty percent of the effort
getting a machine out the door is his
software development versus the hardware
development so when you introduce java
and osgi your ability to load
application so communication you can
break your bundles you know you have a
communication bundle the handles
connection to those networks I talked to
about that has a logic bundle to only
send the data you want to
now folks yet maybe a diagnostic bundle
to monetary the device or a move before
you break your break your software into
a higher-level language and into
something that's manageable from a
deployment deployment standpoint and
then there's a touch upon this in a
couple of slides because it's where a
lot of the work and the standard work is
going on there's ability put
abstractions which has happened in a
number of different markets where you
don't have to write in the mtm and
embedded right down to the lower levels
of the driver Code of the device you are
talking to your out here there's there's
these these software bundles that takes
the driver abstract cement and presents
api's api's to to the application so if
you try and talk to a any type of sensor
right here you don't care how it
interconnects all you say I want to talk
to the sensor and the API is abstract
how that inter connection occurs and
I'll give you an example here in a
second so if you look at how a CO
skyworks you have the application is
developed the application developer
certifies the app it gets set down it
could be staged if it can be sent then
down into an act into a management
server and it could equally be a couple
of application be a diagnostic
application there could be a
communication application those are then
loaded on the machine or directly into
into the or a gateway that enables
connection to a medical device handles a
protocol it makes it connect to to uh to
a whoever needs the data either product
operation data store remote product
management or some sort of alerting
system so osgi is a dynamic aspect of
how you load programs how you break it
into a modular software and load it down
to the end device for deployment
and I just touch upon the abstraction
layers so the abstraction layers of the
software in many of the gateways and
there's a couple gateway companies out
there in the m10 world that really
embraces this company called the euro
tech and then there's kontron Kol and TR
ln we're providing gateways that have
embedded java and osgi on top and what
they're doing is providing people to go
ahead deploy those in networks pull that
data data and then bring it to to the
application and interconnect to a
variety of different devices with
abstraction what it allows is there's a
variety of different ways to
interconnect I listed some of them on
the earlier slides these are some of the
physical technologies that come out of a
gateway so you can you can connect to a
device you connect to a network and the
abstraction layer what it does is
provides a software representation so
when you're right you're right a2a us to
a device that speaks USB to a medical
device you just say connect to a medical
device you don't care for the USB or
z-wave or Ethernet or Bluetooth it makes
the connection you've abstract it how to
make that connection makes a lot easier
to deploy software that was originally
again I single threaded through an
entire network that the software and the
physical world start becoming decoupled
and providing abstraction layers to make
that happen and that all occurs with
java and osgi the only reason I put this
slide up I know it's a bit complicated
but I want to make the parallel here
what's going on with Java osgi and the
software world for embedded because it's
pretty profound is get the underlying
hardware if this is a machine or a
gateway an aggregator if the underlying
hardware of whatever the machine is you
have the operating system the Java
Virtual Machine the osgi framework you
have these abstraction bundles that make
it easy for people to write applications
and here's the applications that that
would be riding on top so it that
structure of operating system middleware
application framework and the
value-added apps is is moving toward the
m10 world and the parallel here
independently if you look at what
android does or iOS does it's the same
structure what's happened in the only
night but i talked to the clock on folks
and they said they you know when they
first made their chips for cell phones
people have to write down to the driver
level to make an SMS messaging to write
up to put a timer on there you have to
write at that you know write code down
to it to the chip level and until they
came up with something called brew to
make it easier for folks to go but now
that's going to wait because you have
iOS you have Android the world has
abstractive for the cell phone through
software the ability to do connect your
bluetooth no one has to write a
bluetooth driver but yet any Bluetooth
device syncs up to your cell phone
volume control GPS is now abstracted so
how many gps apps you have on your
smartphone i go out for a walk in the
morning i put the gps app that i
downloaded it tracks where I walk
through San Francisco gives me a map it
tells me how long I went average speed
elevations how I went in terms of
elevations and that was all because no
one could have written that in the past
unless you have abstracted the gps the
user interface all that has been
obstructed so the same parallels that
have gone on the cell phone market which
meteoric lee took off in terms of
application developers that have popped
out to write apps is starting to occur
we're in the early stages here of the
anthem world what makes a little more
difficult you'll always have a user
interaction or someone there who isn't
working to fix it or download a new one
in the mtm world that's a dumb device is
only as smart as you write software to
make it so there's more challenges but
those challenges have great rewards so
let's go through some success stories
and time for a large package delivery
company initially ups and they're not
i'm not sure if they using java OS
choice so I'm talking about m2m when you
develop a solution kind of the side
benefits of here they initially launched
the track vehicles for better efficiency
so
tracking it tracking the efficiencies
they're seeing someone gets back in six
hours well maybe we'll get that person
two or three more routes to do or
reroutes if there's traffic or an
accident so they know where the trucks
are in real time and the optimizing tent
was optimizing driver efficiency so they
built their ROI on that awesome they
discover I got accident claims were
being impacted by boxes falling into the
driver compartment so well if we closed
some people weren't closing the door so
what they did is put a door sensor
technology that's data now it's another
sensor coming in being reported back a
driver gets dinged by corporate if they
drive leave without closing the door and
as a result the insurance claims have
gone down all you know again the side
benefit and then all of a sudden they
started seeing other benefits because
they're measuring in real time where
these trucks are they tell them to shut
the trucks off when they pull into for a
stop and some of them were idling for a
while then they show the trucks off well
then now they can measure when it goes
to a stop when the ignition goes off so
they're able to save millions of dollars
a year of fuel because they're there
they know the drivers are being
monitored when they pull into a stop
they're not going to stop and roll but
when they come to a stop quickly shut
off that that engine and then started
when you're about to take off so they
are able to extend the time idle is not
being used and only really moving it
forward they're also collecting the how
many times the ignition goes on off so
it goes back to their maintenance center
and they say okay it's been going on for
this truck for ten thousand ons and off
let's bring it in for a scheduled
replacement of the ignition system again
the side benefits of anthem you started
out with one and you start collecting
data then you let just a creativity of
your staff move forward and deploying
with bus drivers in Detroit school bus
drivers so initially
were required good gps on the buses to
track the buses and then using the same
technology these two have a problem with
kids hiding in the buses and being in
the bus left the box and overnight so
then they implemented a switch at the
back of the bus where the bus driver had
to walk all the way down the bus toggle
the switch at the end of his shift that
thereby making sure that there were no
kids / excellent and excellent its own
its once you start start collecting that
the data here's another one it's a
company that's implemented fuel
monitoring so a lot of the gas stations
out there they have few monitoring
systems but it's usually stays at the
station so they could see if the tanks
gettin low before you said you see them
out there on the Hubble that everyone is
you stick that big stick in the ground
you see you pull it out so I'm almost
empty now they've got it better right so
they're collecting it so you could see
it so you don't the stick in the ground
well what happens when you network those
they started networking and they're able
to ensure kind of timely delivery of
gasoline they'll know where the gas
levels are and and also it provides a
side benefit because you're monitoring
it in real time if there's a leak in the
tank you'll start seeing a drain without
it being dispensed because they tie it
into the point of sale terminal but also
they able able to get data from because
they own both the dispensing as well as
the delivery so they correlated data
from the gasoline being loaded on
specific trucks and they're able to
match it exactly to what they need for
the day is one of the things they do is
you load it up ego and you deliver it
only half it's done you bring it back
the truck back overnight two things one
there's you bought the gas and you're
not dispensing it into the station's
efficiently the other part is there some
danger of phenyl that the terrorism
because you have all these kind of
trucks with still a lot of storage of
fuel than them they also uncovered areas
of fraud they loaded 20,000 gallons but
the only you know deliver in 18,500
where that one 5500 went to one of the
buddies gas stations somewhere and the
only again they improve the efficiency
of matching the load to the delivery now
the real thing is when you start getting
real create
some more people in here and you got the
data you're collecting in real time
these guys have played an arbitrage game
if the party they watch gas prices and
they're pretty good at because they're
in the business the gas prices are
starting to to rise what you do is you
fill up your tanks as fast as you can
and keep all your tanks out there and
all your guess is as high as you can
because the price you pay tomorrow is
gonna be higher than the price you paid
today so keep them keep them full and as
a result when they're going down drain
them as low as you can because do I get
it today because tomorrow is gonna be
cheaper so let them go low low low until
they almost run out and you play the
arbitrage and then you get it in the
lower price as a result this one company
made several hundred thousand dollars
per year just on on the arbitrage of gas
prices so what started out for just
monitoring you know because of
creativity started started moving
forward and finally and they use Java
and finally this one that's using java /
osgi company making kind of industrial
and commercial printers and and these do
real-time transactions these printers
usually have some sort of scanner or i/o
it goes to a database brings that on
prints you'll see them potentially I'll
give you an example without disclosing
who the companies like if you have a
rental car that transaction with that
specialized printer has to go back has
to go back to the transactional engine
out there to find out when you went out
how many miles went out who you are your
credit card pulls that together but
there's features and functions that they
wanted to do to continue to add they
might be a new sensor out there that
they want to go in and they don't want
to rewrite the code for their printer so
there are some instances where the
printers and the networking technology
are changing and then also rewrite their
application so they can rapidly update
those and they're providing new service
so that can do remote diagnostics on the
printers so the data goes to the to the
application of printing out that bill
but also data is going to the service
center when the printer isn't working
over there something wrong with the
software it's going to a third party so
they see themselves as totally
transforming the way they do business
providing new features at a much faster
pace and changing the customer
experience
so mtm technology poised I truly believe
that and today in the discussion with
with today's keynote everything business
value for people can connect everything
Java is as enabling platform bringing
the higher level up software there plus
any devices out there to marketplace
osgi we we we believe provides an up an
application capability as well as
abstraction capability and then I think
the Tai Chi Oracle solution provides you
know helps enable a device to data
center and what we're trying to get to
is your today's roll with with mmm it's
really a software world that's
integrated tightly and it's too tightly
go on to programmability I think we're
mmm really takes off like the cell phone
market goes you're going to configure
ability versus programmability and
that's where you know kind of the
applications take off so I know we've
got my hustle through here a little bit
because I know it's the last talk of the
day and at an event tonight but I can
take some questions now or I'll hang
around here for as long as you like to
have any other questions gather your
clapping okay thanks yeah I'm curious
about
observed in the trends around the
endpoint so for example i'm in a
manufacturing business I instrumenting
my magnify manufacturing shop for
because of my ability to leverage higher
speed networks i can put down verse
number device machine right and i can
centralize all the restoration process
Frank I've seen a lot of discussion
about putting more smarts in the end
thanks ya know now and again I don't
know if I try to put in there but you're
exactly right there there certain app
you know certain areas that certain
solutions may or may not work if that
solution works and using the cloud and
getting and putting everything in the
storage your ability to centralize
resources is is important and then
keeping the devices low-cost as you can
moving forward areas that we've seen
have seen as if devices change quickly
or features change then then move to
potentially this this type of
architecture the other the other part is
if if the network goes down and you need
some local still need caching or local
decision-making people are you know
coming to us and saying we need business
rules in here because I'll collect data
but if I lose the connection some local
decision so if you have a you know
depending what you have some monitoring
capability in the home for security of
changing door locks you may not if you
lose your connection someplace else and
have to go back into the mark back at
the network and pull it down it doesn't
work then it doesn't doesn't help the
other spots where where we don't see
this this may work is where there's just
slow movement they know you you you put
a product out there and it stays
unchanged for 10-15 years and they say
no I'll write the C code I'll just
connect it locally and nothing changed
so areas where there's rapid change
rapid innovation a lot of different
connection
technologies out there is where areas
where we see the kind of Java osgi fit
and it's not does not the fit all all
cases well we're just we are we're
leveraging down an osgi or leveraging it
sir yep so we are dynamically loading
module right before yeah yeah yeah I
agree anyone else I'll just stick around
but thanks thanks everyone for coming
hopefully we will see it tonight at the
at the event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
