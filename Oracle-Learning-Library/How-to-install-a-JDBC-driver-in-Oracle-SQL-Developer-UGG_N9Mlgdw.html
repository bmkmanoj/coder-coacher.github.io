demonstration in this demo you'll learn
how to install a gay BBC driver into a
sequel developer to connect to a third
party database you'll need to download
and install the appropriate driver when
you open up a connection dialog you'll
see that we'll have a tab to connect to
an Oracle database and to an Access
database now if you want to connect to
open third party databases once you
install the drivers you'll be able to
see the connection tabs for those
databases for this example I want to
install a driver to connect to either
sequel server or Sybase database I can
do a search on the driver J GDS this is
open source so all these JDBC drivers
are free download here it takes me to
SourceForge this is an open source site
and I want to make sure I install the
supported driver version for these
databases so for G TTS we deport 1.2 you
want to download the full distribution
zip once you download that zip file you
need to go back into sequel developer to
point to that location go to tool and in
preferences if you go to database select
third-party JDBC driver added entry
navigate to where you saved the file and
the file that we're looking for is a jar
file so go
gs1 - and here's the jar file that we're
looking for
so once you've told sequel developer
where the location that the driver is
you go back into the connections dialog
you'll now see a connection tabs to
connect to sequel server and to Sybase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
