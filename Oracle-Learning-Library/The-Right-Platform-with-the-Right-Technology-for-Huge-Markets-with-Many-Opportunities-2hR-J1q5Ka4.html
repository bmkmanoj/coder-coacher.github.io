the Java ME product management team at
Oracle and go speaker here with me in
the room is an Antwon from Nokia and she
leads the product marketing efforts for
the s40 platform at nokia and as the
title of our talk phase the right
platform with the right technology for
huge markets with many opportunities
sure it's a mouthful and we really want
to ensure that by the time you leave
this room we do give a handful of
resources and information to go out and
explore further what we mean by saying
the right platform as s40 and the right
technology one of those being Java ME so
as we get into this session I would
start with talking about why Java ME and
why Java ME on as 40 and other than
talking about the merits of Java ME and
s40 we would want to talk about the
other merits of this platform as well
and where I would lead to lead into the
discussion by Anna so very basic things
and this is like teaching to the core
here when I say what does a developer
want it's essentially something that
should be coming from you to me as these
are the kind of things that you want in
the platform these are the resources I
need to be equipping with you but just
to lay the foundation for the discussion
here for the rest of the hour and for us
to get into the same frequency band here
is a rundown of what I think are the
essential things that would help a
developer and raise a platform or like
or stick to that platform first and
foremost it's about the technology and
when you say technology it's a
combination of the tools the additional
resources that you have available
whether in the form of community help or
in the form of videos tutorials how to
street sheets and whatnot then you need
an application runtime which is
something which is not in your control
but that ends up being the
platform providers responsibility like
for Oracle or for nokia to ensure that
there is a wide install base of devices
carrying s40 or Java ME so that when you
write your applications when you have
these applications ready to hit the
market you don't have to worry about
whether there are enough devices that
you could target for those applications
so that's number three and lastly of
course you need distribution and
monetization channels there could be
independent channels there could be
incoherent ways where you have to plug
in different ways for ensuring that the
application works it has the right kind
of api's and a right kind of resourcing
for you to monetize whether it's through
the in-app advertising or through other
means but these are the kinds of
channels that developers are looking for
and other than the technology when we
say that we have a right device install
base we are saying that we have device
users but that is not enough for
developers to find that there is a wide
set of users out there we want these
users also to be consuming applications
to be consuming content as an example I
might claim that for Java ME we have an
install base of about 3 billion devices
and that means we have 3 billion users
for Java ME based devices but for
developers you would want to question me
are these all three billion users
actually consuming content and then that
becomes my responsibility to ensure that
we give you a good set of application or
content consumers as well and lastly
when we say that we would want to enable
content through the platform or we would
want to ensure that there are devices
and consumers for the content we would
also want to ensure that there are a
variety of different use cases that
could be served through your
applications or for the target devices
and the markets that we are going after
so here is my checklist here are the
essential parameters that I would look
at for preparing ask
or card for a platform so that being
said why would I preach Java ME to you
on the right side this picture here the
circles that you see this is something
that we've been saying Java ME has had
for the last decade these have been the
merits of the platform and these have
been the reasons why we ends or why
developers have embraced this platform
and on the left-hand side is my pitch to
you as why you should still continue to
see it as a lucrative development
platform for you going forward just
quoting one of the market research firms
there from ovum in the next five years
we are looking at about four billion
feature phones to be sold or to be
shipped over the course of this time
that's a huge number and you might say
that the market for feature phones is
declining smartphones are taking over
the mobile market by a storm but if you
look at this number this still continues
to be higher than the number of
smartphones that would be shipping in
the next five years secondly when you
talk about low-end devices or mid to
entry range devices we are talking about
resource-constrained devices not all of
these but a good number of these a good
percentage of these and for such kind of
devices you are looking for low
footprint solutions so that the
application platform by itself does not
hog away does not consume all the
resources we want to ensure that our
platform consumes as few resources as
possible and leave the rest for your
applications or for the other value
added content to be provided for the
end-users next as I see the untapped
potential of applications and content on
budget phones as i call it the mid to
entry range phones is still huge and
Java ME has been a proven development
platform with volume distribution and a
mature ecosystem which you all are
getting to witness here in this
conference
Oracle is still committed to leading
Java ME and continuing to in a weight
with this platform and when I say
continuing to innovate with this
platform it's not only in terms of the
api's and functionality that we want to
provide as a plaque part of the Java ME
platform but also in terms of aligning
it with java SE so say as a Java
developer writing applications for
desktops you are used to leveraging
certain api's for certain use cases we
want to ensure that you have those api's
available as a part of the Java ME
platform as well or you have to do as
little changes to your java SE
applications to be able to use them on
the Java ME based devices and if you
have been catching up with the news at
the event or if not and after the event
is over and as you get to sit and think
about the keynotes you can relate to
what I said here in terms of how we are
trying to make Java ME a little sibling
of SE and how eventually when java SE
becomes a modular platform it will be
that same platform the same components
that you can take and make them as a
part of the lower end devices as well
and lastly we would want that the nine
million plus java developer community
that we talked about as the Java
ecosystem has access to the entire
breadth of Technology starting from SC 2
m.e or the miniature versions available
for these small embedded devices here is
busting a few myths not very many but
the perception in the market is Java ME
based devices are not cool and my
response to that is well it's not just
that these devices are not cool but in
addition to having all that cool
functionality and the cool look these
devices are not as expensive as the
higher end smartphones such as those in
the range of 600 to 700 dollars and we
have some of these so-called
cool-looking phones which are not as
expensive also available in
of the Java ME boots in the demo grounds
so I would invite you all to go and take
a look at what we are referring to as
cool devices which have the same set of
functionality as for these smartphones
are the higher end devices the second
misperception out there is Java ME
applications are not rich and varied
they have primarily been all around
games and i would like to refute that by
again encouraging you to visit this
booth in the java demo grounds where you
can see a variety of different use cases
served by these applications these are
social networking applications or some
voice over IP or some entertainment
applications or there's a cloud-based
portra which can take you to any kind of
or your favorite social networking
channel there are news apps and whatnot
I'm not going to be enlisting this
entire set of categories but this is
just a way of saying that whatever you
can find on smart phones you can find
similar set of applications for Java ME
and s party based devices and in
addition here I'm sorry here are some
pointers to Nokia's App Store and to the
other independent content aggregators
websites where you can take a look at
what kind of diverse set of applications
I'm referring to and lastly the
misperception out there that Java ME is
not as complete in terms of
functionality as iOS or Android or any
other smartphone platform for that
matter I would challenge this by saying
if you are comparing Java ME to iOS or
Android it's not comparing apples to
apples and the reason for that is when
you are talking about iOS or Android
it's a complete operating system and
Java ME is just an application platform
sitting on top of another OS platform or
a device platform like s potty so if
somebody were to do a comparison it
should be say a platform like s party so
Java ME plus s 40 with Android or iOS
and then based on the scorecard we can
evaluate the merits or the disadvantages
of one platform over another
so that being said that's just breaking
some misperceptions out there in the
industry in the community here is my
take on why you should be looking at
Java ME on s40 drop so if you look at
s40 we are primarily talking about the
high-end feature phones the mid to entry
range devices and for this kind of a
platform I believe the wild west of
applications is yet to be explored I'm
not even saying that we are there the
Wild West for applications and content
for smartphones might be over but we
still have to see it for the other range
of devices for the feature phones and
the kind of targets for s40 and let me
tell you why I think the vile vest for
applications and content for smartphones
is over just taking the numbers from
apple's app store itself iOS App Store
itself there are about 1,000,000,000
applications out there today and there
have been more than 25 billion downloads
already so with this whole spectrum of
fun billion applications do you think
any of those application areas those use
cases have been left untapped perhaps
not but on the other hand if you compare
the number of outstanding applications
out there for s40 or Java ME like
devices it's somewhere in the range of
hundreds to 200 thousands and there's a
big difference in kind of applications
we're talking or the kind of downloads
or consumption of those applications and
on the other hand we are talking about
much higher volumes of devices for s40
or Java ME like platforms and that being
said the answer is in front of you as
where the next wave of application or
content consumption would be looked at I
already talked enough about the user
base for s40 like devices in terms of
the number of feature phones that would
be shipped over the course of next five
years and what are the kind of numbers
in terms of the install base that we're
looking at today Java ME plus s40
together if you look at the
developer community the kind of
resources available through OB or
through the other online channels and
product forums it's much more much
higher in volume in terms of what kind
of resources are available for other
smartphone development communities so
what I'm trying to say is in terms of
the resources that are available for you
to get jump-started you are already in a
very good state in terms of the
functionality that you need from the
platform together both of these
platforms provide not just the basic
standard functionality required from a
device platform to access the device
hardware but you have some high-level
functionality for advanced features
advanced hardware features such as for
sensors like accelerometers or compass
or you have gesture api's to help you
serve novel use cases and write novel
applications for your target and users
and most importantly when you talk about
distribution and monetization channels
there are plenty of these available at
your fingertips and the reality might be
that there isn't enough Avernus about
these monetization channels or the
distribution channels for you to reach
out to the end users and for more on all
of this that I said and to talk about
other merits of s40 i would invite anna
and take over from me here
hello everyone while we are changing
slides I would like to ask you if you
want to fill in the feedback form and
return back to the beautiful lady in the
white t-shirt we're sitting close to the
work then at the end of the session you
will be able to get a heuristic loaded
with sdk developer training
cancellation further you will see this
phone at oracle boosts and i will be
talking a little bit about this phone
during the presentation if you want to
do a little bit of assignment which i
will tell you about at the end of the
session you might get the chance to earn
this phone but that's a little bit of
leg work will be required so what is the
next billion opportunity and now I start
talking of numbers does it yes you see
this nice pyramid it represents the
world population which is nowadays seven
billion people the very bottom of the
pyramid which is almost half of the
world population 3.2 billion does not
have mobile phone and that group of
people is very well addressed by series
40 entry devices that can be as cheap as
35-39 years or dollars and these are the
phones which may be the first phones for
the for the users then going up the
pyramid you see 1.2 billion of world
population they do have the mobile phone
but they don't use the internet how can
we how can we address that we can
address it in the similar way as a
little bit higher slice of the cake 1.5
billion of people having mobile phone
but not actively using it so these
people probably already have passed
through the stage that we used the very
basic first phone they have upgraded to
the new phone but we need to excite them
to start using the internet and consume
the content for that we have higher end
of Russia devices with a lot of nice
features a lot of nice applications and
in addition we have support in terms of
data friendly services like browser with
high data compression and we have
operated billing which allows you easily
purchasing applications and moreover we
work with operators on smart data plans
that allow users to consume applications
at ease then on the very top 1 billion
is probably those iphone and samsung
galaxy users they are using the mobile
internet actively already but still
those guys they might want a secondary
phone they might want the phone which is
not too expensive they can take it to
their traveling and they can use it
there so you saw 7 billion population
and where are those opportunities
geographically but pretty much the whole
of the world and to be more specific the
key markets are so-called breaker
countries Brazil Russia India Indonesia
China and Africa and from the photos you
can see a lot of young faces so the
driving force that buys phones and
consumes applications of asha devices
are the urban youth people why are we
seeing urban youth is the driving force
they are trendsetters they want
everything cool they don't necessarily
have a lot of money to spare not
necessarily they want to spare a lot of
money so they want a budget phone that
behaves pretty much the same way as
expensive smartphone and what do they
think about their phones so the phone
must be a social social and more social
a lot of social applications because
young people nowadays they want to stay
in touch with broad communities then
they want good performance they want
good looking phones
they want good features so what you see
is no matter how see how big and seek
the pocket is or the lack of big and
thick pocket everyone wants well
performing good looking at phones loaded
with applications and the ability to
load more applications to those phones
and in every market with all those
geographies of opportunities and big
numbers that you heard we are addressing
them all you don't see the entry the
phones here on the slide but you see the
higher end of Asha range which would be
a very good upgrade phone for those who
have already passed the entry phase they
want Betty experience they want more out
of their phone still they want to have
phone on the budget now we have seven
675 million series 4g phones in active
use and these phones what you see on the
picture are belonging to usher device
family which represents the higher end
of series 40 phones and they are now
rightfully lawfully can be named as
smartphones the jewel of the crown is
asha 311 which I was offering you to
earn after this session and why it is a
jewel of the crown because it has pretty
responsive UI with a swipe feature it
has 1 gigahertz processor Wi-Fi 3G and
you can see here how it works so it
looks very it looks very fresh and when
you hold the phone you don't feel that
this is a cheap feature phone doesn't
cost much it costs slightly above 100
years but it gives you the full
experience of a smart device this slide
is a
duplicates in our deck so you see that
we have pretty good looking
well-functioning phones what else we
need for those phones we need developers
to develop good applications for the
phones and our target is that when the
phone is hitting the market it has
already a lot of goodies there and more
important that as a store has a lot of
applications to be downloaded by you
when you buy the phone so what you see
here is a very popular angry bird game
which is currently pre-loaded to those
phones you saw in the previous slides
and moreover these phones they have
so-called Electronic Arts gift packets
42 applications that are downloadable by
users for free within 60 days after
purchasing the phone if you think that
you are a parent of a kid for whom you
don't really want to spend money on
downloading applications this is the way
you get enough to be entertained for
months and months after you get the
phone this trend shows how download rate
grows in a Nokia Store so the
applications that are published to nokia
store by developers they are living
happily there and not being forgotten
and abandoned by developers the are very
well discovered and this chart shows
this curve shows the very good trend
upwards for series 40 application
download in the store we now have hit
five billion downloads in nokia store
cumulatively and the number of daily
downloads has hit 16 million already I
don't want to concentrate on these
figures too much because I keep getting
those numbers updated all the time and
the numbers are rising and we do
celebrate the Stars you
the store you can see that three
developers have passed 100 million of
downloads this is India game speaker
brothers and i know'd and we have plenty
of developers who have smaller numbers
of downloaded downloads in their in
their pockets like one developer has
reached 75 million downloads three
developers over 50 millions of downloads
and what is important that as I was
saying before developer applications
that are uploaded to nokia store they
are not sitting there being forgotten
eighty percent of nokia store traffic
converts to download so the question
would be how developers can make money
once they publish applications to the
store the old conventional way would be
to charge right away upstart before
application can be downloaded the more
than way is somewhat different the word
is called freemium applications one way
is to use advertising and with our
partner interactive it's very easy to go
to their website and download the sdk
with minimal effort you can start
cashing on your applications by letting
users download the application for free
and letting users to con el on side of
playing your application to view the
advertisements I pretty much the same
way as it happens on the web then
another way is to use in-app purchase
API which is part of nokia sdk for java
and which can utilize quite a lot of
different use cases you see a couple of
them on the slides one is a travel
application which offers you part of
application for free and part of
application is a premium content here in
this case
a currency converter and the world clock
are free parts of the application but if
application user wants to check flight
timetables and that part needs to be
paid for more sophisticated use cases
here would be downloading any kind of
digital goods of the application game
levels or any armory in the game you
just name it this you also can do a very
simple a simple way simple approach here
is trying by so you see the application
here which allows you to play it for a
while and enough to some time it asks to
pay for it user gets hooked enough with
the applications and he pays more than
that you can mix and match this at you
can mix and match these solutions this
application shows to you that first ones
you download it you will be watching
advertisements you get both of
advertisements you want to get rid of
them then it will offer you to buy the
application so this is a combination of
in-app advertising and in-app purchase
and how all these monetization solutions
are doing in-app purchase you can see
here there is a change of the game
earlier it was premium content that rule
to the download world and now you can
see that the freemium content is
actually doing much better than the
premiere one and on the in-app
advertising the trend is going very
steeply upward so you can see that the
estimate is that by 2015 the revenues
would be are counting to 8.5 billion of
years and top publishers are generating
30 to 50 k per month in nokia store by
using the monetization solutions that we
provide one example is twist mobile they
are using in-app advertising solution
and you can see
that they are making with their
applications and with in-app advertising
about one thousand dollars in daily
revenues this is quite a big number i
would say and pretty the average a
successful company we have very good
download figures in the store as well so
you have seen we have phones we are
working hard to get good applications
for the phones so what shall we do next
next if you want to develop applications
for series 40 phones you need to decide
whether you which witch technology you
want to develop on we give an offering
here it is java or web apps if you have
a social networking type of application
you have any shopping type of
applications newsfeed anything that
requires heavy back end processing them
probably best way is to go for web apps
if you have application rich on the
graphics some kind of productivity tool
application that would have a native
look and feel then this is Java on the
Java site now the newest SDK is version
2 dot 0 and it has a lot of enhancements
there we have new enhanced api's for
touchscreen we have integrated
eclipse-based ID into the sdk we have
device sdk manager that will help you to
navigate across all the SDK versions we
are currently supporting the lightweight
you're a toolkit has been also
integrated into our tool bundle we have
on own device debugger we have reached
code examples and documentation to
support you on the API side we have new
gesture api's a lot of API is related to
the touch you I the standard API mobile
sensory ap is now supported
for new devices and three C's GS are 256
Maps API is also part of that SDK and on
the resources side if you go to
developer nokia com you can train
yourself very well and get your
questions answered by browsing through
the resources SDK itself can be
downloadable from series 40 java page or
from various parts of developer nokia
site then on the getting started we have
step-by-step guide whichever way you
choose you want to use Eclipse ID or you
want to use netbeans we have
step-by-step guide and each step is
accompanied by a video the same resource
page has a lot of guides with videos and
documentation for different tools that
we are providing then from the tools
page you can again download the SDK you
can see which api's are supported by
which platform release you can download
older SDKs from there as well the
documentation contains comprehensive
resources not only the Java developer
library but all the aids to help you to
publish application comprehensive design
guidelines which are important very
important if every if you want
application to be well performing and
successful the learning resource has
plenty of training videos and also
webinars we run three webinar sessions
per week starting from the fall and you
can always you can always if you miss an
upcoming webinar you can visit the page
and see where we are now recording and
view the slides download the slides so
this is a very good learning resource
for you on various topics of coding
application performance application
design code examples will help you
because not
only it is a picture but there is the
replica that you can install on your
phone and test it for yourself and the
there is a source code there as well and
then the videos are the training videos
the videos which we're developers tell
their experience of developing
application and so on so forth so as a
summary you have heard that we have very
big install base of devices there in the
market and we are working hard so that
momentum of series 40 is maintained and
we always keep coming up with new
exciting phones for the budget users
once again I was I'm stressing it and we
are working hard to support developers
by releasing new tools better improving
productivity of developers so I guess
that is all I want you to say and if you
have any questions simply shoot
well we have several ways turn to
address the challenge I think that none
of them is perfect and but when you put
them all together probably they do a
decent job one is on device debugger we
are working to improve that one then you
have remote device access service if you
go to developer nokia page then you will
be able to find remote device success
which is a big room with huge amount of
phones from all nokia platforms these
are physical phones which you can book
by yourself upload your applications
through the web tool and you can do the
testing there well then again of course
the emulator which helps you with with
the testing you put this together it
gives you a decent way to do the testing
not at the moment I think you would have
to do some script by yourself
that big
because of the same platform in most
cases you would expect the application
behavior to be more or less the same
across all of these devices but when it
comes to non Nokia based devices again
that's where there is black of
standardization and that's where your
real challenges how do you quote your
application across all of those devices
so just like the Nokia lab you have just
don't like take the world Nokia lab the
verbatim but they lab from Nokia there
are these independent device providers
device on lease or device on rent such
as device anywhere or perfecto mobile
and you can access their devices in the
labs and they typically have the devices
in about seven days when the new models
hit the market so if you are trying to
target some recent models you are you
have good bets of finding those devices
there and to your point about automation
of tests yes that's a real challenge and
that's where you have two ways the pros
and cons every coin has two sides so if
you are trying to tour a target a wide
set of devices and have a wider device
space for your applications you have to
combat these challenges or you go after
one device and just look at the install
base for that device so automation at
this time is not a perfect solution
given the differences in the platforms
given the differences in the API is that
the various platform interest ride
gomez so I haven't personally tried out
that solution and I cannot really claim
the accuracy of or cannot say if it's
one hundred percent automated but maybe
it's a good step forward in terms of
getting or trying to get semi automated
tests
same
what is it
how you can explain the meaning this is
an Indian word something bright and
happy any more questions so it really is
the hope for less expensive devices to
be similar to our as functionally rich
as the higher end devices is that what
it means RIA so if no more questions
want this nice
so now the exercise I wanted assignment
I wanted to give you so we have nice
t-shirts here so if you wear this
t-shirt and take photos around and send
me at least ten photos of you with happy
face wearing this t-shirt then you will
be able to get this nice phone in return
I will not give it to your right now it
will be sent to you by post you will
need to send me videos or photos wearing
this t-shirt are not less than 10 photos
or videos to place is specified one must
be Oracle booth trying those phones and
other I would set union square I I don't
know whether this tent is still there it
should be there with the error and
country so the rest place is up to you
doesn't have to be always looked in
those boring rooms the weather is cool
there if you are in fisherman wharf
taking photos with this t-shirt it will
work if you are drunk to this with this
 this will not be accepted hahaha so
Anna are you going to post these
pictures and videos on your website and
developer forums I think we will make a
mesh up out of this material we will
post to our website so popularity in
return as well in addition to the phone
anyone wants to participate I will so
medium here
so if all of us are able to thank you if
all of us are able to send you ten
