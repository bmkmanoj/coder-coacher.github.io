requests arriving to your api's or out
them to different resource paths would
you like to service only those requests
with a custom header without changing
the backend implementation of your api's
bob sherwood his api's get too many
invalid requests which is degrading the
performance of his service he needs to
limit the access to his api's and route
some incoming requests
luckily Oracle API platform cloud
service can help this service will help
Bob to configure API policies so that he
can manage the traffic interfaces and
request routing of his api's Bob needs
to add and configure three policies for
his API those policies are API rate
limiting header validation and resource
based routing once the configuration is
complete he needs to deploy or redeploy
the API to a gateway and validate the
applied policies here bob is implemented
API s through the API platform cloud
service management portal from the API
implementation page Bob applies an API
rate limiting policy to limit the
incoming requests to his API this policy
enforces a limit on the total number of
requests during a specified time
interval from a different policy
category Bob applies a header validation
policy which enforces the presence of
values in the HTTP header of the
incoming requests in this case the
policy passes any requests with a tenant
ID header that has a value of 1 or
greater
if the request doesn't include the
header or if it includes it with an
invalid value then it's rejected next
Bob applies a resource based routing
policy which helps him to route the
request to different service request
URLs when the users send a request to
the estimate resource path they'll be
redirected to the corresponding service
containing the estimate resource once
the policies are applied Bob proceeds to
save the changes before deploying his
API to a gateway he's able to redeploy
the latest iteration of his API because
he has the proper grants to the Gateway
after the API is deployed with the new
pala
sieze Bob validates and by using a rest
client because he forgot to include the
header and value the header validation
requires he gets an error once the
header is included with the proper value
the result displays in the corresponding
output from the implemented API when the
users send a request to the estimate
resource path they'll be redirected to
the corresponding service containing the
estimate resource when Bob sends too
many requests and reaches the defined
limit the API rate limiting policy is
triggered and rejects the next incoming
requests until the invocation rate has
dropped below the limit to learn more
