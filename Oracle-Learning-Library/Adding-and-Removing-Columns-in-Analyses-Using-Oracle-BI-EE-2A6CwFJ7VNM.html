using oracle bike
I'm a sales manager and I want to change
my team's brand revenue by adding new
columns to create a fulfillment analysis
I want to add product type channel build
units discount value and quarter
previously I added a target revenue
column that I now want to remove first I
must find the analysis I enter brand
revenue in the search field and then I
click search the brand revenue analysis
is displayed in the catalog page I click
Edit I want to include the time
component first so I add quarter to the
table view I expand the time folder in
the subject areas pane and then I drag
quarter to the left of brand in the
table view
next I want to include product type in
the table view I expand the products
folder in the subject areas pane and
then I double click product type product
type is added to the right of the target
revenue column I position my mouse
pointer above the product type column
the cursor changes to a crosshair I
click and drag the product type column
to the left of the revenue column when I
see the vertical colored bar I release
the mouse button
product type is positioned properly in
the table view I want to include channel
in the table view I expand the orders
folder in the subject areas pane and
then I double click channel panel is
added to the right of the target revenue
column I click and drag the channel
column to the left of the revenue column
channel is positioned properly
I want to remove the target revenue
column from the table view I know that
if I right-click the target revenue
column that I can exclude it from the
table view by using the exclude column
menu option excluding the column in the
table view will not remove it from the
analysis and it will therefore be
available for inclusion and other views
that may be added at a later time I know
that I'm not going to need this column
for this particular analysis so I decide
to delete it rather than exclude it I
click the criteria tab I click the
options button for the target revenue
column and then I select delete
finally I want to include the two
measures build units and discount value
I expand the revenue metrics folder in
the subject areas pane and then I double
click build units build units is added
in the selected columns area a double
click discount value discount value is
added in the selected columns area a
need to save the updated analysis as a
new analysis I click save as I ensure
that this analysis is saved in the
company shared products folder in the
name field I enter fulfilment by quarter
and then I click OK I want to review the
analysis I click the results tab now
that I have created this new fulfilment
analysis that includes order detail I
can evaluate our product fulfillment
effort and develop a strategy for my
team to better meet our customers needs
and increase our profits thanks for
watching
