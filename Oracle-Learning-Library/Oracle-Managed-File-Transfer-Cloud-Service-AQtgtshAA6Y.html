all over the place that use different
FTP implementations and products I'm
worried that those services might not be
highly available managed monitored or
secured
what if sensitive customer data is
unencrypted when it gets transferred in
and out of the enterprise you need
Oracle managed file transfer cloud
service it's a high performance
standards base end-to-end managed file
gateway it features design deployment
and monitoring of file transfers using a
lightweight web-based design time
console that includes transfer
prioritization file encryption
scheduling and embedded FTP and SFTP
servers it consolidates data transfer
into a centralized architecture where
you have complete visibility to all the
file transfers this architecture is
cluster Abell
schedulable and available 24/7 it makes
your file transfers highly available
easy to manage easy to monitor and
secure
what about upgrades hits the cloud
service so single click upgrades and
patches are managed automatically and it
supports the same secure FTP protocols
you're currently using so nothing
changes for your business partners so
does it work with other Oracle products
of course it's tightly integrated with
Oracle SOA cloud service or LAN Gration
cloud service or quite
the management enterprise scheduler and
Oracle b2b powerful doesn't require tons
of support its off-the-shelf software
with enough customization capability to
adjust how it behaves to meet our needs
one less thing I have to worry about
it's 100% reliable sounds great I'm off
to learn more at cloud.oracle.com /soe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
