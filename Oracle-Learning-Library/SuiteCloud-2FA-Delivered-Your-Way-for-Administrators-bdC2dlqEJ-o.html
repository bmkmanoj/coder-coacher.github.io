delivered your way in this video we are
going to demonstrate how an
administrator sets up two FA and the
process the user follows to set up their
two FA by using an Authenticator
application using SMS or voice calls or
using a backup code two-factor
authentication allows enforcement of an
additional level of security for logging
into NetSuite to pay is free of charge
and almost zero maintenance costs by
just marking roles as to if a protected
users must set up their phone numbers or
Authenticator applications to log into
NetSuite offline Authenticator
application SMS text messages or voice
calls are all supported delivery methods
for verification codes these can be used
interchangeably along with backup codes
the two FA by phone or Authenticator app
feature will be automatically available
in our mint suite accounts in May 2017
no special setup or enabling of features
is required account administrators or
users with the two factor authentication
based permission must decide which roles
require two fa protection and designate
those as two fa authentication required
roles
in the duration of trusted device column
administrators can specify how often
users will be prompted with the 2fa
challenge in other words how long a
device can be marked as trusted by the
user a balance between security and user
experience must be considered now let's
see how the TFA setup process looks like
from the user perspective after a role
has been designated as to FA
authentication required a user assigned
to that role receives an email the first
time they attempt to login to the - FA
role the email contains instructions and
a verification code for initial login
simply use the verification code from
the email and click Submit after
completing the initial login to a to FA
role a pop-up window opens allowing the
user to select their preferred to FA
method - FA by Authenticator app or - FA
by phone users are allowed to dismiss
the prompt to set up to FA 5 times
before they are required to do so during
this video I'm going to show you how to
set up an Authenticator app as a primary
- FA method and then text messages or
voice calls as a secondary method in the
setup two-factor authentication pop-up
window leave the recommended method
checkbox selected and click Next install
one of the o'the TOTP compliant
Authenticator applications for your
device
using the Authenticator app on your
phone
scan the QR code displayed in the pop-up
window or manually enter the string of
characters shown below the QR code the
essential Gator app will generate a
verification code type the verification
code in the field provided and click
Save now let's set up text messages or
voice calls as a secondary or backup to
FA method so that we can still log in if
our primary method fails in the setup to
add a phone number pop-up window select
the country where your phone service
originates and type the phone number on
which you wish to receive your
verification code from NetSuite or
simply enter your phone number in the
international format using a plus sign
then click send code depending on the
delivery method you selected you should
receive a text message or a voice call
on your phone with the code type this
code in the entry verification code
field in the pop-up window and click
Save when you first set up your two FA
methods
10 backup codes are displayed in the UI
these unique backup codes can be used to
log in to a to us a role when you are
unable to receive a code using your
Authenticator app or phone each backup
pro can be used only a single time treat
backup codes as securely as you would
treat a password this is the only time
these 10 unique codes are displayed in
the UI
you cannot retrieve these from the
system after you close this window
now that I have much of a setup I want
to show you how to use it let's log in
again to log in with the role that
requires two FA you must first enter
your email address and password after
this information is verified you are
prompted for a verification code use
your assent occator app to obtain a
verification code we've set it up as our
primary - FA method or switch to use
your phone to request a code by text
message or voice call we've set it up as
a backup to FA method or use one of your
backup codes let's enter the
verification code generated by the
assent occator application and mark this
device is trusted so I will not be
presented with the - of a challenge for
30 days when logging into NetSuite from
this device
use the settings portlet whenever you
need to reset your to Fe settings
generate new - if a backup codes or
manage your trusted devices thanks for
