addresses the issue of management of
similar systems at scale many customers
now have hundreds if not thousands of
components in their data center and
clouds and they have trouble managing
them consistently Enterprise Manager 13c
has a new feature called drift and
consistency management which directly
addressed the issue of managing
consistency at scale in short there are
two types of consistency management that
you can do in tortora consistency
monitoring and intra target consistency
monitoring in short inter target
consistency monitoring or here shown as
drifted targets is the comparison on an
ongoing basis at scale between a very
large number of similar targets of the
same target type consistency management
is a simple way to ask Enterprise
Manager to leverage the target model it
has for things like composite targets
database machines composite applications
cluster databases and ask it to compare
targets of a similar type within that
type of container for this demonstration
we'll just focus on these drifted
targets or inter target comparisons I'm
gonna click on this 45 to drill in and
see a little bit more detail about what
these 45 targets are that have been
drifted or have drifted as I drill into
the results here I get a further
breakdown of the types of targets that
are being monitored for drift and as you
can see it it applies or you can use
this for simple targets like database
instances and hosts as well as system or
composite targets things like you can
you can use this to manage the
consistency of applications throughout
their lifecycle so you can compare the
dev staging QA and production
environments of a very complex
application and ensure that the
configuration of those applications that
you require throughout those lifecycle
environments is the same
let's drill a little bit further into
this ice a fictitious iPad I seen here
to see which that there is one target
one application lifecycle environment
that has a drift in it and two others
that are not drifted or consistent in
this case so drilling a little bit
further you can see I get a little bit
further detail and the results I can see
that one it's actually the QA life our
application that is has one drift or one
inconsistency in its configuration and
the two others the staging in the
development are the same so just for
illustration purposes let me show you
something here let me just turn on the
entire stack as well as the all of the
four life cycle environments so you can
see that for the first time now an
enterprise manager we're showing results
of configuration comparison side-by-side
regardless of the number of targets that
you're comparing now an enterprise
manager 13c you can see them from left
to right side by side and then you can
also see that here I have the entire
stack modeled for this composite
application consisting of host database
listener web logic etc and you can see
that the one target or the one component
of this application in the QA
environment that is drifted is the
database so let's drill in a little bit
further to take a look and see what
those the difference actually is and
with one click here I can actually see
that the actual difference is the fact
that the initialization parameter job
queue processes is set to a thousand in
the reference which was my production
environment and is actually 900 in the
test environment or this QA environment
now of course detecting these
inconsistencies across large number of
targets in your cloud is an important
first step but it is the only only the
first step in the process the next step
will actually be to remediate any
detected differences and for
initialization parameters you can
actually remediate directly from within
the
application by clicking on this
synchronized button right here and it
will actually synchronize the reference
value the value from the reference
target to the target here on the right
hand side that's not equal with a with a
simple clickable button and following a
few steps in the wizard
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
