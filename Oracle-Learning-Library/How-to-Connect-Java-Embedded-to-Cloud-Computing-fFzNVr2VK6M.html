how to connect java embedded to the
cloud computing and i'm hickman wong i'm
from the java embedded group i'm one of
the engineers that works on java
embedded libraries and the virtual
machine before we start out we have our
typical safe harbor statement this is
for informational purposes and here's
our agenda for today
first i'll be going over an introduction
to cloud computing with embedded devices
so you're at an oracle conference you're
at JavaOne you probably are already
aware of the cloud computing how many
people by a show of hands have heard of
the term cloud computing or know what it
is okay so I don't have to go too far
into detail that and then I'll go into
introduction of Java embedded technology
how many people have heard of or saw my
previous talk on job-embedded ok just
some so I'll spend a little time a
little more time on job-embedded and
then I'll tie the two together of what
does it mean to program in Java embedded
versus Java SC desktop for instance a
lot of people are more used to Java EE
for server or Java SE for DES desktop
computing so I'll explain the
programming differences specifically for
the java embedded environment and then
we'll talk about the techniques used to
connect job-embedded to cloud computing
and then there are tools that are
available to do to help you with that
and there are software suites that
enable you to do that connection to the
cloud and then I'll show a demo at the
end of how that software is used and
then open it up for questions and
answers and along the way if we'll keep
this informal if you have any questions
please interrupt me raise your hand and
let me know what your question is and
then I can answer it directly then as an
overview and since most of you know what
cloud computing is this is this is old
news to you this is just the definition
is using computer resources such as
hardware or software anything connected
to your hardware like peripherals that
are
delivered as a service over the Internet
or over a network it might even be a
private network to your client and the
typical types of services that you know
about our software as a service so an
example is Gmail if you want to use
Gmail as your mailing system you're not
going to run software on your actual
tablet or your laptop PC you're going to
access Google's mail server and all that
software instead of Outlook running on
your PC all that software is running on
the Google server so that some back-end
data center or over the cloud is going
to run that software for you and on your
device you only need a simple HTML
browser so that's the whole big point of
cloud computing as everybody knows it's
allowing all your software to run over
the network on it on the cloud instead
and it's interesting because it doesn't
have to be just a program like a mailing
program it can be an entire platform so
that's what you've heard during the
Oracle OpenWorld that there's also
platform as-a-service for cloud
computing so instead of just Gmail
running on the Google server you have an
entire Java VM running on Oracle's
back-end server and you're going to put
jar files there over the network on that
server to run for you not on your PC not
on your iPad not on your tablet it's
going to run on a Java VM across the
network so that's platform as a service
that makes it more flexible of course
you could put anything there not just
Gmail you could put your own
applications your own EE applications
anything you want is run on a platform
as a service then there's storage as a
service and people know Dropbox so you
would just say hey here's all my photos
my music I'm just going to drop it into
the cloud so there's some disk drive
sitting in on the network somewhere at
Dropbox and you're able to you to
utilize that as a cloud service so again
it's it's leveraging a computer that's
somewhere else on a network in the cloud
and not having to rely on your device or
your client and of course there's gonna
be other things that can be used as a
service not just software platforms or
storage now how does this relate to
embedded and that's that's our specialty
in our division in Oracle is the
job-embedded group we are concerned with
cloud computing for embedded devices so
we're taking the definition of allowing
you to expose your resources in our case
of embedded devices that are delivered
as a service across the network so your
embedded device becomes a mini server or
you know we also call that our micro
server there's plenty of processing
nowadays with arm-based processors on
these embedded devices and there's Linux
running so why not make it a mini server
or embedded server running on the
network and serving up your device as a
service so anything your device can do
measure temperature or measure someone's
heart rate in on a medical device in a
hospital or on an industrial automation
side on the factory floor
this device can now become a cloud
service and not just a device you you
always have to operate and and telnet
into or make some other connection into
it's going to automatically offer its
resources its hardware its software its
peripherals as a service on the network
and so that's what we mean by cloud
computing for embedded devices also
there's a step above just your regular
sensors and medical monitors there's the
concentrator concept in embedded devices
and that allows you to aggregate or to
have a collection of smaller devices and
serve all of those devices up as a
collection and as a service itself so
that in the smart grid world if you have
300 homes in a neighborhood you don't
want to talk individually to each one of
those electric meters in the house
instead you want that neighborhood to be
represented by a concentrator and
that concentrator again will be the
aggregation of 300 homes in that
neighborhood and you would just have to
talk to that one concentrator instead
and that could have more memory it could
be a more powerful CPU on it probably
still are maybe a multi-core ARM
processor and still run Linux on it but
that device is a little heftier maybe it
sits on a telephone pole for the utility
company and not on your meter on each
home so that concentrator can also be a
cloud service or for in our case it's an
embedded cloud service because it's not
a big server running it's not a big iron
T for SPARC server running but it's this
little Linux arm device that looks like
a hub that's running somewhere on a
network and so let's look at a diagram
of what we're talking about here so in
the typical cloud computing this is what
you're doing if you're using Dropbox or
using Flickr or using Gmail you have on
the left hand side your client computer
so it's your laptop computer your iPad
whatever HTML standard browser you're
using it doesn't matter it's talking
that standard protocol to what's in this
right-hand side box and that is a one
single entry point which is a bunch of
servers it could be Amazon's web
services a bunch of clustered services
running on that server that is going to
in its cloud have access to things like
storage so you might have all your
emails stored on there on Google's disk
drives and there's some type of database
that's also on the back end so they can
authenticate yourself and say what's
your password what's your username and
allow you to get on to your account and
then you have all these different
services it might not just be Gmail it
might be your calendar it might be your
task list it might be other things that
these the cluster of servers will allow
you to access so that's typically what
happens in cloud computing is that you
have this very reliable way
of getting to your data getting to any
type of computer resources maybe it's
it's a Java VM running that's as a
platform as a service or anything that a
server can handle is the typical case
for cloud computing and this just
itemizes what we just talked about is
that there's one control one entry point
into a suite of software so you might
have many things human resource software
running on that on the back-end data
center there might be hrs way of doing
performance reviews or doing payroll or
doing your vacation accounting or
expense reports all that is being
controlled through a URL that you go
through with your client and there's no
this means there's no need to install
any type of software on them your iPad
or on your laptop computer you just need
your your your Firefox or your Safari or
WebKit browser that's using that html5
or JavaScript standard that that all
browsers nowadays have and that means
the workload is shifted from burning up
your CPU cycles on your laptop it's
going to be shifted to the backend data
center where it should be
because there's big iron running there
with a big server and that's going to
take the brunt of all the processing
that you need to access your email
access your photos actually access
anything like a Java VM on the back end
the advantages of this again it's easier
to install so there's a system
administrator that's on the backend in
the data center that's watching all that
software 24 by 7 Amazon's watching all
their servers Oracle is watching all our
cloud servers and it makes it easier to
manage also because you don't worry
about your iPad it's it's just got the
Safari Safari web browser on there and
you just have to worry about updating it
from Apple you don't have to install
each one of the HR applications that
you're getting from your enterprise it's
going to be there in the backend and
it's easier to access also so you just
need your username and password most of
the time to authenticate
self the disadvantages are that you're
depending on the network so if if like
at the show here we have Oracle's Wi-Fi
if it's overloaded and is slow you can't
get to your Gmail you can't get to your
Flickr account and that's that's a
problem right off the bat if you don't
have that network connection then also
your data is not local so that means
your data is owned by somebody else and
it depends on who you trust for your
cloud computing if it's a big company
like Oracle then yeah there's a lot of
there's a lot of resources behind that
there's a lot of people working on it
and watching it if it's a smaller
company a start-up if it's Dropbox or
some internet.com but do you know it's
going to be there in five years or ten
years so that data is very reliant on
being there up in the cloud but who
knows what's being done in that data
center as long as you're happy with
whoever is running that datacenter then
it's okay also if if there's a crash on
that that cloud set of servers it's not
just one server but of course like
Amazon they tried to have redundancy and
and all these failover servers that that
kick in when something fails but still
as you've seen in the news amazon's
cloud crashes even though they promise
it will be up all the time because they
have this great design it's going to
happen that that entire cloud is going
to crash and you're not going to be able
to get to your data or worse yet your
customers won't be able to get to that
data so you have to watch out for that
as a disadvantage of cloud computing and
it's the same way an embedded cloud
computing you have one control point or
in our case if you're if you're the
utility company you have one
concentrator that controls all the data
for 300 homes in a neighborhood in a
city so that's one point that you're
going to talk to as a device or a mini
cloud that's going to offer up all that
data for you so there's no need to
install software because the client that
you view into
if you're the utility company and you
want to view into that neighborhoods
data on the concentrator it's just an
HTML browser just like you would do for
your Gmail or for Dropbox and then
there's the workload is shifted also so
that those devices or the internet of
things those billions and billions of
Linux arm embedded processors are
turning away doing some type of
processing this is really important
because you're taking advantage of all
this processing power that's out there
on these small devices and using the
distributed computing model instead of
doing everything in the back end on your
server so this this is meant for many
many types of devices that are mid to
high end that have these specialized
embedded CPUs now that can handle
processing up to that level and the
advantages are again it's easy to
install because you have just your
client talking to a bunch of devices the
devices are managed by either some type
of software that looks at device
management OSGi or some other types of
back-end software and it means it's
easier to access also because you have a
URL or URI that goes to that
concentrator the disadvantages are the
same as what I talked about for for big
cloud computing it's dependent very
dependent on the network and you're
talking about wireless networks in many
cases for embedded devices so you're you
have even another level with Wireless of
things that can go wrong if it's a 3G
network if it's not near a cell tower
and then that data again is on the
device and if you wanted to backup that
data you need to get over the network
and talk to your concentrator otherwise
you won't be able to see that so when
you have downtime on your network then
you have to realize that that data won't
be accessible and then if those devices
crash especially if the concentrator
crashes and you can't talk to any of the
smart meters and in the 300 homes that
present that neighborhood Oh any any
questions so far okay so this is pretty
straightforward also it's each device is
in this diagram is represented by in in
the box on the right hand side a
concentrator or a set of different
concentrators that can do failover type
of redundancy so that when one crashes
and another one picks up and is able to
take over that neighborhood and serve up
the data and then you have all your
devices devices could be smart meters in
that neighborhood and then you have your
database storage so your concentrator
itself can be running a mini database
that it keeps in sync and it just in
case you crash it could recover all that
data for you and if the network goes
down it could also synchronize that data
later on when in when the network comes
back up so that's pretty important is
it's taking the concepts of cloud
computing shrinking it down so that it's
running on a telephone pole somewhere
and then again this is acting as a
control point and the processing is now
spread out you can have all these smart
meters be doing the processing for you
such as figuring out the weather and
figuring out the weather patterns doing
predictive analysis saying hey the
analytics tells me that there's a trend
of heat rising in this neighborhood so
I'm going to ramp up enough power so
that the AC demand is going to be
appropriate for this neighborhood
so all that analytics can be done on
these telephone pole devices not on the
backend server where it's far away and
let's dive deeper into job embedded job
embedded addresses the Internet of
Things making sure that Java runs on a
variety of these billions of devices so
right now we have Java SE embedded and
Java ME embedded running on
multifunction printers voice over IP
phones that's for the enterprise on the
consumer side Java is running on eBook
readers such as the Amazon Kindle
medical equipment industrial controllers
and so that's important because that's
where you see demand for big data
and we're cloud computing for embedded
devices makes most sense then there's
also smartphones and feature phones
that's more on the consumer side again
that is not as dependent or there might
be future business models where you
might figure out hey cloud computing
would make sense on all these consumer
devices - but right now it's it's more
of electric meters and you see that as
one of the items where a smart grid
would make a lot of good use of cloud
computing on these embedded devices and
there's much more there's it's a wide
open field right now where you can
figure out hey if I could run services
on this powerful arm chip on this device
maybe it makes sense to do certain types
of operations there and here's just a
spectrum again of Java that you've seen
at Java one on the left hand side is
servers and that's where the strength
has been for Java over many many years
as Java EE and there's Java SE also
found on the desktop now in the middle
here Java SE embedded is a smaller
footprint so we're shrinking it down to
fit in ten megabytes or more these small
devices where you want the full Java SE
API and in old days we had Java ME CDC
if people are aware of that that was a
subset and it was hard for our
developers to switch their minds around
hey can I use this java.lang API or is
it missing from this Java ME CDC subset
well now we have Java SE embedded and
you don't have to make that mental
switch anymore it's just a full
specification so you just use the same
tools you would use not only that but
I'll show the the suite of software that
we have includes GlassFish so now we
we've shrunk down Java EE to run on
these embedded devices also and so
that's the big deal is that if you want
cloud computing and you want all that
powerful software to do the cloud
computing then we're addressing that
with our new Suites of software from
Oracle and it's worth mentioning that
Java ME since it's a subset of a
specification that's meant for more
vertical markets like TV and
phones so if you need to change a
channel or fast-forward or rewind and
play a video there's Java API is that do
that for you in Java TV API set or if
you want a feature phone to send an SMS
SMS text message or be able to check
your contact list there's another set of
api's for that but what we try to do in
Java as the embedded is give you a
horizontal platform so there's all the
Java API is available that you normally
do for collection classes for generics
for the language doing things like
project coin or in the future project
lambda that's found in Java SE embedded
not in Java ME so that's important if
you want to keep with that latest and
greatest language changes and latest
sets of API is you want a job at SC
embedded any questions there okay so
diving deeper into those flavours of
Java Java SE embedded since it has a
small footprint but full API
specification of Java SC that's great
for large commercial and industrial use
on the factory floor in voice over IP
phones in the enterprise and yes there's
a question here
okay so the question is if it's full
java SE how is the footprint smaller and
that's because we take pieces that
wouldn't make sense on an embedded
system like a headless system and then
we get rid of a WT we get rid of swing
because there's no way to use a TT in
swing and already there that brings it
down significantly so that's a great
question but yes we we do have the spec
where it's going to have take effect
like Java dot Lang java.net Java dot IO
those are all headless api's you can
call them with no problem and they make
sense on embedded device yes right now
the split is is headless there's a
headless Java and Java SE embedded
that's a very small size and then
there's a headful and this might be
appropriate for situations where you
want to have a black box and just embed
Java there without being a full-featured
general platform there's a head full
Java SE embedded that adds in swing but
then of course you get the bigger
footprint there and I think it's might
be 65 megabytes for that type of
environment where you have all the AWT
and swing and then only about 20
megabytes for java SE embedded headless
so that's right now and we're shrinking
it even further down yes our target is
10 for Java sc8 embedded yes there's so
the question was is that realistic to
even shrink it down further to 10
megabytes yes because we're taking a lot
of our knowledge and experience from
Java ME CDC which used to be a subset of
the the full specification and we're
making optimizations in our libraries
that actually the implementation of
libraries can make it shrink down even
further so if we rewrite certain parts
of it break some dependencies that used
to pull in implementations that aren't
really needed in these headless devices
then we can ensure that the smaller size
is going to be
err for you for it to match the ten
megabytes any other questions okay
that's all great great questions it's
it's a little bit out of scope since I'm
talking about cloud computing but it's
good in this part of this section of the
talk because I'm building up to that
what our platform is here the Java and
me
embedded on on the other hand is that's
the subset where we've carved out even
further down to leave out parts of the
API so that it's appropriate for mobile
devices for feature phones and then
there's Java card which is even smaller
that's got the bare minimal set of API s
and specifications so that you could
just run smart card type applications or
machine a machine appropriate for just a
token card to use
there's also cyber-physical systems that
use biometrics to authenticate yourself
using Java card and just to recap it's
Java SCE embedded is that that full
implementation of Java SE specification
but as as mentioned it has those
optimizations that the engineering team
has gone in there and made sure the the
parts that are using up dynamic memory
and-and-and static footprint are shrunk
down so that it's appropriate to fit in
in the smaller devices and we also watch
the ROM usage so that when you store it
on your flash or on whatever storage
device you have on embedded system it's
not going to take up a huge footprint
then and as a result of that when you
cache in all your classes if it has a
small footprint then it's not going to
take up a lot of volatile Ram either
because that gets loaded up also onto
your system in terms of dynamic memory
then we have run time off to
optimizations to make it run fast so we
make sure that the jits are appropriate
that just-in-time compilers are
appropriate for ARM chips and that's
very different these risk-based chips
are MIPS PowerPC are all very different
than what you find with linic
x86 and the multi-core CPUs that you
find that our Intel based on desktops
and now on laptops and tablets so we
make sure that our VM is optimized in
our run time then you get the history of
Java SC which is a proven and stable
platform and it has a huge developer
base so we can look on the LAN line for
form groups to answer questions and we
can have tools such as NetBeans Eclipse
and JDeveloper help our developers for
Java SE embedded because it's all the
same is it's all spec compliant you can
have rapid application development using
those IDE s so that helps out developers
a lot right now and then you have the
goodness of Java you have full
object-oriented programming you have
that virtual machine that's going to run
jar files and bytecode the same way that
you do on desktop so you just take that
one jar file and move it from one
embedded device to another device
embedded device and you have that right
once run anywhere promise from Java and
now on embedded devices also and you
have the memory management and
portability and cross-platform that you
normally get with with the Java language
and these CPUs that are showing up that
I talked about on these higher end
devices they there are ARM chips at our
multi-core so you want your your Java
platform and we do this in Java SE
embedded to be multi-threaded to where a
multi-process aware so that it will run
on these multi-core environments and you
get the Java security and Java
networking that you usually get with
Java SC now for specifically cloud
computing what features from all that I
talked about for a Java SE embedded
would you apply and that includes the
ports because there are a wide variety
of these different CPUs used on embedded
devices nowadays it's not like desktop
or laptops where you only have Windows
you have Mac OS and you have Linux so
you just worry about those three and by
for Java vm's and and you're happy on
small devices you have you have all
these different flavors of Linux you
have the ARM chip you have MIPS you have
PowerPC that's all very different and
meanwhile you have a very small set of
requirements for the memory so we want
to be able to run in ten megabytes of
static footprint or sixteen megabytes of
dynamic RAM use so we want to make sure
that there's a small corner of your
device that where Java is going to run
it's not gonna take up all your
resources on your device since you
normally need drivers and other software
running in the background on your device
sauce at the same time as these cloud
services then what we try to do is pair
down some of the features in the VM also
you will have a serial garbage collector
not not both serial and parallel because
a serial garbage collector makes more
sense on these smaller devices and you
only have the C one client just-in-time
compiler which you really don't need a
server compiler that's on these Linux
ARM chips but we also allow the option
to include the server JIT so if you want
a large full feature configuration for
job embedded in in our case people use
the word embedded to mean software
that's installed on a server so even
though it's not a small device they're
embedding that software to to not get
updated and not be dynamic but just run
as is one dedicated application and
that's what they mean by embedded that
we can use our Java SE embedded
environment to do also but instead of
worrying about the footprint that it
might take up that's available in my
instead of 256 megabytes it might have 4
gigabytes of RAM we tried to run in a
small piece of that so that the other
types of software there might be a CRM
system that runs on that server that
would run in the main memory but we take
up a small chunk of it just running to
monitor that that server and run in the
background and here's different types of
techniques to connect with the cloud in
one view you can say hey maybe the
devices should be the clients so let's
say I had all these irrigation
controllers in different homes and
they're gonna turn on and off the
sprinklers or the lawn these devices
might want to talk to a cloud service
like the weather report so what's the 10
day weather forecasts for this area this
neighborhood and it'll give you know
it's it's not gonna rain for the next 10
days all these devices would go out to
the network and connect with the the
service and say give me the 10 day
forecast and say oh it's not gonna rain
so I'm gonna keep my schedule the way it
is or it might get back a data from the
data set from the cloud service that
says it's gonna rain every single day
for the next 10 days so the irrigation
device would say you know what I'm not
gonna water the lawn for the next week
so that's the devices as the client
they're you're actually consuming the
data that's coming from some big server
or some cloud service that's up in the
internet somewhere that's one view of it
and again just to itemize it the devices
are the consumers of the cloud services
in this technique this means you would
use the typical types of features you
find in Java SE embedded already so you
need web services API so java.net that
URL connection you would connect up with
HTTP type of connection to some web
service for the weather report give your
user ID and password and get back some
XML the 10-day weather forecast with the
XML labels of each day and then you
would have to parse that out figure out
what the the rain forecast would be for
each day and be able to act upon it so
that's pretty simple there's not a lot
of heavy lifting there's not a lot of
extra api's that you would need for the
devices to be consumers of cloud
services and then again just to
summarize that's processing
from the cloud butthere's will flip that
around and instead will say the devices
are the service instead so again this is
more like in the smart meter world where
you have many many many devices that say
that they're using up a certain amount
of power and then you have the
concentrator act as the cloud service so
instead you might be working at a
utility company and you might use an
iPad or some PC or laptop to talk to the
neighborhood cloud services and say hey
I want to take a poll of all these
neighborhoods how much power are your
homes using in your neighborhood so
you're using the devices to serve up
data from that neighborhood there might
be 300 in each one of those
neighborhoods in the city that
concentrator would report back hey
there's heavy demand from all these
people in this neighborhood because
maybe the temperature has gone up and
people are using their a/c devices and
using their a/c to cool down their
houses so the devices report that back
and the utility company says oh I better
increase the the generator here at at
the power plant so that's using the
devices as cloud services and that's
what we find more interesting because
then you use the power of the
concentrator or the devices that are out
there the Internet of Things to do the
processing for you and these whoops let
me see this is just a summary the
devices are the producers of the
services and you need more advanced web
service framework to do this you need
servlets because instead of going out to
some server and using a URL to get to it
you're going to offer up servlets from
your embedded device and you need a web
service framework so some easy way of
saying here's my web service I'm gonna
publish it here's a well-known way of
getting to my data and then you need XML
formatting so you're putting together
all the
these XML tags and all the data that
you're collecting on your device and you
need some type of local storage it's
better if it were a database since you
need that sync ability and being able to
recover if your device ever crash or
rebooted out in the field and this is
offering data to the cloud instead so
this is more interesting it seems like
if if you're doing this they're the
Internet of Things the billions of
devices out there are more interested
are more interesting if they produce
data and what's one way of doing that
with the software and one way to make it
more convenient is that we bundled
together pieces of technology and call
it Java embedded suite for cloud
computing well for cloud computing is
this talk here but it's called
job-embedded suite 7.0 from Oracle and
this allows you to aggregate store and
transmit your data securely to and from
these small devices and that does it
with four components in java embedded
suite we have the runtime which is Java
SE embedded seven and this is the VM and
the class libraries that you normally
would run your java applications then
there's java DB so if you need a way to
store and get to all that data in an
organized way you have a database a mini
database that's on your device and
GlassFish has been shrunk down also to
fit on these smaller memory constrained
devices so you have a glassfish
implementation and you have Jersey web
services and this is just a convenient
way of doing your writing your web
services and developing your web
services I'll show that in the demo
later and we bundled that all together
to run on these smaller devices with
less memory and so where would you find
this useful you would find it useful in
the embedded devices for smart grid
healthcare for industrial automation and
again it's addressing devices with less
memory and lower power CPUs but there
needs to be a network for these this
cloud computing and what we're finding
now is Wireless is becoming prevalent
for
the networking type if you're putting in
on a Power Poll if you're putting a
smart meter on your house you have some
type of either ZigBee or 3g network use
where many many companies are now
piggyback on the the carriers that have
unused bandwidth so Amazon with their
Kindle they piggyback on to the Sprint
3G network they call it whisper net they
just kind of brand it differently
but what it is is the unused part of the
Sprint 3G network and this is pretty
smart on Sprint's behalf because they
said hey not everybody's using this the
3G network it's it's got some unused
portion of it maybe we can resell it and
then they resell it to Amazon and they
are able to have all their Kindles talk
machine-to-machine m2m to the backend
Amazon server to get all the data
updates and all the books that you want
to read it gets downloaded over this 3G
network and that becomes their private
3G network that Amazon uses even though
it's it's a piggyback on top of Sprint
so you you see that in many cases
nowadays is that Sprint or ATT will
offer a part of their spectrum to you if
you want to contract out that and then
you have smaller screens so you have to
worry about the UI making sure that if
you don't have a WT or you don't have
Swing what are you going to do to
interface and show display things to the
user most of the time it's headless so
you don't worry about that but if you
have a multifunction printer you might
want a few buttons so that you can pick
and choose your print job and control it
there then also you have limited input
so you have to make sure you have your
dress touchscreen or a keypad on your
device and so putting it all together
what are the steps now to take java
embedded suite and do the things I
talked about with cloud computing well
you would want to deploy to your devices
and to finally get to that step of
deploying to your devices you would want
to write an application in this case a
Java EE web application and provision it
as
servus so eventually you're going to use
a war bundle or a web application
resource bundle that gets downloaded to
your device and you want to provide it
with a subscription model because that's
normally what you do in cloud server out
computing is that you want to say it's
using a standard web service model and
in our case we're using jersey inside of
the java imbedded suite so that it's a
restful type of service where you can
use the common way of using urls and
HTTP GET and put to be able to access
data and to also send it back and forth
then you need a way to add and
authenticate users if you're using cloud
computing and this can be done using the
java DB that's found on your device it's
got only one password and one user ID
that someone can access into that data
so you want to make sure you have the
proper safeguards in place so that your
cloud computing is is secure and then
you want to enable content so that's
same Java DB that has the username and
passwords in it might also contain all
that data that you're collecting such as
the smart meter has power consumption
data or your irrigation has every time
it turns on it turns off it has all that
data it could be huge amounts of big
data on that embedded device such as on
a factory floor if you're running
telemetry on every piece of equipment on
that factory floor that could be
terabytes of information that each
device collects you can keep it there on
device and not have to use up your
bandwidth and use up all that you burn
up all your wireless connection just
keep that in a Java DB database that's
on your device and do your predictive
analytics on the device and then do a
red flag
when when it's needed only when it's
needed such as asking a service tech to
come over because with predictive
analytics you're seeing that a part is
going to fail within two weeks because
all the data that is being collected is
showing there's a trend of a part that's
going to wear down and eventually fail
so you could do all
kinds of analytics and big data type of
processing on those devices now and so
this is big because people keep talking
about analytics and big data on servers
but we're talking about in our job
embedded group doing this on embedded
devices and distributing that idea of
Big Data to the small devices and then
you want to do the normal thing yes
there's a question is that okay so the
question is is Java embedded suite
running on the device or on the
concentrator normally because
concentrators have a little more memory
not not huge like a server a little bit
more memory maybe 512 megabytes instead
of 64 megabytes and it has a it might be
a bigger processor like armv7 quad-core
processor that that's a better place to
run Java embedded suite especially if
you want Java DB and more and more
storage space you might have instead one
gigabyte of flash memory there instead
the smart meters you want that very very
lightweight and since there's 300 of
them you want to keep the cost way way
down so you might put only 64 megabytes
there and put a very very low powered
32-bit chip there that's a single core
that not not as much would be a place to
run Java embed it's sweet but it's up to
you if you're a developer and you find
hey maybe
distributing Java and that is sweet too
more to push it down to the lower levels
might make more sense in your used case
then you could you could look at our
requirements for job-embedded suite and
see if it matches the the
cost-effectiveness of your device okay
any other questions
okay so there's another aspect of cloud
computing is that you want to be able to
watch all the different services that
you're running you want to be able to
operate on them restart them if
necessary have have a monitor to watch
how it's being used if there's any
security concerns if there's
any breaches and you want to be able to
configure an upgrade send out the newest
versions to all those concentrators and
be able to diagnose and when you have
GlassFish on all these concentrators
then it makes it much much easier
because you can run typical GlassFish
metrics and be able to collect that that
java ee data from your servers your
services running you might be the the
GlassFish web server running or the
version of the application server that's
running that you collect all that data
from so that's very straightforward and
then you want flexible deployment at the
very end you're sending one war bundle
for each of your applications to your
concentrators or your embedded devices
so that they can run as well as cloud
services in this case any questions on
that
ok so here's just a diagram of what I
just said there's a tablet that you have
that you want to connect up to your
concentrators or your your medical
devices on a floor in a hospital each
concentrator on on the floor of a
hospital or a wing of a hospital will be
running that java embedded suite 7.0 and
this goes right to your question here
but if you have devices that are very
very small you might want to run on the
right-hand side there's multiple devices
they might be running Java card or they
might be running Java ME they might be
running just a subset of Java and not
have to do a database there and not have
to do GlassFish running there but they
might be just doing things like a heart
rate monitor that's that's watching a
driver using j'ni and collecting all
that data but then turn right around and
send it to that the nurse's station in
that area has a concentrator and say
here's all the data I'm just taking it
from J&amp;amp;I and native and I'm just giving
it to you as the single set-top box or
Gateway or residential gateway that's
sitting somewhere close by to me and so
that concentrator will have access to
the database or Java DB because it's
running job
it's sweet and take all that data from
the devices and store it then when it's
necessary when it figures out hey
there's a patient dying in room 101
then the concentrator is going to use
the network only then not continuously
streaming but then send bursty messages
saying hey there's alert you should look
at this so that's one of the advantages
of this model is that only on demand
will the concentrator use the network
and let's get into code because this is
a job in one session so we got to get
into a little bit of code this is a
typical way of setting up with Jersey
web service that can act for cloud
computing as as one of the software as a
service and at the very top you see that
there's a path so this would become your
URL if you had IP address 192 dot 168
dot one dot one that slash hello world
would represent this service so you can
have slash Gmail or / Flickr or some
some other services running but this one
is going to go into this Java class and
and how many people have done Java EE
programming before okay a few a few so
this would look very old hat that you're
setting up your you're describing or
using the web application descriptor
language to say what your web service is
and so you're saying this is a hello
world you get to it using that path or
the URL is going to point to this class
and then you see on line six there's a
get declaration this is what's going to
happen if somebody uses a HTTP URL and
pulls information there from your
service what you produce in line nine is
a mime type and in this case I'm just
saying it's text plain and then later on
it's going to do a cliched message which
is going to return HelloWorld so that's
the whole point of this cloud service
but of course you you could
and that's where you add all the meat of
your program is that it would do
analytics there so let's take a look at
how its implemented you first you have
your class where you're going to set up
using your static initializer in line 19
a way of starting up your server so you
want an HTTP server to start up because
you're doing a web service as cloud
computing and this is starting up the
hello world resource as a jersey sample
in this case and so Jersey again is just
a way a convenient way of doing a
restful web service and it just kind of
packages everything together for you and
then in line 25 this is where the class
is going to start up whenever you you
are going through that path and it's
going to start your HTTP server so
that's just like Apache booting up or if
you're booting up Tomcat or something on
the backend it's going to start it up
and then it's going to offer up that
hello world that was the the service
that you're going to get when you're
using a web browser to access it so what
I'm going to do is now demo it on an
actual system and I'm going to switch to
a different monitor here that this is a
device that I have in my hand is a Linux
arm device this is a beagle board a lot
of people were talking about the
Raspberry Pi it's very similar to this
beagle board a beagle board has a Linux
arm v7 processor on it
and it's great for doing prototypes is
great for doing your proof of concept
and then it will directly apply to when
you're ready to install this on on a
system because it's it's already got
that that's standard for Linux arm on it
it's got Ethernet it's got USB
it's got a memory card so everything
about it is just bundled really nicely
and it's the same with the Raspberry Pi
so that you can develop and go and I'm
going to switch over to concentrate on
the screen here this is NetBeans and
again if you wanted to use Eclipse or
you wanted to use JDeveloper that's fine
it's all Java SC so that's that's a good
part of Java SE embedded is anything
that will allow you to develop for Java
desktop will allow you to develop also
for Java SC embedded there's no change
to it and what I did here was I created
this package as a project that is a web
service project so anyone there there's
quite a few people that already have
done Java EE service programming just
create a web service and you're gonna be
off and running on these little tiny
devices like Raspberry Pi or beagle
board if you're using job-embedded suite
and this is showing you exactly the same
way as in my slides you set up a path
I'm just saying generic here so that it
just goes to a URL and then it has some
type of context and it's going to do
some type of get operation and that's it
that's very very small lines of code
very small amount of coding that you
would have to do to say on a get call to
this URL it's going to do this type of
processing I only have one line but of
course you can put all your analytics
here of going to j and i grabbing data
from your native drivers to the
temperature sensor or the heart rate
monitor or the power consumption on a
smart meter do something with it save it
to your database and then return back
since it's a web service each HTML and
that's what i talked about that one
client that is HTML standard client
would be able to to take this and
display it properly so that's that's all
that you need you can also have put HTTP
put do other types of more complicated
data
interaction between your client but get
is it is pretty standard if you don't
have a lot of data to send back and
forth and I'm going to go ahead and run
it
so this builds it in NetBeans and it's
the same way in Eclipse
and it's going to have a deployable war
file and then it shows it running and
that's as simple as you get for a hello
world very straightforward this is going
to the URL and the package or my web
service if you do if you've done Java EE
programming and it gets back this HTML
after doing its processing are there any
questions about this this is typical
Java EE web service programming okay so
now I'll show you how easy it is to
deploy so when you do that build that I
just did inside of NetBeans inside a
NetBeans project you can go to the disk
directory or distribution there's only
one file it's a war file it's got all
your web service description and the the
byte codes and the jar file it's all in
there you take that and you you copy it
over or you push it over you can even
use OSGi OSGi is is a wonderful
framework that you can say push these
out to my 300 devices and that war file
will show up on your device so my device
actually is connected with a serial
connection and let me just clear this
just just so that you can see there's no
tricks nothing up my sleeve here let's
do a cat of the cpu info and it's
showing that it's an arm v6 processor
it's it says I believe it's supposed to
be a 800 megahertz chip so it's showing
bogel mips of about 7:30 and then it's
showing you yes indeed this is a beagle
board the OMAP 3 ARM chip is on here and
it's actually angstrom linux so I think
in our Etsy there's information on an
angstrom version
so it's running angstrom so what what
you do to start up that war file after
you've you've copied it over or OSGi
pushes it over there's a little bit of
formatting here oh I'm sorry
so that you guys bring this up here oh
that's better
so let me go back here and just so that
you saw that okay
so then just show that it was a CPU info
here
that's the BeagleBoard and then i'm
gonna run
that's the angstrom version and then I'm
gonna run the actual war file so the war
file was distributed over here either
OSGi or you pushed it out over the
network with FTP or some other way I'm
going to just start it up just like you
would with a regular class fish host
script and what that's doing is it's
taking the war file it's it's validating
it making sure that everything is is
good and then it's starting up the the
HTTP server and then finally it's going
to deploy the war file so you see that
happening here so as its doing that then
of course you would want to do this
maybe periodically so that you can
update your war files and and have that
be flexible so that if there's any bugs
or any security updates you can make
sure to push that out to your all your
devices and then that in turn will start
up the server here and you can see and I
don't have an Ethernet hub but what you
would do is you would point the same
webpage to your device and instead of
localhost this would be pointed to the
URL and the IP address of your device
and you would see the same thing hello
world but you know since I don't have my
Ethernet hub set up you just have to
take my word for it that this is the
same output you would get I'm gonna show
though
that it is running the war file because
after you're done with it you can't
enter and you can see it's under playing
the war file now the same same thing
that it started up and it's stopping
here you could see it was indeed running
the GlassFish server and now it cleanly
comes out of that so that kind of just
demonstrates how easy it is from
beginning to end of a web service
pushing it out to your device using java
embedded suite to start up that cloud
service and be able to access it over
the network so I'm going to switch over
back to my slides
okay there is a question is there a
tutorial on Java embedded suite on the
website yes we we have more right now
it's a a start getting started guide and
I could I could update either of my blog
or I'll put it somehow with the slides
so that you can access that but if you
if you google or to your favorite web
search engine for Java embedded suite
from Oracle download you should be able
to also find in that same page where you
download the getting started guide they
put a nice web page for that type of
ability that we have a nice license for
it because you can try before you buy
any developer here can just download for
free Java embed is sweet have it running
on a beagle board or raspberry pi
raspberry pi is $35 so to start up and
start developing is is really cheap to
just play around with do your
proof-of-concept but yeah you could try
for free and do your development for
free when you're ready to deploy or if
you have a paying customer then you come
to Oracle and talk to us at that point
but you don't have to worry until then
you can just look at our online guides
and webpages if you have questions on
anything specific then you can come up
and I'll give you my business card and
you can contact me also any other
questions about job-embedded
about the cloud computing model that we
have or okay well I'll be hanging out
here so you can come up if there's
anything else that comes to mind and
this concludes this part of the talk and
I hope you enjoyed the conference thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
