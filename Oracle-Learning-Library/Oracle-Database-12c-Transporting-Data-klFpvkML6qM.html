Oracle Database 12c new feature series
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum
this slide gives you a graphical
overview over this demonstration after
checking some prerequisites you will see
that we take a backup on the source
database which is an 11-2 database on
Solaris then we perform the data
transport with FTP and on the
destination which is it for one database
on Linux we restored recover the files
if needed I mean can perform an Indian
conversion for you depending on the for
transport or to platform clauses so the
first group of tasks which I'm going to
demonstrate will occur on the source
database in my example the view is
database instance is 11 2 on a Solaris
operating system I verify Matt the
machine are you then I perform backups
in we try to online mode a full backup
and an incremental one you can perform
as many incremental backups as you wish
because every time you do that they
become successively smaller finally I
turn the tablespace in to read-only mode
create a final incremental backup so
that everything is in sync export the
metadata and then the demonstration
continues on the destination side in my
Solaris demo environment I execute TCS
age and set the Oracle environment
variables all to be OS logged into
sequel + SSD ba I verify that I have an
11-2 database in read write mode on the
Solaris platform please note the exact
spelling of this entry you
need to use it later in my Solaris
environment I log into Sigma plus assist
EBE
and confirm that my test data exists
when I see that the instance is down ie
it's an idle instance I started my test
table is empty table belonging to the HR
2 user and as you see it has three rules
I want to confirm that that my database
is in archive log mode and here I just
want to show you that that he is to
tablespace is on line on Solaris which
has 11g database and taking a backup of
the ts2 tablespace now I'm taken an
incremental backup and I can take these
backups as often as I wish because the
incremental only takes the changes so
the more often you perform an
incremental backup the smaller the
bigger pieces will become when your
backups are sufficiently small and fast
then set the table space into read-only
mode now I perform the final level one
Beca I'm using the export data pump
utility to export the metadata of for
the TS two tables P we metadata for
tiesto are now exported and I changed
the tablespace t s2 back to read/write
the slide summarizes the tasks that we
just completed on the source database
now I'm switching to the destination the
was the L instance version twelve one on
Linux and I will show you all the tasks
shown on the slide in the Linux
environment I confirm my environment
variables then I navigate to the data
pump directory and I FTP from the
solaris all the files that I need
in your auric a 12-1 environment connect
to our men and use the restore command
with the new clothes from platform as
you see here in the slide
so you successfully restored the full
backup to the new location
next we apply incremental backups so
here is you see we use the recover from
platform command and it is finished and
we are applying the last of the
incremental backups which is done
already logged into Sigma plus is sis
DBA create the user HR to with this
default password so now you have created
the schema owner of the source data on
the target database and now the import
and the job is finished
finally confirming secret Plus that the
tablespace exists so here you see the
result we transported the TS to
tablespace from the Solaris environment
into the Linux database and here you see
the test data after the data transport
the tablespace is in read-only mode and
when you verify that the content is ok
as we did you can set it to read write
if that's what you wish and as you see
the tablespace tears to is online again
which means in read write mode this
slide shows you the steps that we showed
you in this demonstration we had started
with our 11:2 database on Solaris and
performed the backup and then also the
class manual export of the metadata if
you use this transportation of data
between databases 12 through another 12
then you would not need to perform the
semi manual X we transported the data
with FTP from Solaris to Linux and then
used the restored recover commands to
import and apply the new tablespace the
tablespace arrived in read-only mode and
after verifying that the data arrived we
changed that
space to read right thanks for watching
