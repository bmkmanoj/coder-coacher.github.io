I'm going to be showing you a handy way
to test the rules that you've created in
a rule set this demo is principally for
people that have been doing the OB PM
implementation course but anybody who's
interested in having a look at how to
use enterprise manager to check which
rule fired should benefit from this demo
so let's get started
first of all let's look at the rules
that you've just created in BPM studio
well it's five rules unless you can see
there's three conditions so it gets
quite complicated and there are a number
of actions now of course it would be
very possible to basically run through
using workspace the process and try to
figure out exactly how the process will
route as it goes from beginning to end
but you'll find it's much better at the
start to find out just if the right rule
is firing and then perhaps you can go
later and find out if the process is
routine correctly let's look at rule
number four so you can see that for rule
number four the effect of this kind must
be greater than zero point nine of
course that means that that's also
greater than the pre-approve discount so
condition one will be false and the
total net revenue must be less than a
hundred and fifty thousand so those are
the two things that we need to make a
little note on on our piece of paper and
that's what we'll be putting into when
we go to workspace okay so here we are
logged on on the workspace as John
Fenimore Cooper I'm sure if he was
around today he'd be making comte's he
had demos too okay so what we're gonna
do is create an instance well now we're
gonna have a look in the instance and
what we want to do remember those
figures we're gonna make the total net
revenue oh let's make it a hundred and
twenty thousand and then we're gonna
make the effect of discount I wonder
what that was do I still remember it
let's try one point one think this is
gonna work let's submit it
and there it goes so to check if the
rule fired we're going to log into
Oracle Enterprise Manager and we're
gonna log in as WebLogic let's do that
right now and first of all of course we
want to find that application so let's
just scroll down yeah there it is sales
quote we click on it and here we can say
there's a number of stale instances but
we can be pretty sure since we're
testing on our own machine and we're
developing on this machine and nobody
else is around that the last instance is
the one that we just created
that's a right-click now the interesting
thing here is we can see everything this
happened at instance so far obviously
it's been created we can see that it's
gone through and to quote details that's
where we put in those values remembered
was 140,000 and 1.1 it's now in business
practices review which indicates to us
that actually that routing is working
correctly
but what we're most interested in is
what rule fired and we can find that out
by simply clicking on approval rules the
decision service component and now let's
have a look and lo and behold we can see
that rule 4 as we predicted is the one
that fired very handy so let's have a
last check to make sure that we really
did but in the right conditions for real
for yes we put in 1.1 for condition to
effect the disk kind and I believe we
did put in 140,000 which is less than
150,000 for condition 3 which is was the
total net revenue so we should have
expected rule 4 to fire and indeed it
did so everything is working as we would
like it to that's it from me Kenny
Somerville I hope you've enjoyed and
found this demo useful and I'd like to
leave you with the trip to earth alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
