oracle software can run better on oracle
hardware this global company knows
quickly that opscenter can drive their
interaction with their fleet of x86
servers they've been able to cut down on
deployment times drive up consistency
and be more efficient with their
administration staff with opsin are
being included in the Oracle premier
support for hardware it offered this
global company a way to lower their
total cost of ownership on their server
equipment in a few specific ways the
first benefit they noticed was
deployment times opscenter allowed them
to capture how they want it to deploy
their servers very quickly they could
connect service processor configuration
to raid controller configuration to
firmware configuration to OS and
application configuration by leveraging
this knowledge capture they were able to
cut down on deployment times and drive
up consistency here we see a typical
deployment plan the raid card
configuration gives me full option on
how I want my onboard disks to be
configured
next op center allows me to house all my
configuration for my operating system in
one easy OS profile here i have my
kickstart finished grips and how I want
my volumes and my file systems and
network interfaces to be configured
configuration doesn't stop after the
operating system I can very quickly
configure the bios I can go in to
pre-install and post install scripts I
can install additional software and I
can even leverage other technologies
from Oracle such as K splice ops center
offers me the configuration awareness
and observability that I need in a
lights-out data center whether that be
on the Oracle sunblade 6000 which houses
the power of the Intel CPU on our Sun
blade x 60 to 70 series or you could be
using an engineered system built from
the same x86 servers you know and love
here we can see where the server is
positioned in the rack we can jump over
to that server and see its relationship
with the other components in the
environment such as storage and
networking or maybe you're leveraging
our rack series wherever the case may be
ops center will help you identify the
field replaceable unit and track down
their faults
you also have full serial console access
through the lights-out management ports
on all of our x86 servers energy
analysis is right at your fingertips as
you can dive very deep into relating
server performance to serve our energy
consumption we can also examine the in
and out temperatures and the fan rpm
speeds helping you diagnose hot spots in
your data center we have summaries of
firmware across all components that make
up your solutions from Oracle we can
take energy a step forward and start
examining it at the rack level through
the power distribution units we can see
how servers within the rack are
consuming power and relationship to
their neighbors as you can see ops
center offers quite a bit of cereal and
through information here we offer a very
simple report interface that allows you
to extract the information you need to
do intelligence analysis opscenter also
helps you leverage your my Oracle
support contract automatically
downloading many software components
such as firmware for all Oracle servers
very rapidly you can use those firmware
downloads to deploy out firmware images
across your entire x86 fleet by simply
grabbing the logical grouping we can
quickly see which servers are not
applicable to this particular firmware
image but we can also see which ones are
compliant and which ones are not
compliant
opscenter allows me to capture my BIOS
configuration as a server boots there's
quite a bit of configuration that takes
place in the f10 f12 and f9 menu choices
option allows us to capture many of
these boot parameters and push them
across the entire enterprise not only is
BIOS configuration captured but also
service processor configuration I can
quickly grab a service processor take a
back up and use it as a configuration
profile thus driving configuration
reliability steps further opscenter has
a extensive event console I can see
across my data center which faults are
affecting my business services here a
faulty component will show up and a
service request will automatically be
opened through an integration with
automatic service request service
program ops center will automatically
open service requests and help you
replace field replaceable units at a
much higher rate opscenter is an all
about hardware we also have application
awareness through an integration with
our plugin through enterprise manager
cloud control here I can see that all
the targets running on the box I have a
live event feed into how those
applications are performing I can click
on process analytics and go deeper and
see a connection between the individual
processes and the business services that
they provide opscenter also allows me to
pull my server resources together I can
declare that certain hardware in my
environment will be used to perform a
business purpose they will share
networking storage and I will offer them
to my users in a more efficient manner
these pools will be driven by dynamic
policies ops center provides placement
policies and auto balancing policies
this will ensure i'm using my server
resources in the most efficient manner
possible
those dynamic poles will power my
virtual data centers virtual data
centers also known as clouds enabled me
to allocate resources out to accounts
here we see a cloud for quality and test
it's made up a network storage server
pools and accounts the accounts are
allocated CPU memory and storage
resources users then are assigned to
accounts here we see an application form
that has three virtual servers running
and we see the servers that are
providing the CPU and memory for this
account through deployment acceleration
configuration management lifecycle
control observability application to
disk awareness Moss automation and
infrastructure as a service enablement
this global company has taken their
Oracle x86 servers to a new level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
