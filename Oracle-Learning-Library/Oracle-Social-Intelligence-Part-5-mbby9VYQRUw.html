were happening in Central Europe we had
to involve local partners and but we
found out that there is a easy way how
we can plug those modules those language
packs let's call them or natural
language natural language processing
bags inside the solution so what we are
expecting from each of the partners is
to take the if the the message for
example and decompose it to the RDF
structure which is being used by us
later on and in this structure we
obviously in try to get as many details
entities named entities from the from
the from the count from the particular
message we are also trying to we do have
in Endeca sweet we do have a product
which is called this is product
delivered and I think by one of our
partners called like solid discs for
example if Alexa it exists that's the
name of it and this this is especially
useful for English for example
legalities can not only decompose the
message and extract named entities but
can also of provides you a sentiment
indication for the message so if this
message is particularly dangerous or not
for us we used several other different
technologies but legs oolitic or limbu
these guys are also doing this this and
I think they are based in in in in in
Dallas so limbu is doing great job
decomposing the text and structuring in
the RDF format and there are also others
who are doing this so but this is not
something that it's in our area of
interest let me say like this because
this is too much dependent on the
language and and two outs a specific and
needs to be handled by the right people
usually universities usually some
academic organizations have their own
skills and people for doing this kind of
job
yeah well it's it's at the moment we are
we a little bit over simplified the
reality so we were doing this in the
batches we took the data and we were
pushing them into the fan into big data
appliance then we did the processing in
reality we would like to native this to
be done almost in real time so at least
near real time there is another flow
which most likely of processing which
most likely so on the architectural
slide which is specifically going to be
implemented by oap so we would like to
extract the most dangerous patterns and
encode those in IP so Oracle even
processing engine and Oracle with cql
and amount of necessary customizations
maybe not customization but
parameterization it's able to detect
patterns and dangerous patterns in the
text as it arrives so here we can even
assume that it's a real time as soon as
the data are in the system they can be
processed by NLP engine and it really
it's really fast so so we found out that
it's not extremely complicated obviously
it is complicated but if you do this in
the right way if you do have right argh
actually if algorithm LP then it's
starting to be really performant so with
this results that we achieved I don't
recall plastic numbers but I can give
you for for example for polish which is
probably from again more complex but we
really reach decent decent results and
then those results are passed to the FIP
and this is this is a cult of
the M of this partner with with with
with two branches it's if and now it's
it's popular in big big data word so
when you store the design pattern when
you store the data in the same time in a
data reservoir but also you are
providing the data for a real time
processing lambda yes that's the name
lambda bros dream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
