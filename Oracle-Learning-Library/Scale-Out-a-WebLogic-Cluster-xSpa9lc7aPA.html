cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to use
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c to add capacity to an existing
WebLogic cluster by provisioning a
managed server onto a new host
that isn't already associated with the
domain or the cluster this video is
applicable to Oracle Enterprise Manager
cloud control 12c release 4 with Fusion
Middleware plugin release 12.1.0 point 7
this demonstration assumes that the
destination host target for this
scale-out operation has already been
discovered and that a management agent
is already installed on it
by default this procedure will create
the same middleware home directory on
this destination that is also on the
source host this location must either
not exist on the destination host or be
empty the host running the source
administration server requires 1
gigabyte of free disk space in its
working directory the destination hosts
must contain sufficient free disk space
to store the cloned middleware home
along with the same amount of disk space
for the working directory for example if
the source middleware home is 3
gigabytes each destination host requires
at least 6 gigabytes of free space these
working directories will be cleaned up
after the deployment procedure has
successfully completed in addition to
having enough free disk space this
deployment procedure requires write
permission to all working directories as
well as write permission to the new
middleware home on the destination hosts
the administration server for this
domain as well as the managed server to
clone must both be up and running
furthermore this domain
not be in edit mode and finally this
demonstration assumes that if you want
to front-end these new servers with a
web server like Oracle HTTP server then
this target must already be discovered
in Enterprise Manager in order to scale
out a domain I login to Enterprise
Manager as an administrator who has been
granted the provisioning designer role
from the targets menu select middleware
in this example I will scale out an
existing domain that is running Oracle's
so a suite
from the target menu locate the
provisioning actions
you
on the source page I can optionally
modify the default working directory
location remember that this location
must have sufficient free disk space on
the source and destination hosts I
choose one or more host targets to be
the destination for this scale-out
procedure these hosts will run new
managed servers in our existing cluster
a list of all
and servers in the source domain is
displayed for convenience I clone an
existing server alternatively I could
add and configure a new server from
scratch most of the default
configuration for the clone server is
sufficient for my environment
but I will change the default server
name I also must specify a listen port
you
next I choose an existing Oracle HTTP
server target these new managed servers
will be added to the load balancing
configuration of this target
on the next page as
credentials for all of the host targets
that the scale-out procedure will need
to access including the host for the
administration server the destination
host of the new managed server and the
HTTP server host similarly I need to
provide the WebLogic administrator
credentials for the source domain
in this scheduled section I can choose
to either run this procedure immediately
or at a later time I can also customize
the notification such as email messages
that I will receive as the procedure
executes and finally I can optionally
run the procedure in a special analyze
mode in this mode Enterprise Manager
will run all of the prerequisite checks
for the procedure but not actually
perform the scale-out operation
I am now ready to submit and begin the
scale-out procedure
after submitting the deployment
procedure I can track its progress from
the procedure activity page
and for troubleshooting purposes I can
view the details and results of each
step involved in the scale-out procedure
you
after the deployment procedure runs
successfully I returned back to the
Middle where targets page to verify that
the newly created managed server is
discovered and running
you
so that concludes this demonstration on
scaling out an existing WebLogic cluster
with Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud
control 12c now you can quickly add
capacity to your WebLogic in Fusion
Middleware environments thanks for
