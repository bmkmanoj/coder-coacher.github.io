quick introduction of the panelists here
and we're going to jump right in and
talk about convergence of TV video in
your audience and how data is is playing
there on my immediate left stefano kim
SVP ad operations in chief data
strategist turner krishan Bhatia
executive vice president business
operations and strategy advertising
sales NBCUniversal we've got Joshua who
I was just working on his last name but
I'm not going to get it right chief
technology officer of Truex and Mark
Rees is head of strategy business
development and marketing of TiVo so
we've got TV companies here and some
companies owned by TV companies or
companies that support TV companies I'd
like to hear starting with you Stefano
and then going down you know what's the
role of a data stack in the data
business and in data activation in TV is
it relevant today you know I think it's
increasingly more so i think we start
with the premise of our executive just
want to make better decisions right and
that's where data is relevant everywhere
but you know i think as we talk more
about it obviously our business is
changing quite dramatically at a rapid
cadence in a rapid pace and we're trying
to make sense of it all so this is where
I think data in all shapes inform
becomes just every increasingly
important Kishan I would say it
absolutely is but in addition and
actually before you get to a data stack
I think a lot of television companies
have a lot of work to do on what I would
consider more basic systems so we've
just gone through three years of
unifying our television delivery systems
or digital ad stack before we even get
to data because if you have a great data
stack and you can't actually connect it
to how we create value for clients from
an inventory forecasting and management
perspective from a targeting perspective
from a delivery from the reporting
perspective than you have nothing so we
had a lot of building block work to do
Pam this is Pam as part of that Dave
David knows a little bit of inside
baseball but that work
has historically been seen as back
office systems for traditional media
companies and for forward-leaning
digital media companies which we you
know fashion ourselves now as well it is
front and center in the strategy so I
think technology overall and advertising
systems overall are the number one
priority and data is one component of
that so Josh you obviously come from an
environment a more pure digital
environment where data and how that
interacts and understands you know
audience engagement is front and center
how does it feel now to be going into a
television company it's interesting
actually I think there's a lot from the
technology world that is going to be
valuable to bring over into the media
world in data obviously making
data-driven decisions understanding your
audience understanding targeting being
able to pull insights that are
understandable by human and at the same
time actually building optimization
systems so that your computing systems
your ad schedulers and whatnot can
optimize properly for lift click-through
rate all but kpi's at important
advertisers so mark TiVo has had
probably more data available about how
people view TV longer in a usable format
than any other company what's happening
today that might be different than it
some earlier points in the in the
company's history and also obviously
with tra another company it was very
involved in that yeah Dave so you're
absolutely right i think we we've had
data longer than most by default evil
has always had a return path and so
there's always a mechanism by which the
data that was being generated as the
viewers or consuming television could be
sent back but for for a long time there
was no framework within which a large
very granular data set could be put to
use in the television environment and i
think the work being done by the Digital
side by the DMPs and large data
aggregators and entities that allow data
to be matched with other data and create
new data sets that are more useful than
any one individual set on their own is
now making the television data that
we've had for some time and other
starting to gather much more relevant
much more useful and the burden I think
now is to continue to push television
data further and further outside of
television and at the same time allow
the television framework to bring in
data sets to make useful so probably the
biggest question everybody out here
right now is is this the one of those
panels when you might want to just get
up and go do your calls because you're
going to lose a break later for your
CrossFit thing because these guys are
talking about television and Gary's
always to already told us in all of the
trade press and the business press tells
you that it doesn't really matter and
it's going away so what I'd like each of
you to address is what's your own each
personal or corporate but whichever you
feel comfortable giving timeframe on how
long linear television matters or or
does over-the-top change or what is your
vision and if you can give us some you
know some sense of time frames for this
massive disruption actually before you
do that I have another quibble / of a
first question starting from mark coming
across I watching each to give a guess
and I want you all to get a number on
this one too how many Americans today do
not have internet in the home okay
because obviously if we got to talk
about over the top and addressable and
on demand and all that stuff we might
need some infrastructure so I need a
number from each of you try to guess how
many Americans today do not have
internet in the home and krishan you may
have to go last is because you might
have internet count party mobile
internet of all I'd like you have to
break out two numbers because if
internet in the home something that's
like fixed in the home but you can give
me both numbers you can tell me how much
mobile percentage wise bird studies will
convert it there's about 300 plus
million American I'm going to say that
about twenty percent in America don't
have internet in their home I think they
use the internet on their mobile devices
some shape or form and they
use internet in public spaces like all
the library and things like that okay
I'll take 20 20 living in California it
feels like it's a lot lower than that
i'm gonna go ten percent okay good John
I think that's about right I don't know
the answer but I think it's about twenty
percent I will guess like twenty
twenty-five percent of some sort of you
know high speed to the home o high-speed
yeah even any internet would you change
it if you count a dial-up I yeah so
probably yes oh hey well let's just sold
and I think there's a little bit of
dial-up in the business thirty-three
percent 100 million Americans do not
have internet in the home and I think
the smartphone penetration is only at
sixty percent right now enlarged
economic and it's interesting if you
think about geography is one-third in
Manhattan in New York not Manhattan New
York City is one-third as well so now I
want from each of you give us your own
viewpoint color it however you want
personally and professionally with what
people should be thinking is going to
happen out what you should be thinking
about the role of TV and it's changing
and over the top and addressable so I
mean I'll take a first shot I think it
depends on how you define it right
because on the one hand you can define
it as linearly scheduled programming and
I think we all know from our own
experience and from what's happening
with consumer behavior that with the
exception of event-driven media whether
it's sports or news or the like an
on-demand world is the world of the
future and in many cases that is already
the present for younger generations if
you define it as the device that you
consume media on I'm not counting the
big screen out not necessarily in the
way that is it was delivered in the past
but if you look at what we would
consider digital digitally delivered
content at nbcuniversal almost
two-thirds of that is happening on a
television device so we traditionally
think about digital as PC and maybe
mobile and tablet but two-thirds of our
digital consumption is happening on a
television
device mostly through over-the-top
connected devices whether their TV
screens or Roku boxes or chromecast
sticks etc or video that's being
delivered through dynamically inserted
ads in the 4 plus window for VOD so when
you add all of that up that's sixty
percent of nbcuniversal's digital
consumption is back on the television
screen so in that sense television is
strong and then you can define it as
content and i would say that we will all
be in this business consuming television
like content for decades to come I don't
think that's changing i think the
distribution of it's changing i think
the scheduling and promotion and
marketing of it's changing maybe what's
relevant to consumers in terms of the
type of content that gets created as
changing but i think the power of
long-form high quality programming is as
powerful as it's ever been and it's only
increasing in our mind yeah i would say
look i actually very much agree i don't
think televisions going away i think
it's starting to change shape and take
different forms and it's it's following
kind of where the users are and how they
behave with it how they want to consume
it so you know a lot of things that my
management talks about is that you know
we stop at some point we stop thinking
about ourselves as a cable television
company and more as a content production
and distribution business and i
personally take it a step further and
say no we're a portfolio brands and
we're really good at creating amazing
experiences right for those brands for
our brands for our advertiser brands and
our client brands and then now the
question is is what is the right forum
that that content needs to take shape
and and how do we make the whole
experience right not just the content
itself but how it gets delivered to an
end user right how do we make all these
things come together and it's the very
natural native experience for that end
user so that's also quite frankly where
we start to get you know more in tune
with the data right because as Turner
you know we're portfolio of fantastic
consumer-facing
brands but today but frankly we don't
have a relationship again consumer so we
need to start building that right mean
you start building that dialogue so we
can get that feedback and in the
meantime all right we're stitching
together what data and analytics we can
just to get an understanding of like not
just what they want but how are they
considering it what actually is
meaningful to them right gosh I think
one of the big problems today with a
nonlinear consumption is the
fragmentation of the industry so what I
see happening the next couple years to
make it safe for all the linear
consumption to shift on a non-linear is
making everything easily consumable on
demand you shouldn't have to go to five
different locations to consume your
content necessarily there should be an
easy way at least from consumer
perspective or whatever they want to see
at any particular time in that world
obviously there's a place for television
producers media is consumed more today
than it ever has been there are honestly
it's the golden age of television like I
love all this new television shows that
are on so I think that it's going to be
very very interesting in the next couple
years how technology and media come
together the data side of things is it's
complicated I think what we need what we
really need to do is packaged up the
data in ways that make sense for the
current buyers on television and make it
a safe place for them to actually move
into non-linear locations and at the
same time making a user experience is
really really powerful and friction free
because there are many many choices and
people consuming their content online so
if there isn't a really positive user
experience they're going to move other
to other locations mark I think it's
important to consider and this is not
news advertisers have more money
invested in television than any other
singular form of media and that's been
the case for quite some time I also
think it's inevitable that television
will evolve to a more addressable
ip-enabled 121 delivery mechanism but I
don't think that
happen tomorrow or next year or even the
next five years given the statistics
they use cited a day that thirty-three
percent don't even have internet
certainly you know just under half the
country doesn't have a DVR I think
connected TV penetration is nowhere near
fifty percent of the country is
certainly not from activated perspective
it's going to take time for the new
model to evolve and an abrupt shift and
abroad shoving of the current linear TV
model into an IP model of the future
will only serve to fragment the market
and remove a lot of equity that's
already built into it and I think that
will be detrimental both to the sellers
of the media and to the buyers who have
so much invested so I think we need a
path between now and this ip-enabled
addressable future and I think data is
the key to that yes that's this that's a
like that market that pulled together I
think we heard three of you who are at
television companies talking about the
importance of user experience content
you know we could have been listening to
a movie studio in some ways or a you
know a publishing business now
television the intellivision industry is
supported in the United States by 75
billion dollars a year of advertising
revenue and a lot of the content your
companies produce is supported by you
know another 100 billion plus of
advertising revenue outside the United
States to that helps drive the content
how do you imagine this transition like
you know what are the you know is it
smooth is it like Bob Garfield of at age
told us is chaos scenario it all
collapses and then it rebuilds like how
do we get from a world where you get
what you get and you don't get upset on
the TV when it's available in 30 second
spot but still sell stuff to a world
that may be the perfect user experience
is I get to skip all ads yeah I mean
actually I want to go back to something
that Prashant said earlier is that it's
not chaos but it's not smooth right it's
very rocky and the large part of that is
the systems right so you know to the
data you're not just saying that gives
Oracle and they sell system yeah we're
data partner but I guess we spend
amazing 54 these people but but
ultimately know it's you know it's so
funny like coming from both a social and
digital background you look at just the
television systems themselves right and
great the data tells you like you know
here's a you know high indexing or
here's a day part with you know the
index is high for the segment that you
want but at the end day it's like it's
so rigid right like it's just so hard to
make the inventory and therefore kind of
the the targeting the segmentation the
whole entire you know the marketing play
at it it's so rigid and so there's so
much more to be done from just a systems
point of view just to get these things
into one place right and then actually
make that more fluid and be able to be
in a dynamic environment right where you
can really start to work with
advertisers to start to tailor that
quote unquote one-to-one message and
then on the flip side you know the other
thing that we see is you know from the
buy side I feel like in some ways from a
systems perspective they're a little
more sophisticated I mean I see you know
marketing platforms some powered by
Oracle that are actually quite
sophisticated but the the buyer mindset
of how they approach television hasn't
necessarily been integrated all the way
through to how they think about the rest
of the marketing stack and so there's a
lot of friction I would say overall and
the end that needs to be overcome and
it's unclear how long that will take but
it seems every year that they're just
greater urgency to go tackle these big
problems kishan fusion yeah I'm going to
at the risk of contradicting myself I
will I will agree that that the
technical platform build out in both on
both sides is nowhere close to where it
ultimately needs to be but put that
aside I actually think that will evolve
I think what needs to evolve more is how
we buy plan and transact media and how
we let go of current notions and embrace
the new that we all talked about as
being
more data enabled more audience focused
more targeted I think when you actually
create those offerings and then you
engage in a dialogue with an agency or
client around how can we now partner
around really deploying that in a
fashion that makes more sense for you
than what you currently do that's a
really interesting conversation and a
very lengthy and involved dialogue that
we're finding so you can turn all the
platforms on all day long but what we're
finding with the top 50 marketers that
we work with where we really have very
one-to-one conversations with those
clients first around enabling those
types of platforms is ok I have to look
at that in the overall media mix and
audience mix and my brand objectives and
this is one piece of it and if I
optimize this piece how does it affect
the rest of the ecosystem and the rest
of my x that is a very complicated thing
and so technology is important but how
we look at reaching audiences and buying
media in a very fragmented landscape is
much more important and there's no
technology that's ever going to solve
for all of that quite frankly i believe
so Josh actually picking up on on
asean's point you're coming from a pure
digital point of view into now it you
know a television dominated ecosystem
but we could just say a video ecosystem
right how do you deal with a holistic
thing where you have let's say on one
side a television ecosystem we're
actually lawyers don't even get involved
in the making of the deal because they
don't sign contracts further up front
until afterwards whereas a digital world
that you've got contracts and data and
all sorts of things in search that may
be managed at a client level not an
agency level and the digital agency is
in a different holding company than the
TV agency let alone they speak a totally
different language like because I think
some of the things I guess if you say so
I suggest out about their Sean said how
do you how do you see attacking those as
a digital person now inside the belly of
the beast it's an interesting question
so I think one of the issues as a
digital person coming into traditional
media we kind of ruined impressions so
digital people ruined impressions
they're often unviewable they're often
not actual true attention there's all
sorts of issues with impressions as a
metric the television buyers have bought
on GRPs they bought on basically
guaranteed attention and Gary's talk
started talking about how maybe that's
shifting and maybe true television
attention isn't where it used to be but
it's still a very good metric for actual
human attention so I think what's
important as we start packaging things
up for television buyers to buy in
digital is to define metrics that
actually make sense hundred percent
viewable 0% BOTS actual attention should
be table stakes like we should start
there and from there we move on to how
much time did you spend how much did you
interact what was the actual impact of
you from a consumer perspective so yeah
that's so mark picking up on what Josh
just said and I think this feeds right
in a bit in that where TiVo and tra has
been for years gary told us it's all
about selling stuff I mean why should we
do it does it even make sense to live in
intermediate metrics of media
impressions and gross rating points and
engagement if you can close the loop and
understand exact ROI in sales oh yeah
for those marketers out there how many
times does your CEO say way to go i love
the engagement metrics you were just
given us last week and he hands up yeah
I I enjoyed Gary's the presentation very
much and I think he did a great job of
selling Gary I'm not sure if F bombing
television and saying it's all shit is
really appropriate television has
consistently proven to be an extremely
efficient driver of sales and it has
done so with incredible efficiency now I
think is the time to ask television to
perform a little harder to
work in a more precise fashion and to
begin to pull in the things that are
being tested and evaluated and are seen
as efficient in other media I I think
we're a little bit away from allowing
television to be sold based on ROI based
on actual sales but I think we will get
there there are mechanisms now being put
in place to begin to evaluate the
delivery of television against sales
evaluate the literacy against lifting
intent evaluate television against
increase of something that is closer to
an actual transaction than just delivery
against an age sex demo so yeah so I
mean would that be a bad thing I heard a
talk not long ago from the CEO McDonald
who said like well are you gonna be
pushing some money over to social
because that's the future and he said
well aside from you know demographics of
the TV audience mapping to his product
he said if I take my spin down 15 points
on TV just however you want to measure
it I lose three percent market share
that week so one question up to you to
my TV really win if it brings the
digital kind of ROI measurements and
might it find its significantly under
priced I you know I'm going to go out on
limits i think many as this is
television is significantly under priced
you know there isn't there are very
other mediums that you can hit or reach
that many people at the same time
globally right and so it's so funny i
was talking to a few folks some startup
folks and you're seeing a lot of these
folks start to buy television
commercials well funded startups growing
companies and what they're telling me is
that you know pound for pound they're
getting a lot more I guess efficacy from
whatever data that they're looking at in
running a Super Bowl commercial right
versus spending a ton of dollars against
you know a massive Soulja Boy right in
addition to a massive longtail display
by and so you know we have I have
personally haven't dug into numbers
where you start to look into it it's
to make sense where the power of the
medium just hasn't been measured to that
extent so I think there is opportunity
there but on the flip side again I go
back to it's like well we you want to
reach just the big proponent of like
just a native user experience if you
want to reach that person where they're
going to most engage with you right in
that whatever environment they prefer
and you know yes engagement is not the
best metric of success but the same time
it's it's a great leading indicator and
ultimately I think those types of folks
that you know will ultimately you know
close or essentially by your brand so
krishan thank you already I mean I think
you answered the question and you're in
your pre Lou which is television is
measured on ROI basis every CMO every
CEO holds their marketing department
accountable for ROI as measured by total
marketing investment and total sales
generated off of that can you get more
precise than that in every single
channel obviously and can television get
more precise than that as well
absolutely and those are a lot of the
tools that I think the companies here on
stage and others are working on but i
think the ROI accountability is already
there for television otherwise it
wouldn't be as healthy and ecosystem as
it as it has been and I think in
addition to that we all know and you
know this as well that the benefit of
roi measurement that digital media gets
is often fueled by the awareness the
television fuels so we actually have to
look at those two components in
connection to really measure ROI overall
and if you take one component out which
is the awareness medium you're going to
see a significantly different roi
equation or your digital spend as well
yeah one of the points I want to I want
to hit I mean my khmer recently create a
partnership with BlueKai just so we can
target digital on TV and measure the
digital BlueKai segments on TV what
about the TV + digital or the digital +
TV so let's not look at one against the
other what are the perspectives that you
all have about what's going to is there
a one plus one equals three or four when
you start tying the things together
we've we've done a number of studies
that look at cross-platform delivery
tied to very significant kpi's like
sales like conversion
and consistently one plus one does equal
three in terms of the added effect is a
lift higher than either one of the media
can deliver and we don't speculate on
the causation was it the awareness
generator on TV or was it the lower
final conversion mechanisms built into
their banners or the pre-roll video that
drove the ultimate lift but we do see
this consistency that the two media in
harmony playing together and I think to
the work that you're referencing that
you're doing with BlueKai and what I
think others in the room and on stage
here are looking to do is using the same
data set across both television
targeting and digital targeting I think
will further increase the amplification
effect of the two media working in
harmony treating them separately i think
removes the added benefit that we
consistently see being delivered so it's
the fun is this why you all just
announced the turner has a DMP yeah i
mean this is where you know i think a
lot of our work especially with the good
folks here at Oracle it's about you know
I think we know right that there's a
combinatorial effect I think we know
there's synergy there right and so now
the next step for us anyways it's like
how do you start to harmonize these
things right so yeah we might have you
know you might have a different demo
watching CNN on television versus you
know the folks who are you know
consuming CNN on snapchat there may be
some overlap they might not be but how
do you sort of harmonized those
experiences where gets really
interesting when you can not only just
managed global reach across all these
mediums right your media I should say
but now you can monitor your investment
right how do you measure how do you I
guess optimize the frequency at which
you touch these people right channel by
channel meeting by medium right I think
that's what becomes super interesting
and so it's not just about individual
channel roi but as a campaign as a media
plan overall I think that becomes super
interesting so to each of you in anyway
because we'll finish on this when Steven
was interviewing David Kenny earlier
today one of these he was pressing was
you've got this great data story its
complex we're all talking about the
complexity and friction let's just
assume the sell side is enabled who's
who is the buy side of these complex
more
holistic data-driven programs it is it
the agency is that the digital person an
agency a search buyer is at the client
is there an interface is it software
people I mean I would argue its clients
first and foremost leaning into whatever
partners whether the agencies or other
partners that they're employing you know
to effect a positive change in their in
their marketing story and what we're
finding just in terms of the clients
that are engaging with us around
advanced advertising products its
clients that have leaned in for a while
to have a more sophisticated approach to
customer relationship management who
have a better handle on their own
customer data and transactional data and
who have experimented in the digital
ecosystem and are thirsting to be able
to apply some of that intelligence and
those insights in the most effective
medium that you know drives their
overall marketing mix which is
television so those are the clients and
they actually their category almost
across all categories their retailers
their CPG companies their financial
service companies their auto companies
their telco companies those are the you
know five or six big categories where we
really see forward-leaning Cline's
driving change I think it starts with
the cmo's office I stick you start with
the premise that the cmo's office is no
longer a cost Center it is a revenue
Center it is a growth centre I think
they come up with a holistic strategy of
how they're going to move the business
forward whether its market share with
its profit whether it's all that
happened in the same person I mean and
then well I think what happens is is
then as that branches out because that
is a large problem right that you start
to bring in your ex your execution your
strategy partners right to help bring
these things together and I think you
know at least for us our philosophy is
that you know ultimately it is driven by
the marketers office but at the end day
we've got to be able to meet and
transact with all of these partners in
between along the way to bring that plan
together and that's our endeavor I I
think it becomes a shift from a
mentality of expense and managing
expense in the most efficient way to
managing investment and so when you
apply investment mentality like a
financial investor you're looking in
placing your money where the return is
higher than what you're paying out and
that mentality can certainly come from
the agency provided that they evolve
their mechanism and their outlook
instead of the most efficient way to
spend money the most efficient way to
allocate money but it also opens up the
field to others who have that mentality
to come in and improve the efficiency
just like in financial services what
used to be the purview of traders on a
single floor like buyers television now
you have trading systems setup anywhere
virtually and the skill sets that are
utilized by traders today are suddenly
not the same one sitting at the desk 20
years ago you know drinking whatever or
doing whatever else they were doing in a
closed environment I think it opens it
up and allows those that are best at
investing clients as money to generate
equity generate sales to participate
excellent way to finish we are out of
time thank you all Thank You panel great
