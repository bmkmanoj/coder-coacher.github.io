to start my name is Roland Kuhn I'm
working for typesafe typesafe is the
company behind Scala programming
language if you are other torques talks
about that at this conference the ARCA
middleware which is why I where I am
working with and the play framework web
framework
I have should just mentioned I have put
some some cards and stickers up on this
box here if someone is interested in
some maybe afterwards how did I come to
work for typesafe I started contributing
to the a cup project it's an open source
project so I I found Scala basically in
2008 looked at it found it nice and
found one especially nice project where
I wanted to contribute to started in
2010 and the first niche I found where I
could easily get into it was I looked at
the test suite which was at the time
already extensive I mean we have
extended a lot since but it lacked a
common form of these tests everything
was just a bit cobbled together so I
created the akka test kit module that
was my first contribution and I've since
refined it and we're using it for all
tests ever since and have now made it
remote so you can have multi node tests
with injected failures and everything so
that has grown since that time and then
I also well may mostly really redid the
finite state machine module that is
something modeling finite state machines
on top of actors it's let's not yet not
really important what it is but it
me so excited that I was working a day
job at the time and in Munich at the
German Space Operations Center and had
like 100 150 percent job depending on
customers and then in the evenings and
on the weekends I started hacking on
this open-source project because it was
was so good that my wife finally asked
me hey you need to reduce the number of
jobs you're having and that was exactly
the time when typesafe was announced and
then I thought okay that's nice that's
what I want to do let's just let them
know that I'm here and available so that
turned out very well now I'm I'm doing
as my day job what I really like to do
and in the evenings still but there's
more time for the kids that's that's
good that's how I started getting into
this I've since worked on all parts I
mean the akka team is really you do
everything so I did I did the test kit
in the beginning but then I worked on
like corax actor abstractions how they
how actors are implemented and at a very
low level and there you have all kinds
of concurrency problems I will I will
talk about what actors are so I used my
own test kit a lot and this feedback
loop is as a pretty good one and in that
team so what I wanted to say and I lost
it sorry what I wanted to say is this is
all grown my understanding of how to
test event-driven systems has grown and
the way I described I started with
writing the test kit then using and
refining it so I thought this book might
be a very good place where I could ask I
could present
my solutions I have only partial
solutions I know places I will I will
tell you later
where I don't have a solution yet and
maybe someone can can just I'm hoping
for a bit of a discussion I will lay out
the landscape as I see it but as if you
have anything you'd like to ask or or
hints you you like to share please do so
immediately you know as they come up it
this is not supposed to be like a talk
with questions at the end right so
having said that let me show you what I
am going to talk about first I'd like to
define what I mean with event-driven
what I mean with asynchronous and then
my present my understanding of
conventional test procedures and how
that maps onto this problem space and
then show you the akka test kit
event-driven means that you have some
consumer and the consumer does not
really run all the time and is busy
pulling it only reacts to events and
events are published by someone else so
there's this decoupling that is a very
very good good thing a consumer doesn't
necessarily need to know who the
producer is or when and how it obtains
data which are going to be published but
publishing this event then triggers the
reaction that the consumer wants to
apply and this reaction then may produce
other so may lead to the production of
other events or it may not
I mean processing may terminate or it
might go on inform other consumers and
so on so event-driven means that really
the events
define which things happen and when they
happen
asynchronous means that it is not in the
calling context that the reaction is
being executed when you call a method on
an object then well there's a new stack
frame opened and everything happens
which is supposed to happen as you wrote
it down in your code and when that
method returns you come back to that
stack frame which called the method that
precisely is not true for asynchronous
operations so that means well first of
all that you have decoupled the time
when this event is generated no event
generated is kind of similar to the
point in time when you want to call a
method but when it's asynchronous that
means that it doesn't happen immediately
may happen at any later later time but
it also means that the context which
initiated this is no longer available
when the processing ends so they cannot
really be a return value that has very
direct influence on testing these
processes what you then usually do when
you do not have a return value is that
you have to chain operations one event
is processed that triggers another event
and that is called continuation passing
style an example would be that you
register a listener to receive a
callback whenever something is done it
would for example be you call a database
so make make a request to a database but
you do not synchronously get back the
rows and the results set but you just
get back a handle where you can register
your listener to receive the callback
which then invoked for the rows
another example might be web service I
tried to pick something which is closer
to Java Enterprise then what I'm going
to show afterwards so a web service
typically means that you send a request
via HTTP to some REST API or something
and when you send it you don't get the
answer right back so what you get is a
handle where you register callbacks and
these callbacks are then executed once
the reply from the server eventually
arrives but between that the server has
asynchronously processed the request and
this may may well be nested so you call
the front-end REST API HTTP server and
that has this kind of processing loop so
to speak but that may in turn call a
back-end server which might call a
database so this the same thing might be
happening at different layers
now test procedures as usually
established
I mean J unit testing G and and and
similar frameworks a test procedure is
just a method usually which is invoked
by the test framework and this method
runs and when the method ends you need
to know whether it was successful or not
it is a synchronous sequence of events
that happens in this test and it's
single procedure which controls it
that's yeah normally you call a method
and you check that the return value is
what you expect for example that is not
really how it works with asynchronous
and event-driven processing there you're
forced to this different sequence that
you in the test procedure just pick off
whatever it is you want to test the
behavior like you generate this request
to the back end or something and then
the tests the the code under test runs
in in a different execution context it
might even run on a different computer
completely but eventually the answer
comes back and obviously the test
procedure is to wait until that has
happened so after some time you assert
then that the result has been received
and then it was as expected and within
the time expected and so on
there are some some issues with this
kind of with the style of testing if you
imagine you haven't you invoke something
or on an asynchronous service and that
offers a callback so that you can
register a callback when something is
done now this callback is executed in a
context on a different thread so not in
the context of the of the test routine
which means that you need to safely
publish the result if you were to inject
your test callback which just sets a
flag or something that needs to be done
using volatile for example to get it
back in a reliable way
there are other other god shots I mean
if you want to receive sequence of
replies for example you kick off a
single request which gets fanned out to
five that back-end databases and you
collect the events which get back so the
result sets you need to include them in
in a thread safe manner of course in
order to get them all and and don't
receive some corrupt thing the other
thing is you should off events and you
wait for events to happen whatever is in
between you cannot really express in
your test you cannot assert anything
about things which are unobservable only
events which are published can be
checked this means that if you have for
example some worker thread pool which
executes some business logic on request
so you submit to this thread pull some
expensive calculation and eventually you
will get back the response using your
callback then you cannot really test the
inner workings of this business logic if
you just do event based testing that
cannot be fixed but I would say it's
practice anyway to factor out this big
business logic into some yeah factor it
out so that it's independent of the way
it is executed so it's just a library
and then you can make normal unit tests
on that code completely synchronously
and you only test the event-driven
aspects of the the aspects controlling
the execution of the code in in the
event-driven test which I would then
call a feature test or integration test
or it's not the white box unit test
anymore you need to do that on the code
separately and then have different
layers of tests then of course I said
the the test procedure needs to wait but
how long does it need to wait what is
reasonable or another thing is if you
have something like you want to test a
timer that it performs correctly but you
all know you can have GC pauses or you
can run it on a busy Jenkins instance on
on a small ec2 box or something so it
might well be that machine load or other
other factors make this test fail
because it takes too long well there is
another thing to be aware of it is not
deterministic anymore in that sense
because you need to have bounded
timeouts because otherwise tests would
not fail with a good error message they
would just keep hanging that's also not
what you want and then the fourth point
is quite interesting one if you have not
only this this simple I publish an event
and then processing happens and I get
back the result but instead there is
some complex machinery set in motion
behind the scenes to produce the results
so several entities working together in
an event-driven fashion sending messages
to each other
than the ordering of these messages or
the ordering of the processing can
influence whether that succeeds or not
so in that case if it makes a difference
then you have a bar but you're not
guaranteed to find it because you might
just happen to run on for example this
very fast notebook where a certain thing
just always happens in the same sequence
and you don't have extra load which
would add randomness to it so your test
always passes and then you run it on
like a 12 core box with slower CPU but
many more of them and suddenly you
notice oh it fails there's some other
sequence which which just happens on
that box in this so this means that
there is that there is a difficulty that
is one of those which i think is not not
yet solved
there's I just wanted to mention some
related work so which which I'm not
showing in the architects kit but other
the first one being formal verification
imagine you have your event processors
no Matt no matter what they are
imagine you have a specification for
them they receive events yeah yes so I'm
I'm not yet so deep into that because I
didn't have the time I just found I
found a paper from ICS in 99 which I
find found interesting I'm going to read
more into this more more more up on this
I would say so you have a finite state
machine which is very well specified
then you could in principle apply a
formal process to verify that it no
matter in which sequence the the events
come it will always do the right thing
but there is a catch you would have to
restrict yourself in what you do in this
state machine in order for this
specification to be manageable if you
use all language features which you have
so you can have mutable variables in
your implementation which didn't change
which you use an if statements as simple
as that
and then you would have to model that in
order to have it correctly in them in
the verification and if you have
something which is non-trivial this
quickly becomes non tractable this is
yeah not a complete solution to the
problem I I would think then the second
point explicit deterministic events
skewed in scheduling that comes back to
the point where you have certain event
orders for which it works in others
where you have a bargain it doesn't work
but you happen to not hit them and you
tests if you hit them for example on a
production system which is then always
nice is that you can reproduce them if
you can control the scheduling of the
events so in the in your test you say I
know this can happen in all kinds of
ways but please my system make sure that
a happens before B happens before C
because that I know is a problematic
sequence I found it by other means and I
just want to have this test which is the
regression test so that I don't break it
again
I fixed it now and it should stay fixed
that is that is something there are
frameworks which are attempting to do
that not it completely they're called
Bassett and and theta4 for akka more
work needs to be done in this in this
direction we are not currently using
that in the akka test suite I'm yeah the
hint is the last one the last point
that's what we mostly using so event
schedules may problematic or not
problematic and the problem is that you
don't find the problematic ones you
could if you have a system which
controls the order of events you could
basically just exhaust the possibility
space if you have five events I mean
that community Toric's draw pretty
quickly in which way these events could
be ordered but if you try them all then
you're sure that you don't have a bug
again this for non-trivial systems
quickly gets non tractable so what we do
instead is I've quite recently written
it's a test for the actors supervision
hierarchies that is something where some
component may fail it tells its
supervisor and then the supervisor says
what should happen restart or something
it's not not important what it is
important is it is a set of 500 in that
test case of these event processing
little engines and they all fail like
mad in this case yeah I just kill them
randomly in the test procedure and
inject half million failures in
different ways and different sequences
and all kinds of configurations over
there that say different exception types
so to speak and if you do that long
enough then you're pretty confident that
you found all the problematic sequences
that actually happened in this test I
think I implemented this and I wrote the
test and then for three weeks I was busy
basically each day I found a new bug so
the test failed and then it took me a
day to find the cause on average and fix
it and then I thought of a new test case
a new exception type to throw or
something again that the game repeated
for three weeks but since we have not
had a single failure on this test
anymore we've run it 100 times in a row
on different servers different hardware
configurations and now it seems okay so
that is I think the most pragmatic
approach which we found to date to deal
with this so we cannot totally exhaust
the the scheduled space so we just try
randomly we sample randomly and we just
trust that yeah
no it's it's quite random it's quite
random that's the idea
so the problematic sequences will not
just be one in a billion that I won't
hope to find but it will probably be
just a few randomly scattered and if you
just test long enough you can hope that
you hit one
in that sense yes yes okay
I should mention that I made sure that
the kind of failure cases are equally
populated so there is there is some
selection that is true yeah so there is
a high level randomization of what type
of failure and then how deep the failure
should go so there there is a logical
selection it's in that sense I'm you're
right it's not completely random that
would not hit much yeah that's true
you have to think about your problem
actually and and and customize the
process by which by which you apply the
the random failures in that case yeah
yeah that's true
so I hope I didn't forget to talk about
anything important in in general if the
if you have more questions because then
then I would present the the test kit
just quickly what what it does and how
it looks like yeah so for that I need to
introduce actors because actors is what
I do a car is an actor framework and
actors are really prototypical for this
for this kind of problem because they
are completely Asian because everything
about them is a synchronous and they
only react to messages being sent there
they're completely event-driven so the
test kit as supporting methods for
publishing events which means sending
messages and receiving back messages and
inserting probes at certain points in
your actor system multiple actors
working together you can insert a probe
at some point and sniff so to speak the
message flow through that point that
also has scoped timeouts so you can say
these this bunch of operations should
run within two seconds I found that when
you when your aim is to write a test
suite which is supposed to be run on
some site CI servers that you cannot
really go below 500 milliseconds because
500 milliseconds can easily still be hit
by just the GC pause or something that
can just be a hiccup which makes your
test fail to be so the typical timeouts
default timer is 3 seconds to receive
them something yeah and then most of the
Teske API is just assertions concerning
the different events you may receive
so I'm going to do this in in Scala I
mean you don't need to learn Scala here
I just chose to do it because I can then
basically quickly and concisely write
what I mean and you should be able to
understand if you have any questions
just ask this is just just some hello
world object means this is basically
static methods roughly speaking and the
apt rate the the app base class
basically means that everything in in
the body of the class is in fact in the
body of the main method you would have
normally so whenever when you run this
it prints hello world so I have already
prepared this with with the imports you
need to create actors so let's create an
actor called counter now this counter
needs a variable which it widget which
is an integer starting out at zero and
then as I said it's completely message
driven so you just need to define what
happens once it receives a message and
I'm using a nice scala feature which is
called pattern matching this is this is
why I do this in Scala because in in
Java the code would just take many more
lines now let's define the messages we
can give them names you can also send
around strings but then the compiler
doesn't catch typos for this there is
this color feature called Ches object we
can send it a tick or a get and if it's
a tick then well let's increase the
counter by 1 and if it's a get then
well we have a sender a message it comes
in an envelope it has a sender in a
recipient and you can get the sender
which is saying sender and then how do
you send a message that's the bang
operator so sender bang counter this is
this syntax is basically stolen from
Erlang who of you know Erlang just a few
who have you know Scala by the way or
have seen it you know nice nice so this
is this is basically our actor that's
that's the whole of it everything now we
need to create one in order to play with
it so let's make an actor's system an
actress system is basically you can you
can think of it as the container for a
set of actors it manages the the
configuration of common things I'm not
going to do much of that here just need
to know that you need you need a system
the system will start thread pools and
we do want to shut them down
in the end now in the middle let's
create an actor
now as simple as that so you say actor
new counter one feature of of acha is
that it enforces this encapsulation so
you can only talk to actors using
messages which makes them really
completely asynchronous and event-driven
and this is why they are hidden behind
an actor if or this is this is prone to
small you don't you really get the
counter back you get an act of ref
representing the counter now we can send
the messages like a tick and we can also
I mean that's not very interesting
because we won't see anything we can
also send it a get but the gate will try
to send back a response so we need
something to receive that response there
is something like a mini actor you can
reuse for this purpose I call it more
echo at me that's myself which is an
inbox and this is used by these message
sends as the sender reference so it will
receive the replies so I can just say
well C equals me receive and this will
actually wait
so these send-off events they generate
events to be consumed by that actor and
this one here waits with the time out of
three seconds for a message any message
to receive to this me inbox now I can
just
print out the counter and see if that
works so count was one no that's just
all I'm going to say about actors for
now or is that clear enough for
demonstration purposes so it's
completely event-driven everything is
asynchronous it demonstrates the problem
so let's look at test kit we write a
counter spec which extends test kit test
kit I mean we want to deal with actors
so we need an actor system we create one
here I could also give it a name that's
good style and I use Scala test that
that's a framework for writing tests
which has these implicit sender this is
a trait which you mix into this test
class which says that the test kit
contains an actor which will just when
it receives something cue it into a cue
and then you can write assertions what
the top of the queue actually is and
implicit sender means that this actor
shall be used for all send operations
like the inbox in the other example so I
have prepared an outline of which tests
to write a counter actor must start out
at zero so let's just create one and
when we send it a get now so this is all
old news now comes the first test kit
thing expect message zero well this is
again the point where we wait this in
this line we set off with we set the
thing in most in motion which we want to
test and in this line we wait until a
result arrives and then
assert that the result was actually zero
now if I were to run this yep so the bar
is green you see the first test
hopefully you see that that was run the
other one is not yet implemented now we
can we can also
send it tick first so a different
sequence of events and then expect that
the result will be 1 this also works but
that's not new so it's just one more
thing
but must not be dead slow that is the
next interesting one I told you about
scoped timeouts this is why I put this
in here so if I have an actor and this
is a Scala for loop no need to to worry
about the specifics this just iterates
eyes from from 1 to 1000 and for each of
these iterations I send a tick and then
I send a get and now it should be 1 1000
so running this it's still green but
that's boring let's make it red so what
if we actually make it dead slow by
sleeping one millisecond
we do that a thousand times yeah okay
this was the default I didn't actually
put in what I wanted this this works
because default timeout is three seconds
but if we say within one second this
should happen
then it fails now and you can see here
it fails at this line where was this
with an error message assertion failed
timeout some close to 1 million
microseconds during expect message while
waiting for the message 1000 yes yes
that is in the test kit that is the
within he was asking where that comes
from and that is in the test kit and you
can nest these so if you have an overall
process which is complicated which may
take 5 seconds and the first part needs
to be done within one second you can
just nest these I mean they they are
lexically scoped the timeouts then and
they are implicitly used by the expect
message and friends I mean you can this
expects message 1000 you could also
expect message type int for example
expect message class in this this this
would be class of integer that should
also work and there's a lot of them but
that is that is basically the essence of
it yeah you have a facility to receive
the replies the generated events to make
assertions about their order in which
they are arriving and their contents and
about the time it takes you have a
question
oh it was I'm not sure whether it was in
one dot oh but it sure was in 1.1 it's
it's in there since a long time
yeah and in version 2.1 i'm proud to
announce that i actually managed to make
a java test kit
so what i'm showing here is the scala
version because it's still smaller on
takes less screen real estate
but the java version is nowadays pretty
close to this the difference is that if
you want to make it within and there
needs to be some code running within the
within then there's no choice but to
create a new class or a new object so
you must say new for example in a few
places where that is not necessary in
scala but the the java test kit and the
the scala test kit are on par now
concerning the the features they support
yep
yeah
yes so if you were to send the tick and
the get then the first one would be one
and the last one would be thousand and
everything in between then we get them
all ready yeah so we expect message what
we get now the easiest would be to make
a loop again
yep
sorry
yes so I was just thinking like whether
you can can but you cannot really get
out the sequence in one in one go you
need to so you need to call expect
message for every message which you got
which you wanted to get I know so this
is why I'm confused you can also say
expect message all off and then pass in
a sequence one to 1,000 but that's a bit
arcane scholar syntax so I find this
more readable
so essentially you pop off pop the the
the oldest element of the queue always
and check what whether it is what you
expect and then you go on to the next
but this queue can can hold the
intermediate replies so this for sure
will populate the queue before the the
assertion really starts an order is
preserved of course yeah well this
expect message all off we could make it
explicit that that's all off one two
three they would expect the values 1 2
and 3 and then we we can continue like
this from 4 mm let's see whether I'm
making sense here
so it was timing out is because I still
have the one millisecond sleeping it was
timing out waiting for message number
780 which also tells you it actually
goes through it so what are you thoughts
how do you like it
no I neglected to talk about all of that
so in fact the default configuration is
to spawn a thread pool which has maximum
twice the number of cores and it will
then run actors on these thread threads
but we just have one actor now so it
will just one thread which is used
yes
but the current so what what this this
little demo does is I modified the actor
to actually take longer that is not
really what you want to do when you want
to test the system you want to test that
system and not some test variant of it
to be sure that it is actually the same
thing you're talking about I didn't
check the time yeah oh yeah sorry
so if any more questions Oh even outside
