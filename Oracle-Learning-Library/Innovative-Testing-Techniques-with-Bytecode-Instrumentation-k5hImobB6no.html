more about bad biker instrumentation but
with my testing perspective no just ask
anyone just put your hands with the very
ones actually played and played with
b/ci fantastic one person and okay so a
little bit about me first the server
disclaimer so my name is Paul wait and i
work at IBM UK IBM hursley in in the
united kingdom and my primary role is
the quality assurance test lead for java
8 and I lead a team across various
continents across the world and I'll
pray and when we just recently I took on
the role of openjdk openjdk contributor
from a testing perspective those of you
who've been to some openjdk talks may
have heard that we do are a problem with
openjdk in terms of not having many
tests so you actually run and and we're
trying to grow the pool of tests as we
speak so that's going to be one of my
roles for the next year I'd imagine if
not longer than that so what are you
going to get out of this this talk a
little bit a little bit more about me
and why I'm doing the talk I'll give you
a brief instruction up into bio
instrumentation and and then it will
take it then we'll look at the testing
aspects why how can we actually use b/ci
to test the product they were testing
and then we'll actually go and get on to
the command line and I'll show a few
examples of how we actually do bc i we
wondered we will run a test and then we
want to test with pci and you'll see how
how useful it can it can be i will
provide an introduction to java agents
if though just for those who don't know
what java agent is b/ci does use java
agents and we'll also go through exactly
how b/ci works the limitations and then
we'll go through a few approaches
so my team and I test java we break Java
my dog my job is to break off my job is
to find defects in the OpenJDK I'm sorry
but it isn't open jelly but it in there
in the IBM SDK and and my job is that
when we deliver an SDK to our customers
is of good quality and we primarily
focus on system testing and so a system
testing could be a talk in itself but to
summarize what we tend to do is we look
at running tests the high load so we're
stressing the JVM trying to find jit
bugs and also we concentrate on the
third party applications so take for
example eclipse oui oui the Eclipse
application has a set automated test
suite and we reused we run that test
free and all its supported platforms to
make sure Eclipse functions properly
before that diversion of jabra is
shipped to our customers and we use when
we run various other third-party
applications such as diabetes care and
so on because we want to make sure that
when the customer gets Java on day one
that it works so the way the way I look
at system test is that with feta
professor the first customer before are
the real customer gets the egg gets the
SDK and because it java because the Z is
essentially we just want to throw as
much java as we can at the sdk so why
are we looking at BCI from different
from previous I'm example perspective is
that we were using BCI in test because
we wanted to to drive the different ways
of actually then running the tests and
bi is actually very good at doing that
and we're going to go through a few
examples of how to do that
so quickly a quick introduction to
bicone instrumentation so reading the
top line BCI is modifying the bites of a
class at runtime so when you when you
run your jvm you would you do it with an
agent and we'll talk about in a little
bit later and you can you can
effectively modifier classes at load
time or at a point afterwards so when
the rim JVM loads loads classes you can
modify a class them or you can modify it
after it's been loaded and we'll talk
about the different ways of our you can
modify it there are some there are some
restrictions in terms of the classes you
can modify such as java.lang.object you
can't do and some security classes that
you can modify and the good news is as
you'll see later is that there are
abstraction frameworks available one of
the things that that's fairly clear
about well it will be both later is that
with BCI you will be playing with byte
codes and there are some frameworks out
there which make that a lot easier to do
so and the diagram of the bottom here
essentially what i was trying to
represent here is that you have a class
that you've you've created and you have
some code that you want to insert into
that class but you want to do that at
runtime and and that's essentially what
we're doing with BCI
now ASM is is a is a brilliant product
it's used by loads of different
different and packages our products out
there such as an aspect J use it pretty
well and noted and also jruby do and
essentially it is the framework that we
use in IBM it provides provides us with
the the tools to to perform b/ci without
having to get down into the Nitty Gritty
of understanding by codes and and it
also does it's also got an analysis
framework as well which I haven't been
really paid much attention to so the
examples that you'll do i'll show you
will we'll talk about it we'll use ASM
in some great detail has anyone used asn
fantastic
ok so now look at the problems that we
have in test if you imagine a try-catch
block and you have and you're performing
some function and that function may
throw an exception and you need to test
the code in the exception a catch so
that you want to make sure that that
code works properly you can do that by
using the bite effectively using BCI and
well and we'll go through a concrete
example of how that can be done so you
want to if you have a exception block
with three exceptions and you want to
drive all four of those paths in the
exception block you can do that with BCI
and you don't have to change your test
and that's why bc is powerful let's look
at memory exhaustion if you consider a
large-scale application such as an
application server and you wanted to do
an application server you know we'll
have code to the handles out of memory
conditions how would you test for that
there are so many different ways that
the application server could could could
be memory exhaust could experience
memory exhaustion and how would you test
for it it's it is it's a hard thing to
do and it's very and bc i can help with
that and likewise for for secure paths
going through code we easy way of been
able to encourage the the flow of
applicator flow to the Pacific method or
function that you want to actually test
who were here in the audience has is a
test professional
one two three I'd love to speak to you
afterwards actually so here's so here's
an example here where we have a we have
four paths that we want to test so the
first one is we're creating their
sockets and that socket what other work
wait doesn't if it does work and then we
can get on with the code and we can do
whatever you want to do with that socket
but it can also throw an unknown host
exception and we need to we need to be
able to test that the code that then
runs when an unknown exception is
triggered we need to be able to test
that code likewise for an IO exception
and a security exception and we know
this so by looking at the socket API so
forward for the view when you're passing
in a string and onions into the sockets
class you will you'll end up bad that it
can it can throw three exceptions and at
the bottom of this slide here an unknown
host exception if the eye appeared not
the host could not be determined and an
IO exception which is an i/o error when
calls when creating the socket i/o
exception is an interesting one because
it's kind of a catch-all how do you how
can you create an IO exception and and
and be confident that you've caught
they're all the different possible use
cases so as to quickly go through this
example here so in the first in the
first here this is the test running
normally you run the test and it creates
the socket no problems is found in this
example there w is found a it's greater
the socket to the domain example.com and
then you can go off and do whatever it
is you want to do with that socket
for unknown host exception how else
could you test for an unknown host
exception you could pull the network
cable out of the out of the machine and
run your tests and then you can prove
that it's not going to find her it's not
going to find that the host and
therefore you're thrown on that
deception so that's one way around it
you could you could modify UTC house to
ensure that that it doesn't return what
were you expecting but it's not
particularly practical as soon as you go
and change your test machine then any
other tests that runs on it isn't going
to be particularly and you can't really
trust those tests so with bc i we we can
we can do that we can there we can test
for it io exception you will need to
understand the implementation of the
earth what it is that you're testing in
order to test when I exception I
essentially going to be really hard to
do how do how would I would you
intercept the connection in order to try
and cause an IO exception so and again
it's not particularly practical the
security exception is an interesting one
because here you have to create a
security manager in in order to to
actually test this this particular
function this particular exception
rather and it could be complicated setup
and essentially at the end of day might
be best that you have to test any way to
test for both them both conditions
so now I'm going to show you a demo on
the command line to prove the point here
so this to this test all this test does
it look it grates to a socket for three
hosts and the hosts are IBM com oracle
com and example.com if the socket
connection was successful it'll print is
successful Andals unlike wise if not
when bc when the test is one with bc i
there's a trigger in the in the BCI
agent which which effectively says if
the host that that i'm about to create a
socket for is oracle com don't create
the socket just throw an unknown host
exception instead and at that point the
code London the code for the unknown
host exception but could then be run and
therefore tested looking at the the Java
command for test one this is just the
test running as normal and it's and it's
it's a very simple test as you can see
from the description the test to the
test is running with b/ci the command
line and we'll go into in greater detail
after the after on the demo the bots on
want to point out here is the text in
blue the oracle com what I'm passing in
here is a host so I can control the
agents that's I can control what's
actually our host to to throw the on
those toast exception on so I'm going to
go back down to the command line and
we'll i'll show you how this works
so this is the this is the test running
on it as it should do with with no b/ci
it's extremely and basic and so it is
trying to connect to example Oracle IBM
com ice worked so the so the there are
try catch blocks in the test but the
code for those try couple of try catch
blocks haven't been exercised because
the test passed so we've not been able
to test those and the code in the trike
ice blocks so now let's run the test on
the test with with bc i enabled and what
we're doing here is we're telling the
retaining returning selling the JVM to
load to enable the bsd I agent and when
the socket class gets loaded and that we
were effectively modifying the socket
class too it's actually the modifying
the the constructor for the sake class
to allow running I unexplained to so
expensive seconds a cube riding a second
so here we have we've connected to
example.com that's fine oracle com
didn't work because we effectively
thrown an unknown host exception and an
identical com was fine going back to the
slides
for those who couldn't see the screen
properly we the Dow Portland from test
one everything was good and we threw an
unknown host exception for oracle com so
this is a breakdown of the command line
that we've just run the the boot class
path is required for for some classes
that you want to to change at runtime
and it really depends on which classes
you're trying to you trying to change if
you're if it's an application class then
you won't need to use the boot classpath
if you're trying to change some of the
system classes such as java.net socket
you the JVM will not let you do that
unless you've added your all your
classes to the classpath so you'll see
here that we've got the ASM library and
we've also got in green this is the
Mobius is effectively RBI agents which
is packaged in a jar we're running a
java agent with that term which contains
our aura be CIA agent and we're passing
in as an option the historical calm the
test itself hasn't changed so the point
here we're not changing the chest at all
one of the advantages of these with BC
is that we don't want to change the test
we're at the point is you want the test
to be at a single on its own and we will
change the environments which test runs
in in order to to drive certain paths
through through code so let's take a
different example using memory
exhaustion I before I mentioned that
there was a an example of an additive
memory error and an outer memory area is
very hard to predict and that's going to
happen and when it does happen how do
you how do you how do you test the code
that's supposed to run when it does if
you imagine a massive as big scale
complex a huge complex system where an
alton memory could happen anywhere
anywhere within the system how would you
do it you can do it with BCI
I should also say on here that the
sometimes you may want to look at it is
possible that you may want to reduce the
heat to reduced eep therefore it may've
thrown out of memory perception foam
that might work but it's not going to
work for every possible combination
within the within your application and
also the the point here is also that you
if you're trying to reduce the heap of
your application server the application
server may not actually function anyway
because it's not going to work very well
so in this this demo here we are
creating we need we're filling the heat
and in the first instance with the test
running as normal we're adding integers
to the heap and the the announcer memory
exception would be thrown once we filled
the heat but given that we're just
adding integers it'll take a long time
for that to happen it probably would be
continuing to run Java 2013 so how do we
how do we test how do we force Delta
memory exception we do that by using
b/ci and we set a trigger so that after
three integers have been loaded into the
heap throwing out and memory exception
and then you can test you are to me
exception handling code looking at test
one the system is the standard test and
test two this is where we've enabled the
BCI agent and we're passing in later
than number three so we're saying to the
agent after the third integer that's
been loaded thrown out of memory
exception
all right let's go to the
so in this example here we're running
the test and the test ball every time it
prints an item to the screen it's
loading in integer it's not particularly
exciting but it's just there to prove a
point and this will carry on and until
the heaps filled up which means we can't
wait for that so we so I'm just going to
kill it because it's pointless and we're
trying
ok
so now we run the demo with with BCI and
what we're telling what we're doing here
is we're loading it with the BCI agent
and with we're saying that when the
third integer is loaded throwing out in
them exception
so it should go up now
so also this this now therefore allows
us to test our after the the code that
we typically will remember nothing they
would happen and you can't predict to
announce and then we announced memories
tap in the Machine and I appreciate that
depending on the state of your
environments it may not be possible to
recover for mom but let's let's assume
that it's for it it's possible okay so
let's go back to our slides
this is just the output if you haven't
seen it i think the screen is pretty
good so i'll move on so a breakdown if
the command but we're not using them out
the boot class path this time because we
don't need to use it do you speak
because the classes that we're
transforming application classism and
not actually change again sdk classes
running the classes that require the
boot class path and we riding it will
add to the passing in an option 3 into
the into the agent the ASM class
libraries or the ASM libraries are also
added to the classpath and we're
learning the test and the test excuse me
hasn't actually changed so let's just
recap on what we've obviously is so
sometimes it's hard to test parts of the
application and b/ci does provide a
solution for that b/ci does have some
restrictions and when you are when
you're playing with b/ci essentially you
can replace method bodies so you can't
replace a method you can't remove a
method but you can replace the contents
of a method you can you can replace your
entire class and we'll go into that a
bit later so I can't hear
if that's okay is it yeah so you can
place so you can place your entire class
and the point and that the best thing
about this is you not change in your
code you change your code remains the
same and you're manipulating the
environment at runtime when we do bc i
we are actually inserting byte codes
into the application here on time so we
are playing with by codes using the
unknown host exception there are two
ways to do this we could we could change
the test we could create another version
of the test I in this case my socket
class and we end and so fed to the cabin
mock objects or we could modify java.net
socket doc like the socket class which
is what we're doing here whichever way
you should whichever option you choose
you will be playing with by codes
however it's it's actually okay because
there are tools available for you have
to be able to the tools available which
allow instead to do this so a quick a
quick update on driver agents my
apologies for those who know what what
what one is the driver agent so it
basically are busy i need it needs the
driver is uses it to the java rate the
java agent to be able to do bc i and
this here if the code here is the is a
typical agent it must have a pre main
method and the the agent is added into a
jar file in the jar file you create the
manifest and you effectively prayed
you're pointing the manifest to the
class in your in the jar file which
which is your agent so when you're doing
BCI all the classes that do all the
transformations will end up in this in
this jar including
agents and so the the agent the jvm
doesn't know which one which class is
going to it contains your pre main
method so you're doing you're just
setting that by updating the manifest in
for the jar file the when you're running
an agent it's it behaves like any other
Java code so you don't need it doesn't
have any special nothing special about
it can do anything that any of the Java
code can do and actually that's what
makes it quite powerful the
instrumentation object an example here
is what actually does the transformation
when you when you're performing b/ci so
how does bc i actually work I I pondered
how best to describe this because I
could I could display loads of loads of
Java code on the screen and it was a
little bit complicated so I thought I'd
go to diagrams instead I do have
examples available if anyone wants to
see that will take them away with them
the examples that I showed you today you
can take them but it's time to go go
with a with this instead because it was
just easier to do them to put on the
screen so we're using we using the
example of the unknown host exception
and we have our socket class we have our
ASM library and ASM implements a visitor
API so it and and we'll talk about how
all that works in a second so the JDM
has loaded and it's loaded the socket
class and in our agent we're effectively
saying okay one once you've loaded the
class socket now let's go in then I
let's go and look through this class and
try and try and find the method that we
want to change so we start off
and we've we've so we found the soccer
class we found socket and the within the
crystal turbine so this crystal j 9's
address and we go to our visitor method
is this the target method do we want to
change no it's not because we want to
change string codes in port so it
ignores it and it and any workable it
goes back to send them it ignores it
rice device for that particular method
and go and then we go to the next one in
the class here we see here we've got the
the actual construction that we actually
want this is what we're changing and we
ask the question again is this the
target method yes it is so here the in
visit code which is an ASM method it we
we can actually insert the by codes for
the for the the code that we want to run
and the code that we do we actually are
inserting is this you may not be able to
be done yeah it's all we're doing is to
be same so in the socket class for this
particular constructor bad we're saying
instead of doing all the stuff you're
doing just throw if the host is this to
throw an exception an unknown host
exception
now what this means for ASM is that this
code translates to to these by codes so
when you play with ASM this is what you
would end up having to do now if for
those of you haven't seen this this
notation before excuse me I don't find
it particularly useful and particularly
great and there are there is a tool
which I'll talk about later which allows
us to create this code for us and
essentially this is the code that
actually put replaces the the code it
does the bike this is the biker
instrumentation eventually this will be
essentially saying put this code in this
method and then write it back and then
the JVM will be using that code as
opposed to the previous version and what
it and then ASM will do that and what it
effectively translates to is these by
codes and this is um this is like this
is output for mem job p
in terms of limitations the the biggest
thing that you cannot change a field I i
did when i was first plane with this i
was trying to change it to change a
field and it kept complaining i couldn't
work highway and it realized that it was
just it's a limitation you can't change
field to ride the bewbs you can't you
know add or remove the fields and
methods can't kind of also can't be
added or removed but you can change the
actual contents of the methods method
signatures are coming modified so if we
go to the example back here where we
have string host and ports if we try and
change that it would be the JVM were
Nettles
as I've said before most classes can be
modified including most SD play classes
but java.lang.object see one where your
cards and some security classes can't be
modified so BCI options we said before
that you there are different ways of
doing this you can replace the method
body or you can replace an entire class
I prefer this method because you don't
need to play with any bike codes at all
and it's it it's so essentially if you
want to replace a class through with boo
you would you would compile you create
both classes and you compile them when
you when you so the the boo class is
available on the classpath and when you
load the JVM and you've started you be
CIA agent you can effectively say is
that it when it when the agents when the
JVM is loading all the classes you can
go through each this class so is this
the class that I want to change no and
it'll go to the next one once you've
found the class you want to change you
effectively given a byte array which
represents the class instead of using
that byte array you can throw that away
and read in your new class converted to
a byte array and return that back to the
JVM and effectively you just remove you
just replace the class so the davantage
of this is that you don't need to
understand by code but there are some
some limitations and the kind of obvious
really is that you the source code must
be available and on Joren changed and it
has to be the same compiler version I
this is this is the method that i prefer
the best because you're effectively it's
easier than playing with by codes
so there are many b/ci frameworks
available I think that then asn I
believe is the best one the it does
provide the abstraction layers I think
we need I think we find it and that it
if you're playing with it you're getting
down to nitty gritty by codes it's not
particularly fun for me anyway and and
it's a the new thing I will say is that
it is provided an extra dependency on to
on your application and but I think it's
worth it the if you go to the ASM
website there's loads of examples and
tutorials and how to use it I haven't
gone into detail here on how to use it
specifically but I at the end of the
presentation there are some men
references that you can go in and do
that one thing that that's cleared by bc
is that you you do kind of need to know
the jvm architecture a little bit you
need to understand how the JVM loads
classes you know end in order to be able
to perform by code instrumentation and
there's there's a link to the do to them
to the JVM spec for you to read if you
really want to another way of generating
by codes is to use Java p so if you've
created your class and you have and you
can put that through java be using the
minus the option and then you can get
you then you can get your bike codes
listed down and you can use those to to
put into the class that actually
performs the micro instrumentation it's
a bit messy it is certainly one way of
doing it
this this I think is one of the best
best things that the ASM is provided and
it's an eclipse plugin and it's called a
Asma Asma fire and it allows you to too
if you wanted to replace the method body
and you want you two to turn the
contents on method body into a SN logic
which is what we've listed here you
could do that by hand or you could use
the ASM fire at all and all that does is
that it would create you let you install
the plug-in and you you open up the
theta scripts called bytecode
perspective or delivered by code view in
Eclipse click on a method in your class
and then in your open up a window and it
will give you effectively or print this
code out I some of this is the reduced
additional code that it gets rid of
those get printed out and that's where
you had a little bit of expertise is
going to need because you need to
understand what to what with no and what
not to ignore but the ASM manual
provides all that information has anyone
used a SMB fire how they visit good
so what couldn't what can go wrong the
dis life really was 450 HP to take away
because if when you start playing with
this and it won't necessarily go yeah
we're go / faites from day one the if
the JVM it is unhappy over the class
you'll get a Java line verify error
that's potentially what I what I used to
tend to get all the time the well so we
have used to be when um typically there
are three areas here so a star shape
inconsistent and so on to float error
and one of the things that I find is
that in the tutorials that dude go
through a lot of these examples and
you'll also notice that if you're using
asn asn will do loss this web for you
anyway so I do i do encourage you to go
down the asn roots or an equivalent and
the framework
so you need to be aware that there isn't
any in a compile-time checking and also
that if you're trying to call a private
method and it can fails at runtime and
it's essentially if you're trying to use
increments in two methods and or the
ordering or indeed typos it's kind of
yeah very self-explanatory so in
conclusion the I I find b/ci is
extremely powerful it is used in many
