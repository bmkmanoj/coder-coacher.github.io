flow in Oracle flow builder for work
request work order complete with failure
analysis the various transactions are
create a set group asset number create
failure set create work order with work
request material issue and charge
complete work order and verify the data
let's move to Oracle flow builder
navigate to the flows link navigate to
the release product family and the
product way we want to create the flow

enter the relevant description for the
flow being created complete work order
with with request and failure quotes
click create structure this is the
structure for the flow which we are
creating now first let us add the prompt
URL and login navigate component set
drag and drop the component set next we
would add a component for changing the
arc next we would create a set group
next we will add a component set for
creation of a set group then we would
create an asset number using the aid
group created about next we would add
the component sets for creating the
failure set codes here we would be
creating the failure court failure set
with the failure code and as I need to
an asset group next we would create a
work request next you would use a
competency to create a work order using
the work request and the failure quotes
operation summary and material
next we would be doing the resource
charging and the material issue
we will be completing the work order we
are using the company to Accord a
component and we would verify the
failure data
we log out and close the application
let's have a look at the test data Excel
right click on the flow name generate
and download flow test data X in this is
the float is data X in these are the
different components which we have
assembled in the flow let us have a look
at the test plan that gets generated
right click on the flow name generate
and download s plan we have a word
document these are the components that
are assembled in the flow and this is
the test data which we have entered in
the flow this is how we can create a
flow and generate test plan thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
