curriculum developer at Oracle in this
demo I'd like to show you how to deploy
a BPM project that requires approval or
deployment approval workflow for
deployment is available only in Oracle
business process composer when approval
workflow is defined for a project
specific users or groups must give their
approval before deployment for example
here is a project in which approval
workflow has been defined the project
uses a simple sequential workflow so
first W Faulk
and then W shaykh must give their
approval before you can deploy the
project to send a project for approval
the project must be open as you see here
select deployment deploy project from
the main menu first the project is
validated if an approval workflow has
been defined then instead of the usual
deploy project window you'll see this at
a description if you want to and then
click the send for approval button the
project has been sent for approval since
the approval has been defined as simple
sequential the request for approval is
sent to the first participant listed
namely w Falk you can click OK here you
can monitor the progress of these
approvals by opening the approval
workflow browser
at first all you'll see is that the
process has been assigned let's leave
this window for a moment and let's login
to business process workspace as the
first approver w Falk here you see W
Falks my tasks page notice there is a
task associated with the process that
requires approval before deployment
let's approve the deployment by opening
the task and approving it
that task is no longer listed on W
Faulks my tasks page now let's login to
business process workspace as the next
approver W shake
let's assume w shaykh approves the
deployment to back in the approval
workflow browser if you click refresh
notice that the status has changed to
completed if you select the project the
deploy button is enabled and you can
click it to proceed with the approval
workflow completed you can now deploy
the project filling in the fields
according to your requirements
here are sample values note that in
Business Process composer you must be
the project owner or have the project
administrator role in order to deploy a
project to BPM runtime when you have
finished click deploy and that's it you
have now deployed a project that
required approval for deployment I'm
