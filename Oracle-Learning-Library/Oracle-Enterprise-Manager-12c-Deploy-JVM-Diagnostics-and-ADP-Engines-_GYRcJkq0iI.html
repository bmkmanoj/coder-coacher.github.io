Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
deploy the JVM diagnostics engine and
the application dependency and
performance or ADP engine in the
enterprise manager Cloud Control 12c
this video is applicable to enterprise
manager cloud control version 12 point
one point zero point three if you're on
an earlier version consider upgrading
using self update adp and JVM
diagnostics provide additional depth for
diagnosing problems in tuning
performance in Java and Oracle Fusion
Middleware applications both adp and JVM
Diagnostics engines collect additional
deep-dive data using their own agents
from within the JVM of the monitored
application servers this data is then
made available for you to see an
enterprise manager from any page and
enterprise manager will go to set up
middleware management application
performance management from this page
you can deploy both application
dependency and performance or ADP
engines as well as JVM diagnostics
engines so let's sit deploy a JVM
diagnostics engine by clicking add JVM
diagnostics engine on this deployment
page we have two options we can create a
managed server and deploy the engine to
the new server or we can deploy onto an
existing managed server if we choose to
deploy onto an existing managed server
the managed server must exist within the
enterprise manager domain let's create a
new managed server which is the default
the host drop-down list as you can see
here shows who's that have OMS installed
this is because you can only deploy a
jvm diagnostics manager to a host where
OMS exists in this case there's only one
host so we'll accept that the managed
server name defaults to what you see
here if a managed server already exists
with this name the final number
increments automatically until it finds
an unused name as this is the first
managed server will accept the default
and for the managed server listen port
will enter 3900 as the defaults are in
use now let's complete the credentials
section we need two credentials for
deployment we need the credentials for
the host where the OMS server is located
this is so we have the IAM agent run the
deployment job for us and we also need
the credentials for the WebLogic domain
itself to make the underlying w LST
calls to create the managed server or
modify the existing managed server we
have named credentials setup for both of
these so let's select those and now that
we've entered all the information will
click this deploy button now you can see
the job is submitted and we now see the
deployment status page if we click this
link we can see the status of the job on
this jobs page you can see it creates a
stage directory copies the jvm d engine
and scripts runs prerequisite checks to
ensure the ports are open and available
from the OMS and so on then deploys the
engine and we can see that it succeeded
let's return to the application
performance management page
and here we can confirm that the jvm
diagnostics engine was deployed we see
the jvm d engine details and the status
is running so we know the OEMs can talk
to the engine so that's it for deploying
a jvm diagnostics engine now we'll look
at deploying an ADP engine which has a
similar flow to deploying a jvm
diagnostics engine from the application
performance management page will click
add and then select application
dependency and performance engine on
this deployment page again you have the
two options to either create a managed
server or deploy onto an existing
managed server like with deploying the
jvm diagnostics engine you can only
create a managed server on a host where
OMS exists and if you're going to deploy
on an existing managed server it must be
a managed server within the enterprise
manager domain let's create a new
managed server the host drop-down list
shows hosts that have OMS installed in
this case is only one host so we'll
accept that the managed server name
defaults to what you see here like with
JVM diagnostics engine deployment the
final number increments automatically
until it finds an unused names as this
is the first managed server will accept
the default and will accept the default
listen port of 4200 and SSL listen port
of 4201 and for ad peeve is also the ADP
engine registry port the ADP Engine Java
provider port and the ADP engine
controller port these reports are also
incremental according to Oracle best
practices which would mean five 1099 the
familiar are
my registry port is the default the
deployment was it facilitates the
deployment of multiple ADP engines and
automatically checks that these ports
are open and available from the OEMs now
let's complete the credentials here we
need the same credentials as that JVM
diagnostics engine we need host
credentials for the weblogic
administration server and the
credentials for the WebLogic domain in
order to log in let's select name
credentials for both of these now that
we've entered all the information will
select deploy the job is submitted and
now we see this deployment status page
so let's select the status link and here
you can see the job performs the
different operations necessary in order
to deploy and register the ADP engine
let's refresh the page and now it's done
so let's return to the application
performance management page and here we
can confirm that the ADP engine was
deployed we see that the ADP engine is
connected to the OMS and we can see that
the status is up so that's it for
deploying an ADP engine in this demo I
showed you how to use named credentials
for the host and WebLogic domain but you
can also use preferred credentials that
simplify access to targets by storing
credentials in the management repository
and you can create new credentials
during deployment you can test them
immediately and select them as the
preferred credentials also if you deploy
an engine to an existing managed server
and that managed server is on a remote
host additionally you would need to
enter the credentials of the remote host
machine thanks for watching this
demonstration
