second of the three weekly lessons about
a record jet jet includes a collection
of components patterns and enhanced HTML
tags that you can use to control the
visual layout and navigation on your
page jet uses what is referred to as an
HTML forward design approach this allows
developers to use the html5
specification specifically the semantic
elements of HTML as the foundation of a
good page layout by using HTML elements
such as header footer section and so on
your application will be that much more
ready for meeting accessibility
guidelines as well as making the HTML
code much easier to read after you have
the basic structure of your HTML defined
you can use jet components such as edge
a collapsible OJ accordion OJ navigation
lists and off canvas utils to control
the initial page content display and
allow the user to access additional
content by expanding sections or
selecting a tab the architecture of tabs
and how you use them has been redesigned
over recent releases of jet let's go
into the tab bar section of the article
jet cookbook and take a look at how tabs
are done the applicable HTML element is
a J tab bar and within the LJ tab are
you define an unordered list as can be
seen here a variety of different tab
bars is defined in the cookbook as
always what is especially useful to take
a look at is the example at the end
using switcher which enables you to show
and hide content beneath the tab bar
relating to the currently selected tab
take a look at the info section here and
you will see that there is an urge a
switcher component which you need to set
up in your define block and then you are
able to use OJ's switcher and HTML
element to define the content beneath
the tab bar as a quick example notice
that here we have three tabs and as we
switch to a different tab different
content is displayed
in it how that is defined in our code is
shown here we have an ODI bar and we
have an OG a switcher importantly the
 attribute of each item within the
tab must match the ID of each tab here
we have three tabs with ID set to home
getting started and settings and beneath
that we have an OG switcher with the
slots set to those same IDs this is how
the tabs match up with their content
navigation component such as OJ conveyor
belt
RJ film strip and OJ Train used visual
arrows or dots that the user can select
to move backward or forward through data
in the next code demo you'll learn about
the oj filmstrip component here we are
in the Oracle Jett cookbook we're in the
filmstrip section and as always you see
a wide variety of different variations
that you definitely need to explore
before you start working with the
filmstrip component or any other
component very carefully explore the
variations and the related code and you
might find features that you were not
expecting and that could really add
value to your application in the case of
our code example we're going to
specifically take a look at the film
strip so the error visibility they are a
placement we don't need and directly
inside of the code we can just remove
that so that we can take a better look
at the code that is relevant to what we
are trying to do this cleans up the code
quite a bit so click apply and we only
have our film strip so here it is and
what you notice here first of all is a
knockout for each loop using knockout
for each the film strip traverses the
chemicals that are defined on the
JavaScript side of the code and for each
of those a div is created with an OG
panel with a specific background in the
meantime however when you look in the
Oracle Jets cookbook in the framework
section you
find a section called binding and
control flow and in before each binding
section you will find that there is a
special custom element syntax for doing
for each loops which you can use as an
alternative to the knockout for each
loop in fact you are recommended to use
this approach the knockout specific
approach is not recommended anymore from
Oracle Jet 4.1 onwards and in time will
be deprecated so take a look at the og
bind for each and try and apply that to
the og a filmstrip example in our code
we see we have a list of chemicals and
in our view we see a J filmstrip and
this reference we can use because we
have referenced the urge a filmstrip
component in our define block and then
the urge a bind for each is used for
each of the chemicals which we can refer
to as chemical very conveniently a
template is applied and we get the data
from the chemical the data attribute and
from that we get the name and that name
is placed within a span element not only
do you see here urghhh I bind for each
but you also see a J bind text which is
also new from Oracle Jet 4.1 onwards and
we can very conveniently use that in the
context of this example in standard
knockout here you would use a data bind
attribute but jet provides its own
custom element syntax which is more
convenient easier to read and the
standard way of working with jet and
when our resolution allows for it we can
see that we have an arrow on the right
and an error on the left for scrolling
left and right through the data that is
provided by our view model a
lay out pattern in modern applications
is the dashboard jet provides the ajm'
masonary layout component to help you
with this type of layout it's not
designed to be a complete page layout
but rather for laying out specific data
in one section of the page you can also
use edge a dialog and urge a pop up
components to present additional
information to the user on the mount
deciding and when to use dialog versus a
pop-up can be tricky if the panel will
contain from elements or action buttons
it would usually be best to use a dialog
if the purposes of the container is
mainly informative then the pop-up would
normally be used in this part you have
been introduced to a range of jet
components that help you to control the
visual layout and navigation on your
page for your homework for this part
take the tab bar or the navigation list
or another navigation component that you
might have used during this part of the
course and replace it with an IJ Train
component which you probably will not
have used yet so far
take the RJ Train component from the
cookbook and replace one of the existing
components that you have been using for
navigation throughout this part of the
course with an IJ train and with that
thanks for participating in the course
and we'll see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
