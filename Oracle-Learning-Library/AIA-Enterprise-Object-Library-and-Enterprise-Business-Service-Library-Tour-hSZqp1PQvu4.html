curriculum developer at Oracle in this
demo I'm going to give you a tour of the
application integration architecture or
aaaa
Enterprise object library an enterprise
business service library on this machine
AIA is installed under the Oracle AIA
folder all the metadata for AIA
is installed under AIA metadata and over
AIA components in the AIA components
folder here we're going to look at the
Enterprise Business Service library and
the enterprise object library know that
you can see a few more folders here than
a typical AIA installation as I have
also installed the AIA demo application
which creates some new folders let's
look at the enterprise object library
first this folder contains the AIA
Enterprise Business Objects
or eb o--'s and enterprise business
messages or ibm's MEBO is an application
and dependent representation of a
frequently used business entity and an
IBM is a restricted view of the eb o
that identifies the action to be
performed the core folder contains all
the core EB O's that are used across
industries in the eb o sub folder we see
EB owes that aia supplies for common
business users for example bank account
invoice person
and received payment here you see the
schema
and HTML files for the received payment
EB o and E BMS the schema file for the
eb o is this received payment eb o x SD
if we open it up in WordPad we see the
xml that defines the structure of the eb
o but an easier way to view the
structure of the eb o is to open the
corresponding HTML file here you can
easily view the structure of the
received payment eb o you can read the
description and you can see the
attributes of the eb o you can find out
more about these attributes simply by
clicking on them here we see the
information on payment method code for
example that the payment type values can
be cash credit card direct debit etc if
we go back up the file we can see the
child components and if we click on one
credit card payment
it actually takes you to another file
the schemer for common components which
is where credit card payment is defined
common components contains definitions
for commonly used components likewise
for eb ms we see a schema file and an
HTML file let's open the HTML file and
here you see the structure of all the
messages used for the received payment
bo the name of the EBM also identifies
the operation that the message is used
for the first IBM we see is query
received payment IBM if we click on data
area it takes you to the quick query
received payment data area below this is
the definition of the day the area of
the CBM if we click on one of the child
components it takes us to a common
definition as you can see the received
payment schema files are stored in this
v1 folder which means there's only one
version of this IBO but if we look at
another IBO for example the sales order
Evo we see that there are two versions
v1 and v2 the AIA enterprise object
library contains the schema modules and
various stages of their lifecycle each
eb o evolves at oracle because of bug
fixes or customer requests so oracle
creates new versions but some customers
may need to use old versions because
they rely on certain properties in that
version and the new version may not be
backward compatible so the enterprise
object library contains all existing
versions of an e bo now let's go back up
to the core directory
the common folder contains common
components schema module this schema
module contains definitions for global
elements and data types these common
components can be used by any eb o in
this schema module is imported into each
IBO schema module the common IBO
folder contains eb OHS that are used by
other eb OHS and the custom folder
contains its own common common eb o and
IBO folders here you find the schema
modules that you can update to customize
eb owes these schema modules contain
placeholders for your extensions in the
enterprise object library you also see
this industry folder this folder
contains eb OHS specific to certain
industries such as communications
insurance etc now let's look at the
enterprise business service library this
library contains the service definitions
that are delivered for all the eb OHS
present in the end price object library
the files here are the wisdoms of the
AAA enterprise business services or eb
asses if we look in core we see the same
folders for all the eb o's we saw in the
enterprise object library
and here you'll see the wisdoms for the
received payment EBS if we open this
file you see the code for the EBS wisdom
this file identifies the operations that
this EBS performs for example query
received payment as well as any input
and output arguments for each operation
so that's it for our two of the AIA
enterprise object and Enterprise
Business Service libraries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
