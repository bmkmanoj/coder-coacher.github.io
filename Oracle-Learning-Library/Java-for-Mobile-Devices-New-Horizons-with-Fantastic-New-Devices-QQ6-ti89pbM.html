I'm very happy to start the one of the
very first sessions on mobile java and
embedded track my name is Michael
simmering I've worked for finnish
company called future ice and we are
software project house helping our
customers to create great digital
products for the past 12 years and we
work in Finland Germany UK and we
literally cover all mobile platforms and
all web platforms and we got to work a
lot with Nokia also and with the Nokia
developer organization we are helping to
create the developer training for
different platforms and all kinds of
interesting projects and one of the one
of the technologies that we are using is
mobile java on their series 40 platform
and this is something that we are going
to talk about today because they've
released pretty interesting new devices
this year and they are non Singh some
new devices also just couple of weeks
ago and this is something that very
interesting to talk about because in
North America and Central and Western
Europe Scandinavia developers are
concentrating on the smartphone so much
and then basically it's if you walk down
the corridor in here and java 1 and talk
to your fellow mobile developers you can
you can hear the questions like aren't
all people in the world are using some
kind of Android and iPhone and the
answer is no actually majority of the
people in this planet I using the just
as small and inexpensive mobile phones
and both of them I actually mobile java
powered and this session about this
platform what's new on the nokia series
40 devices and i hope you enjoy it and
to make it more interesting i really
encourage you to ask all kinds of
questions at the end of the session and
for every person who will ask question
we'll have some
giveaways from Nokia the the USB keys
with the Nokia and some nokia t-shirts
and the best two questions will get
actually this nokia asha 303 the full
qwerty and capacitive touchscreen mobile
phone and there is a bluetooth NFC with
digital noise cancelling so please ask
me questions okay enough about
introduction let's go on I have four
goals today first of all I for those who
are not familiar I'll tell a bit about
nokia mobile platforms then we'll talk
about what's new in those series 40
platforms on in the mobile java and then
i'll show a little bit about tools we'll
talk about application compatibility
we'll talk about porting and then
finally we'll talk about the basically
the business opportunities that you as
developers do happen the companies do
have if they are working with different
kind of mobile java platforms on
especially nokia asha series and if you
take a look at all the devices that
right now on the market and this is the
whole range of mobile java devices that
are coming from nokia j and as you can
see the scale is huge because we are
talking about the devices in the retail
price range from 30 to 120 dollars and
we are talking about unsubsidized prices
so this is a full price and then most of
these devices you just go to the store
you buy them without contract and then
you pop in your sim card and that's it's
something that quite unusual in states
but that's totally normal in the rest of
the world and some of these devices i
actually do all seem so you can pop two
sim cards with the different operators
and one business and one for personal
use and all of these devices are mobile
java and the if you see the more
traditional one they are either qwerty
or with the Navy pad and with the soft
keys and the last part in here what you
can see the
nokia touching type devices that combine
the touch input with the keyboard and
the very last device they were announced
this June we are talking about full
touch devices that remodel the look and
feel of the meat p and we are talking we
are going to talk about those devices
mostly today and for example what we've
got announced during 2012 we have the
cheapest series for tmobile jama device
nokia 100 series we are talking about
price range thirty thirty-five dollars
and then we have full qwerty landscape
the device asha 302 which actually it
has a gigahertz CPU at the cost less
than one hundred dollars so the mobile
java is flying in there and at the at
this side we have this full touch asha
311 which is the fastest the mobile java
device released up to date from the
nokia and iming in the series 40 and
there are at least five new devices
today and three of them already in
consumer hands and people are trying and
using them right now already so let me
see let me show you that these devices
we are talking about price range within
seventy two hundred and twenty dollars
if you consider them as the premium
mobile java devices in the consumer
space and it is almost smartphone like
experience but these are very simple
mobile phones they do have budget cpu
they do have small amount of memory and
they do have mobile java as the
development platform for the third party
developers and at the same time the jump
from the traditional soft keys and the
qwerty and the t9 keyboard the
a jump is so significant because the
look and feel of the devices is
completely different let me show you one
short video how it looks like now and
remember what you see here it is not
advertisement of the smartphone this is
a mobile phone that is within a within a
hundred dollars price range and we are
talking about totally new user
experience and whatever you see here
it's basically meet p it's a standard
meet p that you can package into those
interesting devices and with the premium
games that are coming with the devices
and all of these that you can see here
available for you as the third party
developer so that you can put together
your apps and you can you can you can
ship them with these devices all right
so right now we have how many we have
five devices they are combining
different hardware specs we are talking
about the CPU range between 200
megahertz and one gigahertz and we have
small amount of memory in there and they
are really really fast and they're
really really cheap so the next part we
are going to look at how different UI
today that you can see on the series 40
devices what's new you get the new nokia
sdk 20 for java and it comes with the
new nokia ID that the Eclipse based or
as the Java developer if you're familiar
with the NetBeans you can integrate this
with the your NetBeans and mobility and
at the same time but there are some
changes at the meat p how the mid p is
look like on the on this new full touch
experience and at the same time there
are some extensions with the nokia you I
that we are going to talk about then you
have lived that was optimized for
serious 40 you it is quite become
complex library and to make it run on
serious 40 within those small memory
footprint it's quite a challenge and
there was a special project where the
people the developers actually optimized
for the memory footprint and for all the
new native features that are available
for the developers and of course for you
developers the new features would be the
how do you work with Nokia Maps directly
from within your applications that are
just tiny tiny jar files within two
megabytes of the of the jar file size
that you have available and how you can
work with the multi-point guesstures how
you can work with the sensors and what
are the api's you can use for monetizing
your applications and these are you I
components that you can see and they are
available on a full touch asha devices
and at the same time they look nice and
great
what else the most important part that
these are just standard LCD UI
components so if you have been creating
midlands for like like five years ago if
you just bring this midlet and you run
on these devices it will automatically
pick up platform look and feel with this
component and it's actually pretty cool
because in most cases if you've been
targeting mobile java platforms before
you don't have to at least on a UI level
you don't have to change the component
set you of course might have to change
architectural and ideological the
approach is how you develop if you're
jumping from the keyboard to the full
touch and full touch you oh I we have
240 x 400 pixel screen that is available
for the developers and there are new
ways how you would handle the standard
meet p keyboard inputs because we used
to have soft keys right we used to have
an avid pad and now it's all gone on a
full touch and located very interesting
work they introduce special areas they
introduce the action buttons they
introduce a category bar so that you can
no matter if you've been developing for
keyboard based phones you can still have
them available in the new system menus
that we have in the action buttons and
there are two new extensions there is an
icon command that is extension of the
traditional command from the LCD you I
where you can customize the the icons
and you can customize how just a
standard mid p commands look like and
there is a new category bar that is not
part of the meat p and it's quite simple
class and it allows you on the meat p
devices and on the mobile java devices
to create the tablet user interface
something that you had to do as the
custom user interface before and if you
allow me to go ahead and start the
emulator of course that's pre-recorded
video i'm not controlling it with my
mind so this how today full touch
devices
look like and if you jump to the
netbeans and just with the standard
visual designer without writing even a
single line of the code if you drop in
standard LCD UI components with the
visual designer let's see how to look
light on the emulator so what you get
you get automatically the kinetic scroll
and something that you had to do as the
custom before and now for example let's
drag some commands if we'll put some
string items on the screen and will
chase some titles and let's turn the
string item into the button and in order
to do so you have to associate it with
the icon command and let's add some
action when you click on this button
you'll get some kind of alert and these
are all i would like to repeat this a
whole standard meet p and lcd UI
components and you can customize
everything visually in the NetBeans and
this is one way how people are actually
learning mobile java and you associate
the item command with the with the
button and then here we go if you just
jump and start it on emulator you have
platform look and feel automatically
without writing every single line of the
code and what is really interesting in
here that if i'll start drugging the
standard item commands that look like
the for example soft keys menu before
now you'll get them in the special
action buttons area and at the same time
you can use it on on a totally non touch
devices because it will give you come
backward compatibility now let's talk
that was about the standard LCD UI and
now if we talk about Lewis who is
familiar with Lou it at least one person
is familiar wizard great
so luid is quite old son my persistent
project that will create the totally
custom UI available for small footprint
devices for the set-top boxes and at the
same time for mobile phones and this is
a standard standard meet p library that
allows you to create totally custom user
interfaces and it is quite a challenge
to bring it to the really really small
footprint devices because you have to
deal with the severe memory limitations
if you are talking about for example $30
device right and Luet was optimized for
serious 40 during this summer optimized
means that all those new AP is that were
modified in standard Nokia
implementation of the meat p they were
changed to utilize all those new
features and at the same time support
nokia you i guess chairs and there is a
special project at the nokia developer
website that you can check out and you
can get all the sources at the same time
and the loot is basically swing like
swing style development on the mobile
platform so what you see here we create
just a regular forms and setting up
transitions and you are putting up the
standard layout managers and standard
actions and you're just adding this
component just like you would add on a
swing form that's what luid brings to
the mobile platform put to the meat p
and you have it up and running with just
few lines of the code you can add to
your standard LCD standard meat p
platform you can add the transitions and
you can add totally customizable look
and feel because one of the strong
features is a really scheming or
reteaming of the entire platform and
with the serious 40 up to
version of the loot you will get
automatic picking up of the platform
theme that will be in your custom Luet
application and what is really
interesting about loot that you can ship
special resources where you can
completely recast ah mais entire theme
of your lewitt application and in this
resource file I have right now added two
themes and you can Lord dynamically
those themes on the fly in the device
and we'll just uncomment two lines of
the UI manager that will pick up the
standard team number one and you have
reskinned your application without
reprogramming so basically you can after
the even the application was compiled
you can create new themes and you can
ship them and you can rebound all them
in the jar file and now we'll change it
to the second theme and what we have
here is totally different look and feel
that was changed just as the resource
without touching computer user interface
and again guys I would like to repeat
that this is something that you might
find as quite usual in the smartphone
world but we are talking about
applications that are living within two
megabyte of the application size and
with the maximum for megabyte of the
available java heap space and to fit all
of these into those is actually pretty
awesome believe me okay let's move on
there are series of demos on nokia
developer website when you download or
if you download the PDF with the
presentation after the conference all
those links actually active so you can
check them out there are several demos
that were optimized specifically for
serious 40 and I would like to show you
one of the actually pretty complex
applications that was created with Luis
library it's pretty pretty big and at
the same time it demonstrates quite a
lot of complete customizations that you
can get rid of if you want to you can
get rid of the platform look and develop
completely different user interface it
was written in the form of the puzzle
game so where you can create totally
custom user interface you can simulate
windowing user interface and for example
you can in this specific application
there is also Illustrated how to manage
memory quite efficiently because it's
graphic intensive application and you
have to fit it into the small scale
again and it was also integrated with
the device camera and the pretty cool
part of the nokia sdk emulator that you
can enable your you can enable your web
camera of your computer and it will
become the this is me and it will become
the camera feed and so I'm taking the
snapshot on the emulator so I can
emulate completely hardware of entire
phone and then I just turned it in the
into the slide puzzle my face ok so that
was about luid and again if you are not
familiar with the mobile job at the LCD
you I it's the way how you develop with
the standard platform provided user
interface and that's the way how mid
'let's were created for ages at the same
time if you want to create the totally
custom user interface you are doing it
with the canvas basically just drawing
your applications and LU it was done on
top of the canvas drawing and it gives
you the swing alike architecture in your
mobile java applications let's move
forward and mobile java picked up on
nokia platforms the touch and if you
consider meet p that the pointer events
they were available for a really long
time but what is really interest
because now on those inexpensive and
budget oriented mobile phones we have a
touch which is basically multi-point
touch and this is not part of the meat p
so they got to be extension in the nokia
you I how to handle those multi-point
touch events and you can register gaster
listener and there are at least
different kind of guesstures right now
we see the tab long press drag and drop
flick and pinch to zoom and this is all
available on the mobile phone user
interface and I have a short demo that
illustrates at the same time the 3d
capabilities of this budget oriented
platform and at the same time we are
registering the standard gaster listener
there is a special guest registration
manager where you can just register and
listen for the specific guesstures and
all you have to do also support the
orientational changes because those
devices now are coming with
accelerometer and it's very simple you
just build the switch constructions
where you just recognize different kind
of guesstures as the Evans and you have
them implemented and in this specific
example we are loading 3d objects this
is a real 3d it's not faked 2d it's done
with the GSR 184 and when you are just
dragging your touch point across the
screen you have the rotation events and
we are applying those on 3d model right
in the emulator you can jump into the
landscape mode where is the correct
reorientation of the touch events and
what is really interesting and it's a
little bit weird way how emulators
support the multi-touch you can
pre-record your guest chairs and pinch
to zoom guess church there's a special
recording manager where you can record
one by one complex even so for example
I'm dragging from the center to
and then you can execute them at the
same time and you are simulating the
pinch to zoom on this platform as the
recording and exactly the same way what
you can do is you can record the
backwards so I'm pinch zoom in a
negative and then I'm executing those
guesstures at the same time so this is a
gesture recording manager that you can
use and it's pretty decent if you don't
have direct access to the device so this
is a guest chair recognition manager
that you have on the platform but at the
same time if you don't need gas church
if you really really want to track
multiple points then you have access to
the lower level multi-point touch events
and the cool part that right now it
supports on the low end it supports the
two simultaneous touch events and you
can assign actually IDs to each tracking
points and you can track them based on
the ids and it's pretty interesting and
you can have a call backs when those
idea the positions of those uniquely
identify touch points are changing and
it's a pretty straightforward not as
small amount of code as before but you
have to register multiple touch events
in your application and this specific
application is just receiving pointer
changes and it's dragging ass or
tracking IDs and based on those IDs just
drawing with the different colors so
it's a very simple paint application
that support multitouch drawing and all
you have to do is recognize where we are
touching down and releasing our touch
points and that's where we are creating
the drawing Evans so here is a very
simple illustration again we are drawing
and each new drawing will be with
different color and we can use again the
multiple gastrous recording so i will
record drawing to one direction and not
a direction and then I will execute them
at the same time and each time it will
be drawn with the different color and
right now it's a simulation on two
fingers are drawing in the same place on
the screen alright if you want to play
with the device later I have the actual
devices in here so these devices if you
have a time after the conference session
so these are real production devices so
you can play with them and see the
smoothness of the user interface ok and
now let's talk a little bit about
sensors again the sensors API it was
available for a really long time it's
part of the meat p but it totally
depends on the device vendor which part
of those sensor api's are going to be
physically implement intent which are
not and this is a very interesting and
unique that this is really budget
oriented device and it does have
accelerometer in there which is pretty
decent and pretty accurate it means that
on very very low and you can provide the
gaming experience with the accelerometer
which is pretty similar and equivalent
to the high-end smartphones if you draw
your graphics in a really nice way and
if you build your application in such a
way that architectural e you will
decouple your drawing loop and you will
decouple the for example sensor queering
loop so it's not like wearing-- sensor
is driving animation but basically you
can have a separate threads and in this
way on really low power devices you can
create pretty pretty stunning gaming
experience and I have a short demo again
with the emulator it's a car racing game
that draws 3d graphics with GSR 184 and
it's using standard sensor API with the
meat p however we can query the platform
if we do support the accelerometer and
if we do support accelerometer on this
platform then you can get the respectful
channels to register those accelerometer
Evans and during the processing sensors
all you have to do is just to get actual
accelerometer data and convert it into
the euro for example game action and
what we have here infinite running
surface and with some kind of car and
some kind of trees and there is a new
accelerometer assimilation where you can
just by dragging the device you can
start controlling it's very simple code
and at the same time if you're buying
for example $50 device and you get this
experience I think it's a it's pretty
remarkable because again I would like to
stress we are talking about not
smartphones these are regular mobile
phones and you can simulate all kind of
the accelerometer Evans with the
emulator and I guess I'm not very good
driver as you can see i'm running
through the through the trees all the
time okay so that's about accelerometer
what do we have next the next we are
going to talk about map api's map api is
some kind of a hot topic lately because
of another newcomer to the to the space
of the mapping api's and it's the really
the question of who is getting it right
and after what time but the cool part
that the famous nokia maps are available
on series 40 platform and in some
devices they are coming with the
pre-installed mapped city data so you
don't have to spend your bandwidth for
downloading the map tiles and map
information and what is really really
nice that you can integrate those map
api's into your midlet into your meat p
standard platform midlet you can get the
Nokia Maps and there are multiple levels
of API supported from the very simple
just displaying the map based on the
given coordinate and you can use Nokia
Maps search you can use reverse
geocoding and you can support the KML
and all you have to do is register
yourself as a developer it's free
program and you just have to acquire the
keys to run the maps and there is no
approval process it's instant proches it
you just have to associate map keys with
the specific application and that's all
and we have very very short them on here
so of course the maps are coming not
from the standard need be but from the
Nokia classes there is a calm Nokia Maps
package and all you have to do is create
the instances of map canvas that is
extension of the standard canvas and
hear the part where you just have to set
up those keys that you acquired from the
Nokia prove developer program and then
in this application we are creating the
very simple standard list with the
pre-recorded coordinates of different
cities as the one view and when we
select the screen I would like to jump
to the Nokia Maps and I'm just getting
the display to the canvas and then
whenever the list is selected I'm just
jumping and forcing this map canvas to
the specific coordinate and when you run
it on the device you see there was a
request for dual sim there is a
simulation of dual sim operations and
when I select the card I can use its
specific data connection and I'm getting
access for example now we select
helsinki finland and with the multiple
zoom levels and now it's loading tiles
live and you can zoom in all the way to
the street level and even more to get
the local merchant data etc etc and now
we are jumping to the to the other
finished city called tamper and then of
course we have to go to the London and
where you can see for example the also
all kinds of met
and you can draw custom interest points
on the map you can get the custom
interest points from the NOC here and
it's pretty nice inflexible API and it
works really fast and again we're
talking about four megabyte heap space
where you can fit all of these okay and
compatibility if you haven't been a Java
developer or mobile java developer for
other platforms then it might not be an
interest for you but at the same time if
you've been involved in to the mobile
java for a long time then of course
bringing your old midlet to the new
platform is always a challenge however
the cool part that there's a full binary
compatibility you can take any sun
microsystems example from the web from
web archives that is like five or six
years ago one of the Sun Microsystems
all tutorials on the meat p and you can
drop them in to these new devices and
they will work and they will smartly
remap you're actually hardware-based
keys to those new action buttons and
action menus and at the same time if you
build with this new sdk you can drop
exactly the same meet p jar file to
actually older devices or the devices
that do not support the full screen
because if you are using the LCD UI
components that's the benefit of
actually standardization that multiple
vendors day if they support mid p they
got to support this as the standard so
it works and interesting solution for
for example if you were using some kind
of a game canvas and you were using the
gamepad or you are using the number pad
for making your game actions and you are
wearing the keyboard all the time right
and if you drop it to the full touch
devices there's no keyboard there is no
simulation of the key part in there but
what is happening you can enable the
mode where when you are actually doing
the swipe gestures or
drug gestures you can simulate the
navigation pad so you can bring all meet
p games to the new platform with the
increased performance and you don't even
have to rewrite the keyboard queering
manager because it's kind of you can
simulate it directly on the game canvas
and there are a few ways how you can do
of course if you care about your
customers you really have to do the
optimization in terms of how you build
their architecture etc etc so there are
multiple layers how you would do that
for example with the high level you I we
are talking about standard LCD UI as we
discussed before it's a automatic
conversion you don't have to do anything
special and the most of the work will go
into the custom graphics because lots of
people were creating their custom uis
and of course one of the major
application development was done on meat
p into the games and you have to change
the of course the screen resolutions and
you have to take here increased amount
of speed on the devices because if you
were working with the devices that are
some arm ish cpu below 100 megahertz and
now you have a gigahertz device then you
actually have to rewrite your
architecture a little bit so it will be
actually manageable in terms of the game
speed ok and when you would like to
utilize the new api's for the guest
chairs and multi-touch there are ways
how you can build even with the single
code base and target multiple device
groups and it's done with different ways
you can do it on the IDE level you can
create multiple builds with the
basically if depth especially working
really well in the NetBeans you can
query the device api's during the run
time and there are multiple of training
webinars at nokia website that train you
how to do that and also if you take a
look if you being a for example a
blackberry developer for a long time and
here looking
or jumping your applications to the
java-based blackberry phones that
serious 40 there are multiple ways how
you can do that because there's a parent
match between the standard full QWERTY
landscape resolution devices and this is
something that is the concept that was
brought by blackberry and when you are
moving that to the new full keyboard
devices you can do various different
things in there but you again have to
remember that we are talking about
full-blown smartphones and we have to
scale it down to the mobile phones with
the low memory footprint and Blackberry
developers they are using the rim
extensions for the meat p or basically
they have their own application
framework that was written on top of the
on top of the meat p and of course you
have to do quite a lot of changes in
there but if for example you are working
with the this slide illustrates that now
you can actually jump also with the full
canvas and full touch devices the cool
part that if you are making the games
for blackberry then you're writing you
don't have to do anything you can
basically just recompile with the nokia
sdk because the games are created with
the canvas on blackberry's also so the
converse based games and game canvas
based games that are in BlackBerry's you
just have to reroute the blackberry
api's into the meat pap as for example
there are blackberry maps api shin it's
almost one-to-one match on the api level
how you work with the the conceptual day
a little bit different but it's not
significant work to take your blackberry
applications and drop them in to the
serious 40 platform we have big set of
tutorials at nokia developer website
where you can actually do this step by
step guide lines how to transfer your
blackberry applications how to pour them
to the serious 40 which parts of the
platforms are easily portable and
which are not and there is also quite
big sash section how to take your
existing Android applications and how to
scale them down to the mid p with the
Nokia api's and now let's talk about the
business opportunities that developers
do have so right now there are three
options how you as developers on any
mobile platform how you can make money
to our standards in application
advertisement and the in application
poor chases and of course commercial
apps but do we have at this room iPhone
or Android developers please rise your
hands come on don't be shy do you guys
are you guys in the app store do you
make enough money to leave one year from
the application purchases know and
believe me nobody does so the question
is that on any store there are multiple
ways how you can make money and out of
hundreds of thousands of developers who
are in any store there is only handful
of development houses and big gaming
houses who are making decent money there
is even smaller amount of people who can
sustain their family for one year but we
are not talking about like multi-year
process of sustaining yourself with the
application development and for those
who do have steel dreams that they can
make money with the app stores there are
two ways how you can make money in
application advertisement that can bring
you revenue into your free applications
and the in application for chase's
because if you are part of the game
studio or if you are part of the big
application chain then you can get
guarantee that your platform will be
shipped in the store in the big amount
of money numbers and then it make sense
to use in application advertisement and
a Nokia platform there are two in
application
advertisement vendors interactive and be
served at ma be and at the same time
there is an in application poor chase
API that is available for serious 40
right now and I have listed devices in
here and at the top and the second line
these are expensive mobile phones that
are in the range from fifty to hundred
dollars but take a look that Nokia 100
series these are the smallest and most
inexpensive series for t mobile java
devices they are like thirty dollars and
the in application poor chase is
available for those devices also and
those devices that are shipped in
hundreds of millions of units outside of
United States in the Europe and I'll
show you some statistics in the end what
kind of numbers we are talking about but
the cool part about the full range of
the nokia devices is that the set of GS
RS is almost identical across the all
these devices from the laws and to the
high end with in this price range so
it's really easy to target multiple
devices and i have recorded very
interesting video in here so this
application was created by my colleague
Paul actually and it's a simulation of
the purchase process and we are
registering special product IDs so that
you can ship your applicationthis drm
game items inside and only during the
purchase process when you will get
notification from the server that those
items were purchased you will get those
drm items deactivate it sorry activated
and if I'm using this you see I'm
getting stuck on the query to the server
but the cool part that you can unplug
connection from your computer and you
can simulate anti-poor chase procedure
with the offline API so you can have
complete simulation of purchase process
offline which is actually pretty decent
and what I'm showing right now I'm
adding those
product codes that are inside my jar
file drm and i will run here with
different pricing model i will run
simulation with the offline server porch
a server simulation when I am purchasing
those items so right now there are no
purchase items I'm going to the store
and I'm getting the list of all items
available and I'm doing the purchase and
this image it was drm unlocked right now
I will go again and table by the second
item and I have it available in here and
with all those api's there are multiple
checks for example you can verify
certain items we have purchased already
so this is a pretty full blown purchase
API that is integrated with the Nokia
accounts on you on your devices and
there are multiple ways how you can use
that you can bundle your drm items
within the jar or you can buy just
activation keys through the store for
example you can enable trial mode or you
can for example allow access to the
specific parts of your website so the
devices will be a purchased devices will
be purchasing the API different kind of
items later so this is something that is
available for third-party developers
today and we are talking about
microscopic payments but if you scale to
hundreds of millions devices that are in
there that brings us to the very
significant numbers and the last part i
strongly recommend you to check out the
remote device access so there is a lab
in finnish city called temper in nokia
where they have literally hundreds of
devices mounted in the dark room and you
can query access totally for free to
each individual device and you can get
to those devices you can see the remote
screen of device you can upload your
items in there yuge arson there and if
we do have
actually the network connection I can
briefly actually show you how it looks
like so this is a forum where you query
specific device and for example I can
select any of these devices and let me
select one of the for example let's let
me check this one I can book it for 15
minutes directly in here and what I got
right now I got the java web start small
part and i'm launching it directly in
here so i have it on my secondary screen
and so that will start I will drag it to
you if we do have access okay so this is
a java web start application and what it
does right now it is trying to connect
to the remote device access right now
and if we have the network working but
it seems like Oracle network is pretty
down at the moment okay it's really slow
okay so this is physical screen of the
device located in Finnish seated pamper
and I just got 15 minutes access to this
device directly from this room I am even
simulating the wisdom I click the touch
and so this is a physical device that is
sitting somewhere across the ocean and
Finland and you can upload to this
device your local applications i have a
form on this screen so where you can
this is a file system of the device this
is your local file system so and if you
don't have access to physical devices
that that's the way to go it's pretty
nice ok let's go back to the slide this
is starts that they want statistic i
want to show you that we
got official permission from Nokia to
show there are 675 million active nokia
devices serious 40 devices active means
they are physically connected to the
store today so these are active for
chasing accounts and there are four
serious four to eight hundred thousand
items available and the cool part that
they have now 16 million downloads day
and all together there were six billion
downloads since the nokia store was run
but the cool part that during the first
billion only thirteen percent was coming
from syrians 40 and the last billion
over forty percent was coming from 640
so we are talking about huge amount of
active users who are at that platform
right now and there's a pretty long text
what kind of developers are achieving
which kind of downloads and we are
talking about at least three big
developer houses in who are reaching
over 100 million downloads and we have
500 developers who are having modern
million downloads 63 development houses
more than 10 millions 41 / 25 etcetera
etc the interesting part also about that
that again we have such a huge
opportunity in here but we are talking
about like hundreds of thousands of
developers right so the best business
models that exist today when you're
targeting mobile platforms is associate
yourself with the big vendor with the
broadcasting house with the operator and
do subcontract them so or let them
subcontract you because people do not
like buying stuff from the stores they
would like to get stuff for free from
the stores and the it seems like the
current tendency right now that only
when you are associating yourself with
the big company and you are due
subcontracting that's the place where
you're actually making very nice profits
that's how we operate how our company
operate I would like to say a special
thanks to our colleague from Nokia and
recycle who was making
huge part of these materials available
and thank you very much and I hope that
you would have some questions because we
have at least some giveaways and we have
at least 10 minutes for questions thank
you very much yes please yeah and the
emulators are free everything is free
yeah with a profiler that is yes and no
so basically the historically the every
SDK the targeting new platform so you
can use older SDK targeting the
platforms that we released before and
you can install them simultaneously you
can have multiple SDK living on the same
computer and they are not conflicting it
just have to run them one by one so
that's the way of course yeah yeah so
what you have you have few options with
the Nokia eclipse-based SDK you have
automatic profiler you can select the
device based on the specific category
and then I'll show you actually pretty
cool thing that is extremely helpful
again if we go to the Nokia developer
website there is a device matrix
if of course the Oracle will let us go
there let's try again yeah the network
is working so there is a device
specification and what you have here the
huge list of all nokia devices ever
released and you can start pretty
complex expert device filtering and in
here you can specify each individual
parameter whatever you hear you want for
example this screen size you want this
amount of memory and then in here you
can specify all of this and you can get
the full list of the devices that are
supporting specific specific device
matrix and please come forward you
earned yourself this wonderful tea yeah
of course this this is for you any other
questions yes a lot of being spent
when it's a hardware yeah and it's being
compared to smartphones a lot so how do
you think the gap between these phones
and smartphones will change it's pretty
difficult to say but at the same time if
you've been watching the last year last
week's they they released two new this
touch asha 308 09 and some of the
agencies are calling them official
smartphones even they are not exactly
and and this this difference will be
blurred over time more and more so this
is a hundred dollars one gigahertz CPU
super powerful mobile phone because the
we're talking about it's some kind of
arm 11 well-armed each cpu in here
gigahertz armage cpu but for the
developers what we have available here
on the phone megabyte you have a heap
space and now try to bring any of the
bigger complex application so you have
to do still quite shuffling but the low
memory footprint and for example there
is no gps hard win here so the point of
having maps in here to get the external
gps over the bluetooth or to use cell ID
and cell ID works pretty decent in here
so we talked and why is though because
it's like something like six to five
times cheaper than any next cheap
smartphone cheap smartphone well they
were they were quite a lot of
comparisons that for example this device
provides kind of the same functionality
as the original iphone because there is
no multitasking and there are all kinds
of background executions that are not
possible but at the same time you do
have access to the to the maps you do
have access to do to the phone books etc
etc it is very interesting world we are
living in and i strongly encourage us
developers who are living in US and
Central and Western Europe and
Scandinavia to actually look outside of
the bubble
of the smartphone world because we are
talking about such a huge amount of
people who are using these it's really
really interesting and of course you
earned yourself whole city wednesday
1130 i'll show you the same app running
on a high-end android phone and on that
phone and you'll see it's actually in
many cases faster on this phone simply
because of differences in ok any other
questions you guys write as you write
them support to several devices or do
you Ryan three we are software
subcontractor we've been doing it 12
years we've right natively always we
have super like talented developers the
entry barrier to our company is pretty
high and so we get guys who can adapt
themselves to different platforms and
jump like on a daily basis in my team we
used to run like 12 projects at the same
time and I'm talking about team of 10
people within the company who are
targeting the specific group of the
applications and we run like easily
hundreds of projects every year and we
discovered that if you are indie
developer you are finding trying to find
all kinds of ways how you can minimize
your time expenses and that's where the
cross-platform nests and cross-platform
api's and universal API as they do come
handy if you are big subcontractor you
want to provide the best user experience
ever you're always right nature so
that's that's the approach that we found
out it's really who you are what kind of
business model you you are doing that
yeah but
come on wednesday i'll show you another
way yeah yeah a plus can you write a
accelerometer based 3d game with the
phonegap oh yeah that out hmm yeah but
trust me those billions of people out
there they don't care about you saving
your time using the phonegap they just
want the best app for free now so that's
that's the reason yeah you had a
question over there sorry yeah be if you
download this free SDK you can get
pretty interesting the access to
basically what happens underneath and
you can profile your applications on the
pretty deep level within the SDK with it
with the emulator the it comes to a more
limited scale when you are going to
develop to the actual devices because
the on-device debugging it's kind of
cumbersome at the same time again you
can use the good old way how we used to
do it like 20 years ago you just do
printouts in the code to the console
that's how it works actually so yeah and
please come forward you have yourself
also be this fantastic d they do the
item in here ok yeah about the browser
support for this so again series 40
platform there's no WebKit you can't fit
what web key to this microscopic amount
of memory so what they did they created
they bought some company what was the
name yeah it shouldn't be opera but it
wasn't oper so they bought another one
yeah number they bought this company
they have a proxy browser so there is a
there are server farms in Mountain View
in China and somewhere else yeah someone
feeling there are server farms what you
get you have all the content compressed
on their side
and sent you to your browser so the
browser's okay ish but then if you
remember it's it's a mobile phone and it
calls 30 euros it's fantastic that one
more additional question from percentage
split like how do you see the Android
like worldwide android/ios versus you
know nokia of the pure Java ME devices
if if you compare the total shipments of
the smartphones with the mobile phones
their recent stats as saying that we are
talking about at this moment 900 or
close to a billion smartphones shipped
and we are talking about several
billions of the mobile phone shipped so
that's you have a t-shirt that's falling
off my table okay please yes please they
are going to kick me out now but please
go on
jpg PNG animated gifs of course not yeah
get yourself the key and I will select
you as the receiver of this and you as
the receiver of this NFC headset thank
you thank you and if you want to see the
device please come forward and just
check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
