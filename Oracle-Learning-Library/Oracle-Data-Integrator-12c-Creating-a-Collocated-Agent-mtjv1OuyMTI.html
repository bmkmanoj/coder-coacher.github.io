welcome back everybody that has been
attending the previous two presentations
of cou previous live events and if this
is your first time this is the third of
four live events for ODI all four of
them are walking through the Oracle by
example learning modules that are on the
start page of ODI so when you install
the ODI product right on the start page
it says do these four tutorials and so
if you want you can go back and do these
tutorial yourself or you can go to o ll
you can do WWE or comm / go to / o ll
and then search for ODI 12c and you can
find these as well so you can go through
and do the fulfil disclaimer that your
mileage may vary this happens to be live
code it's 12 that 1.2 but as patches
come out things may look a little bit
different so the particular environment
we're going to be exercising today is
using database 12c and it works
perfectly fine under other databases it
works for my seat wall it worked for IBM
db2 and it will be using ODI 12 1.2 as
we met them it presumes that you have
some basic knowledge of sequel and the
agent in particular is going to be
discussing WebLogic server it turns out
that you have to have WebLogic server
somewhere if you don't have it installed
ODI will install it for you
it's required to run the studio though
it can be entirely under the coverage
that you will alright and then again
assumes that we have some basic
knowledge of the database as I mentioned
this particular Oracle by example exists
at this website and if you don't want to
type all that in you could simply do a
search for oh L l.o.v.e
Cody I 12c and you'd find it as well
so what we're going to do is we're going
to use the GUI part of ODI and the GUI
part is called ODI studio ODI studio is
made up of these four components and
we're going to spend most of our time in
the quality one form which is where we
create the agents in the previous
examples the previous OBE we did
designer and quality Bowl so where does
this fit in the big scheme of things as
I mentioned we're going to be using the
studio and we're going to be using
topology in the studio and what we're
going to be doing is configuring the
eight the agent needs to run in some
sort of a JVM so it could be a
standalone agent and a VM or it could be
in WebLogic server in which case is just
an application within that or you could
have a separate JV ethical so there's a
lot of different ways to do this which
sort of begs the question which which of
the environments are we going to do
let's let's just kind of recap this a
little bit more cleanly there are three
very distinct environments distinct
environment number one is I have
WebLogic server and I intend to use it
so if I intend to use it
and what I can do is I can make a je e
agent and that's what you'll see on the
ODI options is je e agent and if you do
the agent will exist what you need to be
quiet in WebLogic you need to start it
and WebLogic and it assumes that
WebLogic sided phone domain domain
controller it's got us on that servers
so it assumes that you've got the full
administration of WebLogic that's not
what we're going to do today the second
option is you could have WebLogic out
there but you could choose to ignore it
if you choose to ignore it then what
will happen is a ODI will install enough
pieces of WebLogic to use it but it will
make its own domain controller megaphone
matted servers and it will be
responsible for
starting and stopping the agent itself
and so that's what we're going to do
with the standalone quote located April
which is what we're going to do today
its standalone in the sense that it
doesn't use WebLogic server but it's
co-located in the sense that it can use
some of the libraries of local server
the third option is where there's no
WebLogic server at all and if you're
going to do that where you have some
other data the problem is you lose
studio so this is actually an
unrealistic single environment but it
may be part of a larger so suppose you
have a ODI in a distributed environment
where there's an ODI master console
somewhere and that's got WebLogic server
and then you may have eight or ten
databases distributed around the country
each one of them could be running in a
completely standalone level if you want
to do that then there is a separate OBE
which you can use and vote this OBE and
that one point to each other and it will
show you the different steps but
remember if I'm in completely standalone
mode there still must be WebLogic server
somewhere to run the studio right so
that's the environment we're in be
playing one let's do the actual demo and
as I had mentioned before this is a VM
that is running Oracle Linux but it
could just as easily be running
Microsoft Windows and we're going to be
let's look at the stuff that's out here
okay
we have Oracle 12c database but if it
just is easily be 11 database and so
we'll be running that in this particular
case we're going to be making procedures
that load tables and in order to do that
we're going to need agents and so this
first part of the OBE is to make the
agent and then on Friday we'll make the
scenario that load tables so the
ultimate target is going to be a an
Oracle 12c database but it could just as
easily be any other day we have ODI
installed middleware and as I mentioned
Cody I must have WebLogic server in the
same little where home if you don't have
a license for WebLogic server it will go
ahead and install a bit that means
anyway in order to use that stuff okay
so let's proceed on and if you're
following along in the OBE what we just
did is we describe the environment with
that instead of doing a je e agent which
would require a full web logic
administrator knowledge and instead of
doing a completely standalone but
there's actually an unrealistic
environments because somewhere there
needs to be web logical we're going to
do the middle of the three which is a
standalone quote located it stands alone
in the sense that WebLogic server is out
there but we're not that's the
co-located part is co-located with
WebLogic server but it's standalone in
the sense that we will not use any of
the WebLogic server commands to
administer the agent itself
okay so let's charge him the first thing
we want to do is we want to configure
the domain that's going to help this so
you can see that we are in the ODI home
and so we'll switch to the common bin
and in there we're going to do some web
logic things so we'll do config that
shell script which will make a domain
now you may find config that shell
script in other directories as well for
instance there's one in the webblock 4
but this is the one we want to wanted to
help you so we launched it which will
invoke the GUI and since we are ignoring
the fact that WebLogic servers out there
we want to create our own domain by
default it's going to stick it in the
Fusion Middleware home user projects
domains and it will call it baseball
mode if I was using WebLogic server the
full power of it I would update an
existing bubble so we'll take the
defaults here just simple pate involve
and the templates that we're going to
use are based on how we installed ODI if
you install the ODI standalone you would
not see half of these things but because
we installed ODI EE we have a bunch of
different options the one that we want
is the standalone co-located and so by
checking it you see that it picks up a
couple of other things as well what you
don't want is the Oracle data integrator
8 if you do that and you'll need to
deploy it using WebLogic server or some
other thing yet so we want to standalone
co-located click on next
if you're familiar with WebLogic server
this is going to look like very much the
same screens waiting for it to invoke
so it's going to ask for the name of the
domain user and for purposes of this
demo I'm using the same password
everywhere that way oh another thing
there are password complexity
constraints on this particular password
needs to be one capital letter I need to
be mixed case needs to have a number
needs to be a character so tells you
right so we'll just put in welcome 1
since this is a JVM it wants to know
which KBM so we'll just take the default
or a hotspot just take a default on that
now this panel you need to do two
separate things the first thing we want
to do is put in the full service name
and then we want to change the host now
in this particular case we're assuming
that everything is all in one host in a
realistic environment you probably will
have agents distributed around your
environment and that would be the case
where you would run a completely
standalone agent so we configured the
service table this divided development
service table we configured that with
part of our Cu and the password for it
was welcome one and then what we want to
do is just what it says click the get
configuration first notice that next is
not even an option what so we click get
configuration first it was kind of like
test and it verifies that we can
actually reach all of those things and
now that it figured out what that schema
looks like for the service table now the
next is available so we click on next
now this is a little bit tricky in a
traditional WebLogic server
configuration wizard it makes a
configuration file which are completely
standalone and don't actually impact
anything however what's going to happen
here is that it's not only going to do
that it is going to it is going to write
things so this particular configuration
wizard is going to write to all the opss
information and because it does actually
write to there if you change your mind
and decide if you don't want to use this
particular domain that you've created
you must run RC you a second time you
get exactly one shot at doing this
because it writes to opss if like I said
if you change your mind if you want
become different you must create a
second or yet another opss schema using
our see you so bear in mind we get
exactly one shot so we'll say ok this is
our first thought for the next it
verifies that it can reach everybody
it's just fine and so this is the same
information we filled out before if your
systems were located on different posts
you would reflect that over here and
both so nothing to do here we are
it already did the test selected we've
been great in essence you don't need to
do that again we'll click on next and
you must select system component it's
not selected for you but unless move all
these other options here would allow you
to do more sophisticated WebLogic things
which are beyond the scope of this o ve
t and are unnecessary but you must go
ahead and configure system from home so
we'll do that click Next and now it's
going to start meaning the aprile's
since we only have one agent we can
accept the default if we ended up having
multiple agents we call the next one a -
- agent 3 etc and the only choice we
have is ODI oh there is another choice
didn't reveal it though so we want the
ODI combined with the default so we
haven't actually changed anything so we
click on next
and this server listen port is the
server listen port for the agent we need
to remember that number so write that
down somewhere
the supervisor username for ODI and
supervisor and the password can't
possibly be that long then we type over
it with welcome one and so the only
thing we changed is the password and you
have to write down the listen port so
then we'll hit next you have the option
of doing some WebLogic painful we're
going to ignore that I'll take that off
Eugene
you
you know the option of assigning the
agent to different machines but they
only got one so we will just take the
defaults on it
this is mostly a summary you probably
aren't going to do anything at this
point but this is all the stuff that
gets installed all the score table if
you had an existing WebLogic server
going then
it probably has some of these things in
it and we would simply extend it with
the agents but here's you see these
pulldown here's the opss stuff we talked
about here's the actual agent stuff so
blurry there don't know why that's
blurry but that's the actual application
we didn't do this no it's just making it
works
I never mind okay so we're not going to
do anything to it we're just looking mol
so we're going to click on create
and it does the first part very quickly
and the opss as you remember before
that's actually writing something so
this is not just simply making a domain
the way a regular WebLogic server config
wizard would do this is writing
something to the database as I mentioned
if you decide that you later don't want
to use this particular domain then you
must either clear out the RC you or run
RC you a second time to make another opf
F there's exactly one agent per opss
schema you can make multiple opss emails
but it's a different process we go ahead
and Google but since this is our first
one we can get do at this phone so it
takes a couple seconds for this happen
and then once once it gets passed open
the SSO goes very quickly okay you'll
notice that once it got passed opss on
the left when the rest of it goes very
quickly
don't let that 0% fully effects we
almost done
see that nothing like incremental
updates right so those zero zero zero
zero on eleven
meanwhile this domain v so it finished
successfully that looking for and if
you're curious you can manage the thing
using web console again that presumes a
fair amount of WebLogic server
familiarity we will choose not to
administer it that way but rather to
administer it throughout guy so we'll
just simply click on finish ok so that
completed section one of the OB week the
next step is to start the ODI part so we
flip over to the studio and we're going
to run the studio shell
so this will start back up
and we've already created all of the
topology we created the repository did
all that work in the previous OB es by
the way these are the tutorials I was
mentioning the leader in the middle of
doing this alone to create an agent and
so if you install o di you can come back
we do these at time and then Friday
we're going to do computers and scenario
technically you could do these in either
order but you need both of them
completed before you can get it actually
done
so rather arbitrarily will do the agent
part and then we'll do the procedures in
the scenario set so we want to connect
to the repository we've been playing
with we've got the various logins stored
in a wallet so here's supervisor and
welcome one which would by the way what
we put in that domain so we'll sign on a
supervisor that will populate the
topology with what we've been doing
and if you remember a Monday we created
the file generic and we created file
generic under ODI demo file we also
created Oracle DBA char DB HR we get all
that on Monday and that's still there
good thing what we're going to do today
is work with the ADA so when I click on
agent you see currently there aren't any
when I ran the load of the continence
table the last time it said using local
agent with exactly no agent at all so
what we want to do is we want to make a
new agent
you
the name of the agent is what we saw in
the lizard and that needs to match local
host is correct and this needs to be
changed you remember we wrote down the
number doesn't have to be this number
you could use any number you want as
long as they both match so we change the
name to mess with the wizard was
creating we said if we did this again
with that agent too late agree agent
double-oh seven and then the port needs
to match as well so they got that taken
care of this is an italic and the
diskette shows up so we click on the
diskette it then saves it this becomes
not italic and then it now shows up as a
list of eight ok so now that that's
created notice we did not test it yet we
just simply have it registered in the in
the database the next part of the OBE is
step two we just go and see what that
just created for us so let's go back to
the loops
let's go back to the command prompt and
if we go to Fusion Middleware home user
project's domains base then it created a
bunch of things for us in particular you
see that we have a start and stop
commands for WebLogic server in
particular I want to mention the node
map node manager is a pool of WebLogic
server that will try to restart
processes if they were to crash or the
server comes back up or basically it
manages the start reading of background
services so that's an option you can do
as it is we're going to start the Athan
manually however if there's a disaster
you'll need to restart the agent manual
so at some point in the future you may
want to look at possibly fiddling with
the node manager but this is the thing
that we're going to use and so we're
going to start the agent manually by
doing agents and then we want to specify
the name that we have been working with
this one is going to be agent 1 and some
other machine is agent 2 etcetera and
remember we had to write down the port
number and so we're going to start that
agent since this is the first time I've
run it on this machine I'm going to get
tons of output so there's a lot of Java
things that need to be loaded a lot of
classes need to be found and it's going
to spend quite a bit of time telling you
all about that
so remember is heckling the port echoing
the host address here's all of the jars
that are coming if I run this
second time all of these jars will
already be loaded and so it will go much
faster and what I'm looking for at the
very end of this
is this message here the scheduler is
started for work repository Warcraft on
18 so and so on for twenty nine nine ten
so everything looks happy so we're going
to leave this running you need to leave
that window right so while we leave it
running we go back to OD I you know I
think it'd be fun if I could watch this
in the background and now we're going to
click on the text so the agents running
in the background now we click on the
test and it works they had we not
started the agent the test with a pill
so you leave this leave this open start
the agent to the background and then you
can run that okay that completes the
physical agent and if you remember the
last time we did this we had both
physical and logical if I look under
logical remember we had logical files we
set up my flat files which was the DB HR
we also set up a logical architecture
for Oracle just to show you what that's
still out there we set up a logical
architecture of the DBA for that matter
all that stuff and in the same way if we
have a physical agent we need to set up
a logical agent so when I click on the
plus you see I have a Denny so what I'm
going to do is make a new logical agent
and the new logical agent is going to be
called anything I want doesn't have to
match anything and it has a context of
global remember here the context that's
the only contact we've got but we could
have other contexts like development or
production and the physical agent that
it matches to is the only one we've got
and then we save our work for it and so
now the agent exists
okay if we're interested in looking at
it we can double click on it and that's
all there is
so it's pretty simple so not a lot going
on with the logical items
the physical agent is defined over here
and then the and if we test it we should
see this actually pop in the background
here so that it's sitting in the
background waiting for the scheduler to
schedule some work right and that's
pretty simple so that's the that's the
extent of it
so we configured the agents we use the
domain configuration wizard to make a
WebLogic server domain and it's in the
traditional location where we add that
sort of stuff so if we flip back over to
oh this is where we are we're in user
projects domains base domain then which
is where that stuff normally live and we
created a physical and a logical
representation of it and now it's
waiting for the scheduler so what we're
going to do on Friday is we're going to
come back and create several scenario
procedures and then scenarios which is a
compiled for Cooper and then we'll leave
this agent out there and then we'll run
just for kicks let me just show you
something real quick if I stop the agent
from here and then restart the agent
you'll notice it'll be a lot less verbal
because that those jars are already
processed so we saw that message before
the host in question
and that's it so you see all of that
verb if you saw it before about
processing the new guard that's just a
one-time thing and if we flip back over
to the ODI that should still be
successful for testing and one last
experiment this to prove that is
actually doing something I'm going to
stop it again and now when I flip back
over to the agent and now when I
pestered you could fail because it's not
running so that concludes what's going
to do in the demo the agent so far is
sitting out there with nothing to do on
Friday as I mentioned we will come back
and create a procedure which is going to
in our example will populate a table and
then we'll schedule it and the schedule
is what invokes the agent the ages
sitting out there waiting for the
scheduler and the scheduler were then
throw these scenarios which are compiled
with features to run at a later time all
right well thank you everybody this was
a little bit on the shorter side that
will you know we needed to break at a
logical stopping point and so we'll
continue again on Friday all right thank
you very much and that concludes this
Olo live event Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
