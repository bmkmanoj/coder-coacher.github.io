responsible for getting the data into
the system and filtering the data in
before and here we have a as we call
this a beautiful knowledge base so this
is see the data store which is which
comprising out of free I'd say at least
logically free data sources existing
data sources that that customer one has
at the moment our ontology so basically
for RDF and all WL structures which we
are storing here and and data reservoir
for doing this this text enrichment and
storing all the data which is coming
from from from from the from the media
proxy then we are doing semantics and
text enrichment so here is the NLP
module which is running on top of the
data those data are from back propagated
to the to the system to be stored in a
in the beautiful knowledge base so that
they can be used then for the further
processing by reporting dashboards or
graph visualization tools we are also
focusing using the use of the discovery
tool here we are relying on Big Data
discovery to let write people in the
organization of the customer to inspect
the data and see what's inside the data
before we will create the rules before
we will reach our existing risk
assessment component and so before we
are going to make all those changes
applied in the runtime we do this any
outside discovery mode here so we are
looking at the data as they arrive and
we are trying to find out maybe there
are some different sources maybe we
should look at something else maybe we
should add some metadata maybe we should
change maybe an LP engine because it's
not doing the perfectly right job as we
want it to be so that's that's more or
less the if the the architecture
unfortunately we have we have different
requirements from from the customers or
maybe fortunately from your actual point
of it's always very interesting but from
we've what we found out that some
customers are
are also interested in getting the data
from the cloud so so we do have data as
a service customer intelligence as it is
called now this is X SRM listening
module for those who are a little bit
familiar with our cloud offering which
provides the interface to to collect the
data from from the internet let's say
based on predefined topics or for all
specific criteria so this is something
which is also available then over the
relationship detection we are again
putting the same the data in the same
pipeline and we are doing more or less
what I've already explained to you and
now probably the the most important
thing for for you as we are as I like to
tell few things about how we store the
data in graph databases and how we
visualize them later on so this is this
is the the the version of the
demonstrator which is based on semantic
graphs so semantic RDF graphs in the
database so after the NLP and after
storing the data in the big data lights
in Hadoop cluster we store the data in
the RDF data stores and then after
series of steps so first of all through
Jena and sparkle we were acquiring the
data then we using this Jes it's C it's
a free library that you can use for for
for visualization grab visualization
purposes network visualization purposes
so we created our own graph builder on
top of this library at the moment we are
also using cytoscape so this is the
discussion we had with with with JSON
some few weeks back and we started to
migrate the the social intelligence to
cytoscape j/s because there's another
version of of cytoscape specifically for
the use above in the web applications so
it's a JavaScript library so I'll show
you this in a moment and then over up
the rest services we are exposing this
application logic to at
moment Oracle apex but this is obviously
a place for some fully-blown portal
solution here that was one approach and
the second one was based on property
graphs so this was once this was
announced by by the team a few miles
back we we decided to that it's probably
slightly easier way to represent the
data at that point in time where we were
obviously in spatial and semantic graphs
in the data bytes are very powerful and
of our letting us to also express the
further if the knowledge description in
forms of ontology and all this stuff but
we found out that for the moment we also
need something a little bit simpler and
something fun which could be used by us
specifically here in a Big Data
environment because if one's property
graphs were announced they were
announced as a component also of Big
Data appliance and we're based and are
based on no sequel database which is
bundled with a big data appliance so we
ported the solution and by using tinker
pop blueprints which I think we used
even today and again graph builder and
the same more or less the same logic we
we've we embedded this time in Big Data
discovery because we had number of
requirements from the customer ok we
want to have graphs inside the place
where we do the discovery so we want to
see this how this works
and how those data might be correlated
in this way or another so that's why we
we embedded this into the into the
discover tool and just recently we have
a little bit structure the our approach
to to graph spider as we call this
component now to visualize the graph
data but this is something that may not
be that much relevant for you now
probably it will be a bit clearer when
we run the demo so now let me switch
what you see now it's the dashboard with
with with the dummy data loaded you can
zoom in zoom out you can try to edit the
data so if this graph is obviously to
some extent editable obviously it's it
was not our intent to make this to embed
those editing capabilities because we
expect this graph to be created
automatically but if someone really
wants can create some sort of additional
edges or or or note in the in the graph
and if we use the color code that's
approach so basically all the nodes has
their own meaning and and and and are
representing special type of objects so
in the in the middle you see now the
black ones which are people social
handles which are social accounts let
four four four four for our discussion
let's let's let's assume these are
social accounts all the social
identities which done which this person
has in the internet we can obviously
link some some some internal data
sources like police checks and other
stuff and the the most interesting
probably here is these are the messages
and metadata associated to those
messages so for example Eve this message
was about riots and Canberra this kind
of data would be extracted from this
message and would be coded and and added
to this graph as a metadata so analyst
has a very quick and instant overview of
the situation so assuming that he works
on a certain case he can filter out the
graph which is relevant only for him and
have all the out say important
information available for for for him
for further analysis obviously we can
filter it out so well the the
possibilities are almost endless so so
so this is something which is based on
RDF here so whatever you can wear with
RDF and whatever you can transform into
some sort of network we can visualize it
here and
yeah so that was the idea that's another
view I think very interesting view it's
this one where it shows for example
what's which people are particularly if
connected with certain topics of
discussions or certain locations so it
may ring a bell for someone or it may
raise a flag to some analyst that's
something it's bad it's going to happen
somewhere and yeah go ahead at the
moment you know but we have this kind of
option both on and if obviously on the
data well we do have in the risk
assessments component we we take
different types of threats and we
consider them differently so we are
using different weights at that level
but for the visualization purposes we
are not expressing this here but this
could be easily added so we can add the
property to the nodes and the vertices
for example underneath we do have much
more data then it's visualized here so
we do have a types of relationships
connected connecting those people we do
have attributes connected to those so
this is this is this is quite complex
stuff underneath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
