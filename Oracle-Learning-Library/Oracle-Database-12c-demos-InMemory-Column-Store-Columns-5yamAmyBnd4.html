I work for Oracle server technologies
this is the fourth demonstration of
seven demos about in-memory columnstore
a new feature introduced in Oracle
Database 12c this demo illustrates how
columns are handled by in memory objects
in the I am current store verify the
size of the I am Colin store with the
in-memory size instance parameter to
gigabytes have been allocated to the
in-memory columnstore let's connect
under the SSB user and create an
in-memory table with three Collins
insert data and verify that the
in-memory attributes are written in the
data dictionary its priority being none
you can see from VI M segments view that
the segment data is not populated yet in
the I am Colin store data selection is
requested to populate the data in the I
am column store you can also see from
dollar I am call see you view that the
columns are not populated in the I am
Colin store select the data and verify
that the data is now populated in the I
am Colin store the dollar am segment
shows that the segment is completely
populated in the I am Colin store and
vidura I am calcu shows that three
columns are populated in the I am Colin
store also by default all columns of an
in-memory table inherit the in memory
attributes of the parent table note that
only in-memory compression or no in
memory can be defined for selective
columns columns can
not have different in memory priority
nor in memory distribution since they
are all populated together more rows
have been added in between in the IMC
t-table all values of each column are
populated in the I am Colin store in IMC
use in memory :
units this example shows a table with
three columns and all values for each
column stored into two IMC use each the
performance of queries with simple
predicate against the I am Colin store
it's much better than the same query
against the buffer cache because the I
am Colin store has access to the minimum
and maximum values of each of the
columns for each amcu
if a query searches for Col one value
357 I'm see one of cone one is pruned
out based on minimum and maximum values
and only I'm see you two of the same
colonies can't
Videla I am call Cu view shows four I am
city table only one row per column and
therefore one I am see you per column
because there are very few values per
column each eye MCU displays its minimum
and maximum value now add a new know in
memory column to the table reselect the
data it does not force a population a
repopulation on the existing imc use the
in memory attribute is only reflected in
newly repopulated imc use so move the
segment and reselect the data the dollar
I am calcu view shows now that the new
Cullen is missing in the list
because it is an O in memory :
change the no in memory :
to an in memory color reselect the
gutter as we said it does not force a
repopulation on the existing I am see
use viola I am color see of you shows
that the new in memory color and is
missing in the list so move the segment
and reselect the data now fedora I am
calcu shows the new : in the list with
no values for the moment create a No in
memory table with an in memory :
and you see that it's not possible this
is the end of the demonstration and
