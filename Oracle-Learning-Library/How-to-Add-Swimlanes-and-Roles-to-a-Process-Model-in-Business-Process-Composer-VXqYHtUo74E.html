curriculum developer at Oracle in this
demo I'd like to show you how to add
swim lanes and rolls to a process model
in business process composer this is the
second demo in a series of demos on
modeling a business process using
business process composer let's assume
you are modeling a simple sales quote
process and your model has five user
tasks in it at this point all the user
tasks are in the same swim Lane since
each task will be performed by members
of specific roles you want your process
model to look something like this where
each task is in a swim lane
corresponding to the role that performs
the task where do you start notice that
the swim Lane is currently labeled
unassigned role since the first task in
this process will be performed by sales
representatives let's assign that role
to this swim Lane move the cursor over
the current label of the swim Lane and
click the pencil icon if the sales
representative role existed you could
select it from the drop down menu since
it doesn't exist yet you need to create
it select the create option and type
sales rep and press ENTER notice the
swim Lane label now reflects the role
you created creating a new swim Lane
enroll is easy just drag a task below
the current swim Lane notice this new
swim Lane is labeled unassigned roll the
business practices review task is
performed by users with the business
practices role there's actually a quick
way to create a new role just click the
label and type it right in
it's as easy as that the swim lane
labeled now reflects the new role you
can continue in this fashion to move
tasks into new swim lanes and create new
roles as needed when you're done your
process model could look something like
this
and that's it for adding swim lanes and
rolls but check out the next demo in
this series to see how to add gateways
to your process I'm Rosie pillar thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
