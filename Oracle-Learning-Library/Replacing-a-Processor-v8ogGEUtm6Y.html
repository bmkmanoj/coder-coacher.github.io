and later service note this component
should be handled only by an Oracle
qualified service technician important
notes this video contains an overview of
the CPU replacement procedure for
comprehensive service procedures and
prerequisites see the service manual for
your server use a correct processor
replacement tool for your server which
is listed in the service manual access
oracle documentation at doc's oracle com
to replace the processor first remove
the heatsink gently apply pressure to
the top of the heat sink while loosening
each retaining screw one-and-a-half
turns at a time continue loosening the
screws until all four screws are
completely disengaged a thermal compound
applied between the heat sink and the
processor acts as an adhesive do not
allow a thermal compound to contaminate
the workspace or other components to
separate the two components gently
wiggle the heatsink left and right while
pulling upward use an alcohol pad to
completely clean all thermal compound
from the underside of the heatsink and
the top of the processor keep the
heatsink to use with the replacement
processor to access the processor
release the two retaining levers
open the processor load plate to extract
the processor use the replacement tool
press the center button on the tool to
the down position orient the replacement
tool on top of the processor so the
triangle on the corner of the tool
aligns of the mark of the processor note
the tool must be correctly aligned to
engage the tool with the processor push
the locking tab on the removal tool away
from the center button to remove the
processor lift the tool out of the
server turn the tool upside down to
release the processor from the tool push
the center button upward to remove the
processor hold it by its edges and lift
it out of the tool to attach the
replacement processor to the tool push
down on the center button and turn the
tool upside down pick up the replacement
processor by its edges and with the
circuit side facing upward position the
processor in the tool so the mark in the
corner of the processor is aligned with
the triangle on the side of the tool set
the processor in the tool to lock the
processor press the tool release lever
an audible click indicates that the
processor is locked in place turn the
tool over and align the tool with the
processor socket
gently lower the tool until the
processor sits in the socket caution
irreparable damage to the processor or
motherboard do not press down on the
processor note ensure the tool sits
evenly in the socket and is not
misaligned push the center button to
release the processor lift the tool from
the processor the processor remains of a
socket visually check the alignment of
the processor in the socket when
properly align the processor sits flat
in the socket closed the processor load
plate lower the socket retaining levers
to the fully closed and locked positions
use the supplied syringe to apply point
one milliliter of thermal compound to
the center of the top of the processor
do not allow the thermal compound the
contaminated components or the workspace
position the heatsink over the processor
and align the heatsink screws with the
screw holes in the motherboard lower the
heat sink onto the top of the processor
once the heatsink contacts the top of
the processor avoid moving the heatsink
gently apply pressure to the top of the
heat sink while tightening each
retaining screw one-and-a-half turns at
a time continue tightening the screws
until all four screws are completely
engaged</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
