with use cases and examples what is
identity management it is using
processes and strategies to manage the
security of user identities and
applications there are three major
functional areas for identity management
one identity governance - access
management and three directory services
identity governance one of the areas of
identity governance is identity
provisioning for example when a new
employee joins a firm here is a few
identity provisioning steps issuing a
badge to get into the firm setting up a
VPN account to log in remotely from home
providing access to an email server
self-service and other applications
based on this new employees role in the
company for example if they're hired as
a manager they have access to HR
applications that a regular employee
does not have access to
similarly when an employee leaves the
company all of the above resources need
to be deep provisioned another area is
password management if I forget my
password then I can go to a forgotten
password workflow and that allows me to
reset my password based upon
knowledge-based questions such as my
mother's maiden name or other questions
that I set up when I registered with the
system so when I answer those questions
I can reset my password
what is role management provisioning can
be based upon users roles and
responsibilities for example all the
curriculum developers who are under
Fusion Middleware automatically have
access to X Y &amp;amp; Z applications so
managing the access to these systems is
more robust than giving access to each
end-user separately another area of
identity governance is auditing if there
is an audit in your company or the
auditors want to know if there are
sufficient controls to manage access to
certain systems there is a mechanism of
providing that sort of certification
level with Oracle Identity analytics you
can generate analytical reports to see
who has access to which system and when
and what did they ask for and so on so
analytics can be gathered against those
systems what is a privileged user
account
there are certain accounts that are
shared accounts for example sis DBA
account with an Oracle database or a
root account on a linux server if you
want to perform certain operations you
need to log in as root another example
is the directory administrative account
in Oracle unified directory if you want
to perform a directory server
administration task on an LDAP directory
you need to log in as super user these
accounts are highly privileged accounts
and they are shared accounts so what is
the problem with that if I perform a
certain task as root nobody can tell who
exactly did that so how do we ensure
that these shared accounts are also
highly protected accounts as a solution
Oracle has a product called Oracle
privileged account manager that allows a
user to check in and check out these
highly privileged account passwords and
every time the user wants to log in as
root this program will randomize and
automatically generate a password every
single time a new one and that person
will use it in log in as root once a
user is done with his or her operation
he or she has to check the password back
in and then someone else will be able to
check out a password each password that
the system generates is unique to that
user so the system can tell which user
logged in as root and did which
operations Oracle Identity Manager
Oracle Identity analytics and Oracle
privileged Account Manager are some
example products for identity governance
now access management access management
product area focuses on activities
related to authentication and
authorization authentication is the
process of determining who a user is for
example a common authentication
technique is to request a username and
password from a user authorization is
the process of determining what a user
has access to for example you might be
authenticated as a valid employee to
your firm but you might not have
authorization to access some systems
outside your primary area of work
authentication and authorization can be
complicated when dealing with a large
number of systems and a wide range of
possible
authorization x' Oracle access
management provides functionality to
address the access management complexity
with capabilities like single sign-on
and managing authorization granularities
with single sign-on the user uses a
single username and password to
authenticate once and then access all of
the available systems without
re-entering his or her credentials
otherwise you may need to provision a
single user with hundreds of usernames
and passwords
what is authorization granularity
authorization level can be coarse or
fine grain if you are trying to access a
certain URL course level authorization
defines whether you can access that URL
or not fine brain authorization defines
what you can do on that page such as
what features are enabled or disabled on
that page what check boxes are grayed
out on that page what prompt on icons
are available to you on that page now
let's talk about identity Federation
Federation is establishing partnerships
with various third-party applications or
servers as an employee when you join
your firm you may also get access to set
up your retirement account this
retirement account may be outsourced
through a third-party service that
specializes in retirement accounts you
can log into your firms intranet and
click on the benefits link this benefits
link can take you to the third party web
site to access your retirement benefits
without asking for your username and
password because there's already a
partnership established between your
firm and this financial firm Federation
allows you to go from one domain to
another domain from your firms domain to
a third-party domain so that the
identity of the user which has already
been authenticated at one end can be
used to provide access to different
services at the other end in a
transparent seamless fashion so this is
Federation and Oracle identity
Federation allows you to address this
area
with the advent of mobile smartphones
and tablets access also involves
managing access to those resources so a
firm may provide some employees with
corporate smartphones and to be able to
ensure the security of those smartphones
or tablets there has to be a mechanism
of providing authentication and
authorization audit so for example if
your smartphone gets lost automatically
all the data on it can be erased by
corporate IT staff the applications that
you can install in a corporate
smartphone could be dictated by the
corporate policy so if you try to go to
an app store to download an application
which is not allowed by your corporate
standards it might deny you access to
install it even though from the app
store there are no restrictions on
downloading that particular application
you could also have a single sign-on
through the mobile device so if you have
logged into your firm's intranet on your
browser and then you try to invoke an
app which takes you to the same link on
that intranet it recognizes that you're
already logged in and it will not
challenge you for your username and
password again and this is having single
sign-on on your mobile device
the social aspect of access management
is gaining a lot of popularity these
days here's an example you can access a
news website and customize your end user
experience by personalizing that website
when you first register as a new user
the news website may provide you two
options either you can create it your
registration set your username and
password and answer certain
knowledge-based questions and then you
create your user account to access the
website and then personalize it another
option is that it may allow you to use
one of your social accounts if you have
one these social accounts already have
established social identity of the user
in the Internet and you can use them
without creating a new account with this
news website an Oracle has solutions for
this access access not only means users
trying to get access to various systems
it could also mean web services trying
to get access to other web services for
example I am trying to get a loan for my
I can go to my bank and apply for a home
loan the web service which is processing
my application at my bank for the home
loan might want to talk to a certain
credit bureau to see how my credit
score's so my bank site gets my credit
scores from other web services so there
should be a web service - web service
security as well
besides username and password
credentials there are more secure ways
of handling authentication which are
called strong authenticators when I do
online banking I want to ensure that I'm
talking to my bank so when I register an
account with my bank they say pick an
image and a phrase that goes with that
image and that image goes with the
password page when I want to log into my
bank if I don't see my selected image
and phrase on the password page I should
now log in to that website because that
means somebody else is trying to be my
bank another example for strong
authentication is keylogger attack when
you enter your username and password
through your keyboard there are these
key loggers that record your keystrokes
and play them back and find your
password so to prevent against keylogger
attacks certain online banking websites
provide you virtual keyboards you click
on those virtual keys to enter your
username and password
rather than using a physical keyboard
and another example is using
knowledge-based questions for fraud
prevention so let's say I log into my
bank's website and now I'm trying to do
online transfer of money from my
checking account to my savings account
and I try to transfer $10,000 it will
say you're transferring from your own
checking to your own saving so it allows
me to do it now let's say I want to
transfer money to another person there
is a threshold for example there's some
$1,000 per day if I meet this threshold
they will let it go through but if I try
to transfer more than $1,000 or if I try
to do multiple transfers within a single
day then they challenge me with
questions such as what city were you
married in or what was the first car
that you owned which are questions that
I have pre-registered with the website
another example I always do my online
banking transactions from my home in the
geographical location in Bolton
if there's an online banking request
from a very different location it will
think something suspicious is going on
so it will either challenge me or it
will send me a randomly generated pin
through my email if I have
pre-registered my email or it will send
me a text message if I pre-register my
mobile phone with my bank and I have to
enter that random pin on my login screen
before I can login and it will also
provide an expiration for example within
five minutes it will automatically
expire so I have to enter that PIN
within that timeframe these are called
one-time passwords or OTPs this stop
based credentials that is providing
access to systems based upon your
Windows laptop desktop credentials once
your firm's employees login to the
Windows operating system they can go to
any website within your firms intranet
so the bottom line is all the examples
in this bucket what they are trying to
do is access management some examples of
Oracle products are Oracle
access manager Oracle mobile and social
access management oracle identity
Federation and Oracle Enterprise single
sign-on directory services directory
services provide directory access for
user information these services are
designed for very fast access along with
the ability to both structure directory
information in a convenient reverse tree
structure and unified directory
information from different service
providers LDAP directories are compliant
with LDAP v3 standards and lightweight
directory access protocol the Reavers
tree structure enables very fast and
convenient wearing of the directory with
questions like what users are in San
Francisco and in the technical sales
team a unified directory can help if you
have multiple directories in your
organization for example if you have
Active Directory from Microsoft a
directory from Novell and Oracle unified
directory you do not have to synchronize
this data across the heterogeneous
directories you can still give the
applications or the users a unified view
of all the data store
in different directories by creating a
virtualized unified directory so this is
it for a high-level view of identity
management with use cases and examples
