hi this is matt from the Oracle
primavera curriculum team in this video
we'll look at the Primavera cloud
administration application 16.1 this
application provides a simple way to
manage users for Primavera cloud we'll
start with an overview of the Primavera
cloud administration application which
will refer to as simply the admin
application Primavera cloud users are
stored in an application called oracle
identity manager or oh I am the admin
application works by writing information
20 IM and offers a simple option for
managing users versus doing so directly
in know i am inside the admin
application users are stored in a table
options are available to quickly filter
by user status you can select multiple
filters then use the only option to
select a single filter you can also
search to find users when you select the
checkboxes for users buttons become
present with actions that are available
for those users to add a new user start
typing in the blank row at the top of
the table enter basic information for
the user such as name organization and
user type then add provisioning for the
user in this step you assign roles and
application instances in order to grant
the desired access in Primavera cloud
when finished save your changes a
notification indicates the changes have
been processed any errors will be
reported here and the log will provide
additional details for further
investigation after creating a user it
may be necessary to configure
permissions and privileges within the
applications they have access to once
this is complete select the checkbox for
the user then click the reset password
button this will send the user an email
with its
brary password note that there is no
prompt to confirm this action or save
changes and the password reset is
executed immediately users can also be
imported in bulk from a spreadsheet to
do so first create a template for
entering user data click actions
download import template add the roles
and application instances to be included
in the template using the shift key to
select multiple options when finished
click OK then click ok again to open the
resulting zip file two items will be
present a readme file with instructions
on using the template and the template
itself inside the template add users by
entering their basic information to
provision roles and instances enter a y
in the appropriate columns when finished
save the spreadsheet to import the users
into the application click actions
import users then select the spreadsheet
to add or remove provisions for a user
select the checkbox for the user and
click manage provisions use the right
and left arrows to add or remove
provisions when managing provisions for
multiple users the list of available
roles and instances is presented select
a role or instance then select the
checkbox for a user to add access or
clear the check box to remove it users
can become locked after too many bad
password attempts they can use challenge
questions to reset their passwords and
become unlocked but if there is an issue
with that process users can be unlocked
in the admin application select the
checkbox for a locked user then click
unlock this action is executed
immediately after unlocking a user it
may be necessary to use the reset
password button to send the user a
temporary password when users leave an
organization or otherwise no longer
require access to Primavera cloud their
accounts should be disabled select the
checkbox for a user then click disable
disabled users can be enabled again
select the checkbox for a disabled user
and click enable these actions are
executed immediately there are some
actions that cannot be executed in the
admin application a user's general
information such as name and email
address must be edited directly in
oracle identity manager after doing so a
service request should be submitted to
support to replicate those changes in
any Primavera cloud applications a
service request is also required for
modifying the automatically generated
email notifications and changing
authorization codes thank you for
