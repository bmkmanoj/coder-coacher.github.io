you how to use the mobile expense
management module to enter update and
submit expense reports these features
can be used by employees to manage their
expense reports using their mobile
device from anywhere they have service
imagine how quickly an expense report
can be processed if the expense can be
entered at the time it is incurred
rather than having to wait several days
to have access to the web applications
i'll be using an iphone for today's
demonstration but remember you can also
use blackberry and android devices as
well as the ipad so let's get started as
you can see i have added the expense
management icon to my iphones desktop so
all i need to do is tap on it to get
started this is the user authentication
screen for our mobile apps you just need
to type in your standard JD edwards user
ID and password and of course if you
make a mistake you can also correct it
you down you press login button this is
the expense management home screen as
you can see it's got your three expense
management options as well as a nice pie
chart this pie chart displays my active
reports since I signed on as a non
approver if I had been an approver the
pie chart would have shown a graph of my
employees expense reports so to add an
expense report just have the add/edit
expense report menu item this next
screen it would normally be a list of
any of your active expense reports I
don't have any so I'm just going to
press the Add button and fill in my
header information about my expense
whether our drop-down menus where
necessary so for a report type I need to
select
traveling entertainment and it brings it
in go ahead and put your report date in
your purpose I didn't have an advance or
an override manager so my header is
filled in I did have credit card
expenses for this particular expense so
I press the add credit card expense
button and it's going to go find all of
my credit card expenses so the one for
this was actually the marriott so i
select it when i press done and that
brings it forward into my expense report
so i just need to put any additional
information in do you notice since this
is a hotel expense it will pick up the
configuration with in enterprise one and
pull it forward into this so I was in
San Francisco so I select that it was
paid with that I'm going to charge it to
a business unit in business unit one and
here's my additional information
regarding the hotel expense from the
category so this was a merry aunt can
select that you bring it forward was
only there for one night and it was in
San Francisco I don't need to put a
comment in so now I press the Save
button and it gets added as a detailed
line oh you notice I have a warning it's
a big expense 202 dollars and fifty
senses of both above the limit but
that's what I spent so I'm going to go
ahead and press the Save button so
that'll be added and it brings me back
to the main screen and here's my one
line that I've added so far so I went
out to lunch and I need to get that
charged so I'm going to go ahead and
just press the app
since it was not a credit card expense
and I'm going to select meals can either
type it in and have a try or you can
move through the list I'm going to
select meals loose in San Francisco I
actually paid with cash I'm going to
charge it to business unit 1 and I spent
25 and 15 sex on my lunch so there's my
meal expense and press the Save button
again so now I'm done with my report
it's got everything on there that I want
so I've reviewed it looks good so now I
want to submit it to submit it I just
press the submit report button and tap
submit again to confirm that I'm ready
to go takes me back to my list of
reports since I automatically submitted
that it doesn't show up if I had just
saved it and not submitted you would
have seen this in my list so when I go
back to my home screen you'll now see
that my graph has changed to include my
new report in approver status you may
have noticed you didn't see any back
buttons on our screens instead the
buttons will be labeled with where
you're going to go whether it be to your
reports list or to your home screen
which is very nice so as you can see
from this demo it's very simple to use
this new functionality so be sure to
view the additional video available on
the functionality for approving and
rejecting expense reports I hope you're
just as excited about this new
functionality as we are thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
