for Microsoft sequel server plugin for
Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c today
we'll be reviewing the updated 12.1.0
dot 5.0 plugin including its new
features and monitoring capabilities
throughout this video we'll see how the
Microsoft sequel server plugin is such a
great individual solution for monitoring
your Microsoft database environment this
is mainly due to its integration with
Oracle Enterprise Manager making it an
ideal solution for any heterogeneous
database environment let's quickly
review what we will be covering in this
video we'll start by going over the
plugins support capabilities core
features some of which are new to this
release and others that were introduced
last release and finally the plugins
integration with OAM the Microsoft
sequel server plug-in is compatible with
the current OAM release of 12c r4 it
includes updated support coverage for
Microsoft sequel server 2014 and added
support for Microsoft sequel always-on
availability groups other support
versions include 2005 2008 and 2012
getting started you can see I have
already logged in to an Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c cloud control web
console and navigated to the Oracle
Enterprise Manager welcome page from
here or any other page in cloud control
you can navigate to the all targets page
by selecting targets all targets once at
the all targets page we can find and
view our Microsoft sequel server targets
I prefer to refine my search and select
the Microsoft sequel server target type
from the left navigation pane this will
filter the list of targets to only the
targets relating to this plugin clicking
on the deployed target will bring us to
the plugins home page the first thing
we'll look at on the plug-in home page
is a summary overview the summary
overview provides details of the sequel
instance and host plugin status uptime
DB and server names and your MS sequel
version also in this overview
administrators are given the ability to
run jobs to start or stop their
Microsoft sequel server or agent and
jobs to pause or resume their Microsoft
sequel server this can be accomplished
by clicking the specific buttons next to
the server or agent status confirming
the job will start an OEM job in the
background at the bottom of this view
are links to the performance analysis
and database pages clicking these links
brings us to the individual pages we'll
visit them in a moment next to the
summary view is the database table in
this table each database associated with
this monitored Microsoft sequel server
instance will be listed as a row with
status size and space available if you
click on a column header the table will
sort by that metric type displayed here
is the status for your cluster or an
always-on availability group also listed
is a notation of which node is currently
active and the health of each node at
the plugin we're monitoring a single D
be the reads writes and airs per second
would be displayed here instead the data
for that graph is displayed in a
historical line graph of the last 24
hours
here is the Associated Services table
this table contains Windows services
that are related to the Microsoft sequel
server monitoring the status of these
services can be useful when diagnosing
issues with your sequel server
beneath this row our detailed metric
graphs and charts are provided for some
of the more critical collected metrics
the graphs and charts provide easy to
see call-out points when hovering over
them with the mouse
at the bottom of the homepage you can
find the standard OEM incidents and
problems and job Activity views here you
can quickly view any incidents that have
occurred from metric thresholds and
other problems
mousing over the incident will give the
full description while clicking it will
bring you to the incident manager next
we'll navigate to the analysis page by
clicking the link we looked at earlier
in the summary panel this analysis page
is broken into two main sections the top
five sessions and the top five queries
the top five sessions metrics can be
organized by CPU time or memory
utilization while the top five queries
can be organized by execution count CPU
time or block time after selecting the
metric to view each graph can then be
filtered to show different sections in
time by day week and month hovering over
different points in the graph will
display detailed information on that
metric point the table below the graph
offers detailed information about the
top five sessions as well as the ability
to kill the session by selecting the row
and clicking the kill session button
clicking yes in this dialogue will start
an oem job to kill the selected session
moving down to the top five queries
graph we can hover over the lines to
display detailed data points mousing
over the table rows below the graph will
show the full execution count in query
being ran
using the targets contextual menu we
will now navigate to the target
performance page as you can see the
performance page is broken down into
three key performance indicator
categories processing connection memory
and sequel execution each of these
categories contains historical data on
the defined metric you can change the
length of historical collection by
utilizing the radio buttons at the top
of the page
next we will go to the final page in the
Microsoft sequel server plugin the
database page you can access the
database page in one of three ways
through the contextual menu through the
link in the summary view of the homepage
or from the database table on the home
page the database page is an all new
page added in this version to enable
administrators to monitor and manage
their Microsoft sequel server
environment down to the individual
database level first select the database
you wish to view from the drop-down menu
within the summary view after the
database has been selected the rest of
the page will automatically update with
information related to the database you
have selected the summary view shows the
status ID owner creation date and
availability group the view to the right
of the summary is the database
composition that shows how the database
space is being utilized the database
management view displays the previous
database backups and gives the user the
ability to restore the current database
to the selected state or the user delete
the selected database backup this view
also gives the user the ability to
generate new backups for the Microsoft
sequel server database the user may
choose to backup the database now by
typing in a custom backup name and
selecting backup now or select to
schedule a backup for the future
scheduling a backup utilizes Oracle
Enterprise Managers built-in job wizard
for easy and convenient plugin job
scheduling
moving down to the second row views on
the database page we find several graphs
for showing the last 24-hour collections
of the reads and writes the database
composition over time and the database
space available
the four pages we have just covered
displaced some of the most critical
Microsoft sequel server information
however to view all of the metrics
collected by the plugin we will navigate
to the all metrics view here the metrics
collected are organized into metric
groupings the most recent data collected
can be viewed as well as some historic
values that are stored by the plugin
these metrics explores the breadth of
the plugins ability to collect data from
the Microsoft sequel server environment
to explore a metric further expand the
metric group in the left column and then
select one of the specific metrics you
wish to view the values collected for
that metric are then displayed in this
table to the right as you can see the
right portion of this page is split
horizontally into two sections the top
section shows all collected values and
the bottom section then graphs the
historical values of the selected row
over time the timeframe can be changed
by selecting the view data drop down
menu above the table
now that we have a good understanding of
all the metrics that are collected by
the plugin let's review the available
incident thresholds that we can utilize
to alert us in the case of a failure or
problem setting incident thresholds and
collecting historic data on these
metrics can prove to be a very
beneficial aid in alerting
administrators of potential issues to do
this we will navigate to the metric and
collection settings page this metric and
collection settings page is already
predefined without of the Box thresholds
for some of the configurable metrics
if desired you can fine-tune these
thresholds for each of the metrics in
this list to a desired value
the last thing we look at are the
information publisher reports
the Microsoft sequel server plugin is
shipped with 18 out-of-the-box reports
for easy and quick reporting of key
metrics for an example let's take a look
at the report for memory statistics
as a report loads you will see that the
data is logically organized for quick
viewing and easy prints ability the
Microsoft sequel server information
publisher reports are also great for
analyzing trends in data and finding
stress points in your sequel server
environment before they occur
and that concludes the screen watch for
Microsoft sequel server plugin thank you
for taking the time to watch this brief
demonstration hopefully you have found
this demo to provide good insight into
the updated Microsoft sequel server
plug-in and how it can add value to your
infrastructure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
