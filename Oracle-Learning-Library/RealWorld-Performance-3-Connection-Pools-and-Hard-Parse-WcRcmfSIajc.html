the demo a little bit further and
implementing a connection pool I'll
implement a connection pool you'll
notice that we've taken the performance
up 10 times faster to over 3,000
transactions a second and this order of
magnitude very often people will take
great credit oh I made the application
10 times faster I'm a hero but you'll
notice that still we have actually
inside the database a lot of contention
and serialization although we've managed
to increase the utilization of the CPU
and take the transaction rate up there's
a lot further to be done because you'll
notice if we take a look at this thing
this application is pausing every sequel
statement now the reason why it's
pausing every sequel statement is
because the programmer has written a
very simple application that dynamically
builds a sequel string and then sends it
to the database this dynamically built
sequel string is a classic screen
scraping or webform scraping application
where they take the contents out of a
form dynamically build a sequel
statement and send it down to the
database this results in what we would
call a hard pass and the hard part of
the sequel statement means that it's
probably going to be a unique sequel
statement and it's not likely to find
any match inside the Oracle shared pool
and so it won't be shared either ok so
we're going to take the full penalty of
not only syntactically checking the
sequel statement semantically checking
the sequel statement we're also going to
take the performance penalty of
generating an execution plan for the
sequel statement and all the memory
management associated with it
just think about that that's a lot of
CPU that again is not being spent
executing your sequel statement it's
just setting things up one of the ways
to perhaps think about this is we are
effectively recompiling the application
before we ran that imagine recompiling a
c program every time you wanted to run
it you just wouldn't do that you just
learn to re-execute that having
eliminated the logging on and off to the
database being the performance problem
you'll notice that this application in
itself it's still not meeting the
performance targets we're only doing
about four thousand three and a half
four thousand transactions a second the
response time has come down to about 18
milliseconds but we have been successful
in getting the database CPU busy and
we're running in user code not system
code so let's start investigating the
database for why are we not still not
making the targets well you'll notice
that half the processes in the database
that are running are on the CPU which is
great but the other processes are all
contending inside the database for
memory structures inside the shared pool
and you can see latch row cache objects
and latch on shared pool and you're
seeing library cache mutex and really if
we were to do the root cause of the
problem the answer is staring us in the
face we're hard parsing all the sequel
statements that we send down we're doing
about 13,000 sequel statements and we're
hard parsing about 12,000 them the
reason is again we remember this was an
application that was thrown together
really quickly and is that the
programmer has not thought about curses
and has just done a classic screen
scraping application and it's just
copying the contents out of the web form
and make building a sequel statement so
if we actually look at one of the sequel
statements that are actually being ran
inside Enterprise Manager here you can
see there's an update statement and
they're changing a field but you'll
notice that for everything in the where
clause
it's a hard-coded literal value that had
been pulled out of the webform these
using literal values will mean that
every sequel statement new here has been
is unique is being hard pars which means
we're doing a syntax check we're doing a
semantic check to see that it you're
able to validate correctly execute this
sequel statement and then we have to
generate an execution plan and memory
and manage memory structures inside the
shared pool which were the weight events
you thing because the shared pool is a
shared structure and so we have to
manage concurrency to this the challenge
here is that the developer hadn't been
using a concept called bind variables
and had not been building them into the
application and as a result this actual
sequel statement is patek surely sequel
injectable if somehow in these escape
sequences someone had managed to inject
into the field enough escape sequences
quotes and things where they could
actually start returning additional data
or updating additional data in the app
in the base tables so all they need to
do is embed all one equals one into the
sequel string and of course all the rows
are impacted so this is known as sequel
injection and there's a big security
issue associated with writing screen
scraping applications and again we're
going to talk about the use of bind
variables this should be specified by
the system architect or the development
management team if the programmer is
left to figure it out themselves they'll
take the easiest path to generate a
functional app it doesn't mean it will
perform or whether it's secure
