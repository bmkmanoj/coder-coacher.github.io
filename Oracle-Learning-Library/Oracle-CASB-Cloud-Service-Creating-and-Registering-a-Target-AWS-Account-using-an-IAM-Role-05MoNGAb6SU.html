cloud service can use either an iam user
to act as a dedicated service account or
an iam roll AWS recommends the use of
roles as now access and secret keys are
required and it's viewed as a more
secure integration this walkthrough will
show the creation of an iam role for a
single or standalone AWS account or a
target AWS account configured in cross
account logging this iam role will
replace the functionality of the iam
user account to monitor your AWS
instance at this point in the
configuration it is assumed cloud trail
has already been enabled and that it's
sending its logs to a local s3 bucket
log in to your AWS console and select
services under security identity and
compliance select I am navigate to roles
to create a new monitoring role note
that this is different from a cross
account role
then select another AWS account this is
so the Oracle Cosby cloud service can
assume this role to monitor the AWS
account you will be prompted for the
account ID and the external ID the
account ID is the Oracle Casbah cloud
service account ID the external ID is
generated during the registration
process enter the account ID for Oracle
cos B cloud service
open a new tab and log into your Oracle
can be cloud service from the dashboard
screen select add an app and navigate to
this select an app type screen select
Amazon Web Services AWS and navigate to
the select an instance screen name your
AWS application instance and then
navigate to the select monitoring type
screen this is where you will select
which mode you want to register your AWS
instance into Oracle Casspi cloud
service here you will assign a
preexisting AWS policy to the I am role
you can register your AWS account into
Oracle Caspi cloud service in one of two
modes read-only and readwrite in both
modes you'll base line your AWS security
controls in Oracle Caspi cloud service
any subsequent changes to the security
controls in AWS will generate an alert
in Oracle Caspi cloud service in rewrite
mode Oracle Casspi cloud service can
revert those changes back to the
baseline settings keeping your AWS
instance in compliance however in read
write mode AWS requires Oracle Casbah
cloud service to have administrator
access to make these changes directly
back into your AWS account read-only
mode requires the read-only access
policy if you want read-only permissions
on this
I am role select monitor only if you
want to revert security control changes
back to the baseline automatically and
your security policies allow assigning
the administrator access policy to this
role select monitor and push controls
navigate to the select security control
screen change the authentication type -
I am user role and copy the external ID
switch back to the tab with your AWS
account
and enter the external ID navigate to
the attach policy screen from where you
can choose policies to attach to your
new role
if you chose monitor and push controls
you must choose administrator access if
you selected monitor only enter
read-only access in the filter scroll to
the bottom and select the policy
give the roller name and then create the
roll then select the roll you just
created
the first line is the role a RN which is
required to complete the registration in
Oracle Caspi cloud service take a copy
of this as it will be required later
towards the bottom of the page select
trust relationship and the trusted
entities is the account number of Oracle
casts B cloud service and the conditions
you'll see the external ID that was
generated by Oracle cos B cloud service
select edit trust relationship if the
Oracle can be cloud service tenant times
out or you need to restart the AWS
registration process when you click to
add the AWS application the process will
generate a new external ID you'll need
to replace the value in the trust
relationship with the most current one
to match Oracle Casspi cloud service
switch to the Oracle cos B cloud service
tab and enter the role AR n you copied
earlier and then test the credentials if
all of the configurations are correct
you'll be informed that the credentials
are valid submit your action and you'll
be notified that AWS is going through
its first data ingestion in your Oracle
Casspi cloud service tenant navigate
back to the dashboard and you'll observe
that this application is going through
initial data ingestion
congratulations you have successfully
registered AWS into Oracle Caspi cloud
service with an I am role thank you for
