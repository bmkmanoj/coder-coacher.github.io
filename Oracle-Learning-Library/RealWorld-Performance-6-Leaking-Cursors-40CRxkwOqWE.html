application that we use to demonstrate
pausing and the use of cursors what
actually happens when we to an
application when they start to leak
cursors and it's extremely difficult to
detect this as a problem until it blows
up on you and as you can see we have an
application here that is running and
appearing to run just fine the
performance is great the response time
is great the transaction rate is great
and but what actually I have done is
made this application lika cursor every
half a percent of every transaction
iteration that gets done and so what
you'll notice is that the number of
cursors allocated to each session is
increasing all the time that we're
running this demo and at this point in
time you can see we're very close to
approaching the threshold of the net to
aura parameter open cursors which is set
to 300 and you can see immediately we've
got max cursors they were getting to 300
and we've had one of our sessions hit
the error message or a 1000 maximum
number of cursors exceeded as a result
the application is now throwing errors
and you can see the throughput dropping
suppose CPU is dropping and basically
we're in a situation where we're in
experiencing a system outage now let's
start thinking about this in terms of
what could a DBA do well one of the
other options is the DBS used to
increase open cursors and sort of sweep
the whole problem under the carpet until
such time that they run out of
again but what might be a better
solution for the DBA is to start being a
little bit more proactive about the
whole thing and instead of just
increasing a parameter how about
actually looking to see what's really
going on inside the database so the DBA
instead of just increasing a parameter
and making the problem go away for the
short term can be on the proactive and
set about doing things that can actually
help the development organization such
this problem is eliminated altogether so
let's just have a look at one of the
sessions that we have and the thing to
notice on this session is that it's
reporting errors we see sequel net break
reset to client as one of the wait
events which means it's throwing out
errors to the application is issuing
that error 1000 running out of max open
cursors but let's look at the state of
the session that we have that is now
experiencing their areas and we can look
at its open cursors now go in and have a
look at the open cursors and perhaps
doing a little bit of sorting and I'll
sort them twice you will notice that say
this top insert statement or this select
statement has in this case 87 cursors
associated with exactly the same sequel
statement this is because the
application is leaking the cursor
because we've initiated it inside the
application it's probably as a result of
a exception being thrown in the
application because of some data-driven
or application error and they're
forgetting to close the cursor before
they leave the method and then they
re-enter the method and then they open
the cursor all over again and you can
see here we've got lots of cursors per
sequel statement the ideal number for
that of course being one and you can
repeat it all over again so this is one
of the problems we have and in this
situation a DBA will be wise to go and
speak to the developer and said did you
know this
in this individual sequel statement is
being leaked and as a result we're
struggling and we're getting errors and
how about investigating the logic inside
your program of course the programmers
can make life easier for the DBAs if
they were to use things like sequel
module action information to tag which
parts of the program are initiating the
sequel statements and so they can
actually work much more as a team to
eliminate problems in the program so we
covered the cursor leaking and we're
getting onto the more pathological cases
where we get session leaking and it's
session leaking hurts you most when
you've done things correctly in that
you've managed to build a good
connection pool from a large number of
Java threads here in fact 9600 and
managed to share a pool of 96
connections to the database now if we
actually make artificially the program
throw an error not not every half a
percent like we did in the cursor
leaking error but actually half of a
tenth of a percent so point zero five
percent you can see that's a very tiny
margin for error let's have a look and
see what happens
to the performance of the system as we
start leaking connections
programmatically to the database and you
can see as we apply it very rapidly you
can see that all the connections in the
database are being lost programmatically
and the throughput drops because
basically although we're running at a
high transaction rate it also means that
a high transaction rate we have a high
error rate and as a result of high error
rate it we only take basically need to
have 96 errors and we've driven the
performance of the system literally into
the ground and down to zero because now
we have no connections left in the pool
they're all being used and you're
actually getting this error message
showing up
and this is one of these difficult ones
to explain to people and we're always
reluctant to say all we need to go run
initially with a small connection count
from computer science and correctness
you do but if you implement it straight
away and you haven't tested for session
leaking within your application you will
bring your system to a halt literally as
quickly as we just showed you there and
if you're having difficult conversations
with middleware and people like that
it's going to be a difficult
conversation so it's important that you
test for session leaking very quickly as
part of the development process and in
testing and one of the best ways to do
that is to make your JVM run with just
one connection to the database because
if they leak that connection the JVM
will come to a halt the last bit of
leaking I'd like to talk about is what
happens if we leak a session and that
session is holding a lock let's have a
look at the impact on performance at
this point in time when we leak a
session that's got a lock held so i've
artificially leaked a session and that
every session now at this point in time
is going to start wanting to acquire
that lock over time and as you can see
what we'll see as we go scrolling
through and this may take a while
because we can't have all sessions
chasing the same log we're starting to
see the performance start to degrade as
processes start to queue up in the same
way as we saw when we lost processes and
we're starting to see nqt X ro lock
contention show up on the database this
is a function of everybody queuing up
behind a single row lock on a process
that has been programmatically locked
and you can see performance is dropping
and we're seeing more and more pink to
indicate processes stuck in a lock state
and the CPU utilization is dropping so
really and what a lot of DBAs do and
we'll go back to Enterprise Manager if
we go back to the top sessions screen
again
and watch this if we look at the TOC
activity in Enterprise Manager you can
see a lot of processes of stop using the
CPU here and are now in a lock state so
let's go and have a look at one of these
sessions that's in a lock state in the
same way we looked at their curses the
time before we were looking cursor
leaking you can see they're stuck in a
lock state and qtx
row lock contention a lot of DBAs have
learned-- either programmatically or by
inspection have been learned to look at
the blocking tree and a good indication
that you've got a process detached and
holding a lock if you look at the lock
holder that's holding everybody to
ransom you see them at sequel net
message from client I their program that
is holding the lock is waiting from
interaction from the outside world to
release that lock but because we lost it
programmatically that message is never
going to come back we're never going to
see a commit or rollback so what a lot
of DPAs do is they look at that process
and they go you're the lock holder
you're my problem
and here we can see at the process
that's actually holding that lock we can
kill that session
and then go we'll look back and see what
happens to the performance you can see
everybody was in pink but now we've
released that lock in that session we go
to the throughput by killing that
session it's released all the lock
weights and the performance has gone
back to where it should be and CPUs now
getting busy and the system's looking
like a healthy system again but we
really do have to ask the question had
the user interface been told that the
transaction that they were holding the
locks out was it committed or did it
send an error message the user interface
at this point potentially we here may
have logically corrupted our database by
killing that session will that come back
to hurt us at later on will our
customers certainly say I've lost an
order I've missed my flight I'm not on
the seat this is the sort of thing that
we're programming errors and then
external intervention just trying to
keep the system running may lead into a
logical database corruption
