Astor tech has implemented a new
helpdesk solution using Oracle so is
suite including Oracle service bus to
integrate their consumer mobile
application the help desk integration
flow includes problem reporting
assignment engagement analysis
escalation resolution status update and
customer feedback Oracle real-time
integration business insight or simply
insight will allow Astra Tech's business
users and business owners to model
collect and monitor business level
metrics without reliance on IT with
these metrics they'll be able to track
paid support programs measure resolution
velocity evaluate technician performance
identify high maintenance products and
more different personas work together to
configure an insight model including the
business user and the integration
architect Neena the business user
creates a new insight model from the
designer tab creating a model requires a
name a description terms for single and
multiple instances in this case service
request and an icon to distinguish the
model from others in the system now that
the models been created she'll define
the milestones within the model
milestones are points in a business
process that represent important
business progress and map to at least
one point in the application
implementation helpdesk application is
started when a user raises a service
request to report a problem Neena
creates a milestone representing this
point in the model this particular
milestone is classified as type initial
every time this milestone is passed a
new instance or service request is
initiated Neena adds additional
milestones to the model that represent
interim points of normal execution these
are known as standard milestones the
next milestone she defines is past when
a service ticket is suspended due to
insufficient information because it puts
the service request into an unsuccessful
State she identifies it as an error
milestone it's not a terminal milestone
because the service request will be
resumed once the missing information has
been received from the customer next she
adds another error miles
don't this milestone is past if the
helpdesk support engineer rejects the
ticket from a business perspective this
is an error state and because the
service request can't be completed after
being rejected she identifies this
milestone as a terminal error milestone
finally she adds a milestone that marks
the successful completion of a service
request this is a terminal milestone
now that the milestones have been
defined nina will associate indicators
with them indicators are key pieces of
raw business data that are extracted as
insight observes the execution of
application instances indicators allow
business users to gain insight into the
proper functioning of the application
and also allow comparisons between
application instances there are three
types of indicators unique instance
identifier measures and dimensions nina
begins by creating the unique instance
identifier which guarantees uniqueness
among all integration instances the
identifier points to a unique incident
ID value she associates it with the
milestone in which the incident ID
becomes available next she defines the
measures associated with milestones
measures identify values which allow the
state of the integration application to
be quantified for example a typical help
desk application might define measures
for total resolution cost or times
reported
finally she defines the dimensions
associated with milestones dimensions
provide a type of grouping a
categorization of instances allowing for
slicing and dicing of aggregate
integration measures for example a
typical helpdesk might define dimensions
for customer status geographic region or
product escalation reason when nina's
defined each indicator she saves the
model and logs out of insight in the
next video in this series the
integration architect will map each of
these milestones to the underlying
implementation and then activate the
model thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
