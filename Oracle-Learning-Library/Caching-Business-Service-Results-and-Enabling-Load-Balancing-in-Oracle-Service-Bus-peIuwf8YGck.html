results that don't change often you can
configure those business services to
cash results it improves performance by
reducing the network overhead and also
helps to improve scalability by reducing
the load on the back-end servers she can
define the time to live for a cached
result load balancing distributes
workloads across multiple computer and
resources it also aims to optimize
resource use and avoid overload of any
single results here I am in Oracle
JDeveloper
and I am creating a service post
application with a service bus project
this application will invoke a simple
composite application in the returns
hello message first I add an HTTP
adapter the requests are we so file from
the hello people one composite the hello
people one endpoint returns a message
that takes about six seconds to respond
Here I am adding a pipeline with a proxy
service to call the HTTP adapter this
pipeline has to be exposed as a proxy
service so I don't have to create the
service by myself once the components
are wired I proceed to run the proxy
service the service boss console opens I
provide a name as a sample data and wait
for the response I confirm that a
message is displayed
I have to admit the cellar service to
enable Russell caching I am setting a
token expression based on the person's
name as a unit token for a cache entry
every time the request contains a name
previously sent within the time to leave
period it has to return the cache result
I am testing the result cache in now the
first request takes about 6 seconds to
receive the response
by running the proxy service again
including the same name in the request
it returns the cache result now it's
time to add load balance into the
project add in a second endpoint enables
to balance the workload on the external
service I can choose from different load
balancing algorithms I am running the
service to test the load balancing by
providing a name in the request this
time I get a different message because
it is the second endpoint
once I sent a new request the result
displays the first message because IDI
use the initial end point and that is
how to configure caching and load
balancing in Oracle service boss thanks
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
