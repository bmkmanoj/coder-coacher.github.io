life I happened to be a manager at
Oracle I'm actually technical on my
background but I'm starting to graduate
up away from the technical side so to
try to keep my hands in the technical
space I worked started this open source
project called groovy FX and I've had
some history with Java FX and then I
said well it really be cool to do groovy
with it and it sort of grown over about
two years and and it's come to this
we've had a lot of contributors to the
project you're welcome to join and
contribute even if it's just using it
and giving us feedback on what you would
like to see next that type thing so in
we have a slide show ready and that's
what we gave over to the show but we
thought that was kind of boring so what
we're actually gonna do is show you real
code and real demos and I think you
might find it interesting
introduce dark thank you my name is dr.
NIC and that all that counts I work for
Canoe let's start with coding okay that
was for the presentation no more slides
so going over since we do a lot of
demonstrations which are not really well
visible in on slides anyway I'm gonna do
a screen capture and if you follow my
Twitter account which is at MIT II then
you will get the information where to
find it can I somehow yes please thank
you so groovy effects we can talk
lengthily but groovy effects this well
the first place it is a very thin veneer
of groovy on top of the JavaFX powerful
awesome rich platform and
we will go a little bit into that
project but before we do this I'd like
to introduce how you can use it from a
user's perspective and I'm actually
spending a lot of time a lot of my
business time of my programming time by
just using groovy effects and I'd like
to start with the with a control or some
some use case that I implemented on my
flight from Switzerland to San Francisco
as long as my battery would hold and if
you I guess some of you have flown
economy-class
that means that the seat before you it
hits your forehead and you have your
laptop like this and you do what I call
accordion programming it when you're on
your belly so this is how the following
code was written this is a control that
I call which is a dial you see you'll
see it in special first show it how it
looks like
sorry like what some wrong one do y'all
control go here back to you see it's
real live right now just yep just taken
our mistake started started the wrong
coat here here it is so in one of our
applications we had the request for arm
with your finger entering a number hmm
so how do you do that normally you use a
slider L slider gives you a left a left
value and the right value and but it is
always difficult
what buddy is to choose for left and
right because that also influence
influences your a precision that you can
possibly have with your finger I guess
everybody has seen that before so here
we do have something which is close to a
slider you can click on it and that you
can just turn around it like so so you
can think to go from 0 up to 360 for
example less here yes and since you have
this geometry in this radial control you
can if you are very close to the center
you can spin around very quickly and
even go to high or low numbers so in
clockwise what key would be to high
numbers right that's something that you
cannot do within normal slider but still
you can be very precise by using the
geometry but going outside and having
only a slight thing over here it's light
changed in value putting it to a certain
value like so and that was the idea that
I wanted to implement yep and then you
know one thing to notice is says he's
moving the dial around the value is
updating
this is done to a groovy FX feature
called binding and we'll show you how we
do that it's built on top of JavaFX yep
and here's here's all the cold all the
coat radio it is a dial and it is radial
in shape so it's a red dial pun intended
so the whole code of the dial is
actually this is pretty much it this is
visible from the back maybe like so it
is a circle gets an ID it has a radius
at the feel that gives us this cone
stuff feeling is linear gradient from
the Gainsborough color to the dim gray
color don't ask me how I chose those and
it has a stroke around with this with
the boss the border which is a gradient
that goes from white to black
now with the width of 8 now the inner
handle pair can put your finger on so to
speak it's just just another circle was
a linear gradient that goes from black
to white but has an opacity of only over
5 and that's for a reason
well let me show the code again
why is why is that yep you go so I'm not
quite sure whether over the Bema you get
the same effect but if you would have
been asked whether this blue is the same
color as that blue you'd say no this
looks lighter than the other one over
here right and that's because here the
Blues constrict contrast it against a
white isn't visible almost they were it
and here it is contrasted against black
so that makes the blue appear lighter or
less all more bright if we would do this
this here with fixed colors we would
have the effect that over here the
darker color contrasts against a light
gray and here against the darker gray
and in one of two places we would
instantly have like too hard an edge for
that and one thing to consider when and
with these kind of controls is you would
never want the user to click on
something that appears to have a hard
edge because you know your mouse is like
like your finger and you're kind of
reluctant to click on anything where you
may hurt your finger it's a kind of
psychological thing to keep in your mind
so that's kind of all kinds of
considerations that you can have when
playing around with new controls and
groovy ethics makes it very easy now
that's the point in point to drive home
to play around with these values and and
start again and do all that
so the indicator line the red line is
just that we have seen when I click on
it has per default a transparent stroke
so you don't see a pretty fault
it starts in the middle
and there's a text which is bound
against the value of the dial this is
the binding that Jim has mentioned and
the value is dark red and it is
repositioned to some other place and so
on so that was now when I start dragging
the mouse I get the the coordinates over
here where the dragging is currently
located I said the indicator stroke to
red huh
that's the indicator that's how you do
it in groovy effects and it has an ant x
and y position for that stroke now
that's so it it all is updated
automatically I also give to the main I
give a drop shadow I may not you may not
have recognized that drop shadow in blue
in light blue which gives the indication
that the dial is no now on in action hmm
we've seen that before
what did him if I start clicking
it has Liz below around it and the glow
is gone again glow and it's gone again
gives you a very good indication with
what you're currently modifying and by
the way below is nothing else but a drop
shadow in a different color it's a good
trick to to take away I learnt all these
tricks from Garrett who invite my you
know if you have any seen if you have
ever seen any of his work you will
recognize it and then we have to kind of
do the mathematics here to go from XY
positions into polar coordinates to work
with the radius and and the angle really
so I chose this Oh and theta words from
the polar coordinates and then I have to
translate x and y position of the handle
to the respective place and that that it
was and then I set the theta value of
the dial the dial is now what would be
in if you do standard controls in Java
fix would be the control respectively
the behavior motor control really it has
a bindable value such that any other
JavaFX controls groovy effects control
can bind against it in all the various
methods that you have to implement a set
value a get value a value property
method and even a value method and all
the checking whether the value really
changed and so on is all in these
methods automatically injected in the
bytecode so the FX bind of all
annotation you send there see there it
just says that the next property is
going to be a JavaFX property and it
generates the getters and setters for
the value but also behind the scenes
generates the property itself
there's two ways to use it when in this
case it's just going against one
property of the radial value class you
can also annotate the class with this so
that all the property properties within
the groovy class will have this JavaFX
properties generated and the way you
access the value is you can call value
left friend right paren and that's
actually pulling the property back
rather than the actual value at that
time if you scroll down we'll show that
to you or you did the bind oh well the
bindings so here you have the bind on
the dial
class and says dial that value so what
that's really saying is on my text line
is to whenever the value of the dial
changes then it basically the text will
get updated with that new string the bio
string so as the value changes the text
automatically gets update and that's the
only coding you have to do to tie the
two together a couple of the other
features in groovy FX if you notice the
fill argument here has dark red so all
the color standard color properties our
first class like IDs within the groovy
FX so you don't have to double quote
them or do anything special they just
get interpreted as colors the fill the
groovy blue we added our own you could
add your own colors we add a groovy blue
as to the standard list of colors okay
that was
the other key thing here is where you
see like the pain with the ID that says
radio well once you do that then radio B
actually becomes a variable accessible
through your to your groovy code so we
can identify the pain I think you do it
later in another class but you can
actually say radio dot whatever and set
the properties on that pain which is
kind of a neat trick now that was
playing around blues showing you with
what little code that was 70 lines of
code what you can achieve hmm that's
really something which would take you
which will take me at least a week if I
would have to do it in Swing if at all
and yeah so something that you can do
that that was more like like little
teaser right now let's look what's what
is the minimum amount that you have to
do for using groovy effects and that's
it you just start you're using sort of
make it a little bit bigger like so good
you're using the start method and it
takes a closer but if you don't think
about closures just think open race and
then there's a stage inside and inside
the stage there's a scene and inside the
scene versus dec pain inside stack pain
there's a text mm-hmm that's pretty much
it and so we have a text note here it
has a feel what else may have you said
white but you could have just said
oh yeah I don't necessarily need to have
that as a string it is there as as
variable and of course it is
I've got translated for example trends
late X and give it certain value
whatever so this this is how you do it
in and after I should start it huh give
you some gives you some idea of what we
do here filled with white now that's
that's rather small so that's not not
the final thing that we'd like to have
now we play around with it say we want
to have a font and the font should be
mm-hmm
36 points or ramble sorry Trey amble
amble and it's that like site yeah right
and I'll really amble installed or not
let's see
yep that is and suddenly we would like
to have a reflection on that effect
reflection and by the way you get you
see the the reflection class which gives
you a good hint that reflections
probably available like so try again
so you go well that's that's an easy way
of playing around with possible
groovy effects code now if you want to
do this you need to have Java ethics
installed on your machine there must be
a Java a fixed installation and this
installation includes in Java
jf x RT which stands for Java FX runtime
doctor and this must be explicitly on
your class path that's a catch beaker
and that's not a catch because of groovy
effects that to catch because of Java FX
otherwise it doesn't start correctly the
so even if you have the latest Java 7
which also includes an already has on
the class path all the JavaFX you need
to have an extra entry in your class
path so that less yield this is your
escape this is your class path over here
and you'll see that this Java one seven
eight one zero one seven oh eight early
access preview there's some groovy and
and yes you need to have groovy hmm one
way or the other I have the latest
groovy over here and I have the runtime
job you can fetch the latest groovy FX
jar manually but you don't need to
groovy has this feature of so called
grab you can use the grab annotation and
say grab and give it
or coders job ethics on a picture so the
the actual groovy effects right X and
then then the the module which is groovy
FX and then the ode 3.1 and this will
automatically download it from the web
install it locally and you can send your
code to anybody who has not even not
true VFX installed
he must have job FX installed so that's
the way that you can use it and now we
have like we'd like to go through a
number of further demos with that are
directly in the groovy FX groovy FX
comes is on the web if you search groovy
affects you you will see the the home
page and it comes in the in the demo
folder are many many many many demos in
fact we have a little more demos than we
have test cases I'm afraid better demos
are the test pieces yep and whenever we
do a change we have to go through all
the demos and see whether they still
work and what is your favorite demo
let's start just analog clock clock
since I wrote that
love one yep so it's gonna actually
build it and you see this was if you're
familiar with Java fax that there is a
Java effects version of this and I
wanted to test binding so I ported it
over to groovy FX and so I'll show you
some of the code here
to do
go up to the top first so we have this
class time and we keep the hours minutes
and seconds and then we keep all the
angles for the hour hand and the minute
hand and all that stuff and then
basically for the time we update the
time the hours minutes and seconds and
they get bound to the angle so as you
are changing the clock the the angles
for those pants automatically changes
and again we just this is straight
forward groovy effects we have a stage
and then here's using some groovy syntax
to actually create the little ticks
around the clock so we can just use the
for loop and generate that as a list
which is just a bunch of circles we used
and then later on the circles will get
installed into the scene which is the
where it says nodes our dots that's just
pulling that other list end so you could
kind of mix and match how you build the
scene graph in different ways note is
just a generic included Java FX node and
then again we have the the different
parts of the clock thing then as the
time gets updated that just causes the
you can see where the in the bottom
there where it says buying time that
second angle and then you get for the
middle hand you got time time to admit
it angle as those values get updated it
actually updates the graphic elements
and then this uses a lot of animation
classes and JavaFX this one we use what
they call it a sequential translation
transition so basically this is going to
update the transition or the x and y
values and then it runs indefinitely but
then i just set the timer to one second
if you see there the pause transition
it's using a
groovy syntax which one dot s gets
translated into a JavaFX duration of one
second and then as that pause terminates
it calls the groovy function on finished
which actually invokes the time at
another second to it I mean I know it's
not precise for you guys they're really
in there but you get the point
yeah and still it's all groovy count and
that means we I get the normal support
in groovy code which is yes my time
object here's the respective method I
can command click on that one and I'll
be sent over here I can say out of seven
please give me all the people on all the
places where this is used and if there's
only one place that actually jumps to it
so in your normal IDE here we had also
call your support it's not like an
external file that the ID doesn't
understand so go back to that method if
you see here in the math that all I'm
doing is recalculating the seconds
minutes and hours and there's nothing
there at that point that's recalculating
all those angles or updating the screen
through binding which was up before
whenever a second changes it
recalculates the second angle should be
up a little bit you can see whether but
seconds are bound so I made a find
usages and here we see whether where the
second angle property binds against the
seconds times 60 and here's a little
catch even if you have ever seen the the
binding that is in the in Java ethics
you can bind against an expression right
but the expression is made up of method
calls it is in Java FX this would read
seconds property or compare and close
parent house or open parent
then you undo you would have a new in it
on the object value you would have to
call a method called multiply and give
it the number six which is okay from API
but doesn't read nicely it's nice to
have the real mathematic expression
being visible Excel and with groovy
mehta program with the sorry what the
groovy method object protocol we can
actually implement this operator very
nicely and make it appear as as a
mathematical expression even though
behind the scenes the exact same thing
happens as if you would write object
proper second property of compare a new
object properties of multiply six close
paren close paren semicolon right so
here very concise you can do something
that takes a little bit more when you're
in the java world we have support for
like a lot of different operators
multiply divide subtract I think modulus
a couple others I can't remember all
tough my head groovy and action of the
book has all the operators in chapter
one chapter two
okay I wrote the book good F XML demo
was requested from the audience yes so
who's not a planet so the there's for
the F XML you may have seen that there
have been many talks about JavaFX and
Cinderella Cinderella allows you to
create an F XML file and this is fully
supported with groovy effects you can
use your singular and save your F XML
file and what we do is if you have such
a file you can easily say F XML at any
point in your scene graph and give it
the file that you're going to draw in
and go to the text of it this is how
Ruby reads the text from file there's
other options here too there's a
resource tag we use which will actually
you can give it a URL to go into your
class path to try to find the F XML file
or you could just pass in a URL to some
location yeah this is just one way to do
it and then um that's actually my
preferred workflow you do the whole
layout in Cinderella but what you lay
out what your layout lling is more like
containers and you give your containers
IDs there's an FX ID actually butte on
every not every possible note
sorry yep there's there's another one
that it it which is a bit difficult and
we'll come to it in a second
Thanks now I just wanted to drive the
point home that you can get hold on to
any ID
dramatically with with only this little
API call from this stage you go to the
scene and you look up this ID and then
you get all elements that are that have
this ID now an ID they should only be
one note with with one ID in your scene
graph right this is not enforced by
JavaFX that this is the convention for
an ID now we can get hold on to the
title property of that and change the
title and this is how we can get hold on
to the various elements in the scene
graph even though they have been
constructed with scene builder and being
put into an external if XML file right
doesn't make sense
oh cool now since Dano has requested
this one here is this a little bit more
code that effectively the same approach
this just demonstrates that you can use
strings to load up the F XML if you just
decided to do that just showing
different ways to load the F XML is your
question gonna be about getting at the
controller class
very excessive values any CSS any person
there's one
so the effects of my life didn't like
them
okay true yep so there's even much
better to support than the explicit look
up all the IDS that VFX finds in when
passing the XML file will be as we call
it in the binding of the script so you
have them directly available as if there
would be declared variables and there
would be some property binding or so
just did enough for folks just loader we
recently had someone asked that they
wanted to get at the controller and I
guess if you're pure eff XML you're not
supposed to get at the controller but we
don't have a built-in way right now to
instantiate the F XML with a controller
object we just do what's defined in the
F XML file that's probably something we
can look at adding in the future
okay lighting effect demo okay we're now
doing something that we haven't have
rehearsed in because oh we we are so
confident that things work so is a light
effect and light effects are really
really easy to use let's look into some
of these demos are very simple because
we're just trying to demonstrate one
aspect of the language yep well like 20
minutes to go that's fine and lighting
is meaning setting in effect that it was
right there's number of properties that
you can set for lighting you can have
the lighting in a certain position in a
certain distance in a certain angle on
top of it and will consistently have
like reflections on your object and also
drop shadows and so on so that is that
is really an interesting an interesting
feature it's a JavaFX feature but it's
so easy to use from group VFX let's do
the swing and the swing demo cool swing
swing swing swing swing
speaking demo since this demo shows how
you can use groovy effects with the
swing builder in the groovy effects
builder so if you have a mixed swing
JavaFX project that is how you can do it
it has a border layout in swing and text
control and swing and a button in swing
that the the content pane so to speak in
spring terms isn't a fix panel and it
shows the about view right so this is
combining in the webview JavaFX object
with swing objects
does that go or internetworking I have
no idea
let's try does it go or maybe not I have
no idea what I'm really hooked up until
the Internet
we all see if not you get there you get
the message right so how does it look
like in the code before it is pretty
decent
we have default URL we have a swing but
those of us you have done some groovy in
the past now the swing Bella and now
there's also seam graph Bella which is
for JavaFX we do have the JavaFX panel
with dimension we have some logic to set
a URL and actually in the scene graph we
defer to the to the back view engine and
let the yours you're a lowly the defer
method just means invoke this when it's
on the JavaFX thread it's similar to the
EDT thread from swing creating the scene
but the interesting part comes here and
swing we say please inside the ADT
create a frame with this title and with
a border layout have a panel which goes
into the center automatically and
however sorry which is so it's bottle
layout north and it goes north there's a
text field and the button that we have
seen with an action perform for setting
to URL and then there's which it which
contains ethics panel which it is a path
will note that allows you to pass in any
note in your system now while we're at
it think about custom notes we do have a
custom node thing that we haven't looked
at it either in degree hustle but it
the custom field is really cool and I'll
show you first Soviet the custom field
how it works the custom field is an AMA
text field and make it a little bit
bigger like so and but it does it only
allows ages that to be to be entered so
I can do a/b c/d but when I want to
enter like number one for example which
I do now
well the sound effect is me but it's
easy to just sound effects comes with
you when you're Dan was all right I
distribute it personally so and and how
difficult is it to have like such a
custom component well and and use it
inside groovy effects the Eric here
comes you do custom for your demo
let's start over here it has a little
description it's easy author so you know
it has some API description
you're just a bean factory under the
name reject field and here's your class
and that means that inside your groovy
FX code you can just use this node
reject field because it was registered
this way and you can give it additional
properties for example what is allowed
inside and also what should happen and
in case that something disallowed is
entered when first we press enter and
second if if this happens we are shaking
and shaking means we have a sequential
transition which like rotates over three
times in a duration of out of one
seconds and then moves back to zero and
and here is when input reject this is
the logic that should happen be sure we
want to play the shaking this is the
shake now this is the reject view this
is how you can this one of many options
to have a custom component in Java FX
you are extending for them from an
existing one and then you override the
methods that you're interested in this
is now replaced text and replace
selection very easy
since you're looking so closely in the
audience oh please make it a bit easier
for you to see and it's all on the web
if you go to the groovy ethics github
page you can directly see it on the web
through your browser see that code let
it run on your machine the action action
demo in the last talk we have heard that
there is no action abstraction in in
Java fix and I mentioned well you should
use groovy effects anyway almost I was
close to saying that and contributed by
Andres Amir I the entrance of there
thank you thank you for that
contribution we now have also actions as
we have in swing can say there's a
Netflix action it has an ID it has a
name it has an on action what should
happen and so on and then later you can
refer to for example the open action and
have the open action on the menu item
and this has all the behavior that you
know from swing in our terms actions are
a presentation model for something to
happen it is actually presentational
because they capture state like is it
enabled disabled what is the I can and
consistently displayed no matter what
whether you have it on a button or a
menu item or somewhere else
that's that's the whole purpose of an
action will let you show the canoe demo
usually yeah thank you so one thing that
that we demoed at the keynote force how
you can use JavaFX for real business
applications right so real business
applications are usually serve eccentric
they want to have your application
running on the server but you want to
have JavaFX with all its capabilities on
the client so
there's a new technology called dolphin
made by canoe it's open source and I can
close this one or drop it for the moment
go over here and I'd like to show you a
demo of it the push demo with all the
application logic running on the server
it's actually pushing vehicles around so
to speak and vehicles have an XY
coordinate and they have a color and
entered rotation angle where they are in
space here is two different master views
unlike a map view and a table view and a
detail view on the top
when I select any vehicle over here it
gets selected in the detail view it also
gets selected in the other master view
over here with this with this border
which is a sein Bora you you see these
these little vehicles are actually plane
rectangles with a lighting effect on top
of it that's all it takes actually only
the group where they live and has
lighting effect and it replies loop the
lighting correctly no matter how they
are rotated right it's always correctly
from the top to the bottom if you would
like to do this with a gradient color or
so yeah it's going to be difficult hmm
so the lighting effect is really cool
what you can do as well is selecting in
the map view over here and you'll see
the selection being updated in the other
list view and interred entity for in the
detail view I can even change on the
client let's say the Y position which
will result in the selected vehicle
going upstream and landing over here and
then after so many seconds will be
updated anyway from the server side
laughs so let's try zero and goes up
here and it's also reflected over here
that the new Y position is zero and all
this happens without any view knowing
any other view you know that's the
important part no view knows any other
view not even indirectly through a
controller or so you're writing this
code and you can write any view totally
independently and only knowing if
presentation model and nothing else this
is valuable for itself even for a
standalone application but now comes the
tricky the presentation model can
actually live on the server and the
server logic can decide how it
manipulates how it changes the
presentation what is in the presentation
model it is we have four instances of
the presentation model in each instance
has four attributes like so right for
the color expert positioning of the
angle that's all it takes that's all
what the what the client needs to be
concerned about and whether the client
displays it as a map as a list in a
table or as as detailed view for the
selection only the server doesn't need
to care this is all information that
only resides on the client the server
determines what to display the client
knows how to display that's the division
of labor that we have
and this is truly important for business
applications but it's not about small
prototypes or so that you're writing and
we have a number of customers that use
the exact same approach with totally
different UI technologies of course our
preferred one is JavaFX but we also have
clients using it with Eclipse RCP and
one is using it with string so it can
actually bind against it from all those
various UI technologies the back here
you have seen what happened between
client and server they actually is a
long pauling going on the server's port
for updates and whenever he is something
new he closes the the response and it
will be automatically displayed on the
client how does it look like
push demo there's some custom action
what happens on the server the server
has the server dolphin so to speak which
is this custom action for for our
application and the client shows the
view
so yes the post view
the pooch shoe is started within the
dolphin incidents for the client-side
and dwarf an instance is able to send a
command command here for the sake of
type safety is inside I click here in
the properties class with the constants
that is used I'll go back and there's a
selected vehicle which is a specialized
presentation model and the class is
client presentation model so you see
there is nothing special there is no
vehicle presentation model also it is a
generalized solution you don't have to
share any co-op between client and
server if you don't want to only these
constants are interesting to share
between client and server because you
won't have consistent constants with
client on server as we call it making
the semantic dependencies syntactic
dependencies good make life easier make
life easier
you can reflect through light and serve
at the same time yeah
so let's look into not so much the the
map view but for example the list view
the list view is based on an observable
list of client presentation model
classes which is this observable list of
PMC let's look where it's used command
shift f7 f3 so the table items table is
the table that we have seen is set to
the observable list and this never
changes it never changes the table is
bound against that list period never
changes now we add a listener to that to
that respective observe the list and
need to make best whenever this list
change this means there's a new vehicle
being available so we have to do
whatever needs to be done
for example the map has been
but there's a new entry in the map that
needs to be it needs to go in there
right and yeah there may be a new
selection and so on there we must have a
rectangle which needs a mouse to kentley
and so on so this is when the when it's
filled when there's new there's new
information available now when the main
loop starts we are now more in the
bottom of the of the code we are sending
a pull command for starting the main
loop and pull command gives us that all
the currently known vehicles their
presentation models respectively and
what we do is for every presentation
model that comes in this is an
unfinished handler that we are executing
when it's finished it's sent
asynchronously when it's finished we
know that we have to put this
presentation model inside the list of
all our presentation models right that's
that's all we have to do because the
table view of Java ethics will
automatically display the information
that's it
from an from a groovy ethics point of
view and I have a little teal is a small
teaser here for general we do have a
special kind of binding that they're
using here we're using the command
syntax from from groovy to say we'd like
to bind the X attribute of the selected
vehicle which is the deef the
presentation model for the TTL view to
the text attribute of selected X
selected X is the text field that
contains the selected vehicle thing the
x value of the selected vehicle which is
the simple binding now
this bank method the way that this Bank
method works is not it's special for
dolphin to often comes with it I can go
into the bind method it comes from Jeff
expander which is an extra class can go
back and my suggestion was that we have
some kind of this binding also in groovy
ethics but I guess we haven't decided
yet on whether we won't have it or not
so that's still an open issue I've been
playing with it I just haven't pushed it
up yet okay ah so if if we reach
consensus that we want to have it then
it's gonna be in groovy ethics as well
makes life easier for dolphin if it's in
the standard distribution good and then
you can have specialized binding for
example on action when there's the Enter
key being hit inside the the text field
or you can have be directional binding
by saying well first I bind in this
direction and then I bind in the other
direction select vehicle you can give
them a conversion logic to it when
there's an integer needs to be converted
into a string and vice-versa for this
play and that's that's how you do the
binding enough and after that there's
some selection listeners that needs need
to update the various selections so
that's that's pretty easy it's all open
source thoughtfulness open source if you
go to github open - dolphin you'll see
all that code and can work through it
well I thought it was good about this
was like I started with groovy effects
and you're down at this level just
trying to get job FX working in groovy
now I see it progress over the year to
where you have a full-fledged
application doing client server work and
combining the groovy fxn and just
showing you the progress of
what the open-source projects been doing
suppose we could take a have a few
minutes for questions if a vice
come
where the binding was wanted was playing
around with the which is probably the
most I mean a more general binding tech
mechanism the other thing is just
keeping up with all the latest changes
in Java effects and yeah we certainly
help you be welcome all contributions if
you would like to join the team that's
more than welcome you're currently order
3.1 and I would say what's missing for a
wondered over or maybe keeping up with
the with version numbers that Java
ethics has is first we are always
lagging behind a little bit with with
providing specific notes for all the
functionality that is in Java ethics
second years we have to complete the
documentation that's the biggest part
that the biggest part we also have to we
can go further for the automatic testing
that means there's only a small amount
of test cases in there I would say we
have to do more the reason why we don't
do more is first it's it's very visual
you have to see whether things look
correctly second is Java epics which we
would have used for the automation is
not quite there we where we would like
to have it
and yes all all contributions are
welcome that's that's for sure I've done
some experiments with the invokedynamic
option that's
come out groovy 2.0 and there's a few
bugs we've been uncovering along the way
but the performance is much much faster
yeah and especially when you have a UI
type thing where you're doing a lot of
looping invoke dynamic allows all that
code to be so that it's
executing it blinding speed but maybe I
guess for only a second if you're a the
way that I am working with groovy
effects writing my own code that uses
groovy ethics is have the groovy effects
project open in the background and work
from the demos right because every
single feature that we have is somewhere
in the demos you can very easily
copy/paste things over and then go from
there that's very productive even though
I don't normally advertise copy paste
that this is the way of doing it and
it's very easy if you're really fastly
progressing through your code so I'm
just
our Christmas was more the compliance
with the various JD case and letting
people forcing people to upgrade my
point on this is if you show people what
they can do when they upgrade like have
you seen the JavaFX 3d demos yesterday I
mean that's jaw-dropping and if that
means I have to upgrade to Java 7 I do
this instantaneously you have to provide
value and if you're probably bad you
people will follow that happening that
being said I'd like to mention Griffin
because the since entrances in the room
and data of course if you set out to do
any desktop Java development have a look
at Griffin Griffin gives you a true
application platform a development
platform for Java desktop development be
its wing or SWT or groovy groovy effects
Java effects whatsoever whether it's
groovy or Java or anything else that's
like I don't know ten languages
supported also you can do it with
Griffin but it gives you the right
environment a module system plugin
system add-ons like 160 170 plugins plus
plugins that you want to have you have
standard sets of icons you have
archetypes everything it's it it's so
much faster working with it I can only
recommend having a look at Griffin if
you do any serious Java desktop
development yes please
now the question is how in which case is
what I use Griffin and Randolph in both
together right the client part is
desktop development so the the big
application that you have seen on the
keynote all the 3d stuff where you fly
through a ship you through a container
yard that's the Griffin application it
is only on the client side
it has it is Griffin application using
groovy effects plug-in using dolphin
using the client often and on the server
side at the Grails application that uses
server dolphin and in the middle of this
HTTP right that is that is how it works
and and it has worked for us and for our
clients thank you very much for the
question I guess we call it a day for
today sorry
what you really do more you would like
to see the 3d demo I can show you at the
3d video man yeah this is video good
enough for the 3d video are good I can
do that groovy groovy cool thank you one
of the next steps in java facts is
making 3d objects first-class citizens
we're here this money we got to keep up
with that the other thing I like to do
with groovy effects is to start
incorporating the jf extras project if
you're familiar with that with they have
a lot more control than that type of
thing
we have
kind of metaphors
Oh
well it's one simple similar-type
feature but that's not all what Ruby is
right
every wire
groobie
I'm what I can I haven't prepared that
but what I can show you is a video that
I'm not allowed to show so but without
any legal disclaimers this is this isn't
you know I captured this with my iPhone
from one of the early developments of
the 3d stuff and please don't hold it
against me and this is one of the
presentations only to give you an a
rough idea on how it looks like well we
have all these containers and we
reported that shape transitions
very simple because our export destiny
easy to move around to send out
and yes you can explode the whole data
structure and we make use of that in a
more limited fashion that we explode
only one role such that the the operator
can see what's in that role because
otherwise it would be hidden behind the
other ones so when the the final thing
is not quite that one even though what
you see is and then there's additional
thing angry on the right hand side you
see just back and there is literally
tens of thousands of containers in that
graph and that's a scene graph with all
the containers in there and even even
more exciting I guess it's it's a few
minutes along the row you'll see a big
Tower on the left hand side yeah coming
in and this tower is composed of I don't
know as well 10,000 containers or so and
it is one single note in the scene graph
where all the 3d textures are render are
combined and give a rendered tech give a
combined texture on only one note and it
looks as if it was like thousands of
nodes though there's all kinds of tricks
that we do for all this very smooth now
you see it in the back very healthy
items if you if you have been very
observant and and yes the the ship that
is in in the docks is is made from some
space spaceship 3d modeling or so yeah
it is it is bits but star was like bit
it is relevant for business right yeah
even though we of course we started with
playing around this is truly relevant
for business because the way that simply
because there's a company nervous who
sells it right and if you can sell it
better if you can can distinguish
yourself from the competition by giving
a better user experience by having more
features being able to accommodate more
requirements
then well you then you have them an
advantage in the market well in this
case like we're doing a proof of concept
with sunspots but the sunspots like
doing light temperature and all that
this would be great to visualize that
where you could see if the container is
overheating or perhaps a container can't
go above a certain temperature threshold
and you could make that I mean we have
the frozen fish feed set it's gone so
you may have frozen fish in your car in
your container and it needs to be hooked
up to the power supply to keep it frozen
and when it starts melting it you get in
an information on the on the system get
like a pulse effecting so that's frozen
fish feeder okay thank you all so much
they come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
