infrastructure audit the cloud has
revolutionized how businesses operate
and exponentially increase the scale of
operations is there a simple solution
for managing cloud resources at scale
what about security with data access and
user privileges in both the physical and
virtual layers
is one of the many infrastructure
platform features and services that
enable governance and access
hi can you tell me what the Oracle cloud
infrastructure audit service entails
visibility is an important aspect of any
cloud implementation the Oracle cloud
infrastructure audit service
automatically records calls as log
events to all supported API endpoints
this helps you to easily see and
understand what is happening in your
tenancy
the access to audit events is highly
secure
internally the audit service performs
data integrity checks to make sure that
the events are delivered as recorded by
the service infrastructure by default
the audit service is turned on for every
tenant you cannot turn it off
every tenant administrator has access to
read audit log events in every
compartment in the tenancy to allow
other groups of users to view and manage
audit logs you must configure a policy
using Oracle cloud infrastructure
Identity and Access Management Service
or I am
you can access the audit service using
the console REST API or SDKs the service
is enabled by default at no additional
charge log events recorded by the audit
service include ID of the caller target
resource time of the recorded event
request and response parameters API
calls made by the Oracle cloud
infrastructure console command-line
interface or CLI software development
kits or SDK custom clients either Oracle
cloud infrastructure services
what problem does the service help
resolve cloud operations teens can view
the user activity triggers review usage
and changes in their tenancy and
troubleshoot problems by viewing the
activities it is also useful for
security audits and compliance
monitoring
how long does it take for an event to
get logged and how often is activity
logged it typically requires 15 minutes
from the occurrence of the event to
delivery at the log event to the audit
service log file the audit service
typically delivers events every 5
minutes
that would be a huge volume of data what
are the viewing options log events are
in JSON or JavaScript object notation
format you can view these log events in
the audit section of the console or you
can use the Java SDK to programmatically
download events matching a specified
time range log events can be analyzed
using standard log analysis tools
however you cannot modify log events
here is a sample event log
these events are in standard JSON format
so you can easily use them with popular
audit and security analysis tools
let me share some tips that you will
find helpful when using the audit
service and inspecting the events for
the key questions that audit service
answers you will need to inspect each
audit event for specific fields
what was the activity for this you need
to examine the fields of request action
request parameters request resource
as you can see the action performed was
to get or view details about the compute
instance
who did it from where to identify the
user or group that perform the action
look at principal ID request agent
compartment ID
this gives you the identity of the agent
associated with the action
when did it happen look at event time
what was the outcome
check response status when was the
outcome you can see that under response
time
you can use the text search in the
console to filter to the most
interesting events for example to list
all events that experienced failure you
can search for events with failure
status codes like 5 0 0 or 4 0 4
how long will this data remain available
all audit events are archived for 90
days after they are recorded it can be
extended up to 365 days by using the SDK
REST API or by calling customer support
audit events cannot be archived for more
than 365 days
thanks for sharing all this information
sure hope you can now easily view and
understand the activity in your tenancy
