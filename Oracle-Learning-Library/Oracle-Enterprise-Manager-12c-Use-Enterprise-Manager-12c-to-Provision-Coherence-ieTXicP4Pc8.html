hi my name is mother in this session
we'll see how to use interval manage it
will see to provision coherence for
provisioning to work we first need to
ensure that this software library is
properly set up you can create the
software library using setup menu go to
provisioning and patterning and then
software library you can create the
software library on OMS shared file
system or agent file system
once the software library set up we then
go in and create components to create
components click on the enterprise menu
provisioning and padding and then click
on the software library menu on this
page the first thing that we need to do
is create a folder under this folder
will start creating components I have
created two components here each
component here represents a file in this
case I have chosen the zip file of the
coherence installation and the perl
script for starting the node this perl
script default start script dot PL is
available with enterprise manager
installation typically this will involve
several configuration files or
application specific jar file or any
other file that is necessary to set up
the coherence to create a component
select this menu create entity component
select genetic component give the name
of the component which you want to
create typically this will be the name
of the file the product name has to be
coherence this is really mandatory click
Next click Next on this page we select
the software library location the source
can either be the local machine or an
agent machine if you select an agent
machine then you have to select an host
then you have to log in using your
credential once the files are selected
here then you go ahead and complete this
visa and create a component once the
components are created we then go to the
provisioning and patting procedure
library on this page we search for
coherence here we have a deployment
procedure called coherence node
provisioning we select that and we click
the launch button this will launch the
coherence provisioning wizard on this
page we have to select all the
components that we need to provision as
you may you might notice the product
name is already selected here we select
the components
click Next on this page we have option
you can actually add a new node to an
existing cluster create a new cluster or
updating existing node we will select
the option of creating a new cluster I
give the name of the cluster as
provisioning cluster you have a option
of selecting communication our
communication methodology multi casting
as well as well known address we will
select the well known address the next
step is to add a note on this page you
can actually go ahead and select the
host where you want to add the new node
the first node typically is our
management nodes so we give the name of
the management node then we mentioned
the unicast address and unique a sport
we mentioned that in the well known
address since this is a management node
we have to select this option management
node with mbean server we specify the
jmx port number remember we also have to
select this particular checkbox primary
management node used for monitoring
since this is the first management note
into file manager you will use this
management note for monitoring the
cluster here we specify the installation
directory this is where the coherent
files will be copied and we also have to
specify the part of the start of crib
click continue next we go ahead and add
a storage node here again we select the
host we specify the node name you
specify the unicast address input and
also mentioned the least of well known
addresses here since this is the second
note that we are creating on the same
machine we select this particular option
do not copy software components in this
case enterprise manager will not copy
the software components again the next
step again here we specify the
installation directory and the path of
the start of script click continue
click next here we have to specify the
host credentials so I select the host
where this deployment is going to happen
and I go ahead and select the right
credentials click Next I also have to
select the schedule you can select the
time which is in future so that you can
actually plan your deployment or you can
do the deployment right away click Next
this is the page where you can actually
review your deployment if everything is
fine you can go ahead and click the
finish button this will launch the
deployment procedure you can track the
progress of it using enterprise manager
once the deployment procedure is
successful Enterprise Manager will
automatically discover the newly created
cluster and all the nodes which are
running in that cluster
thank you for watching this
demonstration
