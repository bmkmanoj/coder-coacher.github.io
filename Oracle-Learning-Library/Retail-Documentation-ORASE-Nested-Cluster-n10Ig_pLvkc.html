documentation video series unnecessary
advance for clustering is an enterprise
specific clustering solution that uses
data mining to create store groupings at
different product levels using a variety
of inputs these inputs include
performance data such as sales dollars
sales units and gross profit product
attributes such as brand color size and
fit store attributes such as climate
store format size and servicing
distribution centers third-party data
such as demographics like income
ethnicity and population density and
customer segments in this session I'll
be showing you how to generate an Esav
cluster using multiple criteria in a
hierarchical form for instance will
generate clusters using climate and
historical sales performance and then
proceed with nested clusters which allow
you to subdivide an existing cluster in
order to analyze it further to generate
a store cluster I'll click the tasks
icon and select generate store cluster
on the all cluster criteria page I'll
select the create new cluster icon
the new cluster criteria pop-up opens
where I'll find the initial cluster by
entering the name I wish to assign the
cluster
to create the nested cluster I'll select
the cluster hierarchy icon
in this example I'll select store
attributes for criteria level one and
product performance for criteria level
two
on the right side of the screen you can
see the cluster by hierarchy of store
attribute and product performance I can
also select the effective date for the
cluster and the history to use when I'm
finished I'll click Save
once you create an F sequester the name
nested of the name of the original
cluster appears in the cluster criteria
area you can then define its
characteristics in the same way you
define any cluster
notice the status says created too cute
the primary cluster and the nested
cluster I selected the primary cluster
and now I'll click the execute all icon
the status changes to execution in
progress in order to see the completed
execution I'll need to select the
Refresh icon and we can see that both
the primary cluster and the nested
cluster are in the status of ready for
approval
now I'll move to the cluster results
page
the application uses the data and the
parameters I defined in order to group
stores together that are most similar
according to the characteristics I
selected and two separate stores that
are most dissimilar
I can rename each of the clusters to
more accurately reflect the attributes
of the store by selecting the name and
then selecting the drop-down arrow next
to actions
then I'll select rename' cluster
I'll rename the cluster to cold to
reflect the cold climate of this store
cluster
and then I'll do the same for each of
the clusters to reflect the warm and hot
weather climates of the other store
clusters
you
I'll then return to the cluster criteria
stage
and this time I'll select the nested
clusters I want to rename these clusters
as well I'll rename each of these
clusters as part of the primary cluster
attributes I'll need to do this for each
store attribute of cold warm and hot
I can change the scenario name by
selecting the drop-down next to scenario
name on the cluster results page
when I'm finished renaming to see the
hierarchy I'll select the cluster
hierarchy cab on the cluster results
page where i can see the store
attributes I'll drill down by clicking
the arrow next to the attribute where I
can see the additional child levels a B
and C I can drill down even further by
clicking the arrow next to the a and I
can see all of the stores in that level
if the cluster information reflects the
data you want to report on you will need
to approve the cluster scenario by
moving to the cluster insight section to
approve the cluster I'll expand the
cluster and then right-click on the
primary scenario and select scenario
menu and then approve selected scenario
this will also approve clusters for all
other parent clusters for instance hot
and warm and now a leaf or child level
clusters like cold a and hot C are ready
for export
as part of this session I showed you how
to create a message cluster for more
information on creating clusters and the
BI results associated please see the
video on creating an advanced cluster

science documentation video series for
