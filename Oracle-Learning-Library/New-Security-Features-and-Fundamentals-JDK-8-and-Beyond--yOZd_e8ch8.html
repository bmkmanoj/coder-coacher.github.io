we're going to be doing tonight my name
is Brad wetmore and to my right is Jeff
Niswonger I am one of the security
engineers that works with the core
libraries in the JDK Jeff is our
security architect and we've
collectively been on this for about 20
something years so we have a little bit
of history with the group but this is
actually pretty good usually we get the
thursday night at nine-thirty crowd and
everyone's kind of like oh shoot I want
to be over on Treasure Island and so
this is actually good right next slide
please so as I mentioned we are part of
the Java security library team and our
primary responsibility is for the Java
standard ish edition and the GDK
security technologies we also do a lot
of consulting with a lot of other groups
within Oracle especially the Java ME
organization and sometimes the s EE
organization as well so we're really
after the design the implementation and
maintenance of the different api's and
of course the underlying implementation
that goes along with it so when you or
download the oracle jdk you're pretty
much getting the stuff that we work on
of course now a lot of our stuff is part
of the OpenJDK so most of the OpenJDK
work that we do eventually ends up in
the oracle jdk so the different
libraries that we work with I work
specifically on the cryptography
libraries that I misspelled that okay
the public key infrastructure secure
communications authentication access
control XML signatures and so on so
that's kind of a very brief overview of
the different libraries that we also do
there's other things like Kerberos and
GG SS and SAS all and all those
different kinds of things one of the
other things that our group is prime
sponsored for or chartered with i should
say is working with some of the
vulnerabilities and to try to help other
teams assess and understand what the
vulnerabilities are so that they can go
ahead and get them fixed so we'll do
some code reviews and you know basically
just consult with them one of the other
things that one of our team members
works on is the secure coding guidelines
and so that's a some documentation but
best practices that we can help put out
so that you guys can actually look at
your code and say oh I shouldn't be
doing this maybe this isn't the greatest
idea so next slide please so for more
information if you're familiar with the
JDK and the JD hey security probably
seen these pages already but I thought
I'd just throw them up there anyway so
that the people who haven't seen them
can and for the people that are
downloading the slides they can also
find where they are if you go to the JDK
documentation you will be these pages
will pop right out of course so next
slide please so I did get a little bit
on the secure coding guidelines there's
actually two documents that are out
there now one of them is the one that
Oracle actually publishes and that is
the Oracle secure coding guidelines and
if you look on the web google it or
yahoo google being yet you will find our
document there and it's kind of a it's a
shorter document it's not terribly long
but it would take you a couple hours to
read and i would highly recommend that
anyone who's doing any java coding take
a look at this there's just things that
we see all the time where people are
doing public static hints and all of a
sudden they don't realize that there's a
you know way that somebody can grab that
value and change it and all of a sudden
all of their assumptions that they were
doing no longer apply and so you know
it's it's simple things like that and
some of them are a lot more insidious
and a lot trickier to find but I would
recommend that anyone who's doing any
programming in Java definitely have a
look at that document now if you want to
go a little bit deeper well actually
quite a bit deeper this organization has
also put out a book and we've consulted
with them and it's actually available
out in the bookstore there's a little
bookstore out in one of the lobbies
there and it's they've done it's
probably about two inches thick it's a
pretty thick book and then go into a lot
more detail some of the problems that
you might have in addition to touching
some other things that we didn't mention
in our document
okay so we thought we'd do just a little
bit of a recap of some of the things we
did in jdk 7 and then we'll move on to
some of the things in that we're
planning for JDK 8 and beyond so one of
the first things that a lot of people
have been asking for was an ECC provider
or elliptic curve cryptography
essentially what that does is it allows
for much faster public and private key
operations and so we put together a ECC
provider that's it's actually native so
we'll run a little bit faster and it's
also based on the Solaris ECC provider
that's uh that's in Solaris
unfortunately we wanted to do a java
based version but because of the
licensing issues that were involved this
was the best next thing that we could do
that would not really run us down into a
path of other licensing issues another
thing that we worked on was doing some
certain paths and TLS algorithm
disabling so you're probably familiar
now with that some of the certificates
that are based on algorithms such as MD
two are essentially broken or certainly
much less secure than would be
acceptable in some environments so we
have added a few system properties
they're actually security properties
which will allow you to disable certain
algorithms or certain algorithms based
on the key length that is used to
initialize these algorithms and then the
way to configure them is actually there
it's a security property not a system
property and you would just specify that
either in the Java security file or you
could set it through the api's okay now
one of the areas that I worked on is the
SSL and TLS or the transport layer
security which is essentially HTTPS for
those who are not really familiar with
it HTTP s giving TLS 10 has been the
version of TLS that we've had in the JDK
pretty much since day one um it has some
drawbacks and if you've been following
any of the news you've probably seen
some of those about a year ago there was
an issue called beast and essentially
what that came down to was a
problem that was in the protocol itself
well about six years ago there was
actually a update to the protocol called
TLS one dot one and that one addressed
the problem that beast eventually
exploited and so in jdk 7 we do have TLS
11 and we also went ahead and
implemented the next one which is TLS 12
and those are available in jdk 7 at the
moment at the moment there is no plans
to backport these 26 but if we get
enough a request we will certainly
consider it right now we're deep in the
middle of getting everything ready for
eight so six is adding new features 26
is a little bit hard at this point some
of the requirements of TLS one dot one
is that we disable some of the weaker
cipher street cipher Suites so some of
those things which depended on the 40
bit version of des are pretty much
forbidden at this point especially once
you get into TLS 1 dot 1 and 1 da 2 so
we had some of those available but just
disabled or not enabled by default i
should say one of the other things is
something called server name indication
and essentially what that is is it's a
way to hint at the TLS protocol layer
what server you're trying to connect to
so if anybody knows anything about HTTP
HTTP has these header fields that they
use that say I want to connect to host
google com well unfortunately when
you're trying to deal with a TLS
handshake all of that information about
you know host colon google com all
occurs after the handshake is finished
and so if you want to connect to google
com on a virtual host that is serving
many many different domains you've got
to indicate that information before the
handshake completes and so SN was a way
that was developed by the IETF to
address that short coming and so we have
added the client side only version of
SNI which is essentially if you ask for
a socket and you say I want to connect
to google com we will add in the sni
information for google com as an
extension to the client hellos at the
moment there is no server side but
be talking about the server side in the
next little bit here we also have some
things for endpoint verification in the
previous days we used to have a hostname
verifier and the hostname verifier would
try to match up and make sure that if
you're connecting to google com and you
get a certificate back that says
amazon.com you say well we these don't
match up I'm not really connecting to
who I thought I was connecting to so we
do a different style of endpoint
verification now where we actually have
the ability to check within the trust
manager or the key manager who you're
actually connecting to and also the key
manager and trust manager actually have
access to the sessions under
construction and so as the handshake is
proceeding you can go ahead and grab the
relevant bits that have already been
established and use that to make your
decisions and then the last one we used
to wrap all of our ssl hello handshakes
in a older version to support some of
the older ssl v2 client hellos or
clients excuse me we used to wrap our
ssl hellos in an older version of the
hello format and pretty much those have
all gone away at this point so we went
ahead and disabled that by default okay
some of the other things there was a
plenty of key tool enhancements we used
to pretty much only generate self-signed
certificates and there were certificates
with no extensions on them and so we now
have a way to actually have a way to
create extensions as well as create
certificate authorities so you can have
a certificate authority sign a
certificate for another entity and it's
it works pretty well there's also a way
to grab certificates that are on a ssl
server or https server and you can grab
those and print them out or you can
import them into a keystore jgs s is now
using the Kerberos 5 login module by
default when there is no jazz
configuration available for it there's a
new API
extension for something called the
Galois counter mode which is a variant
of the AE ad and they have to come up
with it advanced yeah authenticated
encryption associated with associated
data thank you I should know that I
wrote the thing the thing but anyway
there was there was no api's to allow
for this kind of mode within a cipher
and so we went ahead and added a few
extensions here and there in the cipher
class to to allow for that that has the
advantage that if we get time we will go
ahead and back port some of the GCM
modes that we're going to be working on
from JDK 8 when that actually gets
implemented back into jdk 7 so you will
have that available fairly soon and next
slide okay one of the other things that
a lot of people have been asking for is
to have a list of required algorithms
that you know pretty much you could be
assured that we're going to be existing
on every implementation that you went to
so if you ran ours and then you ran an
application under IBM you would at least
know that you're going to get a es and
RSA a DSA and diffie-hellman and so on
so it does help with cross platform or
cross implementation development and
then there's also the new ntlm sasal
mechanism all right and that's it for my
little section here and then Jeff is
going to talk to you more about what's
coming in the next release hopefully
I assume you're all reading that very
carefully basically says you know what
we're telling you what what we think
we're going to do but subject to change
time pressures things get moved from one
release to another things turn out not
to be such a good idea when you're
implementing them things like that so
just just so you know let's start taking
a look at what we got here my glasses on
so so what are we doing here so we've
been moving java development to a more
open jdk right open source development
model and over time we're becoming more
and more transparent in our i always at
priorities for the future releases and
what projects we're going to work on and
other people can start proposing things
and stuff like that so there's a there's
a process behind that and in particular
there's something called a JEP or a jdk
enhancement proposal and that's just a
short form description of a feature idea
for inclusion in a new release so we're
going to walk through some of the jep's
or enhancement proposals that are
targeted for jdk 8 at the moment and if
you want to see these online you can go
to OpenJDK java.net / jeffs and and you
can see all the things I'm going to talk
about tonight plus things that are not
security related and you can see them in
more detail that I'm going to talk about
them here so it's good stuff to see
there and also also on OpenJDK we have a
security web page that describes more
about the group and other things we're
doing in the process for participating
of you know in the open source
environment and we have a mailing list
that you can see there that also is our
so once again under consideration not a
promise might some of these might
possibly get pushed off to jdk 9 or
disappear altogether new ones might be
added in the future so they're numbered
you can compare these numbers to what
you see on the online Jeff pages that I
pointed you out earlier so let's start
going down the list here 113 is called
ms sfu which is obviously an acronym for
something sounds like it might be an
expletive we're not sure so it's a
Microsoft Kerberos 5 extension and I'm
guessing that it was originally designed
for the service for unix Microsoft
add-on that you can install on top of
Windows that provides you a eunuch
simulation environment we're going to
run compile and run UNIX programs and
what it does is it is it enhances the
Kerberos 5 delegation mechanisms so it
lets a server that is contacted by a
client a client makes a request to a
server and the server authenticates but
it doesn't use creek the client doesn't
use kerberos to authenticate itself to
the server so these mechanisms allow the
server to authenticate to Kerberos on
behalf of this client that's that's
that's calling to them and get a
Kerberos service ticket so they can turn
around and access some back-end service
or proxy or request with the clients
authentication to some other service you
know as part of its implementation so
these are defined and Microsoft has
published the specifications for these
in the open and that anybody can
implement so we're going to look at
whether it makes sense for us to
implement them the next JEP is 114 and
that is the TLS server name indication
that Brad was speaking about earlier
except it's the server side of that so
in jdk 7 we have the client side so the
client can tell the web server hey i'm
trying to authenticate you as this
hostname and if the server actually
serves up content for multiple different
host names virtual host names then
server can pick the right certificate to
send back to the client to complete the
authentication process so this is going
to be in jdk 8 or enlist in this in this
request to enhance jdk this is the
server side of that so its mechanisms
that can be used in the jsse secure
socket extension api's that implement
TLS to allow a server to configure and
control the way that it's multiple host
names that it can authenticate as get
get process these incoming requests from
different clients that use server name
indication so the next one is is the AE
ad cipher Suites and Brad also talked
about that that's that's implementing
what yeah you it's this Galois counter
mode related cipher suites that do this
authenticated encryption which is
different style of encryption block
ciphers and there's a set of TLS cipher
suites or ways of using that low level
encryption mechanism with TLS so we're
going to be implementing those hopefully
and 116 is extended validation
certificate so if you've ever gone to a
website for like a bank or a stockbroker
or some sort of a high valued financial
institution kind of site that's using
HTTPS to let you connect to it you might
notice that when you when you go to that
in your browser when that server is
authenticated
the URL the top of your browser terms of
green or at dordt you know it shows some
indication that that this is an enhanced
SSL authentication site and so that's
the that's that's a extended
authentication that the companies that
issue public key certificates for use
with SSL go and they you pay extra money
to them they'll check you out more
thoroughly and then they'll give you a
certificate that has these magic bits in
it that say that this is an extended
validation certificate we really checked
you out and and then when the browser
sees that it can turn things brain so
we're going to put some api's into Java
that allowed java applications to
recognize these things and process them
in a friendlier way than currently as
possible so 121 the JEP for this one is
titled stronger algorithms for password
based encryption so password based
encryption is a way of taking a password
that somebody types in and turning it
into an encryption key that can be used
to do something else to decrypt
something or decrypt some other keys
that you use to create keys they're used
for communication protocols encrypting
things so it's a way of taking a
password that someone might type in and
turning it into an encryption key and we
have some api's for doing this in in the
jdk right now but they've been in there
for quite a while they're weaker their
old or the new and better things have
come along so we're going to go through
and look at putting some newer and
higher quality algorithms into the jdk
for doing that
the next one is 123 which is
configurable secure random number
generation and I think this is getting
it we have almost forever we've had a
class called secure random which allows
you to get a stream of random numbers or
random bits random bytes and this is
different from the random number
generator that's in Java math which is
just kind of like a handy source of
faking it to get pseudo-random numbers
so the the secure random API is is a
more secure way of faking it because
they're not necessarily totally random
numbers they're just random enough for
cryptographic purposes they're not
necessarily generated by sampling the
physics of you know whatever but they're
gathered up by sources of entropy like
when a system boots up you know what do
the interrupt timing sequences that are
hard to guess that happen what do people
the timing of the way people type on a
keyboard and various other kinds of
things that gather enough random
unguessable information that you can
generate random numbers see two random
number generator this that's good enough
for security purposes and we've had this
mechanism for a long time but it's it's
not it's a little bit hard to configure
it in a way that gives you the high
quality that you need for some
situations like you're generating
short-term keys versus long-term keys
that you're going to use for a long time
you we want different assurance levels
for the random numbers that you get and
so we're this is all problem not just
for Java but actually for the whole
industry there's dev random and dev view
random in UNIX and people are finding
that they don't really give you enough
expressiveness to to let you ask for the
quality of numbers that you really need
so does that's all improving our stuff
working with the unexpended and other
operating system vendors to improve the
way that they give it to us as well so
124 is enhancing the certificate
revocation checking API so what that is
is when you like
NSSL site and it n Achatz a server what
actually happens is server sounds a list
of certificates to the to the client as
part of the SSL handshake and a
certificate is just a big blob that has
a public key embedded inside of it and
then a bunch of naming information that
says what this key is for and who issued
it and so we've had an API since at
least one dot three that lets you get
these certificates and hand them off to
this API which can go and check them out
make sure they all make sense together
and they do what you want because it's
all complicated really to make sure that
these certificates are real and not fake
and so we want to refine this API and
give it more flexibility let it support
some newer features that have been added
to the public key infrastructure on the
internet over time and make it more
flexible for new new protocols and new
uses of certificates so the next one is
140 and it's called limited due
privilege so if you're familiar with the
access control mechanisms in Java we
when you make a request to do something
like open a file or make a network
connection or something like that when
we when we did we know we need to
determine should we allow that to happen
say say you're an applet your downloaded
running in the sandbox and so we need to
decide whether to allow that to occur
and so the way we do that is we look on
a call stack look at all the people who
have been calling in the call stack that
led up to this request to open that file
we make sure that that the code the you
know that the Java class that that
method is in you know some method called
in class a call to method in class b
which called a method in class c and
when we go and we make sure that that a
B and C classes have the permission to
open the file that you actually are
trying to open and so there's a
mechanism to let you short-circuit that
called duper
and if you have extra special privileges
you might want to assert your privileges
by using this API and saying I know what
I'm doing I don't care who called me i'm
using my privileges to open this file
and so what this is about he's letting
you be more specific so what's that I'm
just saying I want to assert all my
privileges that I happen to have
regardless of what I'm about to do that
needs more privileges this is a way of
describing i am going to assert my
privileges to open files in / town and
then you go open your files in / temps
you're not opening you're not asserting
everything you're just asserting the
actual narrow specific thing that's
extra special that you need to do so
it's it's a good idea it's a it prevents
certain kinds of exploitation security
holes where someone convinces you to do
something you weren't actually intending
to do originally so that's something
we're looking at 152 is about crypto
operations and something called network
h SMS so an HSM is a hardware security
module which is a fancy name for a
crypto card or some kind of device that
knows how to do encryption operations
and hardware and typically they also
have ways of creating and maybe even
storing cryptographic keys maybe in ways
that the keys never actually leave the
hardware device so that software can use
a key and encrypt something with a key
but it can't actually read the value
with the key and I take it and send it
somewhere else so it's a so an HSM is a
generic name for one of these encryption
hardware devices and sometimes they have
these things on the network so they're
not even on your machine like in the old
days it would be you know backplane in
your computer and you'd go and you'd
stick one of these cards in there and
put the screws back on and there you go
but nowadays some people have have these
things on the network and they can
process requests from multiple machines
and do things like that so there's been
some requests to us to enhance our api's
and make it easier to use such things
and fit them in with other cryptographic
providers that may be configured in Java
like ones that are software only that we
implement and make it all work work
together better so that's what that's
about 166 is a request to overhaul the
key stores that we have so there's some
names of key store types JC eks and j KS
and pkc s12 those are all names of key
stores and in a key store in this sense
is is a location of key storage so it's
in reality for these it's a file so it's
a file on the disk and it's filled with
a bunch of binary data and in different
formats and and the contents inside the
binary data are keys that you can use
for encryption or maybe they even
contain certificates that would be used
with say an ssl server that you're going
to configure so we've got these three
different formats the first two of them
jks and JC eks are java specific there
weren't any good format file formats at
the time that we were doing this so we
just invented some jks is one that does
not does not literally encrypt the
contents of the file because of export
encryption regulations at the time that
we did it and JC eks was similar to jks
except that it did real encryption on
the contents of your of your file so if
pkcs12 is actually a standard so there's
a bunch of security standards called PK
CSS and pkc s that that were largely
defined by RSA laboratories which is a
company which some of the RSA encryption
founders and work for were dead so that
is a file format they came up with for
it primarily for interchanging key
material from one platform to another
one machine to
there but we use it as a general-purpose
key store as well right now we support
it but we and we let people configure it
but we don't use it as the default key
store when we ship the JDK for
historical and backwards compatibility
reasons so we're going to look at
whether it makes sense to actually
finally switch to a keystore file format
that's actually encrypted and and what
the compatibility aspects of that are
and we may need to enhance bkc s12 a
little bit to support support some of
the notions that we have in our key
store API so these are three more jets
which have actually been implemented the
ones that I was describing before our
ideas that are on the list of things to
do but they're not actually integrated
into the code yet that you can download
and look out and play with so NSA suite
b is is a specification document that
the government put out the National
Security Agency and it specifies a
standard list of algorithms Brad was
mentioning that in jdk 7 we published
our own list of standard algorithms that
we implement so that we have you know
cross you know JDK implementations from
different companies and licensees all
have a standard minimal set well NSA's
list is larger and it's it's going to be
mandated at least for certain government
purposes and it's generally a good thing
it adds some important new algorithms
and cipher block modes and things like
that so longer key lengths for certain
algorithms we already support so we're
going to be implementing we hope NSA
sweetpea across the board so we can just
say that we do it SSH sha 224 for JEP
130 is is a kind of message digest so
message digests Divac Westman way back
there yeah
question is about back porting cipher
implementations and as I sweet be back
boarding the NSA sweet pea no I what I
meant was was we're implementing all of
the algorithms that are listed in the
NSA sweet pea specification we're not
necessarily back porting that's that's
something for JDK 8 we hope so sha or
Shaw 224 is a message digest a message
digest is a way of taking a bunch of
data and making up a short version of it
which you like you can use forking like
create a message digest of a file and
then later on you can transmit that
digest or shortened version of the of
that file and then compare it you know
to a file on another machine and
generate the same thing for the other
file and then and then see if the two
digests match if the two digests match
then there's very high chance that the
larger files are actually the same file
so checksum it's a fancy cryptographic
check zone so there's a whole bunch of
them based around some governments to
NSA generated standards for Shaw called
Shaw and later shot 2 and 2 24 is one of
those that has a certain length to it
now it's 22 24 bits instead of 256 bits
or 512 bits we never bothered
implemented before wasn't widely used as
some of the others but now we're going
to do it just for completeness sake we
do yeah we do shot 256 and sha-3 84-inch
I of 512 and 224 just I just never got
around to it before and mostly people
don't care so the last one on on this
page JEP 131 is about doing a 64-bit
version of the windows native library
that that implements the pkc s11 and
crypto support so if you you know we
have a pkc s11 is another one of these p
kc s things and pkc s11 rather than
being like a file format or something is
actually an api specification and so
it's a way of that what happened
hardware vendors and people who
implement cryptography actually
implement this p kc s 11 is a library
now they implement the methods are the
functions that are specified as part of
this api specification and turn it into
a live native library and you can use
that library to encrypt stuff with their
library and so we in Java we have a
capability to dynamically load different
peoples libraries that implement the
standard API and then we can make that
cryptographic capability available
through the Java API is automatically so
so you can go to different people and
get different p kc s 11 implementations
and configure java to use it and boom
you can start using it from java and so
we haven't supported 64-bit windows
versions of this in the past there you
we have 32 but we haven't haven't gotten
around 64 so we're doing 64
and that's actiontec I'm going to toss
in one more thing and that is something
that's sort of kind of related to
security but lots of other things so we
don't list we didn't list it
specifically here and that is a java
modular ization or jig the project
jigsaw and one of the security
implications it has when we implement
its now targeted at JD canine is is
going to give us some new kinds of java
access controls so when you have a class
and you say well my class is public or
my class is not public java modularity
when we implement it is going to give
you an extra layer of that so that you
can have you can have some code that you
write an application or library or
something like that and you can specify
which which api's or classes that that
that are part of your implementation are
supposed to be callable by other people
and be public and which of those classes
are purely internal implementation and
should never be seen outside of your
module or should only be seen by people
that you know are writing other modules
that you're closely working together on
and so that's that's going to be an
important thing in the future but not in
not in jdk 8 so having gone down the
list and given my spiel equal have I
have one more thing dad took at the
discussion that Jeff had in some of
these features that we've been working
on that are coming up there's the list
that are actually integrated today and
are ready to go there was also the list
it's not quite there yet and if you're
interested in seeing those and seeing
the progress that's been made on them
the openjdk mailing list is where we do
a lot of our discussion and so if you
want to see what the current status is
of some of these different jep's that's
the place to go and of course please
participate in the conversation if
you're interested yeah excellent
have any any questions any requests for
things that are on our list yeah I guess
right in the back there
I'm afraid I didn't quite catch your
question can you repeat it I think the
question I didn't I had trouble hearing
it I think the question was something
about sha sha three I think that's not
likely to show up in jdk yeah that's not
that's not currently on the list any
other questions yep
well this this this this session is
really just sort of talk about the
library features and and you know future
things that we're working on we're not
really going to address like specific
vulnerability things in this buff
actually milk yep introduce yourself
yeah so my name is Milton Smith and I
lead the Java security program and
yesterday I did a presentation and I
think when the materials for that are
made available I think it'll help answer
some of your questions it talks more
about the the program and you know why
and when we communicate and things like
that so I think that'll be helpful you
wanna talk about those slides a couple
songs over we'll just go just let
everybody see it yeah because the audio
is there and all that yeah yeah I
provided it yesterday yep I don't know
exactly the protocol for when it's going
to be posted but the other two are just
rotated through 830am yep so you had to
be really motivated for security all
right
anyone else dare to raise their hand
okay well we're going to be we're going
to be up here for at least a few minutes
feel free to come on up and ask
questions grab this out in the hallway
we can talk a little bit more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
