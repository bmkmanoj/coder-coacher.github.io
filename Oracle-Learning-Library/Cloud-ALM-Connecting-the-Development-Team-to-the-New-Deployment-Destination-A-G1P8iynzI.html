talk to you today about bringing some
alm into the cloud and my name is Mick
Kirsten the CEO of Catholic technologies
in the creator of the Eclipse my own
project i'm joined by can gather convery
from oracle he might have seen in this
morning's keynote with with thomas
korean and lucas bandar who's the
development lead for the open source
components here from task top so what
you'll see a lot of in you know sort of
all the developer counts that you go to
and especially oracle world java one is
the transformation that we're seeing on
the application development side with
the cloud so we've got both in terms of
you know maybe what you saw in the
earlier keynote this morning how
infrastructure as a service is now
established on top of that there's a lot
of the innovation and love to change
that's driving the way that we build
application is on the next layer up on
platform as a service so that the
applications that we're actually
building you know there's very much
service based hosted applications that's
becoming easier eat much easier the
economy of scales scale and the hosting
supports that and now all of that is
becoming available for java which is a
really big deal on those layers we've
got some you know these these currencies
of virtual machines then ready-made
services nap hosting that's transforming
the way that we build applications but
what we up what often takes a back seat
is the way those applications evolve
over time so not only the way that we
build the application the way that we
deploy them you know and the change from
the deployment destination being under
our desk to being in a data center to
being a hosted destination the way that
that application involves all the time
the way that we go from requirements
that we that we collaborate with our
team members the way that we spin up new
projects and so just like there's been a
lot of innovation on the application
development side the application
lifecycle management site is changing
and these two things need to change
together they need to evolve together so
this talk will take a look at that alm
angle of this move to cloud and really
addressing not you know not just where
the bells deploy to but the way that we
work day today and the way that this is
affecting our tool chains and the way
that this provides us with a lot of new
opportunity
and how we can plug this into the Oracle
developer cloud services so a really
interesting change in the way an
application lifecycle management over
the last 10 years has been just how much
developers have transformed the ALM
staff so it used to be that large scale
applications were managed with tools
like clearquest and clear case and the
rational unified process these very
stringent management centric processes
that were very rigid and then you know
basically agile development and these
very lightweight open source tools
transformed everything so things that
were very much driven and architected
around manager control have been
disrupted by things our support
developer control and ease and these
tools that became popular so bugzilla it
was one of the main innovations there
are some tools before it tools like grr
actually just take that same model of
bugzilla Zilla didn't in Japanese you
pronounce JIRA and that's where the term
deira comes from is bajheera well they
were Japanese people as you can spot
Zilla it's that same mental model of
very lightweight workflows that's been
commercialized in the lot of these tools
that we also have open source tools for
source code as we move from CVS to
subversion subversion was a big
disruption and now get tools like
material as well so these are just some
examples bias to the Eclipse ecosystem
and in this Eclipse continued survey the
numbers are similar from last year's
community equals to new survey you'll
note that for organizations not just
contribute to eclipse but using eclipse
the open source tools have the majority
of the market share these very
lightweight tools have the majority of
the market share so a lot of new
projects are ramping up with tool chains
like this one and there's been evolution
right cruise control is almost out of
the stack but most people stats but
there's been this disruption because
these tools make it very easy for
developers to work there you know all
the sorts of planning and managerial
facilities and ways of doing sort of
traceability across the lifecycle
they're actually missing from these
tools these are just very lightweight
tools that make developers very
productive there's this problem because
the
burden on setting up these tools and
these tool chains is actually now found
on the developer you've got your IDE
you've got your ALM server so you might
have set up your Garret and you're good
and you're trying to figure out the best
practices and kind of wire things
together you're setting up your IDE
manually all the way as well so you now
connect them to six different servers
from your IDE and trying to you know the
passwords for each one and sending up
the configuration for each one and
figure out which Hudson jobs you care
about for this release because there's
300 and then you've got your application
which you have to connect to so your
application is you know whether it's
hosted or whether it's you know it's
on-premise there's a lot of setup that
you have to do to get the right branches
for the application to do that so
there's just a ton of this manual work
because the tools are disconnected so
with Oracle we saw this interesting
opportunity of using the new host the
development destination taking some of
the best of breed aspects of these of
these open source tools and putting
field is this interesting offering for
developers so you can gather is going to
show you some of this new offering that
he's summarize this morning I'll show
you how it plays in with these open
source components and these this
integration layer that we've been
working on Glen thanks make how many of
you were at the Thomas Korean keynote
this morning about the Oracle cloud not
many of you so I can repeat the whole
thing so one of the things that week was
just talking about is I need to do all
of this set up to start a development
project all the tooling that I need and
in the end if what I'm going to produce
is an application that is going to run
on the cloud the obvious question is why
can't they have all this set up in the
club why can't I have this all
integrated with the runtime that is
going to be in the club why can't i have
a developer 12 and that's the Oracle
developer cloud service so it provides a
turnkey development environment that you
can go to snorkel calm and sign up and
you get a complete development
environment including the basic
functionality with source control tasks
Vicky continuous integration by Hudson
and automatic deployment to the Oracle
Java cloud service on the Oracle
database cloud service so you can do
continuous integration deployment into
the cloud as well and this is all
integrated with the rest of the cloud
there are collaboration tools iron it is
based on the same set of standards that
you are already familiar with source
control where I get you can also use
github if you don't want to migrate the
code to start with there is issue
tracking functionality built in with
flexibility so that your issue you can
track bugs you can track tasks you can
track enhancements with flexible
searching tagging and all the
functionality that comes with issue
tracking continuous integration by a
Hudson and then Vicki for project
planning and then collaboration they are
all these subsystems publishing into
activity streams so that your
distributed development team can
collaborate with each other where are
these notifications that come through
Activity Stream and email etc etc also
that while developer cloud service takes
care of setting up all the environment
and all the key functionality that is
needed in the cloud so that you as the
developer can focus on what needs to be
done for the business logic of your
application commit your source code
track and monitor the bills are going
through fine and then deploy the
application to the runtime and then test
your act the developer cloud service
provides multiple interfaces so you can
obviously use the developer cloud
dashboard which we are going to
demonstrate in a few minutes you can
also pick your favorite IDE it's all
integrated with all these three IDs
jdeveloper eclipse NetBeans you can work
on your tasks from the IDE can work on
your source control and push it to the
cloud using the IDE you can test the
application using the IDE all of that
stuff you also have ssh access to get we
also expose rest interfaces so that you
can build custom tooling on top of it
and
as we demonstrate later on and talk
about it there are partner applications
like the task of saying that demonstrate
that capability and well we have the
founder of the Milan project here so
obviously my name is all integrated with
the developer cloud service so with that
thank you so what we're doing here is
taking all those things and again the
key goal here is you just get a turnkey
offering you're getting some of the best
of breed open-source tools for basic you
know working with your code working with
your issues doing code reviews and the
like and if this is all seamlessly
hooked up into your project hosting and
then the key thing is that you'll see at
the end into your deployment destination
so the components that you'll see is it
will do a longer demo and walk you
through this the components that you'll
see here you know we just saw so this
Milan Hudson get Garrett and then this
turnkey offering automation and hosting
and framework on top of it with this
goal of getting you you know everything
that you need for enterprise-scale java
development with all the benefits that
that you want from lightweight open
source code hosting so this is the you
know the robustness of an empress filed
with beyond the lightweight toolset that
has evolved in open source the
scalability so you can host as many
projects as you want but it's our
transparency which has been the working
model in the success of those tools like
10 and track and mantis and JIRA all
captured in here and you know so that
your teams have that velocity of these
high efficiency tools but you can also
layer in as you'll see at the end you
know potentially you're on your own our
planning tools that you may have my own
premise with some of the integrations
that we're layering on top of this so
with that well we'll switch the lucas
doing a demo and we'll talk through some
of the features and just give you an
overview of the Oracle cloud developer
service cool okay so we're going to do a
demo partially of the web UI and then
we're going to look at the Eclipse to
lean as well to show off all the
automation and how to connect all these
services so the main way to access
developer cloud service is through this
website
so this is your main landing page once
you've logged in you can see all the
projects you have access to there are
various levels of access to each project
they can be private just to you and the
team members you've added or they can be
shared within your organization creating
a project is an extremely lightweight
affair you need a name an optional
description you choose this privacy
setting and you create the project so if
you've set up your own instances of
these projects before that this part at
least the first time it happens the
second time you'll take it for granted
the first you know time is kinda like
magic all of those servers and services
were just provision for you completely
transparent transparently you know a
Hudson instance where you can add your
build jobs initiative the source code
repositories with get and so on wiki and
such I'm all those things they can
gather mentioned so all of that is now
now exists for your project and it's
almost instant provisioning so I've just
created a new project and now I want to
add someone to my team so in the Oracle
cloud you've got your identity domain
for your organization once you've signed
up and I know that God errs in my domain
so I can just add him to my project and
I can set the role I want to give him so
he now has access to the project he's
got full access to do whatever he wants
with in the project so it's the same
identity domain like all the rest of the
cloud services in Oracle cloud are
connected to Lucas so that we can share
users and permissions and other details
between the cloud services absolutely
and that's another thing that's
interesting right if you've set up kit
it's got a completely different access
control model so all of that has been
layered in to these tools again it's
just completely turnkey for setting up
the project everything working and
identity being delegated to your oracle
identity I'm just going to switch to a
project that created yesterday that has
a little bit of activity
so once you've got a project setup every
project has its own homepage short
description of a project that you've
created stream with the latest activity
within the project and then pointers to
some of the associated services so that
if you're using some tools natively you
have the URLs readily here for you so
these are two git repositories within
this project second every project has
its own dashboard so you can see all the
builds that are configured for this
project if I'd done any commits recently
we would see a graph of commit history
and then history of tasks so small chart
showing how many open tasks closed tasks
and commits over time and again a longer
version of that activity stream so here
it looks like I created a task so let's
just go to that task so you get a
full-featured built in open source caste
system it's based on a bugzilla
compatible schema so if you've got any
data in that format it's easy to get in
here but it's an all new web UI build
with GWT so it's fast it's responsive
but it does all the things you'd expect
a bug tracker do so I can come in here
and say change my priority to hi pretty
important to edit tasks so we should get
that done and I can be
so you can very quickly change tasks or
you can even switch into faux edit mode
where you have access to all fields all
the time
so I'm going to ask Mike to implement
this one so you're delegating to make
yeah cool he's good at tests okay second
with a built-in wiki that's powered by
Milan wikitext so it's a multi wiki or
multi markup language wiki but from the
web UI it's just super simple it's just
a a title so markup and quick access
controls is you don't need too much more
than that here
so you edit with the mark language you
see it displayed immediately so source
control I've got to to git repository
set up for this project I can see their
names I can see the URLs I would use to
connect to them and I can see their
commits these two don't have any yet
because we haven't done anything we'll
get back to that later and then
provision for you as soon as you've
created a project is your own Hudson
instance so you have your own full build
server you can set up all your builds
however you want to set them up you can
schedule them to run nightly you can
have them pull your git repositories
they can pull external git repositories
you can build ADF jobs if that's what
you want to do you can have maven based
java build that's what you want to do
you can run ant tasks if that's what you
want to do this is a faux Hudson build
server when you prove it in a project
you get a couple of sample projects
sample build jobs that basically
demonstrate how you can set up with
different types of builds so let's
switch quickly to the Eclipse tooling
and we can look at accessing all this
functionality within eclipse
so if we start with the clean eclipse
with nothing in it in the Oracle
Enterprise pack for eclipse or Opie will
be included these tools where you get a
dashboard for the Oracle developer cloud
service and within this dashboard you
log in using same credentials you'd use
on the web to get to the web interface
and instantly you can see all the
projects you have access to you can see
those same three projects the one I just
created when I created yesterday that we
were looking at so even you know if
you've used my land before which helps
as much as I can automate your you know
the way that you bring in your good
projects your issue tracker is all those
tools within eclipse this is what Lucas
we've just done by signing in to eclipse
with his credentials it takes like
multiple hours usually to get your
workspace setup properly with this all
of this information is now at your
fingertips it's all hosted in the Oracle
developer cloud service you just sign in
and you know you now think of your IDE
torque looks like the EE as this rich
client for that cloud service so if I
haven't done anything yet probably the
first thing I want to do is connect my
task list and find my tasks so from this
dashboard there a number of wizards
built in that will help automate all of
these connections processes for you I'm
just going to use a predefined search I
just want to see all tasks in this
project so I look there's my two tasks
already so notice I didn't have to sign
in again I didn't put my credentials in
anywhere again all I had to do was you
know say what I was interested in so in
my Milan task list I already have these
two tasks I have two incomings and
I can just open them so I have a
full-featured Milan task editor
so I can see all the attributes of these
tasks you know this one's in the tools
products and maybe I actually want to
put that on a release so it gets
scheduled and because Mick is maybe
clinch to do this one split up the work
so that it's the same folks now you have
in the browser with feelings basically a
my language client it's all available to
you offline since primal cast is
everything offline and you know as
you'll see lately the architecture it's
actually both the browser and the quick
search client they're using the same
rest api's to talk to the to the service
over here so you just have two kinds of
clients one running in your browser one
in your Clips ID both hosted both with a
data hosted so next time I want to do is
share some code or imports and code from
the existing git repositories within
that project so when you create a
project you get one git repository
created for you for free it's just got
the same name as the project you can of
course add as many git repositories as
you need to support your project maybe
you want to break up your code into
multiple repositories you have major
components etc in this case I want to
clone a git repository and then I want
to share one of the projects that i have
in my workspace so this is just a quick
sample app so i can see here that I have
to get repositories for this project and
for each one of them I have access under
two different protocols so I can choose
how I want to set this up I'm going to
choose this one
so what this has done is has clones the
git repository onto my machine has
shared this project with vacuo
repository and now it's all set up I can
make a commit
so now maybe actually I'm going to take
this pass back cuz I want to work around
it later and let's just push this before
we do anything else and so the moment
this push happens you know what you
often see with these demos and let's
head up on an oniony hosted offering a
lot of that is just happening on your
browser this gives you you've got the
code in your ID today for the project
that you might want to try out pushing
to the to the Oracle developer cloud
service so this again all that codes in
your IDE with three or four clicks that
are basically you know going through
eager than the clips you've now got all
that code posted so I just pushed from
code I have a build server out there I
want my build server to build my code so
when you first create a project you get
those sample builds set up and if I
haven't set up right it will pick up the
code change i just made and push so what
i'm doing here is running through the
monitor builds wizard from the dashboard
it's filled out all my credentials
automatically for me all i have to do is
select the build jobs on the server that
I'm interested in and all of a sudden I
can see that I have a build server for
this project titled new projects and
then have these two builds and it's
updated their status for me in the IDE
oops
so this is the Eclipse Hudson
integration and so you can see all kinds
of things about your build server you
can see which builds have run recently
if the regime unit test run you can see
all the results here you can even pull
in the full console from the build run
directly into eclipse you need to
inspect it and you've got you first I
was basic tailored so you've got in the
web browser you've got lot more
functionality from monitoring bills
we've got parts of the Hudson Hudson web
UI integrated as week I showed you here
you've got all the ID specific
functionality so if you're living in
your your Eclipse IDE you've got and
later today we'll actually have a talk
when your house has a dysfunctional and
that means as well but the Milan mapping
start that will link at the end you've
got everything that you need to see as a
developer you know you just made the
build fail you'll get that pop-up
notification in your OS you can click
into the builds view see the whole
failure of unit tests and rather than
having them stuck in the browser and
copying and pasting test failures it's
just one click to bring all those
failures into your J unit viewing
eclipse and run them in eclipse is a
second clip so you're getting you know a
lot of the stuff that we're seeing
richer and richer experiences in the web
browser for development a lot of what we
do in terms of running and debugging
unit tests and writing code is still in
the IDE so we're just bridging these two
worlds through this again through the
through the web services being hosted in
the Oracle developer cloud service and
Nick I got chartered with all this by
just downloading the IDE and getting
started on it and signed up on the
developer cloud says I didn't install
anything else locally source code is in
the cloud Hudson is in the cloud bugs
bug system isn't everything exactly yeah
so if you ran pick up any project it's
just all there and again this easy path
from taking the source of that you have
and and pushing it to the cloud so for
every project as well so I've just
clicked on you project dashboard for
every project within eclipse you get an
eclipse space project dashboard as well
you can see it's similar to the web
dashboard you can see all the builds
similar graphs and activity stream so
you can see some of my activity here
you know today I committed and look the
sample maven build brand we should just
be able to click on that even okay so it
looks like it succeeded and actually
built a war that's good so what's
happened here is Hudson was set up to
pull so we can just look at the config
even Hudson was set up to pull that git
repository on the master branch every
minute and then just run a maven build
so this view for you would update by
default every few minutes you can set
its whatever you want if you hadn't
flipped back to the web you would just
get this coaster notification that says
hey your build succeeded at that point
you know you can do do whatever you want
maybe you want to deploy maybe you want
to make another change so let's try
making another change first
so I actually want to work on this task
that I assigns myself so let's just call
it assigns so other team members know
not to work on it then I'm going to
activate it so activating the task
instantly focuses your workspace and
lets you filter any view that you want
to filter down just to the current
context of the task you're working on
and this is all part of the milan
framework so i'm going to change
anything really it doesn't have to be
substantial so once I've got one or two
files open I can filter my package
Explorer I'm only looking at what I'm
interested in I don't need to have any
other overload we'll just make a trivial
change so once I'm happy with my work I
can go and commit and now because I have
this task active I basically get a free
commit message Milan Andy get coordinate
together and they look at the current
task that you have active and the change
that you're working on and it fills out
the commit message and you can set these
up based on any template you want so the
template i'm using says you know put the
task and it's identifier in and then the
summary of the CAF and then a pointer to
the fast URL so i'm happy with that so
i'll just use that there's some of that
original island functionality but what's
interesting here in terms of this
linking that my own does between tools
what cinching nails that works forget so
disability blank tasks and commit
messages but and what's really cool is
the way that you'll see in the web UI on
developer cloud service the way it's the
way to exploit the fact that everything
gets linked in your activity students
for example all the commits and source
code and activities automatically linked
because we're able to extract that
additional activity in the IDE from the
developers activity just from Lucas
activists has to get a context
let's go see what I've been doing I
guess so in this activity stream I can
see that I committed something and
here's the message and I had set this
task to assigned ok so let's go look at
the task again so here I can see is it's
moved to assigned it's not very
interesting but I can also see the
commit i just made so because these are
all hosted together all the project
services know about each other as soon
as i push my commit with the right
message i can now have full traceability
from that task to all the commits that
implement changes for that task and i
can look at the full commit on the web
as well so some people like you know
prefer to use get on the web and look at
diffs this way maybe if they just want
to look at something quick other people
prefer to use the full you get tooling
you know where they can look at the full
history any get or something like that
so I'm done my task I'm going to resolve
that is fixed submit it
and I think I push source code so i
should have another build running some
point let's go look on the web yeah so
because my job is set up to pull for
changes to my repositories it just kicks
off a build whenever something that
happens so this is pending we have to
wait for well we don't have to wait long
it's running now and you know the same
way your CI de just always a modern
either you just always run your bills
and compiling your system for you your
build plans are now running
automatically using what's a very large
infrastructure for those bills so we'll
talk about later how the Hudson Beltran
works here but you're basically getting
resources from the Oracle developer
cloud service for running these
essentially very very large bills all
hosted and all you know all via Hudson
and the limitations that we kind of seen
the IDE start to go away when you've got
access to those kind of resources for
your projects so while it is building up
so if I am just starting on a new
project I can sign up for the developer
cloud service all this system is set up
for me and I can get started right away
if I am already using existing tooling
and I have a source control that i am
using maybe from github maybe from
somewhere else i can migrate them into
work across if it's github I don't need
to move it if it's if I'm using a bug
system like bugzilla I can migrate them
into the cloud-based issue repository if
i am using Vicky we support multiple
Vicky format so i can just migrate them
into the cloud and then continue to use
all the functionality of the developer
cloud hoods but either way like you said
the powerful systems are available to
build and all that stuff and it scales
up just because it's in oracle cloud so
if you if you if if the project you're
working on catches fire and you now need
to have more developers work on it you
can just scale up using the elasticity
of the Oracle cloud exactly it's all you
know it's again back to that best of
both worlds right access to all that
infrastructure and then none of that
annoying manual configuration that you
have to do at the moment Luke has pushed
the change the bill just picks up so
once you've got this kind of interest
once it's all integrated so it's not you
know not saying at five servers it's one
turkey set up with all the services you
need for your project this automation
it's been possible for this automation
that you're seeing here to be layered in
where again you know our whole goal of
you're not doing all that manual busy
work is gone while you're still getting
to use these tools they they're so
popular now so so we'll switch over and
talk a little bit about the architecture
and when we should leave some time for
questions after as well and then do one
more the one more demo at the end of you
know basically closing the loop and go
into that deployment destination but
quickly what you're seeing here is that
there's a copepod hub there's notion of
team identity that's pluggable these are
those open source components and
everything you see here with the Oracle
developer cloud service it's build on
some these open source components some
wig you don't you see piercing Hudson
again Milan get and Garrett and so on
with all this value added on top as I
mentioned the connectivity you've got
three modes of connectivity to it so
you've got the eye and the cool thing is
they go through the same abstractions
after the same task abstractions to the
same same change abstractions so when
Lucas showed you the activity history
that's a unified activity history over
everything that's going on in the
underlying services and we'll talk later
how you can actually extend that you
know say bring in other other
application lifecycle management tools
you get your getting a bunch of
entropically on the box as if you can
gather mention you've got you can
actually even bring use github
repositories out of the box since github
has been so popular as a hosting
destination so you can paste and
confluence syntax into the wiki system
it actually understands confluence
because what Mylan's done is its created
all these abstractions that work for
multiple ALM tools because there's such
a wide variety of those yeah the key
thing is here you've got a common API if
you've got wrecked asses from the ib IDE
basically this very similar access
through the browser through google web
toolkit and of course the native clients
and it's all transparent the fact that
there's a you know this this huge farm
running your servers that all of the
public cloud infrastructure running it
it's still very much transparent to your
native client which thinks it's talking
to a gift server even though you know
you've got high availability behind the
scene
and the kinds of things that are just
very difficult to set up with your own
good instances if you've tried that all
those services that you saw and then
we'll get back to deployment in can
Gannon is Lucas tasks and wiki services
so um must be coo don't just a little
bit sure interesting architecture there
so we use two major types of
architecture to handle load so the first
one is just a very traditional web
application stateless web application
where you can scale horizontally so Nick
was talking about the hub all traffic is
authorized in a fennec ated and proxied
through the hub and then is passed to
one of the underlying services so in
this diagram this demonstrates the
architecture of the task service the
traffic is passed from the hub to a load
balancer this could be a virtual IP and
then depending on the amount of traffic
in the build or in the instance you can
scale the number of faster if you have
and those all talk to a shared database
for persistence so that's multi-tenant
all the data for the task service is in
the same database but the data for each
project is in stone schema so it's fully
separated from each project the second
major approach is to end this is used
for get services and maven services is
to again proxy at the hub but then pass
the data to a specific gift server
associated to that project we do this
for a few services because there's a
heavy disk i/o to actually support
service so get is a traditionally
serialized down to disk and so in this
case there's affinity between a specific
project and a specific hit server so you
see that here in this diagram
and it's a enterprise-grade particle
database sitting underneath the covers
for all the database access required for
the developer cloud service strictly on
that answer Lucas yep so to implement
this we actually created an interesting
multi-tenancy framework when you're
dealing with multi tendency in an
application there's two common problems
you have to deal with one is how to
identify the tenant and then to what to
do once you know the who the tenant is
so first you know when I'm processing a
web request I want to set up some
context for the tendency who the tenant
is and then you know some information
about them just like you would with a
user context for a session so this
framework supports initially two
strategies for identifying tenants first
of the fragment in the URL another
common strategy that we support is
adding a custom HTTP header to the
request and this is extensible so you
could have many strategies for
identifying your talents second you want
to figure out how to isolate tenants
from each other within your data a
common approach is to use a single
schema with data for many tenants in it
and for that you might use a column and
a tenant data key in the method we're
using which I described earlier we
actually have a different schema for
every tenant and so that's the second
approach where we use what we call it
data switching data source so a request
comes in and it reaches the task app
server and we actually switch schemas
dynamically and then run all of our code
which is rindge written entirely in a
single tenant it fashion so you write
your code and your services in a way
where as a developer and a testing team
you only have to think about logic for
single pennant and we abstract away the
tendency to the cross processing layer
the neat thing is I think some of the
technologies that you saw at this
conference and discuss that open world
is that it's now going to be much easier
for you to port your existing
applications without worrying about most
of the stuff multi-tenant existing Java
applications is a total pain we've as a
you know in terms of providing source
scalable services we've had to do it in
a few different places and what we've
done previously is and we actually
learned the pain of what it takes to
multi put in these things this way as
well so if you can't avoid to do it but
just as with Milan we've open source are
common glue components with that stuff
works on is the glue that wires together
various ALM servers and collaboration
services and so on we've open sourced
those in Milan other common models well
what we've open starts tears on the
server-side infrastructure components on
the server side blue needed to to put
together these ALM various a line
services connect them to various vendors
ALM tools our partners am tools so this
is code cloud dollar project with some
this infrastructure is now open source
and that includes on the fantasy framers
as well little bit on the Hudson build
poke is again with all these things they
have very different strategies for
providing the sort of scalability and
available that you need and leveraging
the resources of the Oracle cloud in an
efficient manner so you saw when I
pushed code at built you know within 30
seconds a build was started and that's
because there's actually a pool of build
executor behind the scenes this pool is
shared across all projects and when you
need when your project needs an executor
it just grabs one from the pool so
what's cool about this is you can have a
dynamically size cool and the developer
cloud service will have it to
dynamically sized pool of executives the
scales up and down as as demand waxes
and wanes if again right now you
probably mantis manually or someone else
in your organization is an adding and
removing server and so on the economics
work much better if you've got this
shared across many servers and across
many projects and across many
organizations in the end
so what's cool about that is you know if
you were running this yourself you could
sighs it your budget or hardware if
you're going to use the hosted developer
cloud service they were about sizing it
to their budget and hardware and the
goal for you is that you just have no
wait times you asked for build executor
you gotta build executor you run your
build yeah and this you know it's just
very key thing that's happening this
transformation is that we give in turns
the big picture we need to move to a
world where we're wearing less about
wiring together the stacks that drive
our application development the ALM
tools and actually just building the
apps and and this is exactly some of the
core concepts that we've abstract away
here that you know that can be run on
this highly efficient cloud
infrastructure so just quickly the
architecture when you're hudson master
which is what coordinates all your
builds and does the polling of your git
repository and shows you the web UI when
it detects that it needs to run a build
it asks the hub for a new build slave
the hub then looks the slave pool and
says hey do I have any you know maybe I
need to wait but if I don't I should
provision a new one and then it
authorizes a slave for the master that
mastered then gets a lease for build
slave and then the hub tells the master
about it and then the master goes and
runs the build on that slave when the
build is finished master gives the slave
back turns over its lease and the hub
then cleans the slave and puts it back
in the pool is an available build
executor so grapple with the components
that you seeing here you've got these
open source pieces they're extensible
there's an extensive layer on top of it
you can use my lens SDKs you can use
rest api's and the other services like
single sign-on pass top is providing
regice to other ALM tools because you've
probably got other LM tools within your
organization you know you might be using
quality center protesting if you've got
large a large-scale Java shop you might
be using IBM rational team concert to
orchestrate across all of that but you
want some of these you know services and
deployment capabilities you're about to
see so the past I've central grid is for
that if you adapt is for open
called such as low slc which will
actually talking about tomorrow as well
and in session tomorrow afternoon how
you can extend this how this can be
integrated with other efforts like the
oracle team productivity center and so
on so the key thing here is that this is
designed to fit into your alm ecosystem
now not as an afterthought and there are
rest api is for example that you can
start using to to query co2 cloud as
well similar to the way they made of
clients do but right now let's skip over
to the best part which is actually
connecting this to the running
application so all right so i have my
distributor development team they
started using the developer cloud
service and they built this let's say
hawaii app or a nearly app app or a
warlike luca showed earlier now i want
to run it in the cloud what do i need to
do do i need to manually upload it into
the Java cloud service and deploy it is
or is there something seamless that I
can go the good news is absolutely this
one okay the good news is because the
developer cloud service and the Java
cloud service are both running an Oracle
cloud they are integrated with each
other there is this concept in Oracle
cloud called Association where if you
have multiple cloud services from Oracle
you can associate them with each other
so that they know about each other and
do a handshake and communicate and that
is what we are going to demonstrate now
where we're going to start a new
deployment so now the the scenario is
Lucas and twin can make all develop this
application there is a war being built
in the continuous integration build
system in Hudson in the club now all I
want to do is to deploy to the Java
cloud service now in the deployment
screen I already see that my target Java
service is selected because the Java
service and the developer service are
associated with each other I can either
choose to do a manual deployment or an
automatic continuous deployed if it's a
test system I probably want to choose a
automatic continuous deployment and if
we say production system at all you want
to do manual after it passes some tests
and I get the approvals
now I just give it a name did we turn on
my microphone I just give it a name and
say save and apply now the application
archive war in this case is getting
transmitted directly from the developer
cloud service to the Java cloud service
in the cloud directly without any
downloads and we got deployed into the
Java cloud service I can look at the log
here I can go to the Java cloud service
enterprise manager you I to look at to
convince myself that the application is
that indeed deployed I do see that the
customer orders application is indeed
applied so it's as simple as that in
terms of either a manual individual
deployment are a continuous deployment
to integrate the two pieces we have in
the cloud the development environment
with the developer service and the
runtime environment with the with the
Java cloud service now the developer
cloud service is in preview right now
and so if any of you are interested in
participating in the preview please meet
us after the talk or you can come to the
Oracle cloud developer service demo both
all oracle cloud demo booths are in
moscone north upper lobby and there is a
booth for the developer cloud service
where you can see more details and sign
up for the premium
alright great so just quickly to wrap up
again out of the box pass stop saying
which is the alm interoperability that
leading a lemon tree pub
interoperability tool with support for
all these various tools which you might
already be doing supports the Oracle
developer cloud service you're using a
different issue tracker you're using one
of those enterprise alm tools those can
be connected in real time to the Oracle
developer cloud service out of the box
so again a key thing and the you know
the main thing that we want to emphasize
here is that you're getting all the
turnkey benefits of the lightning quick
tools all the benefits of the Oracle
cloud in this in this package where all
the details all the hosting on the
provisioning on the connectivity our
place you know are taking care for you
and the integration is there so you can
start using it from day one whether it's
to take an existing project push it
straight into this take your github
projects or integrated with one of these
tools say if you want to add add the
planning as a layer over top of what
you've got the activity that you've got
happening here you pick one of those
adults tools and get this point of
basically this continuous deployment
where you know going from your IDE to
your deployment destination is totally
automated and the tools and the steps on
the way are you know just a normal part
of your process whether you're in the
IDE you're working in the web browser so
for more we've got links over here so
the jdeveloper ADF community you've got
links right there we've got um the few
more talks left so there's going to be a
talk on Milan NetBeans you'll see some
of these concepts that Lucas showed in
the IDE how they're now materializing in
the netbeans ide and then there's a talk
tomorrow on linking the application
lifecycle so come with a bigger picture
talk on how we can cannot connect up
these things to the application life
cycle through open standards like like
this oslc so that we can get
traceability in the whole across these
various tools and that's tomorrow at
four thirty p.m. so that i think will
wrap up and have some time for questions
thank you any questions yeah
absolutely I'll take that so there are
Java is the one that resonates more and
it's a simpler to visualize if it's Java
yeah but typically you're building a
Java EE app and it has database
dependencies so you can push it then
what happens is the Java service and the
database service will have association
between each other so that the database
is accessible as a data source from the
Java Java cloud service and you can push
both the schema into the database cloud
service and the application artifacts
into the Java cloud service there is
also you know you can you can build just
the database applications using chillin
like apex in in in Oracle and you could
just publish them into the database
cloud service so all possibilities all
of those permutations and combinations
possibilities that are possible through
association not between each other yeah
what is that not this an on-premise
version of this no but you can download
that so the code to cloud open source
components you can download and and
stand us up on premise but oh okay so
yeah so in other article of open-world
sessions about the cloud we will talk
about private cloud offerings from
Oracle and the private cloud offerings
from Oracle will include the developer
cloud service as part of that so I think
the point there is private clouds are
the same as Oracle cloud that run in an
environment outside of our data center
that is in your data center right so
everything else remained the same
question over there
you
she won't take that yeah absolutely so
there's a couple options you can go to
your Hudson builds and you can download
the sale or artifact or ear or whatever
you've built and then manually deploy
that or you can set up a job within your
Hudson instance and some automation to
push that artifact out with your server
or even the inverse where you you use
the rest api's that are available from
the developer cloud service and
programmatically maybe through a
deployment job running on some other
server pull down that artifact and then
play it so you can use use many many
pieces of this service independently or
together and pick and choose which ones
you want to use oh you can run the
application in article club and yeah and
if you use them in a family again you're
getting you know you're then managing
those aspects on your own because the
beauty of that automation is it can be
done when it's also hosted within the
reach of that of the cloud destination
yeah
always
yeah so we we have integrations with all
three IDs the jdeveloper Eclipse and
netbeans the jdeveloper integration
would be available in the 11 1 16
version which is our general operation
that works with oracle public cloud
right the same version that works with
the Java cloud service in the database
cloud service will also work with the
developer cloud service and netbeans
will have the next release of NetBeans
that kind of goes with the developer
cloud GA is the one that will support
the functionality
am I on okay so I'll take them in the
reverse order in terms of migration just
like we talked about how you can migrate
from another location to Oracle
developer cloud service earlier we can
they were talking about it it's similar
so you can take you can download the
source code and you can move it you can
download the bug system from the from
the schema so basically all the all of
the Oracle cloud options all of the
Oracle cloud services not just the
developer cloud service have self
service control through which you also
have an archive and download mechanisms
and those will be available here as well
and hence if you heard Larry Ellison the
other day Thomas Korean this morning
they talk about standards-based and open
and no lock-in as the key facets of our
platform and service offerings of which
the developer cloud service is part of
and to the first question we still
working on the final pricing as I said
you know we are in preview right now and
by the time we go ga we'll figure out
the pricing scheme for preview obviously
it's a it's my imitation and we're
working with a few customers and and we
still have a few slots that we can fit
if it's someone n if you are interested
and of course preview is free back there
so if you're running tools that are can
be uploaded as artifacts or found as
maven artifacts or something like that
that's sort of quick and easy and
totally possible so you have a full
Hudson build server you can run a number
of plugins on that build server as well
the only real limitation is that it's
from a set of plugins that's been
adapted to work in this environment so
out of the gate obviously there won't be
support for every hudson plugin that
exists but the premise is that over time
and based on demands each of the popular
plugins would be supported so maybe
there's a Hudson selenium integration
plugin that you want to use yep oh and
by the way you can come to the booth so
you already pointing people at the booth
in moscone we've also put some more
demos at the pass stop booth on the
flora Java one here with 5428 or
something like that oh aight yeah but go
ahead we still have a couple more
minutes
yeah I said it's an instant question I
think it will be a distance a feedback
loop get-get what's selected
intentionally because so many of the new
protiv companies are leapfrogging
subversion and their move or announcer
at the limit of of what subversion could
offer them so it's definitely possible
to integrate subversion into these
services uh and i think it'll just be a
matter of time like just the the speed
of the move to get just like that's you
know the speed of the migration away
from I you know onto onto Hudson on to
the more modern build system from cruise
control was just so fast that's that's
kind of been a it's we've not worked on
it yet um another you you card most of
it currently it is the source control
repository there's nothing preventing us
from adding other options going forward
but there are no concrete clamps to do
that between preview and she erred this
point oh yeah I mean you've got
developers all over the place working
and get and checking into other sdms
right also there is get in itself has a
variety of problems that have to do with
its complexity right how how challenging
it is to set up and that's pretty
important a bunch of us has been
addressed in in the automation that's
been provided here right the sign on the
access control access controls of pain
and good and people set up Garrett and
it's again it's a manual mess those some
of those keep adoption challenges of get
um have been addressed by the Oracle
developer cloud service so again you
know I think you can try it out and I
guess check into subversion if you need
to all right thank you everyone oh yeah
go ahead Steve
the api's are in code the cloud so that
opens the rest api they are the plugins
for the ssl but the identity is coming
as from from the Oracle services so it
doesn't you know that the third
large-scale identity systems not in it
so you could plug into any you're SSO
system basically maybe you want to just
plug into LDAP or you know some other
SSO system you have in-house all right
thank you yeah but by the booths or
stick around for more questions and
answers Thanks thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
