hello everybody in this video we will
see how a self-service user can request
new sawai instance from self-service
portal here is enterprise manager 12c
login page I will login as self service
user
this is landing page for middleware
self-service portal in the services
section we see number of instances owned
by this user in notifications region we
see notifications for instances due to
expire under usage section we see number
of illogic servers and memory consumed
by this user the number on the
right-hand side of the bar chart
indicate maximum cota available for the
user on the right-hand side we see
active instances under services region
to request a new sofa instance click on
request new service button this opens up
a pop-up with Service Catalog this list
service templates available to this user
choose the right service template and
click on select this open up a page to
request new sawa instance give suitable
name to the service and description if
you want to add select zone where you
want to create this instance in schedule
section you can control when you want to
start execution of this request by
specifying start date you can also
control how you want to keep this
instance by specifying ended after this
particular date instance will be deleted
by enterprise manager job automatically
once done click on next
on next screen you can select database
instance where you want to create so are
dehydration store then specify schema
password optionally if you are using so
our token that can be added here as well
if you want to start managed server with
custom startup arguments you can mention
those in this film then specify weblogic
username and weblogic password
once done click on next on next screen
you can review the information and
submit the request since I already have
an instance created we can explore the
existing instance to explore the
instance and to open instance homepage
click on instance name
here we see details about usage response
time and load activations open JDBC
connections etc the interesting part is
middleware service instance mail you
where we can change the end date start
or stop the instance add new matrix for
monitoring and from this menu we can
also open weblogic server admin console
and fusion middleware control so let's
click on weblogic server admin console
and explore this takes us to the
weblogic server admin console as we see
here all components required for fully
functional sawa instance are created you
can find details about servers and then
clusters then we also see the
deployments for all the components of so
our including be to be a BPM and then
papel all the adapters all all the
components are divs deployed on this
instance to make it it's fully
functional so our instance we also see
the JMS servers configured for various
components to work together similarly
JMS modules can also be seen here now
let's go back to the instance homepage
and explore Fusion Middleware control
once on fusion middleware control we see
the so our infrastructure under so I
infrastructure a menu we see so our
deployments menu wherein we can deploy
and deploy or redeploy applications
under service engines menu we can go to
a specific service engine homepage and
explore existing instances running on
the service engine so the service engine
can be repelled by pmn mediator human
workflow or business rules on bindings
menu we can create bindings for b2b
under so I administration menu we can
set various properties for service
engines like bapple and mediator we can
also set up a b2b server properties and
