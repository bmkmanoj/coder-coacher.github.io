the logical domain by using the create
profile wizard in this example I'll
create a guest domain provide a profile
name choose to create a deployment plan
and select guest domain as the sub type
enter a name for the guest and a
starting number to be appended to the
end of the name for the configuration
change the number of CPU threads to 16
and leave the rest of the default
settings as they are select an as
storage library for the guest domains
metadata in a SAN storage library for
its operating system these libraries
were created earlier specifically for
this purpose you'll select a LUN later
when you apply the plan select a network
for the guest domain review the summary
and finish the profile and plan are
listed in the plan management pane
create an OS provisioning profile for
the guest domain in the create profile
OS provisioning wizard start by
providing a profile name and description
be sure to select logical domain for the
subtype and virtual machine for the
target type very important make sure to
select Oracle Solaris 11.1 spark for the
operating system image also very
important and SRU 10.50 for the image
version also select solaris mall server
for the software group for the operating
system setup select your language and
timezone specify vt100 for the terminal
type enter a password and you can leave
the other settings as is specify an opt
center administrator account to be
created on the operating system this
example doesn't use I scuzzy disks so
I'll skip this panel set the swap file
system size to 8,192 megabytes this
example doesn't use name services so
I'll skip this panel to review the
summary and create the profile next you
need to create an OS configuration
profile for the guest domain in the
create profile OS configuration wizard
start by providing a profile name and
description make sure that you select
logical domain for the subtype and
virtual machine for the target type
automatically manage the guest with op
center and deploy an agent controller
also make sure that enable multiplex
Daioh is selected on the specify
networking panel leave none selected and
to keep things simple use one network
interface review the summary and create
the profile
create a plan that you can use to
provision and configure the guest
domains operating system for the plan
select the OS provisioning and OS
configuration profiles that you just
created make sure that the number of
results and assigned targets match these
values and save the plan now put all the
profiles and plans together into one
final plan by using the configure and
install logical domains option select
the plan that creates a guest domain and
the plan that provisions and configures
an operating system onto a guest domain
make sure that the number of guests to
create number of results and number of
assigned targets match these values and
save the plan in the assets pane select
your virtualization server and perform a
create logical domains action in the
first panel select and apply your final
plan you can leave the apply with
minimal interaction options selected as
you work through this wizard you don't
need to change very much you can leave
the name as is select a line in the sand
storage library retain the network
connection settings and network resource
assignments make sure the create logical
domain summary looks good and continue
in the wizard
retain the network for the boot
interface and specify an IP address and
a host name for the guest domain review
the provisioning summary and continue
now from this point on you don't need to
change anything just review each panel
and then schedule the job to run now
if you want in the jobs pane you can
open the guest creation job and watch
its progress okay fast-forward 75
minutes and the job is finished keep in
mind that the timing might vary for your
system you can see that the guest domain
and its operating system are listed in
the assets pane if you select the guest
domain you can view its v-net and IP
address on the network tab listed on the
port connectivity tab are the alternate
MAC addresses which OP Center will use
for non global zones within the guest
domain on the storage tab you can view
the LUN that stores the guests operating
system if you select the operating
system for the guest domain on the
dashboard tab you can view things like
the operating systems IP address whether
it's running its type and whether it's
agent managed on the virtual disks tab
for the virtualization server you can
identify the virtual disk that belongs
to the guest domain that concludes this
