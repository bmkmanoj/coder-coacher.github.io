business processes and collaborates with
other users for example create a
workflow to evaluate a project proposal
or review a budget plan there are three
steps to developing a workflow in Prime
first create a workflow designed to
visually map out the process next create
forms to collect data and finally assign
forms and users to the steps in the
workflow users are referred to as
performers when they are part of the
workflow so let's get started and create
a workflow design the workflow design
page displays all of your designs the
workflow editor is the canvas upon which
designs are created the workflow toolbar
contains the task and decision steps
used in a design simply drag and drop an
object onto the canvas and reposition as
desired in this example we are going to
design a workflow for approving or
rejecting project proposals and the
first step will be to collect proposal
information and enter it into a form so
let's go back to our design in progress
and name the step include a description
and then create a task in this case the
task is to complete a form with basic
information about the proposed project
then we will draw a connector line next
we have to determine if we can approve
the proposal an automatic decision step
automatically determines the direction
that the workflow progresses and makes a
decision based on information it
receives from the previous step in this
case a performer will determine the risk
level of the proposed project using the
Associated form in this step when the
form is submitted
the automatic decision step determines
if the proposal can be approved or
if more information is required before
approving or rejecting the proposal now
we will create the automatic decision
and the steps that follow and draw the
connector lines we will then rename the
connector lines in the exit options
table of the automatic decision step to
indicate what each path represents let's
save our work thus far and take another
look at our completed workflow example
to see what comes next when we take a
look at this step we see that a form has
been included to capture additional
proposal information when a performer
completes the form and submits it a
decision must be made whether to approve
or reject the proposal a manual decision
step is used when a performer is
required to make a decision so let's go
back and add the form and decision to
our workflow first we will add our form
here
then add the decision step okay we are
almost finished
as mentioned before a performer will be
asked to either approve or reject the
proposal any manual decision step if
approved the workflow will continue to
the approved proposal step if rejected
the workflow will be routed to this step
when we take a look at either the
approve or reject steps we will notice
that there are two tasks associated with
each both steps contain a form that will
be used to present information related
as to why the proposal is approved or
rejected as well as a task that will be
used to update the proposals status and
Prime first let's create the reject
proposal step and then our connector
lines then we select the manual decision
step to enter its name description label
the connections and provide instruction
for the performer here is a sample of
what the performer will see when
prompted to make a decision note that
the system includes the instructions and
creates radio buttons that correspond to
each of the connector lines alright just
a few more things to do to complete our
design when a decision is made here we
want to send the project stakeholders a
notification regarding the status and
update the project status field in the
system to show that the project is
either planned or rejected to achieve
this we need to create two tasks in each
of these last two steps
let's start in the approved proposal
step we will create a form for the
notification then create an update field
task that will change the status of the
project in the system to either planned
or rejected now we will do the same in
the reject proposal step saving your
work will save it as a draft in the
system validate the workflow to
determine if there are any potential
errors
publish the word flow when you are ready
to make it available for use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
