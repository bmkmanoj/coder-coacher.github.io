cloud control 12c demo series focusing
on the best practice of Oracle
e-business application measurement this
screen watch is for compliance
management for Oracle bi application the
purpose of this screen watch is to
highlight the out-of-the-box
capabilities and benefits of en call
control 12c for compliance management
and administration for Oracle bi
applications compliance management is
one of the key tool in the proactive
management of VI applications it
provides the ability to evaluate the
compliance of targets and systems as
they related to business best practices
for configuration security and storage
this work can be achieved by defining
customizing amazing compliance
frameworks compliance standards and
compliance standard rules in addition
compliance management provides the
guideline on how to change the
configuration to bring your targets and
systems into compliance the use case of
discipline watch is to select a couple
of the recommended tuning parameters
from the Oracles tuning reference
whitepaper I will take a look at the
Curie results caching area one of the
main advantage of Kure caching is to
improve apparent query performance it
might be valuable to see the cache
during off-hours by running queries and
therefore create a server to cache their
result the number of cache entries and
disk size may be for the cache can be
configured so under the Oracle bi server
we can configure the parameter under nqs
convicted ini file for this demo I'll
create the compliance standard rule for
the mask cache entry sign and set it to
40 megabyte after we identify all the
parameters that we wanted to create the
compliance standard rule we need to
verify whether that primer exists in the
current configuration once we verify the
existence of the parameters will create
a compliance standard rule using
Enterprise major core control 12c once
the compliance nettle rule has been
created
we'll run the simple test tube
the rule in development stage it is
recommended for users to try out the
rule multiple times before go out to the
production environment
let's start create the compliance in the
rules using Enterprise major 12c once
you launch the Oracle Enterprise major
cloud module 12c go to your aplia
application target in this case I select
my PI server and click the drop down
menu from the BI server go to
configuration select the last lactate
here we are trying to verify the prime
minister we wanted to create the
complaints that the rule exists we know
those parameters are coming from the
entry in style configure ini file so
highlight those file and click the drop
down menu from the action select a
search under the search criteria select
the target time is Oracle bi server and
create the properties select
configuration files expand the
configuration files and select the data
source container attribute and value
click OK and my data source is coming
from the anchors conflicted config the
ini file and my attribute is max cache
entry size or type max cache entry and
click search in this return that I have
max cache entry size cache value 20
megabytes that under the NQ s convicted
ini file so through this step I verify
that my community primary exists in the
configuration file now I can move on to
current the compliance than the rule
after we verify all the parameter
disease in our current configuration
go to enterprise menu we select the
compliance and choose the library under
the compliance library click the
compliance standard rules
you can do the create line by selecting
the existing compliance than the rule
but in this case it will create a new
rule so click the Create button
select the repository rule from the more
information of that you want to
understand about the other road please
check the e/m admin guide click continue
first step is to provide a detail of the
role so I will name the role SPI
compliant role and for the state of this
complaints will be development after you
verify and tested this role you can roll
it to the production possibility you can
change you can choose minor warning
warning and critical in this scenario
I'll choose my own warning and select
the places where you want it to apply
this compliance for in my case this is
this parameter coming from the Oracle PI
server so from the drop down menu I will
select Oracle PI server you need to also
provide a description of the rule or
rationale and if there's any reference
to our you can associate in the detail
section once you've done all the detail
information go to next here you define
by the secret secret sources where you
want to specify the query where the
returned data that is need to be
verified against a simple or a sequel
condition click the moderate query
button and click the search button first
and stretchy buttons are returned with
the multiple PI server select the BI
server that you wanted to create the
compliance rule guess so in my case I'm
selecting the my PI server one and click
the property button expand the
configuration files or more time under
the configuration file select datasource
container attribute and value click OK
and click the search button again so
this returns a lot of value so here
based on the data that comes under the
table we can use it for defining our
search engine so for the data stores
we know that the parameter coming from
the NQ s convicted INF file so type NQ s
comfy that ini file we'll set the
attribute s max cache entry size and
click OK click search so they're all
returned my max cache entry size in all
of the PI server in my environment click
OK
so once they select the parameter it
will bring back to the define query page
here you see the secret search has been
populated with all the attributes and
the data that we suspected ending on
alias to a column allows the primer to
be used in the compliant and
non-compliant when surrounded by
percentile so here output is too dark
value as value instead the comply
message as compliance with default
profile check for non-compliance mess
I'll define as value percentile value
not meeting the compliance standard row
click next in the step of define
violation condition choose the
combination of columns that unique
identify the violation you must have at
least one non key value which is why
info added in the curie generator for
best practice leave it as unchecked so
select a value attribute container data
source as a key and you don't have to
have all of the key should be display so
I'll have on your value an attribute to
be display and the rest of them not
being displayed by the valuation
condition under the
on time violation condition will be
evaluated on each row of the Curie
specified in the previous step so if the
condition evaluates comes are true then
the valuation will be generated so in
our case we will select a simple
condition and select the value as a
column name and the comparison operator
is not equal to default value will be
set it also for a megabyte and click
Next so once we define all the violation
condition that we can run the test
against the target that we wanted to
create a standard row so select a
magnifying glass and select a target
that you want to run the against test so
select my bi server then click the run
the test button once the testable has
been completed you can check the result
so now here you will see the rule
violation has been January because my
our system has been set the value is a
20 mega byte which is violated our
default value is a 40 mega by now you
can go to next last step is to reviewing
the compliance standard rule that we
just created once you verify all the
parameters set correctly under the
standard rule then we can face the steps
this will conclude the demo of creating
the compliance rule for the BI
measurement server by using the
compliance management functionality in
Oracle Enterprise major cloud control
12c system administrator can operate the
VI environment more efficiently and also
control the environment more
systematically since we are enforcing
the system to comply the certain
parameters in this case some performance
and tuning parameters we can ensure the
system to be more reliable therefore
reduce the cost for operating the system
as a conclusion we highly recommend for
BI application admin server to utilize
the compliance management functionality
and the best practices for managing VI
application for reference we have used
the following white paper for tuning
recommendation it is also recommended
for user to read e/m and administrator
guide for more in-depth understanding
of compliance management features this
concludes our demo of creating
compliance standard rule in enterprise
media cloud control 12c
