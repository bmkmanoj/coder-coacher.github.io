testing suite a training series this
video recording covers oracle load
testing overview providing general
features how you can create load testing
scripts in open script and also to run a
load test session in oracle load testing
my name is utakata katsu i'm a group
product manager of the application
testing suite products today's agenda
covers the quick introduction of
application testing suite then also go
through some of the key features of open
script and oracle load testing open
script is a tool that you create your
load testing script and oracle load
testing is another tool that you do the
load test and after that we will see the
product demonstrations for both open
script and oraculo testing so we are the
application testing suite but what is
the application testing suite
application testing suite consists of
three separate by integrated products
the first product we have is oracle
functional testing which we usually call
this product open script open script
provides automated functional and
relational testing for web-based
applications this is also where you
create your load testing scripts so when
you are to do the load test the first
thing you need to do is to go to open
script and create a load testing script
the second product we have is the Oracle
load testing which provides automated
load in the performance testing so once
you create your load testing script you
can bring that script on to Oracle load
testing and run hundreds of thousands of
concurrent virtual users against the
application and reload an Oracle load
testing has a built-in server monitoring
capability we call this feature server
stats
server stats can monitor the backend
application structure during a load test
and collect performance metrics for
example you can monitor performance
counters from web server application
server database server and also from the
operating system such as Windows or
Linux that hosts these applications and
you can later use these data to identify
the bottleneck of your application
so finally we have our contest manager
that allows you to manage your test
cases and requirements and track the
defects that are found during the
testing and today's focus is open script
and oracle loaded so as mentioned when
you are to do the load test the first
thing you need to do is to go to open
script product and create your load
testing script open script provides
automated functional relation testing
for web solar-based and Oracle packaged
application the naming may be a little
bit confusing but Oracle functional
testing which is official name is also
called open script the reason is because
it is not just a functional testing tool
but this is also a loaded scripted
generator so either you are digital
functional testing or a load testing
this is the tool that you'll be working
to create your script open script
provides specific custom accelerators
which are basically the script templates
we have accelerators for local packaged
applications such as EBS and sweet
Siebel applications JD Edwards and
fusion ADF applications so when you are
to create a new script and if you are to
test one of these Oracle packaged
applications you can select an
application accelerator that provides
additional configuration to your script
on top of the general capability that
our Web script provides so basically
this is an option that essentially makes
your scripting life much easier because
it provides better script automation
that reduces your manual work time as a
result the UI capture is shown in the
right hand side of the screen open
script is a GUI application you can
create in the bug ear script using the
graphical user interface you do not need
to have a deep knowledge of the
scripting language to create most of
your scripts on the other hand to run
the line script language is pure Java so
if you're comfortable writing code
especially Java
you can flick the UI to show the code
base interface and write any Java code
your script an actually open script is
built on top of the Eclipse Foundation
so if you have expertise using clips you
can flip the entire UI now only the
script view bar enter UI into the
Eclipse IDE user interface and use any
debugging feature Eclipse IDE provides
to create and debug your load testing
script on the other hand most of these
advanced knowledge in Java or Eclipse is
not necessary in order to create the
most of your test scripts you can do
most of the configuration using the GUI
interface and this is especially true
for load testing scripts you can do most
of the working required for the load
testing script including correlations in
tree view with the graphical user
interface and this is more an option for
functional testing users who require to
develop a lot of reusable scripts open
script is apparently integrated with
oraculo testing you can take the load
testing script to the Oracle load
testing and simulate the load to run any
number of concurrent approaches users to
test application performance under load
open script is also integrated with
Oracle test manager our test management
tool so you can bring the functional
testing script to put them on the Oracle
test manager as a part of the test plan
and you can run the functional testing
script within the test plan manually or
you can also schedule to run that script
but this integration is an option only
for the functional testing script so if
we are only doing performance testing
then otn Oracle test manager may not be
your interest this diagram shows a list
of accelerators available in open script
for the current 12.1 release this as a
core module will be HTTP that works with
any web based applications we have
accelerators that work especially with
Oracle packaged applications such as
civil applications it is in suite and
forms applications
fusion ADF or JD Edwards
and they are built on top of the web
HDPE testing module so when you select
these acceleration modules open script
provides pre-configured api's and
correlation libraries that design
specific to work with a selected Oracle
packaged applications in addition to the
basic capabilities of the web HTTP
module provides please keep in mind
however open script supports any
web-based applications as long as the
runs in web browsers or deployed as a
soap based web services these
accelerators are just an additional
capability built on top of them here I
would like to introduce some of the load
testing automation concept the slide
shows how user communicate with his
application there are two diagrams in
the upper side in the lower side of the
screen the upper side says functional
testing and the lower side displays the
caption save load testing but they are
basically the same diagrams at least at
this point so when user access to his
application he will use his personal
computer and open the browser he will
use his keyboard and mouse to access his
applications web page by typing URL into
the address bar and will enter user name
or click button to log into the
application then the browser sends HTTP
requests over the Internet to
communicate with the web server in the
application web server then talks to the
application server application servers
talk to the database server to process
the user requests and at the upper right
corner here you see open script icon
asking where do I fit below open script
is an automated testing tool so it
should replace some of the manual
process somewhere but that will be
different between the functional and
load the answer is for the functional
testing script open script replace the
user actions and communicate with the
browser
so when you record a functional testing
script you will see a lot of Glee
commands that replace the user actions
such as click buttons or click link or
enter text set the password when you
play back the script these commands will
be sent to the browser and the browser
will do the rest of the work so the
functional testing is a GUI level
automation and for the load testing
script opens get to replace the browser
and communicate directly with the
application because load script does not
talk to the browser but speak to the
applications web server it requires a
different protocol that web server
understands which is HTTP so when you
take a look at a load script it has a
series of HTTP commands instead of
Glickman's
so while the functional testing
automates the transaction in a GUI level
load testing automates the transaction
HTTP protocol level this is a big
difference between the functional
testing script and load testing script
so compare the functional testing script
load testing script is lighter and
scalable apparently because it does not
need a carrier browser and what that
allows you to do is to bring the script
to the oracle load testing tool and run
any number of concurrent virtual users
while minimizing the number of test
machines that you need for the load test
so that was at the plane back this time
ram shows how open script captures the
HTTP traffic during the recording when
you start the recording open script
enables a proxy recorder and monitors
HTTP traffic between the browser and
application just like wire search or
fidelity then opens with transform that
captures the HTTP traffic to API common
and write commands down to the script we
will see this later in the product
demonstration
once you created a load testing script
and open script the next you want to do
is to run load test you can bring the
script to the Oracle load testing and
configure it as a portable load testing
scenario and also apply any desired
parameters and setting to run a load
test in your preference you can see the
screenshot in this slide Oracle load
testing is a web-based application and
the content will be shown within the
browser so you can access to the Oracle
load testing server from anywhere as
long as you have a browser access or
Colo testing provides a realistic load
testing what realistic here means is
that the transaction is based on the
browser navigation which you do during
recording so whatever you do in the
browser will be coming transaction and
that transaction is recorded into the
script and that is a script which is
going to be executed by the Oracle load
testing into the load session and it
allows you to scales up to thousands of
concurrent virtual users to simulate the
peak load conditions so basically what
you can do here is you can simulate the
situation that certain number of users
doing a certain type of transactions
that you will see in the production it
delivers an accurate load by performing
validations against the contents
returned from the server so this means
we are not just sending HTTP requests
but actually it's checking the contents
returned from the server to make sure
that the right page is coming back and
mentioned earlier the OLT
or Colo testing has built-in server
monitoring capability which we call
server stats so during a load test you
can monitor the performance metrics from
the backend application structures such
as web server application server /
database server or the operating system
the whole source applications so looking
at the report you could get an
understanding where the bottlenecks may
reside within the underlying
infrastructure under load
the session reports can be shown in the
HTML format or with the Flex based
graphical reports both for the real-time
and also the post runs this diagram
shows Oracle load testing architecture
when you perform a full installation of
application testing suite you will see
three major components installed in your
system they are a TS server ATS database
and ATS agent they are showing at the
left side of the screen they are
services and because of that in the
default setting whenever your machine is
up olt server is up and running and
standing by for you to start the Lotus
oil tea controller and oil tea server
stands they are actually the WebLogic
server these components from within the
WebLogic server when you start the load
test what happens is that loyalty
controller communicate with the agent
process you can run more than one agent
process and distribute across the
multiple agent systems in the agent
process lounges virtual users and the
virtual users execute the scripts and
that script includes the transactions
that you recorded by navigating through
the browser so this way you can run
realistic multiple concurrent users to
your application to simulate the peak
load condition in addition when your
server status monitors are enabled
server status module will communicate
with the data collector components data
collector is another process resides
within the agent framework and collect
performance metrics from the hardware
and software of the application under
load agent process then returns the
gathers information to the OLT
controller and oil till controller
stores and information into the Oracle
database we have Oracle
XE Express Edition database shipped with
application testing suite but you can
also use Oracle database 10g or 11g
enterprise or Standard Edition for the
production you
next let's see what we have learned in
the actual products so this is the open
script product I have two scripts open
one is the functional testing script and
another is a load testing script I
recorded the same application same
transaction for these scripts the
application I recorded is the metric
application that comes with the WebLogic
server the first script is the
functional testing script so all the
commands I see here are the Glickman's
set text press tab set password click
button these are the commands that
drives the applications through the
browser you are in functional testing
what we do at the playback is to emulate
the user or the user action open script
speaks to the browser and send these
Greek commands to the browser the
browser will take you to a list of the
work the second script we have here is
the load testing script in this script
what I have here is a series of HTTP
requests instead of a GUI commands so
although I recorded the same transaction
for the same application different
commands are recorded into the script
depends on the type of the script and
when you play back this load testing
script Blaser will now go into launch
this is because open script emulates a
browser in the load testing and
directory speak to the applications web
server so now I am back at the
functional testing script o playback the
script by pressing this play back button
in the toolbar and what happens the
first is that because functional testing
should requires a browser it will try to
launch the browser now the IE browser is
launched and it is going to do the exact
same transaction I did during the
recording now it is entering the email
and password in clicking submit button
and going to click the link
press the button and logo this was a
transaction I did during the recording
so driving through the browser is a good
way for doing the functional testing but
this is not apparently efficient way to
do a load testing because it requires a
browser for one virtual user and this is
not a scalable way for doing a load
testing because in order to run 100
virtual users you need 100 web browsers
so we have a different mechanism to do
the load testing so now I am back at the
load testing script and going to play
back the script what is going to happen
is that this script will not launch the
browser because we are sending HTTP
requests directly to the application in
load testing open script replace the
browser and that is why we need the HTTP
commands instead of glickman so that we
can speak to the applications web server
so compared to the functional testing
script load testing script is much
lighter and a more scalable script that
allows you to run multiple concurrent
approach users while minimizing number
of test systems that you need for the
load testing next let me show you how
open script requires the load testing
scripts as we have learned open script
captures the HTTP traffic by enabling
the proxy so I'm going to create a new
script by selecting this new icon in a
toolbar selecting web HTTP under load
testing click Next name my script click
finish and this is going to create a
brand new script for me so I can start
the recording by pressing this record
button but before that let's see what
proxy I have set in my LAN setting I'm
going to launch ie go into tools
internet options connections LAN setting
and this is the proxy I have this is a
corporate proxy I need
in order to access the my internal and
external resources going to close down
and go ahead and click the record button
this we are going to start recording at
this time open script proxy is already
enabled and running so let's go to the
internet option once again to verify the
connections round setting now I have
localhost 7777 this was done by the open
script and this is how we can capture
the HTTP traffic but say I still need a
cooperate proxy in order to access my
application that I want to record in
that case you can actually chain the
proxies I can go to open Skype reference
record HTTP and go to the second tab
proxy setting and check the chain proxy
and specify my corporate proxy here by
doing this you can record the
application that requires your corporate
proxy open script launched an IE browser
when I start the recording I can type
the URL of my application in address bar
or I can click one of the bookmark icon
in my toolbar to access my application
entering an email and password and click
Submit and as I navigate through the
browser the commands are written down to
the script so this is how I can record
the navigation from the browser I'm
going to stop the recording
however in fact open script is not just
monitoring the specific browser window
that is launched when you start
recording but enabling the proxy this
will capture all the HTTP traffic that
goes on within your machine for example
open script supports officially IE 9 and
Firefox version up to 6
with the current version of open script
photo 1 however when you are enabling
the proxy this will also capture the
navigation you perform in a non
supported browser let me show you how I
can record the navigation from the non
supported browser I removed all the
commands I recorded and save the script
and going to click the record button
once again this will launch the IE
browser however I'm not going to do
anything with this browser instead I'm
going to launch Google Chrome browser
I'm going to access to my application
that I want to record enter credentials
click Submit click profile and log out
so as you can see as I navigate through
the window commands are written down to
the script this script I recorded with
Google Chrome there is a chrome
information in the user agent here so
actually you can record any web
application in any web browser as far as
underline protocol is HTTP or HTTPS and
this also applies to the non web
application such as Windows application
open script can still capture
transaction as long as the underlying
protocol is HTTP however please keep in
mind this is the only option when the
recording mode is set to the HTTP mode
open script provides two steps of
recording mode web mode which is a
default mode and also the HTTP mode you
can configure this in open script
preference
in will mode the recording works only
for the supported browsers so the
capturing of the HTTP traffic from a non
supported browser or non web application
is only the option when your recording
mode is set to http the basic difference
between the live mode and HTTP mode is
down the web mode script in both browser
actions in addition to the HTTP commands
while the HTTP scripting only has the
HTTP commands so well more the scripts
are less complicated than that of HTTP
mode and could be easier to read on the
other hand web mode scripts may be
difficult to debug in case of the script
runs into trouble and may require more
resource when running in the low sister
the next thing I want to do is to bring
this script on to the Oracle load
testing and run multiple concurrent
virtual users but before doing so I want
to parameterize one of the data
I entered during the recording I used
volleyball comm as a username in order
to log into the application but when I'm
running the script from the Oracle load
testing I want to run with a different
user IDs I can do that by clicking the
subsidy voluble icon select add a new
data bank and select one of the data
file that I have data that I want to
parameterize click finish and now my
script is parameterized I'm going to run
the script but this time I'm going to
click this I to right button in the
toolbar and select the used data banks
and check this run no more than two
iterations just to verify the data
parameterization works I'm going to
click OK to start the playback
now my script start to play back and I
can see the first circulation I used
flit golf calm as the user ID in the
second iteration the script is using
Larry bball calm and I can also see that
in the details view which is returned
contents from the server so my script is
done I'm going to save my script and now
I'm ready to bring the script on to the
Oracle testing I'm going to open Oracle
load testing from the Start menu and
this will launch the browser because
Oracle load testing is a web-based
application because I have installed or
Colo testing into my own laptop the URL
is localhost if your Oracle load testing
is in the remote system then you need to
specify the machine name in the URL I'm
going to log into the application by
typing the password which I specified
during the installation
okay so this is how the Oracle load
testing looks like it has a series of
tubs but before going into the details
in Oracle load testing let me show you
the backend information how the Oracle
the testing works as I mentioned earlier
the Oracle load testing runs a service
so if you open up the services dialog
you'll find were called a TS server this
is oraculo testing if you open up and
you can actually see the executable
which is be a SVC so this is the
WebLogic server you can also find the
oracle ats agent and also the oracle
servers XE database now I'm back at
oracle o testing or IOT
as mentioned olt consists of series of
tabs the first tab here is the build
scenarios tab which allows you to
configure the scenario settings for your
load tests the scripts that are
available to use are shown in the tree
view if you do not see the script you
want to run then you may need to
configure the repository settings so
that the loading server can spot where
your scripts are located repository oil
T is nothing but the directory in the
file systems you can configure the
repository by tools options repository
you should see the default repository
already configured but if you have a
customized repository to store your open
script script then you also need to add
that location to the Oracle load testing
please note that you need to configure
the custom repository in both open
script and royalty they are not
automatically synchronized each other
okay
close them I'm going to select a script
I just recorded which is the load 17 and
adds the scenario I can add multiple
scripts to the scenario to make the
scenario more realistic but for this
demonstration I will just run a single
script
the numbers we use is the total number
of virtual users you are going to run
for this load test the default settings
comes with tempting use but I can
specify any number of leaves I want to
run as far as my resource allows me to
but I'll just go with the ten for this
demo system is where you run your agent
process for this script you can specify
to run your agent locally or remotely
loyalty server here is the local agent
it is the agent which is installed in
your auditing server machine but if you
configure your remote agent then that
agent name will show up here in the list
like this let me show you how I can
configure an agent go to manage system
for you agent systems and click new
specifying the blue agent information
entering the password
this is odds general password you
specified during the installation for
the agent royalty agent not the oil tea
controller and also please note that
agent in a controller has to be the same
version same build so if you have 12
1.02 65 for the oil tea server remote
agent has to be the same build 12.1.0
dot 2.65 if the bill numbers are
different then all these servers will
fail to connect to the agent when you
start a load test you can also specify
the delay setting iteration delay here
is that way between the script iteration
and the blue you pacing think time here
is to specify whether you use the
recorded thing time or not you can
select to use the think time or to run
without delay depend on what type of law
do you want to generate and generally
speaking recorded delay is more
realistic load and running with no delay
will have a heavy load to the
application under load and this is not
the end of the scenario settings
clicking this icon will open up the Edit
scenario details which allows you to
apply many other settings to your
scenario and one of them is the virtual
user logs in this settings additional
logging can be enabled if you want to
see the header information or server
contents which you are returning from
the virtual users running in your load
test this is a useful option when your
session is especially fading with errors
you can narrow down to a specifically
use specific navigation to identify the
cause of the fader on the other hand
extended logging may require large
storage space in the database so turning
this option on and off is on your
discretion in the default setting
extended logging is off also if we are
planning to run a large load test then
you may want to configure this maximum
JVM heap size to a specific number the
default style is 256 megabytes that is
sufficient for the relatively small
sized testing or demo or evaluation but
if you were to run a production load
test say more than 1,000 virtual users
with a complex scenario that most likely
you need to increase the JVM size to
upload a session being terminated by
running out of the memory and if you
scroll down there are many settings that
you also see in open script those seems
to do duplicated settings however please
keep in mind these settings are not
synchronized with your open script
settings so if you want to run the
script in the same runtime settings you
have an open script that you need to
upload the same setting in TS file close
that
and here you can configure the data bank
control I will select user data bank for
this script and I can also configure how
the blue users are going to use the data
in more details in to click OK and now
I'm going to submit the scenario to the
autopilot autopilot tab allows you to
configure runtime settings you can
specify to start or stop the test
immediately or scheduled to stop or stop
or after certain iterations you can also
control how you can ramp up the speed of
your virtual users in the autopilot tab
you can also configure your server stats
configuration to monitor your back in
the infrastructure of your application
while you're running your load test so
if you have already configure your
server stats then the configuration name
will show up here in the pull down menu
but I'm now going to use that we're
going to create a new configuration go
to the server stand configuration and
this will open up the dialog I'm going
to create a new configuration my name a
configuration my config three save and
click new from the monitors and I'm
going to metric profiles which is a set
of the predefined metrics and going to
select Oracle database because I want to
monitor the Oracle database server
from my application next and here I'll
need to enter the access information to
my database but I already have
pre-configured my credentials so I'm
just going to cancel that and leave as
it is already configured and go to the
next and these are the counters I'm
going to monitor I'm going to select
this test button just to make sure I can
get the values
okay looks like I can get the value so I
will close this dialog and click finish
to have these contrast configuration
okay so next I would like to add windows
counters I can do that by selecting the
data source person and click Next and
again I need to enter the credentials
for my accessing to my Windows Server
but since I already have my credentials
already entered so I'm going to leave
the app and click Next
and to get the windows counters we're
actually running the windows perform in
the background so you need to make sure
you can get the counter values using the
windows personal from your local windows
system where your data collectors
installed otherwise the server stats
personal manager will not able to get
the counter from your monitor system as
well here I'm going to select processor
information total user time click Add
and also memory information go to the
bytes again finish okay so my windows
counters are added to my existing
database countries and lastly I want to
monitor the Linux systems go to the new
against metric up files system lineups
next
I'll need to add the credential to
access my Linux systems so you have to
click new actually add
and you see a command prompt you have to
enter and you may not know what that is
and the easy way for doing is to open up
the booty and see what command prompt it
returns in the command line
it's a dollar sign here so change tab to
the latter sign
and say okay
select next and discover
discovery done click OK and click Next
these are the counter of going to
monitor for this rhinock system you're
going to click test just to make sure
that I can get the value out ok so I'm
getting the value some close this and
click finish the monitor the linacs
agent works unix of sorry systems that
we are using virtual agent technology
which is basically the command-line
agent the monitor will run VM stats or
any command you can specify this will
takes a little time because it's
verifying the 69 monitors ok son so
these are the my configurations I'm
going to close down and now I can see my
configure 3 showing up in the program
menu in my Oracle o testing I'm to
select app and I can also see what
countries I'm going to monitor the
reminder test now having all set of the
settings and I'm ready to run the load
test I will click the start button this
green circle button to start the load
test I can specify my own session name
but I will accept the default name and
click OK
this is going to start the Lotus
the tap will be automatically flip to
the watching wheel grid and later on
you'll see the status of the your
virtual users in this tab and while
waiting let's reveal the Oracle load
testing architecture if everything is
going well then now the oil tea
controller here is communicating with
the agent process and agent process is
starting up the virtual users that run
the scripts you record it using open
script product and virtual users will
report the status back to the loyalty
server and the oil tea server is going
to store the information into the Oracle
database for your reporting purpose
later on let's go back to the oil tea
serve to see what's happening and I can
see the virtual users are already
running some of them already finished 21
or 18 iterations
none of them are filled and I can also
see the how long it took for the last
run time and you also also shows where
in the step currently each of the
virtual users are and the system here is
the agent name I use the local oil tea
server for the agent but if you use the
different agent agent name will show up
in here and I can also see what data
bank value used for the last iteration I
don't see any error here but if you
happen to have an error in your script
then you will also see the error
information here while running the Lotus
I can also see the runtime graph for
this session I will just click view
round graphs and these are going to show
set of pre-configured graphs I can see
six graphs that are showing up in a dust
short style view but I can also double
click to enrich them and here what I
clicked is the statistics versus time
graph it shows the circuit information
hits per second in kilobytes per second
pitch per second and you can also see
them as the number for virtual users
increased the serpent information also
increase so this is expected and graph
uses flex technology
so if I hover my mouse cursor on to
online OCD the body of the data here and
I can also see the status status in
numbers here I can see me max average
value for the throughput information for
the total scenario and but I can also
see the information for the page table
or the step group table now let's go
back to the watch video grade tab and
low test it is still running because I
configure to stop the road test when I
press the button
I didn't schedule the test to stop so
it's going to run until I press the stop
button so I'm going to go ahead and
click the register Go button to stop
this load test and what happens in is
netic virtual agents will finish the
current error duration and then stop but
if you want a terminated session right
away you can also have an option to
unclick this upward button this is going
to abort your virtual user and
regardless of the which step group or
which step the row tests running so this
is not a clean stop if you want to have
a clean stop then it is always
recommended to press the stop button now
all the virtual users have finished
status and your load session is
completed so next we want to see the
results of the load test I can click
this creates reports tab which you can
see the reports from the past sessions
I'm going to click this reports tab and
going to select the session I have just
run and click the generate button to
generate my performance report so this
is the session performance report for
the load test I just run in the top it
shows a start time end time and the
duration of the load test then min max
average and also the total count of the
throughput data
octa virtual users here stays I have max
temperature users round for my loss
session and in average 4.8 virtual users
are running concurrently there is no
error for this flow test we also have
the throughput data here transaction per
second is a number of times the virtual
users playback the scripts per second
and please note the concept of the
transaction in oil T is not the same
with a load testing tool provided by the
other company in the Bay Area the
transaction oil T is a script titration
not the user defined the segment of that
transaction the pages per second is a
number of page returned from the server
per second and hits per second is a
number of resource requests made to the
server per second and also the kilobytes
per second is the number of kilobytes
transferred between a client and server
per second and if I click this link it
is going to launch up the corresponding
data in a graphical view here in going
back to the report and you can also
further narrow down the performance data
into the page level you can also export
this data into the HTML or to the CSV
file in addition to the session report I
can also select to open the a degree
report for this session this is because
I monitor the Oracle database if you
monitor the Oracle database in the
service stats then you'll be able to
have an option to see do a degree report
for the particular database you're
monitoring and I can also able to open
up the a DDM session report for the load
test the analysis says there is no
enough database time apparently because
I was just running this for
demonstration purpose just for 10
minutes but if you happen to have a
database problem in your Lotus then a
DDM may be able to help you analyzing
your pattern in your application
I can also generate a graphical report
in my preference I'm going to select one
of the session I have run in the past
I'm going to select the throughput
information pledges per second and also
number of we use and again the pages per
second is a number of pages returned
from the server per second so the
greater this number is the better your
application is performing and this is
the your throughput data pages per
second but as I can see when the number
of virtual user reached 300 your
throughput data is slowing down and I
want to understand more on what has
happening here and I can select the
server stats counter and add it to this
graph I'm going to select the processor
information of the application server
and what I can see here is when the
virtual user reached 300 actually the
Machine CPU is reaching almost 100% and
this could be the bottleneck of your
application so Oracle load testing won't
hear you want exactly the cause of your
performance bottleneck however by
analyzing the data you can drill down to
the where the bottleneck might reside
next I would like to correlate
performance counters from the two
different sessions say you have reported
this problem to the development and they
have fixed the root cause of the problem
now you want to verify the improvement
and run another low session and say you
have run another low session build two
and you can select the same throughput
information pages per second and
apparently it was run at a different
time what I can do is to change the
scale to absolute or relative so that
they will show up in a single timeline
so you can see the page per second has
improved and I also want to see the
server status monitor whether the
processor information has also improved
so this is the CPU information from the
first one and this is the CPU
information from the second run so
apparently there was some improvement
made in the moment you can also export
this data to the CSD or Excel or the
image file so I'm going to select CSV
and click export and this all down shops
in Microsoft Excel with that all the
data I need so that I can create my own
report in any way I wanted to close that
now I'm done with my load testing for
today and I won't go home but I don't
want to repeat the same configuration
again tomorrow
in that case actually you can save the
scenario setting and open the next time
you do the load testing with the same
setting you apply today so my settings
today I have configured one script for
load test and all I also set run time
setting in my auto pilot I want to save
this configuration what I can do is I
can click the Save button you open up
the dialog I'm going to name my scenario
is C into and ok and it's all safe now I
can click new to initialize my oil
testing so I don't have anything any
scenario configured right now nothing is
selected in the major but I can open the
save scenario
to load up the saves scenario I just
configured so I have load 17 and within
the older pilot I have my server stats
data also loaded and if you have
configured the start/stop ramp up
setting that will be also going to be
saved and be loaded when using select
the scenario you staked so this was a
product demonstration for the Oracle
load testing overview session thank you
