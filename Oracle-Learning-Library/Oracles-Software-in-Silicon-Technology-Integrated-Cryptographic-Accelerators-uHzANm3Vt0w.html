software and silicon integrated
cryptographic accelerators technology on
Oracle's spark m7 processor we have
entered the age of the mega breach the
significant volume of data that is
harbard globally presents a massive
target for today's increasingly
sophisticated hackers securing data in
this environment represents one of the
largest challenges facing businesses
today and it is playing out in real-time
24 hours a day seven days a week a
recent study by fire I suggested that
ninety-five percent of companies have
been hacked and many of them don't even
know it
hardware and software based encryption
have been used to secure data for years
however the processing resources they
require and the resulting degradation of
application performance has limited
their use to specific elements of the
application stack this leaves data that
is not encrypted vulnerable to attack as
businesses move rapidly to cloud
computing and virtualized infrastructure
standard encryption models fall far
short of the need to secure large
volumes of data in response to the need
for a new security model Oracle has
continued to augment cryptography
support in each new generation of spark
processors Oracle's spark m7 processor
is the ultimate expression of hardware
and software engineered together to
provide a new level of information
technology security in this view of the
spark m7 processor the 32 cryptographic
accelerators are highlighted in yellow
notice that there are as many
accelerators as there are cores in the
processor because each processor has
more encryption bandwidth than the i/o
coming into and out of the system all
transmissions can be fully encrypted as
the processor count and the system grows
encryption bandwidth scales reaching an
excess of one terabyte per second of
encryption bandwidth this design is
incredibly efficient while the 32
accelerators rapidly process data only a
fraction of the spark m7 processor
cycles are used for encryption this
high-performance security solution
leaves nearly all of the processor
cycles available for use by the database
and other applications in addition to
providing significant performance
improvements spark m7 processors support
a complete set of strong cryptographic
ciphers for example AES and sha to this
support enables organizations to protect
information at every architectural layer
ciphers are implemented within the
appropriate pipeline rather than as a
coprocessor which dramatically improves
the efficiency of cryptographic
calculations using the integrated
cryptographic accelerators across all
layers of the Oracle stack provides a
greater data security with almost no
loss in
application performance in the example
shown here you can see how application
performance is significantly improved by
delegating cryptographic operations to
the Encore accelerators in this test we
ran the spec Jana prize benchmark which
measures the database and Java
performance of a system while the spark
m7 solution delivered significantly
better performance with fewer cores than
the second-place competitor it is
especially noteworthy that we achieve
these results while running fully
encrypted data from the client all the
way to the database while the
competitors benchmark was run with no
encryption at all in this example you
can see how the spark m7 encryption
architecture enables the secure live
migration of data imagine the case where
all of the data in an enterprise cloud
solution is encrypted and you are using
the spark virtualization technologies to
migrate virtual machines between systems
while they're running because of the
unique capability offered only on spark
systems today the spark m7 processor can
encrypt those VM images and send them
with extreme speed across the network
without exposing data during any part of
the migration the spark m7 takes a giant
leap forward in making the fully
encrypted data center a reality by
introducing industry-leading software
and silicon technology to deliver the
most advanced security platform while
delivering extreme performance for
applications and the cloud please go to

Oracle's software and silicon cloud to
gain access to this technology today
