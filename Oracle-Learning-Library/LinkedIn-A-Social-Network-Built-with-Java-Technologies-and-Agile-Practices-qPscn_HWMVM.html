Adam trachtenberg from LinkedIn who will
hopefully give us a slightly different
perspective than some of the other
speakers we've had today so Adam welcome
thank you glad you being squared of
today's track it's great to be here
thank you all for coming to my talk this
is interesting sort of watching the
earlier sessions because I saw a lot of
the same themes that I'll talk about
here resonated earlier whether it's sort
of bit ly and they're sort of use of
data to drive insights stuff from
facebook in terms of the using the graph
and the types of linkages between people
because inherently we also believe that
sort of social interactions and
relevance sort of really does help drive
activity and user engagement so as
Roland said my name is Adam trachtenberg
i work at linkedin the director of our
developers program and i'm going to talk
today about building on the LinkedIn
platform specifically talking about
professional content and sort of how you
can use LinkedIn to sort really help
amplify that that message so a lot of
people have used linkedin over the years
actually how many of you have LinkedIn
accounts all right awesome and I always
like to sort of talk first about our
mission because in some ways it's really
audacious it's not just sort of
connecting the world professionals or
providing them an opportunity to sort of
have their identity but it's really to
make them which is really you and me and
everyone really at this conference much
more productive and ultimately
successful right so how do you take that
and find a way to use this whole network
and all the interactions that are going
on not just to be sort of a destination
but also a way to sort of really
supercharge where you go both in your
day-to-day lives but also long-term in
your career and when we look at the
platform it's really how do we let
developers take the
and have it grow so sort of seeing the
Liggett ory slide in terms of growth as
you can tell you know not many of two
million were there in 2004 but we've
seen exponential growth over the last
couple years it's funny I joined in 2002
and I think it was you know 75 million
it seems so fantastic in terms of where
they had gone and now we've just been
growing growing and growing and I
actually even had to update the slide
because we add one more language clues
there we go so what we really see is not
just that it's professionals who are
using it by the engagement that we're
seeing if people on the network it's
growing every day and one of the nice
parts about where we've gone in the last
couple years is really having developers
power our platform and letting you us
all the professionals sort of really
work wherever you work right sort of a
recognition that a website as a
destination is no longer sort it's
necessary but it's not really sufficient
or even the case of bit ly where many
cases people are using bit ly all the
time without even really going to bit ly
right there's certain parts of people
who are doing that but all sorts of you
can interact with that platform without
even using it so one example is you know
people going to cnnmoney they have the
hundred best companies to work for and
so we're 11 that's going to be Zappos
and there'll be you know interesting
like buttons like share you can reshare
the articles but even sort of using the
professional data and professional graph
that we have plug in to say well who do
you know who works as a pose right
priding that relevance contextually
right in the piece whether that's social
proof or just sort of insights directly
being drive there just provides a much
more compelling and augmented experience
because as we sort of talked about you
know its earlier sort of attention is
greater than money right so how do I
make the experience and every site wants
to make the experience higher and higher
quality as they go and so we've actually
have over 75,000 developers who
leveraging our AP is over the last
couple years and then when we look at
the value that we provide our members
and our developers we have the sort of
an audacious goal here I'm sort of like
I want to eliminate in some ways the
business card the rolodex and the resume
right how do we provide you with a way
to get your professional identity and
express that in a way that's distinct
from a personal identity or any other
thing that you may have to represent
yourself right so there's a lot of other
networks that sort of allow you to
express other sides of who you are but
it linkedin I think we have a
fundamental proposition that when you
sort of have professional self right
that's the self that's at this show in a
certain kind of way that's a different
self than you want to retin-a may
necessarily represent to others and
other times right other people that you
interact with and that extends online as
well as you go to other sites and other
places you know how are you making sure
that you're providing the right
contextual identity to the application
or the sites that you're using and using
that data in the appropriate way
likewise we really want to make sure
that you can get the insights to do your
job more effectively right and so how do
you be great at what you do not just
good not just get that information but
really be great fantastic at what you're
doing and whether that's in some ways
because you're getting the right
information at the right time as fast as
and efficiently as possible and then
finally as I sort of touched on we want
to work where I remember we'll work it
has to be everywhere that's not just on
linkedin com that's obviously on any
mobile device that you may want to
choose to carry or any other website
that you go to and that's really where
the developer opportunity is to sort of
recognize that many of us as software
professionals are even just
professionals there are certain
applications that you live in right so
maybe you guys live in Eclipse or maybe
you hate Eclipse and you live in you
know whatever ID is your choice maybe
you live on other sites github maybe
you're not even program at all you live
in your CRM
you live in some other tools how do we
make sure that to the point that it's
relevant for LinkedIn to be there
because that's where you are how are we
making sure that we're providing you not
just with sort of a link but actually
the right data in the right experience
that you need to really be powerful in
those spots so when I talk about it you
know this is sort of a standard slide
that our CEO and ever in the company
talk CEO identity insights everywhere I
like to sort of reframe it and say what
we're really trying to do on our
platform is provide identity and
insights everywhere I'm our members work
so outside of LinkedIn and I sort of
think this is in some ways a fundamental
for all platforms is that they provide
value to all three players in the
ecosystem right there's you know
customers right the end of the day we're
very members first organization and if
the user isn't really interested in not
providing any value of it doesn't matter
how much the platform provider and
developers want there's really nothing
to go there likewise you as developers
or any developer actually has to find it
worth your time there's a ton of
technologies you can be integrating why
are you choosing to use this one and
then likewise I think ultimately the
platform provider the business that's
providing it has to find its worth their
time otherwise they're not going to
invest all the appropriateness in terms
of care and feeding and SLA s we
certainly heard about number of people
who both either been building their own
platforms can body and using other
people's platforms from infrastructure
all the way up the stack and they sort
of talked about how you know they've had
challenges using the platform and they
need to make sure the platform is going
to the extent that the platform provider
is still provide seeing value they're
going to invest in it to make that more
and more reliable add more and more
features if it's not going then it
doesn't sort of go right and I really
see this as a whole thing of course is a
nice virtuous circle where I amplifies
each other where the more that you're
doing it the more that it feeds back is
a really nice feedback loop and it keeps
on going and one piece that when I think
about this is sort of there's the three
coefficients right there's the customers
developers in business and often people
sort of say they try to make additive
you say all do this one's you know scale
one to ten that's an eight and that's a
seven and oh well that one's strike
probably only because one or two or zero
like it doesn't matter the other two are
really high and when I say you're
thinking about it the wrong way these
are really multiplicative right and if
any of these is set to zero it doesn't
matter if the other ones are set all the
way at the top the whole thing is zero
is out right and so you really need to
know what you're doing and really make
sure everything is aligned in order for
a platform to be successful and really
pay attention to everything that's going
and when that doesn't matter whether
you're in the enterprise whether your
consumer or any types of applications
that you're building I think that's a
key lesson that I've learned over time
and I think as anyone sort of trying to
think about where you're going with
social or even your enterprise you have
your employees right if your employees
don't see value in it that doesn't go
anywhere likewise that the business
isn't seeing value it doesn't matter if
all the employees want it you know you
nearly need to make sure that things are
aligned a linkedin one of the key
differentiators that we have obviously
you're all on linkedin that you know
this is that we have a professional
graph right there's grand all sorts of
different graphs that people have
assembled on the internet right whether
it's so user click graphs or you know
these are pages or these are where
interests taking that graph and sort of
filtering it to have the right set of
information at the right time the
contextual relevancy is highly important
and what we've done is sort of filtered
it just on professional dimension right
now there's a ton of other ways that we
can then cut that data to drive insights
and you'll see that even in our own
platform or our loan products when we
think about things data is something
that sort of scales up and down
horizontally vertically across all the
different horizontals right everything
that we do is sort of power by the data
because ultimately allows us to drive
the right set of recommendations or
insights at that same time the classic
one where everyone knows about that
linkedin essentially invented at a
production like scale as people you may
know all rights that box up in the
corner that says hey do you know these
guys do you know these gals right it's
pretty easy to do it naively and it's
pretty easy to do it poorly but to make
it that it's always refreshing
are only showing three people that
you're like actually know these people
and then doing it is very hard to do but
another hand it greatly increases the
velocity of the graph and the growth of
it so everything many things that we do
is powered by the soul set of
professional professional data here and
this is just one visualization that one
of our data science teams put together
called in maps sort of like a hack but
we sort of will do it from time to time
and sort of saying you know here all
right these are all the people who I'm
connected to how are they naturally
clustered together right and I look at
it and I said oh yeah that's my open
source work you know that's my schooling
you know that's my previous company when
I look at that company I keep in sight
see it's divided between the engineering
side and the product side right and
trying to take data that's very large
and generate relevant insights from it
is fantastic right it's a mean that's
that's the key and that's what we work
really hard to do and linked it on the
professional side so I talked earlier
about sort of insights I did identity
insights and everywhere and I want to
give a couple examples of what some
developers are building on our platform
to do so this one thing is a product
called outlook Social Connector and the
key is just like many of us we live in
our email client at least part of the
day and when you get an email email from
someone how do you have all the right
information to make the decision about
what should I do with that message and
if you already know the person well then
that's already there right but maybe you
sort of remember that name or you've
never heard from them before in your
life well do you need to reply and if so
how quickly and talk to them about what
right so even if you know them maybe you
want to see the status updates that
they're having right so this is the way
that we're sort of taking the identity
the people's professional identity and
sort of bringing it into the site
experience so the application experience
to allow you to make very fast very
informed judgments about what you want
to do we had actually a developer on our
platform called rapportive it's company
called rapportive and they had a similar
product built into gmail and you know i
think the CEO gave me is fantastic
example about it's sort of launched by
accident and they're getting a ton of
inbound requests and you didn't really
know how to handle it and then one the
request came through and of course he's
using his own plug-in heroes like that
person was an angel investor and all of
a sudden that guy said huh that's was
probably an email I want to reply to you
and through that they ended up getting
funding and help them grow but that
crystallized for him in the moment the
actual product benefit that he had been
trying to articulate about why you want
to have his product in the first place
and it was particularly important for
him to have the professional dimension
of that rather than the personal you
know if he got some information and he
knew that the guy was like a fantastic
daddy he really loves sailing awesome
but wasn't really going to help him
decide about what they had to reply that
email or not and we want to sort of make
it so that developers building our
platform always have that experience to
sort of take the identity and customize
their applications in a professional
sense to make them some higher quality
and better experience for all the users
another example that everyone probably
here is heard of is a fortune fortune
magazine every year they have the
fortune 500 right the top 500 companies
and they used to have a very static list
here's the magazine you can read it okay
that was a good start but as you go
through that you want to see that well
company is just aren't companies right
companies are the collection of
individuals who work there and the
relationships that you have between them
and also people there so they came out
with a fortune 500 app that had all
sorts of information it's not just Apple
but knowing that these are the
financials or these are my contacts at
Apple and so the ability to sort of see
who do I know at each of these companies
what is my relationship to them someone
who I used to work with now go there
that again allows you to have the right
relevant information at the right time
filtering that data and cutting it in a
way that's always staying fresh it's not
stale snapshot but since people are
always updating their LinkedIn profiles
it's sort of always ready likewise we
have linked in mobile it's grown
fantastically over the last couple years
and all our mobile products are powered
at least in some part v our own public
API s we have other stuff that we use to
right different types of technology but
you know there's example earlier about
you know wanting to power your products
on your own set of public api's with our
mobile experience that's something that
that we do and really trying again to
say different devices different types of
experiences more or less information
different sets of things that you need
the phone experience is totally
different than tablet experience and
both of them are radically different
than the website experience and this is
I think my favorite chart and graph I've
ever seen like I mean then I don't know
I just I just couldn't have possibly
under sold that but here we have sort of
everyday uses patters of LinkedIn and
this is saying when do people come to
LinkedIn sort of different types of
traffic right based on the west coast
see ya not a lot of people using
LinkedIn three in the morning but then
as the day comes people are waking up
you start checking linkedin getting your
day going and then you know sort of as
the evening goes you're using it less
because you have other things going on
at work or the time sun is shifting or
you're going to bed dinner time and
that's an interesting chart I think
every site has its own different sets of
you know time base usage but then we
sort of said well that's an interesting
cut for the website what if we overlay
when people are using our mobile
experience and you'll see this a
completely different set right the peaks
are off put the trough is different
right so when they're waking up and
getting your coffee you're checking
linkedin right even before you come on
there and then likewise at the end of
the day you've gone home you're sitting
on your couch you're probably on your
tablet your checking linkedin and doing
other things as well so what i charge
you is to find how I you can use
LinkedIn at five in the afternoon in
your car that's supposed to be a joke
thanks so we can figure out how to how
to fill that one up but you'll notice
that as your sort of building different
and devices and different experiences to
us it even said the product that we have
to deliver not just well mobile is
different cuz its mobile or tablets a
different experience because as a tablet
but actually when they're using it and
what they might be using it for totally
differs right and as you
or think about trying to customize the
experience and providing different
pieces that's a very powerful insight
that we had in turn our product design
right and likewise I think that applies
everywhere both enterprise and not in
terms of well what are people using it
when I VPN into my site and checking
things at night at night you know maybe
I'm going to try to do different things
then I am sort of in the middle of the
day right I'm not going over meeting at
nine o'clock i'm probably try and do
other things so I just sort of found
that a very interesting way that you're
a simple data you ask the right set of
queries about what's going on can drive
a powerful insight into a decision
making process from a product
perspective so long line is coffee the
couch and everything in between yeah so
I wasn't involved especially in this
particular analysis but you know this is
sort of a very simple way of sort of
expressing what people were doing but
obviously once you sort of get that
insight you know we then try to you know
go in either talk to users or actually
take the data and see what types of
queries that they're making and then
sort of say oh where where is that
trending and then sort of trying to
build the product experience that sort
of helps amplify the things that they're
trying to do and even more importantly
minimizes the things that they're not
trying to do right so I think one of our
guiding product principles is sort of
simple as better than good the simple is
better than complex right and actually
simplicity is very hard but I think one
of the things that we took from this
data is to say well we used to offer
these not 12 things but when we looked
only three of them we're actually being
used a lot not only should we build out
those three but maybe we actually want
to take away those nine so we did you
analysis and that's in some ways drove
the new version of our iPod or iPhone
product I don't have the slide here but
there's a one that we used to have our
our phone had about 12 different buttons
different tabs what you can do when you
joined it and then we looked at it and
the new one has four right because
either through grouping or reduction we
sort of reimagine you know what are
people trying what are they telling us
through the data and also what do we
think that they're doing and how do we
drive them
so having sort of talked a little bit
about LinkedIn the way we think about
products our platform where things can
go I was going to spend the rest of the
time talking about what i call the
publishing ecosystem there are a ton of
different types of applications that
people can build on linkedin have built
on linkedin but this is one that I think
is particularly special it's worked out
really well for us and it's an area that
we're very much actively encouraging
developers to pursue so going to do a
bit of a deep dive here and sort of talk
about you know the both the technical
pieces of it but also sort of the
business pieces of it and how we thought
through it so just like before I sort of
mentioned that there's this publishing
ecosystem and any platform has to have
this virtual circle I thought I'd just
sort of start with that it's a very high
level but I think if you don't sort of
understand the strategic into the
strategic you know and how things are
aligned then everything else product
technology those are just sort of things
that you're moving deck chairs around
the Titanic right you really have to
understand what are you trying to do and
why is it working for everyone and then
you can realize the product experience
and then you can realize the technology
to enable that so fundamentally we
believe that you know as your LinkedIn
we're providing you with an opportunity
to express your professional identity
right I like to view that is telling
your professional story right and then
from doing that you also want to get the
insights to do your job well right and
how you sort of fantastic in your career
and achieving your career aspirations
and a lot of ways that people are doing
that is you're always reading
professional content you're on different
sites all the time and you want to share
articles or you either want to share our
otherwise other information about your
professional activities right it could
be Adam is attending javaone it could be
Adam read this fantastic article about
the bitly API right all those are things
that I'm sort of curating naturally
that's telling my professional story and
as a member of LinkedIn these are things
that I actively want attached to my
profile or I actually want to share with
my colleagues because the builds of my
reputation or I just think these are
things they'll find interesting so I
have a natural incentive to sort of
share this information and I want to
make
it as easy as possible for the
information to be shared and that's
where developers can play right so I
linkedin obviously there's a box you can
cut and paste the link and we'll make it
really easy for you to share that
information but if that can happen on
the site natively through a share button
or directly embedded into an application
all the better right but why is you as a
developer care about this well ok it's a
feature that people like good but the
fact is when that information is being
shared it's driving traffic back to your
site or back to your application it's
increasing your engagement right so
whether you're building for enterprise
app or whether just a consumer app
ultimately usage activity insights money
there's some metric that your serve
being judged on that ideally you're
being measured on in general being able
to generate traffic is sort of the first
step to getting that and then relevant
traffic and high quality traffic is the
next parts that you want and I'll sort
of talk about how our platform is
enabling that and that ties in
ultimately to what LinkedIn can do as a
business is we provide a platform for
really making it easy for our members to
share find get that information amplify
it redirect the appropriate traffic back
to developers and also surface that
information up to LinkedIn and that just
creates more engagement which ultimately
is a benefit to us so all three of the
parties find value of them and not only
are we finding value almost so one
positive value I'd say almost no one
finds negative value which is pretty
critical so you can pilot an experiment
and try out new things and in fact over
a million sort of different you know
domains and sites use our share plugin
and you'll notice here it's a very
professional bent and who's using it
right if they're not articles talking
about Kim Kardashian though those may be
trending really well right it's
TechCrunch us news cnet CNBC New York
even New Yorker right which is sort of a
professional as professional you can get
four right for consumer publications the
use of the sites that really resonate
when it comes to who's using like
LinkedIn sharing technology
and the number of queries that you know
impressions that we serve up for this
share button is like off the roof right
i mean it's fantastic challenge in terms
of scalability to make that happen
because not only you have to serve up a
huge amount you serve up very quickly
because says was talked about earlier
talk people don't want any wait and see
on their pages right so you need to find
a way to get that and deliver it
reliably and efficiently so we talked
about how people can put a share button
on their page share button and you click
through and you do the share well then
that drives to just one of the products
that we use to sort of help take that
data and make it more interesting right
yeah of course you can appear in your
feed I think we've all sort of seen that
you know your friend Adam or your
colleague Adam and share this article
but we take that and sort of split it on
the data so how many of you have
actually use LinkedIn today yeah yeah
behalf so LinkedIn today is a news
product that Lincoln has that tailors
our recommendations for articles you
should read based on who you are so you
have profile data and it sort of
explains a little bit of who you are
what your interests are what you're
doing we have information about a lot of
the other people that share it and so we
can provide the contextual relevant top
news to you based on you know you serve
your connections who is using this right
you see that social proof that makes it
more relevant someone who's interesting
number of people in my company are using
it and then using that data to sort of
say what are the right articles that are
trending today versus yesterday what's
current so to make it so again you have
the insights to be fantastically
successful in your career right and the
advantage for again developers or
publishers is if you can start to
generate more and more the more relevant
articles these will get aggregated these
will get filtered up and they'll pop up
but the really nice pieces since it's
not a one-size-fits-all algorithm if
you're generating the most interesting
articles in construction or higher
education or ballet well when people in
those three industries come those will
be the articles that will be the top
right Kim Kardashian may win all the
time
but maybe not in those various
industries right ballet of course they
care about Kim Kardashian but not
construction so one of the articles so
Business Insider it's a fairly you know
professional centric website they said
well what has happened since we've sort
of turned on linkedin today in terms of
generating traffic to them and there's a
little graph you know sort of oh yeah
it's going a little bit increase and
then boom up to the top right and we
really vaulted but the part that I like
that I think it's most interesting is
that when they say we have a higher
number of page views per session a lower
bounce rate than the site average right
so these are we're not just bringing
traffic or bringing the most relevant
traffic and high quality traffic which
ultimately that's the type of people
that you want to get coming to a site
and that's really showing the power of
good filtering of data right because you
can throw a lot of eyeballs at it but if
they all just sort of bounce away it's
actually sometimes people say it's more
expensive for me to serve this up then I
got from it similarly a number of other
sites have said consistently that not
only bring them high in large amount of
traffic but it's again higher quality
page user going up other partners are
doing it the coming more frequently we
are bringing the right set of audience
for my match right and that's the key of
having that professional overlay so I'm
going to walk through a couple different
sites that show they use some of our
plugins and then I'm actually going to
get into some code I don't think I've
well maybe the original speaker gave
some java code but i actually will have
one slide showing some real
honest-to-goodness java code because I
felt I couldn't come to Java one without
doing that even though I think we've had
embarrassed Python programmers we've had
embarrassed product managers I will be
an embarrassed PHP programmer but we all
we all program and I think a lot of the
most part about the web is that it's
language neutral when you're talking
like rest style api's which most of us
provide but so here's behance if you're
a creative person and you have a
portfolio this is the site that you live
in right millions of people are using
this to sort of promote their work and
show what's going on and you know if
linkedin we can you can register and
sign up for it and the nice part about
that is we know when you're signing up
maybe the information that they
eat is not your personal information
into professional information right and
that's the right information if you were
to sign up for java one or arc open
we're all the amount of the information
that you fill up in the registration
process is your company information not
your personal information so in some
cases that is the right way to do a
registration flow it's using LinkedIn in
other cases it's not the most relevant
but in certain cases we certainly
believe that that's really should be the
first choice of what people are going to
use for register and then you can use it
to customize professionalize the
experience based on it so you click to
say I want to sign up little dialog pops
up and says yes I'm going to give access
to behance and we sort of let you say
what exactly you're going to give them
access to right it's important that
members are in control over exactly what
their data is doing and we use OAuth for
this just like some of the other sites
that have come talked about this today
as an open standard and then you know
the product becomes experienced you know
if I was publishing something when i add
a new product or here's a here's a new
piece of my portfolio can automatically
get published to linkedin so as i'm just
using behance as part of my everyday
sites how do i get more information and
sharing and embellishing and i'm putting
my behance profile and portfolio on to
linkedin or even just sometimes as
simple as a share button right this is
actually a product on behance that i saw
on linkedin that i purchased because i
thought it was so cool it was like oh
that's interesting and i clicked through
and it sort of the sculptor does wooden
letters and i bought some for my son and
it was sort of like a really nice
experience it was someone through that
social proof of this is something I find
interesting I came and actually
discovered it and then I turned into a
purchase right I don't even know if we
think about there was that talk about
you know serve social commerce this was
even sort of like professional social
commerce which as much as I always
thought fright fascinating another site
actually my wife uses this right so she
does a lot of video work as what her
experience is and she uses vimeo right
so a lot of people use youtube but
another one clicking on more
professionals as they use a cycle vimeo
it has more controls for people in the
professional belt so should i go well
you know what can i do is well when I
like something
you know I can have that bound to my
LinkedIn account and then i can actually
explicitly choose what type of actions
when i do on be on vimeo gets pushed to
linkedin right so sort of in that same
facebook style open graph to say all
right i want to do things on this site
and i want to get them published but one
of our keys is how do i put that person
in control of that data and i don't want
any surprises right this is your
professional reputation you want to know
when when you're doing things so yeah
okay i want to want to upload a video
but and i like a video but maybe not
every time I leave a comment or maybe I
do want to comment but not when i add a
video to channel a group right so
providing people with the experiences to
sort of toggle in and out and then
sharing that content back to linkedin to
get that viral distribution not only
gets you that traffic but also makes
that person feel empowered that they're
in control and that they can therefore
comfortably dry the site experience to
do what they want and then ultimately
you know it appears to my feed and it's
shared and then other people can see it
on linkedin and interact with it and so
again that provides that circle because
then they see that and they click
through and watch the video and then
maybe they like it and then more people
see it and that expands and expands and
expands throughout the graph and this
isn't just behan so this doesn't just
vimeo it's github its tripit right so as
you're just sort of checking in code on
github maybe they're saying you know
you're following a project right and
you're sort of sharing that it's a great
way for me to see what cool code my
colleagues are playing around with or
using right trip it another way i love
tripit because all of a sudden I started
to see when people are traveling to san
francisco right i used to live in New
York I have a lot of friends in New York
we're coming to town I'm sure I was top
of their list to it to send a message to
but maybe they forgot sure if it does it
automatically right and so here's
another way for me to say oh hey we
should get in touch for a cup of coffee
right we should go get some blue bottle
it's better in San Francisco and then
it's in brooklyn and likewise for me
when I'm traveling they get that
experience as well
so I spent the first bit sort of talking
about what is linkedin whether that's
how do we use our platform where do we
go with that I'm going to actually sort
of move now to the more engineering
centric part of the talk and sort of say
how do you get your content in front of
175 million professionals right they're
using it so developer at linkedin com
this place to get started like many
others we have restful api s we also
have some javascript plugins and a
series of tools that you can use to get
started with your development you know
we make it easy for you sort of get
started in terms of going about with
that sharing experience and growing and
building an application that lets you
sort of be part of this virtual cycle
virtuous cycle and get going so I just
made up this phrase earlier today
calling professionalize the experience I
think the language people will will be
unhappy with that I might have to remove
it but you know it's more than
personalizing it right you really want
to make it relevant to the professional
who's seeing it and so we have a lot of
information in a lot of different ways
that you can get it whether it's people
connections social stream and then
invitations and messages in contacting
because it is people are at the heart of
this network from a rest style
architectural view we use rest which
means sort of the resources or URLs the
actions you take them are HTTP verbs you
can use data via XML or JSON your choice
we're sort of indifferent you can
authenticate using OAuth one or use our
JavaScript SDK to make it really simple
and the other key part that I mentioned
is that we have member permissions as
well so you're are always served you
have to ask for what you want and the
members are informed about and from a
rest I'll view here resources are
represented by a URL API linkedin com we
have a version number so we can sort of
provide backwards compatibility and then
we have you know people or collection of
persons 123 is the way identify uniquely
someone on our graph or you can use
tilde or me to sort of say here's a
shortcut for the signed-in user because
often that user you're making them a
call on behalf of is sort of critical
right it's not just what do I know about
I want information
about this person but it's really what
can I Adam see about another person
right because depending on how we're
connected i might feel more or less
comfortable sharing more or less
information with you and then from there
you can say okay can I see their
connections getting in our mailbox a
specific message right so really trying
to use rest I'll harkey's to represent
and model the data and then using the
actions by the verb so not everyone can
sort of do this this is more of a its
actual real example but depending on who
you are not in fronting jobs on linkedin
but you can post to the jobs endpoint to
create a new one and return 2012 say
it's created you can get it sort of the
heart of customizing something like I
want to read that data you can edit it
through put and then you can delete it
or say I'm no longer put that jobs been
filled using delete endpoint and nicely
to is we serve you something called
field selectors which I jokingly called
the emoticon syntax because the sort of
looks like a bunch of smiley faces and
the parenthesis to let you specifically
enumerate what information you want
because again performance is so critical
that you take a little bit time once to
tell me what you want and then we can
optimize the calls on our back-end and
over the wire to just return the data
that you need to make the responses as
fast as efficient as possible because
sometimes some data is cash I can
retrieve that very small subset very
quickly another time if you want stuff
that's still quick but not as quick
right our JavaScript SDK provides the
ultimate in simplicity initialize you
include like one line and an API key you
authorize you can choose one script to
say okay when you login give me that
sign-in button and when it's done here's
a handler load the data make the request
to say get the profile for me the
sign-in user get this sort of their
first name their last name their
connections and then inject that into
the page so very simple authentication
experience bet you get up and running on
the front end no time at all and then of
course the obligatory I will include
some Java code slide here to say all
right if you're doing things on the back
end you know you can use the scribe
OAuth library which is actually written
by someone who
works at LinkedIn to say all right well
I want to hit the end point of people
till the shares to add a new share I'm
going to post that I'm going to post you
some XML so let me tell you what type of
content that is I'm going to build that
up to say alright well I'm having an
awesome time speaking here at javaone
yeah i'm going to share my talk on
building on the LinkedIn platform here's
the URL anyone can see that add it in as
XML make the request and then get the
response back so it's very simple you
could I have a similar one that just
uses JSON as well so whatever you prefer
you can you can create and package that
up earlier there was talk about Open
Graph tags so it would be possible that
if you said well I don't even have all
that information I don't want to present
it you could say I would say oh well
just give me the URL the page if you as
long as you barked up that page with
Open Graph tags will go and fetch that
information for you and automatically
decorate it to provide even more detail
about it so our goal is to make it
extremely simple for you as a developer
to sign in and authenticate with the
user make that information and help
professionalize that experience and then
as they're taking actions on your site
okay you can share that back to LinkedIn
it's creating that virtuous cycle
they're building up their professional
identity and then likewise you're
getting traffic back to your site as
we're at LinkedIn automatically
targeting it through our feeds through
LinkedIn Today emails and other products
to say who are the right people who need
to see this message so that you can
interact on it and then drive you back
the largest set of the most relevant and
engage users possible so I want to leave
some time here for for questions great
thanks Adam really great to hear a
different use case than we've heard are
today any questions science Yeah right
there
so the question was one could you be
able to move the nodes in English graph
all the in maps yeah it's a complicated
algorithm to figure out how to even lay
that thing out in the first place but I
don't know that's a product feedback to
the team well really that Java it's
really just a rest I'll it's a REST API
and I just inscribe is on github so it's
really just sort of using the scribe and
I think it's dumb for J xml library
together to call our rest i like the ice
yeah it's a coat you know with OAuth and
with rest since it's really just making
HTTP requests and signing them we don't
have a Java our own java sdk because
most the time it's easy for people to
sort one or they want to roll their own
all right perfect other questions so the
question is does linkedin have a plan
for semantic web and marking things up
with rdf and actually that's not really
something i'm an expert in but i'd love
to come up afterwards and we can talk
about it or i can least try to get your
request back to the right people inside
a linkedin great other questions all
right well then thank you very much it's
really been great talking with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
