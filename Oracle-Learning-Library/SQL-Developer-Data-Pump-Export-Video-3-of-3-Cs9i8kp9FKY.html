this demonstration will be on sequel
developer data pump export
in this demo we will be using the data
pump export wizard to export HR into an
empty schema to access the Wizards
navigate to the DBA browser
you will need to have DBA privileges to
use the data pump feature expand the
system user select data pump under data
pump this is where you can view your
export and import jobs right click on
data pump to open the context menu
select data pump export wizard in the
first step you see that I'm using the
system connection I have the option of
exporting just my data or DDL or
exporting both data and DDL which is
what we want to do
for the type of export you can select
database tablespaces
ms or tables select schema
in this step you can select one or
multiple schemas just select HR
here you can enable the include exclude
filter will leave the default in this
step this is where you can filter on
your table data by entering a where
clause you can enable logging where an
export log can automatically be
generated you have the option of
changing the export log name but we'll
leave it as is this log file will be
saved in the data pump directory
here are the output files this will be
your dub file you can leave the file
name as is but let's go ahead and give
it a unique name this dump file will be
saved in the data pump directory any
existing files will prevent the export
but you have other options such as
delete an existing dump file or append a
timestamp to that dump file just in case
this file exists selectively existing
dump file whenever you initiate an
export a job will automatically be
created here is where you specify the
information on your job such as the job
name and the description you can
schedule to rock the job to run
immediately or at a later time and you
can select if you want it to run
repeatedly and at what frequency
and in this final step this is where you
will see the summary tree which will
show you all the options that you've
selected you're going to be exporting
your HR schema here is your log file
this is the name of your dump file and
in case this dumb file exists the
existing one will be deleted in this job
will be run immediately you can also
view your options in the PL sequel tab
click finish while the data pump job is
running you can actually go back to your
export jobs expand it and you can view
the current export jobs that are running
once your job completes you can check
the export log for any errors the log
shows all the objects and the data that
was exported from HR this also shows you
that the export completed successfully
this log is located in your dump
directory if you don't know where it's
located you can do a select star from
all underscore directories thank you for
