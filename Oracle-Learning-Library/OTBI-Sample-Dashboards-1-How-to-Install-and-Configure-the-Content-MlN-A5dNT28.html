four short videos about the sample otbi
dashboards and reports that I've posted
on customer connect my name is Caroline
gladwyn and I work as a solution
consultant in the Oracle UK HCM team in
this first video we're going to be
looking at how to download and install
the content will then be looking at the
structure of the content before
finishing off by looking at how you can
configure the content to work with your
data so to be able to use the pack of
sample otbi dashboards and reports you
need to be on customer connect just
search for me and you'll see it as one
of my posts you'll notice below that
there's a post about the talent review
meeting and also a few otbi hints and
tips I only mentioned those at this
stage because I'll be referencing them
later in these videos to download the
sample information simply click on the
posting and you'll see here all the
information that you need so what's in
the pack understanding about its purpose
and also some information about the look
and feel of the dashboards in order to
use this content you need to make sure
you've downloaded all of the documents
that attach to the posting once you've
done that you can then begin to think
about importing them into your fusion
environment so you can see here in my
file manager I've downloaded all of the
files that I need
I've also unzipped the sample catalog
files and we can see here there are two
files which contain the content that
we're going to bring in as well as those
catalog files there is also a brief
guide to the otbi dashboards i'd
recommend when you have time that you
take the time to read through that and
actually get some more information about
these samples and how they are built all
of the information I cover in these
videos is briefly referenced in these
guides as well as that there's also the
ad-hoc workshop so if you have any
employees that need to get to grips with
otbi and a fairly new to the product
they'll find that the workshop gives
them some hands-on exercises to get them
up to speed and again I'd recommend that
you go through that to understand more
about the techniques that we cover in
this video once you've downloaded all
the files and you've unzipped the
catalog files you're ready to bring the
content into your environment you need
to be logged into Fusion as a user who
has access to be able to unarchive bi
content into the web catalog if you're
not sure check with your administrator
to make sure you have this capability to
bring the content in you simply need to
highlight the custom folder which is
under the shared folder and choose the
unarchive option down below the first
file to bring in is the one called
sample content v1 catalog so highlight
that and click on open and then okay the
content may take a few seconds to come
into the system but once it has it will
create a folder called sample content
and we'll be taking a look at that in
more detail in a second we now need to
bring in the second folder and that's to
do with the dashboards so this time
highlight the dashboard folder under the
custom area now if for any reason you
don't seem to have a dashboards folder
it may be one of two things it may be
hidden so have a go over here checking
the box on saying show hidden items to
see if you've got the dashboards but
they're hidden away if you still can't
see a dashboards folder then a quick way
to create it is to highlight back on the
custom folder and choose to create a new
dashboard that will automatically create
you the dashboards folder that you need
once you've got the dashboards folder
highlight it click on an archive again
and then bring in the second file
this one's called sample otbi dashboards
v1 dot catalog again click on open and
click on ok once that has been brought
in you'll notice under your dashboards
folder that you have a sample otbi
dashboards area so that finishes the
first part of this video which is about
downloading and installing the content
we're now going to move on to the second
topic which is looking at the structure
of the content so the
you can understand what it is that you
now have I mentioned that the dashboards
come in in into the sample otbi
dashboards folder if we expand that
folder you'll see that the dashboards
have a number of different pages in the
samples they're arranged in functional
areas so things like absence or
organization structure or profiles but
there's nothing to stop you at a future
point in amalgamating Bateman
amalgamating the information and making
it cross-functional for example now in
terms of the content that's displayed in
each of these pages that's held within
the sample content folder which is now
created under custom within here if you
expand the sample otbi dashboards you'll
see that there's a folder for each page
in the dashboard so if for example I
want to see the reports that are on the
absence page I can open up that folder
and have a look at all of the different
reports that are made available to me
and it's the same for all of the other
pages so whether it be the head count or
the performance or the profile page you
can simply click on that folder and see
the reports now many of the reports used
shared filters and conditions to update
their information based on the dashboard
prompts so you also have a folder called
subject area content and that's the one
that holds the definition of all the
different filters and they're grouped
according to the subject area that those
filters relate to now the final piece of
content that you have in here as well is
the worked examples for the hands-on
otbi workshop that i mentioned earlier
so if you do have people that are
working through and picking up skills in
otbi and want to check the answers that
they've created then they can use this
otbi hands-on folder to have a look at
those different reports now if at any
point you want to know which report is
on which dashboard if you go back to the
sample otbi dashboards and choose to
edit any of these pages so for example
if I edit the organization page then I
can see the layout of the dashboard and
I can quickly find which reports are
displayed on which dash
bored so for example I might want to
have a look at this headcount breakdown
report so I can click on the X Y Z icon
and it will then if I choose edit
analysis take me straight to the report
which is displayed on that dashboard so
that's another way of understanding the
link between the content that's provided
and the dashboards that are displayed so
now that we've got the content on the
environment and we understand its
structure we're able to move on to the
third part of this video which is about
configuring the content to reflect the
data that you have so what we need to do
is we need to go up to the dashboards
and have a look at them
so if we choose the dashboard link and
choose sample otbi then that will bring
us into the dashboard pages
here we can see the basic structure of
all of the pages so we have the prompts
down the left-hand side and we have some
information on the right-hand side that
relates to the selections that have been
made now in some of these pages the
selections on the left-hand side have
been hard-coded to demonstrate the
intended use of that page so some of the
configuration we need to do is to go and
update those hard-coded values to
reflect your data
the first tab that we need to do this on
is the absence tab so here we can see
the absence page and you'll notice down
on the left-hand side the absence types
are hard-coded to some specific values
these won't reflect the values that you
have and therefore to update that you
simply need to go to the top right hand
corner and click on the edit dashboard
link this will allow you to access the
prompt and update the values so here we
can see the prompt to absence on the
left-hand side again we just choose to
edit that and then we define the new
default values so here is the definition
of the prompt and it was the absence
type that we want to update so I
highlight that and choose to edit it
using the pencil icon if I open up the
options we can see here the default
values that have been selected so if for
example I wanted to either add or change
these values I'd simply highlight them
and maybe delete one and then I can use
the plus button to add a different one
in so I may have defined a new absence
type and I want to select that in as my
default value so I can come in here and
I can sit either search through the list
of values that are available or I can do
a search using the box at the top to
limit the choices I want to add in the
sick progress UK absence type so I'm
going to select that click on OK and say
ok again if I now save this dashboard
and go back to have a look at the data
in it then you'll see that what I now
have is an updated default set of
prompts which reflects the data that I
have in the system so we can see here on
my absence types that I've now got
selected the three updated values that I
just chose you all need to do that for
the sick
absence types that you have in your own
environment now you need to go through a
similar process with two or three of the
other pages so the other two tabs that
we need to do this on is the skills tab
and the talent tab so here we can see
the skills tab and again on the left
hand side we've got hard-coded some
competencies the idea of this page is
that it's been designed to only show
somewhere around 10 to 12 different
skills or competencies if you have a
need to display information about
hundreds of different competencies then
I'd recommend that you redesign this
page to reflect that volume of data but
if you're happy to limit yourself to
between ten and twelve competencies you
need to follow the same process we just
looked at to go through and choose those
competencies as the default selections
for the skills dashboard prompt the
dashboard page will then be updated to
reflect those new selections the same
thing will happen on the talent page so
the talent page is all about talent
review meetings by default it's been
limited to one or two specific talent
review meetings again you'll need to
update this to reflect the talent review
meetings you're running within your
organization but please note that this
page has been designed with the
performance vs. potential layout in mind
and therefore if you have other types of
axes that you're using in your talent
review meetings again you may want to
think about redesigning this page but if
you have performance and potential
review meetings then just update the
defaults on the left hand side in the
same way that we saw earlier to reflect
that the other thing you might want to
do in this page is to bring in the
talent review report that's on customer
connect and I referenced this earlier on
when I was showing you the content on
customer connect so if you wish to use
that report then please download it and
follow the instructions and video
relating to that particular report if
you do that then you may well end up
with a dashboard that looks like this
one here where that new report has been
imported in so here we can see that this
dashboard now has the nine box layout
and the ability to drill down to detail
on the different
areas of the organization so we've now
done the first part of the configuration
we've updated the selections on the
dashboard prompts if I return to our
sample set of dashboards you could go
through the same process on any of the
other tabs although their values aren't
hard-coded you could choose your own
default selections if you want to you
may also need to set up some data for
the succession page so the succession
page is based on the fact that you have
marked some of your jobs as being
critical to the organization
so we can see here that the information
has been retrieved for those jobs that
are marked in that way we can see
account of the total number of critical
jobs as well as information about
whether or not they have a plan if they
have a plan whether they have candidates
in it or if there's no plan at all
so if I just switch to the fusion
applications I can show you where that
data is set up we can see here if I go
to the navigator that I'm able to go to
the profiles relating to talent if I
choose the link to profiles it will open
up the page which will allow me to
search for those key jobs that I want to
flag is being critical so I choose the
job profiles and then I can do perhaps a
standard search or an advanced search
for the jobs that I'm looking for so I'm
going to look for things like the chief
exec if I put in the search string of
chief then it will return all of those
types of jobs for me and I can then
drill into that information and I can
then set the content type called
criticality to say that that job is a
critical job the key thing is that
you've switched on the radio button down
here for yes against requires succession
planning because it's that piece of data
which then drives the content in the
otbi dashboard the very final piece of
configuration we need to do is to update
a couple of the reports to reflect some
of the links so if I switch back to the
dashboards and move on to the profiles
tab I can show you an example of this on
the profiles tab and the same is true on
the absence tab there are some reports
which have links to allow you to drill
across to the person gallery we can see
here the report called assignment
details and drill to person gallery this
go to portrait link needs to be updated
to reflect your instance name in order
to do that we first of all need to find
out what the link is to your person
gallery so if again I returned back to
the fusion environment then we can see
here what I need is the first part of
the URL so for me it goes all the way
from ad C across to comm and I need to
just highlight that
copy it if I then return to the
interactive dashboard and edit the
dashboard I can go and update my report
to reflect the actual location of my
fusion instance so we can see here the
report is called assignment details
again all I need to do is edit the
analysis
what's the report is open then I need to
go to the Advanced tab to enable me to
quickly update the links that are within
the report so when I open up the
Advanced tab it shows me the XML
definition of the report now it's not
one to be concerned about in terms of it
looking a little bit complex it's
actually very simple to update this so
if I just open up a notepad I can paste
in the part of the URL that I just found
what I also need to do then is return to
my analysis XML and highlight the whole
box so I need to scroll all the way down
to the bottom to the bottom of the box
and highlight the whole of the
definition once I've got all of that
information again I can copy that and
bring it into my notepad session so we
can see here I've now pasted it in now
the next thing I need to do is I need to
take the the updated URL that I've just
found from my own environment and I need
to replace the URL that's currently in
this report definition and to make it
easier what we've done in these sample
reports is we've put the URL as being
xxx com
so if you do a quick search you'll find
that that string is available in the XML
code so what we need to do to update
this report is do a find and replace of
xxx comm with whatever your particular
URL is so I'm just going to do that and
click on replace all
having done that all I need to do is
reselect the information in notepad copy
that and then replace the information
that's currently in my report with that
updated definition so if I paste that in
and then click on apply XML what I now
have is a report which when it drills
off to the person gallery will take me
to the particular instance that I'm
running this on if I want to see if
that's working correctly then I can say
show me how the results will look on a
dashboard it will display me the updated
report and then when I click for example
on alien Amy Marlins link it will then
open up her employee portrait
so you can see there it's opened up in a
new tab and it's displaying that
information just for Amy Marlin as I say
there's another of these links on the
absence tab so you need to go through
the same process for that report
so that's updated the links to the
person gallery the final thing we need
to do is to have a look at a couple of
the reports on the skills page which use
case statements and reference data that
may be different in your own environment
if I return to the profiles tab then
what I need to do is navigate to the
skills tab to enable me to update those
reports so here we can see the reports
around the skills information and one of
the things we've done is to do a case
statement to rank the different
proficiency levels according to the
numeric rating system so one for
advanced two for expert and so on
now it may well be that your rating
systems are slightly different and
therefore you'll need to update both the
text and also maybe the numbering that
you wish to use it's quite
straightforward to do this again you
just need to edit the dashboard and go
in and find that report so I'm going to
edit the competencies report and within
that I need to find the item that has
that case statement defined on it
it's on the breakdown tab so if I switch
to the breakdown tab then it will label
me to get to that proficiency item so
here we can see the information that we
need to edit if I go to the Edit icon
just above the proficiency column
selector then it enables me to get to
the definition of that column so here I
can choose the Edit formula option and
we can see here the case statement that
we're using so for me my proficiency
levels are advanced then expert then
skilled then intermediate and finally
foundation but it might be that in your
organization they're different or you
have a different numbering system so
simply go through and update the case
statement and that will then be
reflected in the reports there is also a
similar concept used on the performance
document status so you may want to
update those ones as well so that
finishes this brief overview of how to
install the content how to understand
the structure of the content that you've
been provided with and how to configure
it to reflect the data that you have in
your environment you're now ready to
move on to the second video around how
the data is displayed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
