of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet at this point of the course on jet
you should be well aware of the fact
that jet focuses on reusing existing
technologies rather than reinventing the
wheel that approach is true for the
tasks outside of the creating and the
development of jet applications too for
example while you might have used tools
like ant and maven if you're familiar
with Java development for building your
applications in the JavaScript ecosystem
grunt is a widely used alternative
represented by this scary guy that is
grunts official logo for most things
you're likely to be doing you won't need
to know anything about grunt at all once
you have the Oracle jet command line
interface installed which you did right
at the start of the course you should be
able to use the commands that we'll be
looking at in this part we recommend
that you go to grunt Jaya's calm and did
you explore that site surelly since
under the hood you'll be making use of
grunt heavily throughout the work you'll
be doing with the oracle jet
command-line interface in the context of
its build commands the grunt site
provides a lot of information and
tutorials as well as a well-established
community but again you shouldn't need
to know too much about grunt in detail
when working with jet applications
though it's always good to know where to
go when you want to do something special
invoke a jet build and you'll notice
that by default a web folder will be
created containing your artifacts as
you've learned throughout this course do
not write your code in that web folder
instead write your code in the source
folder because the web folder will be
overwritten whenever you do a new a jet
build the web folder is called web
because web is a default platform for
jet applications after all by default
jet applications are web applications
that are used in the browser on the
desktop on tablets and on mobile devices
a related topic is that of theming
the jet developer guide has a whole
chapter dedicated to this topic themes
consist of CSS stylesheets
icons and other artifacts that change
the appearance of your jet applications
at Build time you can switch between
different themes that you have defined
for your jet applications the ad theme
argument is used as part of the jet
command and then a theme folder is
created which can be included in your
build when you run a jet build in
conclusion grunt the very widely used
JavaScript task Runner is used under the
hood but the Oracle jet command-line
interface it is a standard part of
Oracle jet applications you use it for
bundling your artifacts as you've seen
in this part of the course and you can
run it from the command line your
homework for this part is to explore the
related section in the Oracle JDeveloper
guide and find the references to grunt
in particular where there relates to
building your application explore the
various build options in the Oracle
JDeveloper guide and use them in the
applications that you have been creating
throughout this course finally as always
many thanks for participating in the
course on jet and see you in the next
part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
