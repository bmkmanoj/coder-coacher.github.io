Oracle developer advocate for PL sequel
and I'm here as part of our ongoing code
Talk series co-sponsored by Eugene OD
tug with Rob Lockard the Oracle wizard
and expert on security and what we're
gonna do is chat about the importance of
security from a developer standpoint
when you sit down and start writing PL
sequel code but first probably want to
know why should you listen to Rob locker
and on security well I'll tell us about
yourself well I am a developer designer
DBA have been working in this industry
for 30 years now I have been working
more specifically on the security
aspects for about the ten past ten years
I've worked in financial crimes tracking
customers or blame my last tracking
terrorists money money laundering I've
worked in Cyber Crimes tracking attacks
on our nation's systems and I've also
worked in a couple other places that I'm
not free to discuss all right so it
sounds like you might know what he's
talking about and a lot of what Rob does
talk about in his holistic database
security presentations and his work is a
big picture of network administration
system admins DBAs and there's a lot of
important stuff to talk about there but
I don't care about any of that because
I'm a developer so what I wanted Rob to
do was focus in on your appeal sequel
developer writing code what things do
you need to be aware of sound good
sounds good okay so how do you want to
start I don't want to start let's first
talk about what I'm gonna call the bad
old days where we put everything in one
schema we put our app code our objects
and then we granted access to the schema
and when we grant access to the schema
code and the schema can access any
object in the schema and I can inject
other statements into code to make the
database do what your code was not
designed to do I can extract data out I
can put in backdoor
I can do almost anything so and we're
going to show some of the code that
would illustrate that but so what you're
saying roughly is that a very simple
architecture so we'd like to keep it
simple but the simple architecture of
one schema that owns your data your code
and your users connect to that schema is
a really bad idea
that is a atrociously bad idea so we're
animals dead well the first thing you
should do is you need to take and
separate your application objects or
tables your views or materialized views
out into its own separate schema that
schema should not have Connect
privileges anything that goes into that
schema will be explicitly granted by a
roles now there you can also build an
API schema your API is gonna have your
insert your selects and all your code
and then you're gonna build out your app
schema that's gonna interface with your
API okay so three schemas ideally
ideally the data the code the users
roughly correct and users never connect
to a schema that has access to direct
access to the data absolutely sounds
pretty reasonable okay so assuming they
follow that kind of architecture now
we're down to somebody writing code yes
and the question becomes what should
they care about and we thought that one
of the best ways to demonstrate this is
to start with some really bad code do
the kind of changes that can be made to
it right right and we got some really
bad code for you so we're gonna take
advantage of live sequel live sequel as
a database live sequel Oracle com that
you can visit 24 by 7 play around with
sequel in PL sequel and you run other
people's scripts and in fact this script
will be available on live sequel at your
search command called secure your code
and what we're gonna do is start by
creating a few different tables and then
we're gonna start by looking at a really
bad piece of code so this is our
starting point it's a procedure called
process one row so I'll talk through
what it does okay and why I think it's
great
okay and then we'll take it step by step
and analyze the kind of changes that
could be made to it so this is a pretty
super cool procedure I pass in the table
name right passing a where clause that
you can construct any way you want to
and then I've got a dynamic
single block that is so cool that
constructs a record based on that table
type selects a row from that table and
then does some processing of that row
and instead of having to write 15 25
different procedures that all take a
different table
and work with a different row I could
just write this one program once and
everybody can use it I love it and I've
even got exception handling it's not
like I didn't care about what happened
some things went wrong I really paid
attention here and I raised application
error and I pass back all the
information user needs to take action
and correct whatever mistake they made
nice huh
oh yeah really nice we love you Stephen
thank you so much now just to run
through a couple of examples so one of
the things that I think are fascinating
about programmers that were incredibly
optimistic people mm-hmm and one of the
things we like to say to ourselves is
our users know how to use our code or
they're gonna use it the weights in tend
to be used and people like me look at
code and say how can I make it do what
it's not designed to do one of the
issues with the code that you're using
there is you are creating your own where
Clause alright so I can inject into
there all kinds of things I can expand
that code out to create other objects
simply because you're concatenating in
the all of these variables together so
when I pass in something else I can get
the PL sequel compiler to execute
whatever I pass in now I've got to
confess I don't how many of you are
familiar with sequel injection hopefully
everybody well when I first was reading
about it it seemed really weird to me
like if you look at this piece of code
you say to yourself well I do a select
and - from a table right after the table
name is where and then a where clause
and it's really easy for us to look at
that in a glance and say well that's ok
there's nothing else you can put between
the table and from clause and the
keyword where except aware close and
then you're done and of course if you
use it as intended which is what I show
here you just pass in that customer ID
equals 7 and 0 9 there's the block of
code that's generated and a
cute it and it looks pretty good but
what you're saying is that yeah but not
everybody use things as intended
correct correct it so tell me about that
statement six and what it's doing there
and why they're able to get away with
stuff like this
well with statement six what we've done
is if you will notice we ended the
command where ID is equal to seven zero
nine with a semicolon well with PL
sequel we can now put another command in
there right and I can say execute
immediately let's create another table
let's go in and create another package
we can pull all kinds of things in there
anything that's PL sequel legal I can
put in there so that's the thing we have
to keep in mind especially with dynamic
PL sequel you terminate the string that
was being passed and you think is aware
cliff you terminate with a semicolon and
then that person is treated to whatever
they want now so you can see in
statement six and seven we're actually
injecting additional code that wasn't
originally intended and so the thing you
have to think about the way I think
about it when I'm writing code is that
if I have any external facing input from
a user so my users my expected customers
are doing the right thing but there's
some you know seventeen-year-old kid in
the Ukraine or who knows where and
they're sitting at my website they're
just trying all sorts of stuff what
happens if I do this what happens if I
do that and they'll hit certain
combinations and get interesting
feedback to say yes there's an open here
yeah and you're you're sending back a
whole lot of information that we're
gonna be talking about here in a second
so let's talk about that what we can do
to this procedure well to make it more
secure the first thing I would do with
this procedure is I would look at my use
cases for it and then I would make
generic where clauses so I'm no longer
passing in a where clause and that locks
it down a little bit but we can go
further than there so if you would
scroll down we so it's pretty clear that
unless you are careful about how you
craft your code and especially if you
like users directly input text to be
executed dynamically you can have a
problem so now what we'd like to do is
kind of step through this original code
and talk about the things any PL sequel
can and should do to make it more secure
so let's start with statement a what's
going on here
most statement a what we've done is
we've moved the code from a procedure
into a package now if it's does that
make well what that what's that means if
you look at all source for a procedure
as opposed to a package when I bring up
all source on a procedure I get all your
source code if I do it on a package I'm
gonna get your package specification
that's it
it's more information than I would like
to get out but it's not your entire code
because if I can get to your entire code
which I could from the original
statement I can find all kinds of other
interesting ways to exploit it so this
doesn't resolve any of the issues around
sequel injection but it's such a it's a
basic and important reminder in general
we should never put code in skin level
procedures and functions everything
should go in packages there actually
many good reasons for it but from a
security standpoint it's really simple
you move your code into your package
body you grant execute on the package
you're granting execute only on the spec
and because of that the only thing
you'll ever be able to see about that
package assuming you're connected to a
schema that doesn't own the package is
the package spec so at least at this
point what we've done is secure the
implementation of that procedure correct
it's bad now it's gonna get better but
in any case the question is who should
be able to see the implementation often
not very many people
okay so we've secured the code from view
okay so let's take a look at the
statement nine and talk about what we
what we want to do here and why it's
important well we're doing two things
here number one we've looked at the use
cases that how this package is being
used and we've created generic where
clauses that we can append to the
statement the other thing we're using is
bind variables with bind variables you
have almost eliminated all possibilities
of sequel injection there are still
other possibilities in there however
we've made it a whole lot safer
you cannot inject into a bind variable
right so so let's take a look now at the
code so if we look at the block that's
being dynamically constructed it still
has this wide open we're close being
concatenated in but if you look at the
API we're no longer passing
we're close we're passing specific
values and then internally the program
constructs the workload so what we've
done is taken control of the where
clause away from the user and we've
built it ourselves and so that's and and
the point here is that when we actually
execute it
we're using binding and variables
instead of just a indiscriminating
where clause that's pretty cool so so
basically you have these situations
where developers get all excited about
writing a generic code and I think
writing generic reusable code is great
but I'll occasionally get an email
saying Steven I'm so excited
I built a package to handle everybody
sequel in the entire application you
don't have to write your own selects
updates inserts anymore you just call
the update procedure passing the table
pass in this pass in that and I'm
thinking that's nuts
it is no it's fun but it's crazy so what
you want to do is if you ever see a
piece of dynamic sequel is actually ask
how is this being used right right what
kind of inputs are actually happening
and in this case the analysis was Wow
I wrote this to be super dynamic and
generic but really there are only two
use cases right and they each have to
bind variables so I can create a single
API to support both of these cool okay
and so as you're saying you can't inject
through these bind variables so now
we're good everything's great
well we can make a couple other steps so
how else could we still inject into this
into this chunk of code how is that
still possible well we got table n ok so
we still got we're concatenating in the
table name and you might say well what
can fit between a variable and table
percent row type again terminate with a
semicolon
mm-hm go off and do it if you want so
well then people are gonna look at this
and say but if I terminate with a
semicolon we're gonna have all of the
rest of this code trailing well I put
the rest of my statement in and then I
put - - and I was like everything else
on the line is a comment or a declare or
who knows what okay all right so how do
we what do we do about that I mean you
you have to concatenate the table name
you can't bind a table name right a
parse error right so what do we do well
we're gonna use DBMS assert package and
we're gonna check that what we passed in
is actually a sequel object name if it's
not a sequel object name it's going to
raise an error so DBMS insert is one of
the supply packages designed
specifically to help us strengthen our
dynamics
when guarded against sequel injection so
sequel object name you pass it a table
name and it checks to see is that a
table in your schema is that an
accessible object if not it throws an
error if it's okay it passes the table
name back and you go and use that
excellent and notice also what's what
this sis dad I mean why why not just say
DBMS assert why say system well first
it's a best practice you want to
specifically point to DBMS assert you
could actually have I'm gonna say a bad
actor create their own DBMS assert
package create a public synonym on it
and you're in trouble so think about it
if they get a backdoor in somebody might
have gone in there and actually said
executed dynamically as an example
create or replace DB a package DBMS
output and recreate the API for DBMS
opera which everybody uses but the
implementation of the body for this DBMS
output output lines might be delete
everything from your table do this do
that
so if you just have unqualified
executions invocations of supplied
packages in theory somebody could
actually hijack the package if you say
sis done well if somebody hijacks this
well you've got much bigger problems and
again in our first example that we used
we created a little procedure well you
could create a DBMS assert right within
that schema mhm or DBMS output that's
the script to show people doing that
that'll be fun okay so now we're making
sure that the table is a valid table
mm-hmm we're making sure that the where
Clause is under our control and we avoid
sequel injection through binding so now
we're good now everything's great
nothing else to do no all right so
what's still wrong you're sending back
information to the bad guy you are when
you kick out an error message it tells
me about your environment it'll tell me
did my injection that I didn't put
enough rows in it you know so I changed
my injection a little bit it'll tell me
what type of database you're running I
can even get the versions of databases I
can find all of the
information from the error message so
take a look at what we're doing here
again I thought I was being a good
citizen so you passed in a table you
passed in a where Clause I constructed
this big complicated block but something
went wrong I'm gonna tell you what went
wrong I'm going to show you the block
I'm going to show you the error message
and hopefully you can look at that and
say oh I didn't mean to put an X I
should put in Y or I'm going to call
support and say look at all this
information help so I think I'm doing a
good thing and in fact what I'm doing is
giving ongoing feedback to a hacker
saying now you got to change it a little
bit you've got a semicolon you forgot
this and and they're actually hacking
more effectively because of my feedback
so what should I do instead well one of
the things that you do that a very good
friend of mine suggested was create a
package that records all of your errors
and then you just return to the
interface a pointer to that error and
say call the help desk and include the
phone um thank oh no no no how do they
know how to how to contact their help
desk well if they're it's if it's an
internal user they probably have the
help desk number if it's an external
user but you might include it that phone
number all right and I think you know
one of the things that this reminds me
about regarding hacking and securing
systems is where the real vulnerability
is all right so you watch a movie and
there'll be some hacker say you know sit
down and hack into the Department of
Defense system right now I'm going to
shoot you in the head and like that and
you'll see four four hands right on the
keyboard and you see all the codes
growing like oh my god they're amazing
well obviously we know that doesn't work
that way right so how do most break-ins
happen is it because they have an
amazing technical skills they can write
code super fast they're very intelligent
and they're very tenacious that is
really where it is and we're actually
when we give feedback of what they did
wrong they learn how to tweak it but
isn't it also true that a lot of the
hacks don't happen through the
technology but by fishing expeditions so
I get an error message saying you know
table XYZ does not exist and I and if
and if I have the helpdesk number I can
call but say hi I'm Joe I just got this
message looks like I'm typing
what's the right table name or yeah and
they actually manipulate people to get
well information well yes and the help
desk they want to help the person on the
other line the help desk the way we
normally work it is they have
well-defined scripts of what they can
talk about and anything that goes beyond
that they are not allowed to talk about
and I'll give you a specific use case a
couple years ago a I'm gonna say
customer called in to the help desk and
on the one the line was the business
unit there have to send us very
sensitive information and on the other
line was their security people and the
security people goes I'm not gonna send
you the information until I know how
your security is set up helpdesk comes
to me and says how do I answer that
question I'm saying have them call me
and I had a lovely conversation with
them you know guys I want to know what
firewalls are running what revs on it
what encryption you're using and he's
fire in the business unit and what
they're doing is what they tried to do
is create a sense of urgency they say
this has to be done please help us the
business person right it's on the phone
going please I have to send you this
information my security people won't let
me and the security person is like I'm
not gonna let him you have to help me
and I'm like no and it was about a 15
minute conversation until they
threatened to call the director and I
said fine you know you call the director
and I think I gave him the number to
suicide hotline so I think the lesson is
putting aside the code issues for a
moment is that don't get caught giving
out confidential information about your
company to somebody you don't know right
people can be very good about lying
manipulating other people that's how
they get these things done so we should
not look at you know you might read an
article about some person who got their
Social Security to ID identity was
stolen and you think well that would
never happen to me I'm too sophisticated
for that I'm a programmer but you can
still be manipulated so watch out well
yeah and you know we call them hackers
and really what they are
right and con women and Conway might be
sexist about this okay
not this time so so what else can we do
with this code so now we've we've
changed the error message so that you
just get this very bland pointer to the
I you know the diagnostic information
and then you go and pursue the issue
with your helpdesk are we done no we're
not no or not now where we have to worry
about the user that is doing this may
have execute on this package well this
package may have all kinds of
functionality in it that it's just a
generic you know package to handle all
the i/o well if that user who's
executing it does not have permissions
to say update the customers table well
you want to check that so we're gonna do
it based on their off ID as opposed to
the definers because as you know when
you create a package by default it goes
to definers rights so let's review this
a little bit it's a feature that was
added in in PL sequel a long time time
ago I think it a tie but many developers
aren't aware of it so you have two
different authorization models to use
when you compile your code one is auth
ID definer one is auth ID current user
if you don't include this clause which
is probably true for 99% of all the PL
sequel code in the world its auth ID
definer and it's a very powerful and
potentially very secure model in which
when you call my code so I create my
package in my schema I grant execute to
you when you execute my code even if you
have no privileges to do anything on a
table if you call my delete procedure
it'll do the delete for you in theory
that's controlling what you can do and
in general it's a great model when
you're doing dynamic sequel I think
that's where it really gets tricky if
you execute my program and it's
executing dynamically constructed SQL
and it's definer rights then it can be
doing acting on my tables and my
structures inside this other schema and
it's not control
so in general when you're doing dynamic
sequel and asteroid program unit change
it to author ID current user and what
that means is that when you execute my
program the PL sequel runtime engine
wakes up and it says well I don't care
what that table meant to the owner of
the package what I care about is what
does it mean to you and it kind of
reflects back into your schema and if
you don't have the
just to act on that given object it'll
be rejected so dynamics equal insight
Stewart program units both ID current
user and vocal rights okay now we don't
know we're not really there's more we
can do well there's actually one other
thing and it's very important one of the
things I do to try to escalate my
privileges from a generic user is you
set the auth ID for current user well
what if I can trick cysts into executing
that code what if I never another peels
the sequel unit that is calling the code
and it's vulnerable to sequel injection
attacks so I want to specifically list
out what program units are allowed to
execute the code and you have locked it
down you know a bit more and how do you
do that in PL sequel well you're gonna
do it with the accessible by Clause ha
version of Oracle was that additive
12.10 dot - I believe may be just 12
that one 12.1 I'm using done 0 dot
you're showing off I'm showing off I'm
waiting for 12.2 to come out so so this
is added in 12.1 accessible by you can
actually whitelist access to your
program units the primary use case
around that I think was when you want to
split existing packages that get too
large into smaller units to make them
more manageable but it's not expose
previously private sub programs to
unauthorized access but as a security
mechanism mechanism it also gives you
another way to lock down access this
package can only be called by these
three packages and that's it if anything
else tries to call it do you get an
earth well then there's one other thing
and and I see this a lot people will
write one massive package to handle
everything I have started having people
break the packages up this package does
sensitive work this package is a generic
helper package this package is my
low-level IO and I'm using the
accessible by clause so I can
specifically point to on my sensitive
package
who can execute that excellent all right
so it turns out there's a lot we can do
is just individual developers forget
about your chief security officer and
all the big-picture administrative
issues still when it comes down to you
writing code you can write stuff that
looks pretty cool let's go back up to
the top that looks pretty cool in
generic and it's full of gaping holes
from a security standpoint and there are
a lot of steps you can go through to
make it more secure all right anything
else we should talk about so we've taken
a look at code we've shown step by step
how you can secure it much more tightly
than you might've first have slept
possible so let's kind of go back and
sum up let's go back to the architecture
of code stepping back a level and sum up
for our listeners okay well the first
years the first things we have done was
we separated our application code from
our API from our objects your
application objects in their application
API they do not have create session
ability that's number one number two we
have taken our sensitive tables or
actually all of our tables when we put
roles on our selects update insert
delete okay and then we have granted
those roles to the appropriate packages
wait
grant rolls to program units oh I
thought you just grant roles to you no
you know that's the bad old days the bad
old days because when you granted a role
to a schema to a user
they have everything it's it's something
since when can you grant roles that's
that's 12 another 12.1 feature as an
Oracle employee I asked you so people
should upgrade to Oracle Database 12c is
that right yes and Steve promised me the
Commission so what you what you see is
that 12c has a number of security
related features even at the level of
simply PL sequel code and lots beyond
that okay continue continue okay so we
have granted our second sensitive select
to our sensitive API and then we've
taken the sensitive API and we've done
the accessible by
to the package on your app that actually
executed and we can actually go one
better is not bleh that blame alas we
can but what we're protecting against
with the accessible by is our non
sensitive package that may have a PL
sequel and or a sequel injection bug
from accessing any of the sensitive
objects that's good alright great so
where can people go from here to find
out more about security database and so
on well we have resources one of the
resources I use extensively is this NIST
paper which defines PII how to protect
it PII personally identifiable
information how to protect it from a
government standpoint but it applies
also to the commercial sector and I'm
saying this is not your gold standard
this should be your baseline you know
build onto it you you're absolutely
welcome to make it stronger another
thing is I have a spreadsheet out there
and that is listing what I would believe
to be sensitive columns and if you go
there and you can email me if there's
columns in there that are not there I
speak English
so you're building a little repository
of common column names that would likely
be sensation you want to keep restricted
yeah and that way you can take this and
you can report on your database and say
this is what's in there and if you find
something that you know should be in
there please email me I'll happily add
it to there sounds good
and maybe we'll load it up as a live
sequel scripts they have a table that
would date in it instead of a
spreadsheet spread she didn't come on
database okay database okay what are the
resources Bren has got a beautiful white
paper on sequel injection on how to
write sequel sequel injection proof
let's say that that's it sequel
injection proof PL sequel so bring the
lon PL sequel product manager
yeah the PL sequel product manager the
the paper was written in 2008 but it's
still highly relevant today I still
reference that paper frequently and then
there's another one than this more into
the date DBA part you can close your
ears for just a little bit
there's encryption issues with data pump
if you run a data pump on encrypted data
and you do not specify and crypt on the
data pump command line that will be
saved unencrypted okay and that's
something that everyone needs to be
aware of set me really because I don't
do that but that's important information
now okay great
so hopefully you learned a lot about how
you can modify your appeal school code
to protect it against sequel injection
and other kinds of unintended access to
your code anything else are some final
comments words of wisdom to us a naive
and optimistic programmers when we
develop systems we're on a deadline
management says we must have the product
out the door by give a date and because
of that a lot of sloppy code gets out
there that's very injectable security is
hard okay but we're trying to make it a
little bit easier and you should design
the security in from the front security
is a feature and if you don't design it
in from the front it gets really
difficult to retrofit it into your code
and I'd like to think that after you
when you watch this video and you see
the kind of changes that should be made
they're they're not that difficult no
those are not difficult it shouldn't
even take a lot more time in as you're
writing your code and it probably makes
it easier to test too so hopefully it
won't come away from this talk thinking
wow I don't think I can secure my PL
sequel code that would be a wrong
conclusion and lazy you just be lazy so
don't do that draw these lessons out
think about where you're currently doing
dynamic sequel especially dynamic PL
sequel it's less common but it's
more dangerous in terms of the things
you can do right because I can and
string together many commands and
dynamic PL sequel and with with dynamic
sequel I can only string in one
additional command like one additional
Konami PL sequel way worse and the other
thing I guess you do wanna have
developers do is look at their
application and ask are there any
outward facing data entry at fields
places where people can type stuff that
ends up directly being defended to
dynamic sequel right that's the path
that you really have to shut down yeah
you have to shut that down and that gets
back to where I'm constantly talking
about yeah a gold access path is trusted
access path where you can say I'm going
from point A to my data and you can
define the risk at each point all right
Rob thanks very much for sharing your
expertise with us at IU G collaborate 16
and hopefully everyone will benefit from
your wisdom thank you thank you for
