physical domains and describes how they
enhance the virtualization solutions in
Oracle SPARC m5 32 and SPARC m6 32
servers from the rear of the server you
can see that the hardware resources are
divided into four groups called domain
configurable units or DC use each DCU
contains processors and memory PCIe
expansion slots integrated network ports
and integrated storage DCU's provide the
building blocks of physical domains a
physical domain operates as an
independent server that has full
Hardware isolation from the other
physical domains in the server you can
divide the server into one to four
physical domains to suit your
application requirements for example you
can combine all of the DCU's into a
single physical domain that contains all
of the available hardware resources
another configuration option is to
divide the server into four physical
domains each containing one DCU and
running its own operating system and
applications for different organizations
in your company once the server has been
divided into physical domains you can
add hardware or even restart a single
physical domain without affecting the
operation of the other physical domains
and the server
DCU's and physical domains enable you to
plan for future growth and expansion
when needed the server chassis includes
processor and i/o slots for 4dc use
however you can purchase a server with a
minimum of eight processors and
configure them into either one or two
physical domains as shown here at a
future time you can purchase additional
processor and i/o options to populate
the remaining DCU's you can then
increase your hardware resources by
combining these new DCU's to existing
physical domains as this example shows
DCU 2 and DCU 3 can be added to physical
domain 1 while physical domain 0
continues to operate without
interruption located at the front of the
server the scalability switch boards
provide the capability to combine DCU's
into larger physical domains the
scalability switch boards provide a
global interconnect that joins all of
the processors together and enables them
to communicate with each other this
global interconnect enables you to
configure the server into a single
symmetric multiprocessor system
containing up to 32 processors and up to
32 terabytes of shared system memory
a bounded physical domain is a second
type of physical domain available
bounded physical domains do not access
the global interconnect provided by the
scalability switchboards so bounded
physical domains provide increased
hardware isolation from the other
physical domains in the server bounded
physical domains also accommodate
additional hardware configurations for
example a bounded physical domain can
operate successfully with only two
processors where regular physical
domains require at least four processors
bounded physical domains are limited to
a single DCU so you cannot combine two
or more DCU's to make a larger bounded
physical domain a single server can
contain a mix of bounded and regular
physical domains physical domains enable
you to isolate specified Hardware from
other Hardware in the system beyond
physical domains the server fully
supports Oracle's other virtualization
solutions including the Oracle VM server
for SPARC software and Oracle Solaris 11
zones each physical domain can be
divided further using the Oracle VM
server for SPARC software which is
bundled with the server the Oracle VM
server for SPARC software enables you to
create virtual servers called logical
domains which run their own independent
operating systems and use a configurable
portion of the available server
resources each logical domain can be
created reconfigured and rebooted
independently when assigning logical
domains along processor core boundaries
you can create up to 384 logical domains
and a spark and 6:32 server and 192
logical domains in a spark M 532 server
use Oracle VM server for SPARC logical
domains to isolate an operating system
from other operating systems running
within a physical domain Oracle Solaris
zones which are included with the
pre-installed Oracle Solaris operating
system provide further virtualization
opportunities each Oracle Solaris zone
contains a controlled environment
through which you can allocate the exact
resources an application requires use
Oracle Solaris zones to isolate an
application from other applications
running in the same logical domain you
can create thousands of Oracle Solaris
zones within a single Oracle Solaris OS
instance using a combination of physical
domains Oracle VM server for SPARC
logical domains and Oracle Solaris zones
you can partition the server's resources

environment and applications check out
