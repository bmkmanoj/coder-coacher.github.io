product manager with the Oracle no
sequel database team Oracle no sequel
database is a scalable distributed
database designed to provide highly
reliable flexible and available data
management across a configurable set of
storage nodes Oracle no sequel database
has meant for organizations that require
very fast storage and retrieval of any
type of data we do this by taking
advantage of parallelism throughout the
entire system what we want to demo for
you today is how you can take data that
is in the Oracle know database system
combine it with other data in Oracle
database and even external files to get
better insight into your sales process
or other types of data that you have
take it away Hema hello everyone welcome
to the demo that shows integrating
Oracle no sequel database into data
visualization tools the goal of this
demo is to show how data from Oracle no
sequel database can be joined with data
from other data sources to generate
reports and dashboards using existing
Oracle tools in this demo I use Oracle
data visualization desktop product to
join data from three disparate data
sources for relational store I use
Oracle DBMS for key value store I used
Oracle no sequel database for non
database data
I choose excel spreadsheet I use Oracle
Big Data like VM to create and store
database tables though I use data
visualization desktop product in this
demo the same procedure can be applied
to other visualization tools such as
Oracle business intelligence Enterprise
Edition also known as obiee
here is a typical customer scenario the
customer has an existing AR DDMS table
that participates in reports and
dashboards in data visualization tools
today given the variety of data in
modern application the customer adopts
polyglot solution and builds the Oracle
no sequel database application the
customer now wants to integrate this
data into exist
in tools the problem is that the data is
now into disparate data sources one is
relational and the other is key-value
and they need to be joined the solution
we provide is to use Oracle Big Data
sequel feature to connect oraculo sequel
database table to Oracle a DBMS thus
making the key value store data
available to the data visualization
tools to the Oracle or DBMS connection
the customer already has steps 3 &amp;amp; 4
show how the solution is implemented and
step five shows a non database file
participating indeed reports the first
step is to connect the relational data
source to the visualization tool the
customer usually has a relational data
source added to the data visualization
desktop in my case I already created a
or DBMS table called sales and made make
model and unit sold as part of the data
visualization let me show you a bar
graphs for the second step I have
created a Oracle no sequel database
called vehicle table using the sample
program that comes with the product now
that I have created a no sequel vehicle
table for step three I have connected
the Oracle no sequel database
application to the oracle rdb ms first i
created a high table using the hive
external table interface in the Big Data
light VM and mapped it to the vehicle
table through the high table storage
handler I use the properties to set the
vehicle table to point to the kg
variable table in the oracle no sequel
database next I create an oracle rdb ms
vehicle table with organization set to
external and of type oracle height and
make it point to the height table after
these two simple steps I have collected
the Oracle no sequel database
application to the L DBMS and
with all the mappings complete step four
is to add the vehicle table as a data
source to the Oracle data visualization
desktop tool in the data visualization
canvas I go and add the KB store as a
data store and I add it to the project
as you can see vehicle table which is a
KB store is now a data source and I pick
the column count and I add it to the
visualization notice that out of the 246
Chrysler Aspen vehicles four were sold
and out of 256 for 155 I sold and this
demonstrate that data from two different
data sources are used in the report
generation in the last part of the demo
I use a non database file in my case an
Excel spreadsheet and show how it can
participate in the report generation s
law I go back to the canvas and add the
data source and in this time I add a
file which is an excel file and then I
add that to the project the information
that I am king from this file is the
promotion information and I add that to
the visualization from the graph you can
tell that or Chrysler asked them for
three units promotions they replied and
for Ford f-150 for five year Mnet's that
which sold promotion was applied and say
for example Chrysler journey or chrysler
pacifica
there was no promotion that was applied
the promotion information comes
somewhere
yet another disparate data source which
is an excel file that concludes our demo
raishin where we have shown that data
stored in Oracle no sequel database can
be integrated with other data sources to
generate valued reports and charts using
existing Oracle software products thank
