talk about using html5 and Java effects
together and Steve and I'll duke it out
try to make suggestions on which
technology should be using and then
maybe talk about how we can use them
together but I think Before we jump into
that Steve we have the most important
slide of the deck here and why don't you
go ahead and cover that this one's on
Steve side I don't have one of these
yeah wonderful
Oracle policy on legal disclaimers
around forward-looking statements thanks
thanks for throwing this one on me Kevin
alright so here we are Steve want to go
ahead and introduce yourself so that's
me with my daughter riding with me on my
motorcycle I'm a Java technology
ambassador talk about JavaFX technology
and also a user group leader with my
with my co-lead here keith keith is he's
come there is so we run the Silicon
Valley JavaFX user group don't you don't
you running user yeah so three of them
for me so I run the Silicon Valley job
user group the JavaScript Meetup and
also the Google developer group so very
busy with those and author a web tool
fundamentals and VP of engineering where
I'm not fooling around with the
community guys so I'm the head of HR
also that's one of the roles so we have
a lot of fun in the office anyway all
right so I want to start to kind of kick
things off and take us to how we got to
where we are today right so we started
with HTML back in 1991 a very long time
ago kind of moving forward things got a
little bit interesting with introduction
of CSS and JavaScript in 96 but at that
time we're doing kind of using tables
and things like that for layout
eventually in 2002 is where things
really kind of got it started getting
interesting where we're using CSS
correctly you know building rich
applications that look like you know
regular client applications last time
like rich desktop apps kind of kind of
yeah
then we moved into Ajax so instead of
having this entire page refresh all the
time you know you get that power of
being able to to do what Oracle often
referred to as partial page refreshes
then in 2009 which is really not that
long ago but we've come a huge way since
then
2009 was the introduction of html5 and
that's that's really where things you
know it's almost as big of a change as
what we had for web 200 with with Ajax
and what that brought to the table so
why don't I talk a little bit about what
html5 is and these are all great feature
Steve so you know we'll see if we have
these and JavaFX so anyway what is html5
and let's start with what it is not
html5 is not HTML plus CSS plus
JavaScript what it is is a next
generation of modern features and you go
through those you've got a lot of great
things you've never had the ability to
do in the web and that's offline storage
having web sequel databases index DB
caches web workers we can do multiple
threads web sockets notifications drag
and drop is is native part of html5 file
system geolocation speech input all
kinds of great things canvas audio and
video support so so I think Steve I mean
you must be really jealous if this huge
list of features that that I'm showing
you here yeah so this this feature list
is pretty impressive I'm glad I'm glad
you say html5 start 2009 2009 yes I'm
glad I'm glad you finally got to about
the level rich client technology was
around five ten years ago yes good you
guys are catching up we're catching up
but not only we catching up but I think
we're surpassing so we'll see oh yeah
so I want to start talking a little bit
about these html5 features and talk
about why you shouldn't be afraid right
so this is a demo from the html5 rocks
calm and if you go to slides html5 rocks
you can see it's a really great tutorial
recommend it to everyone it's I don't
know 50 slides roughly maybe 30 slides
and it goes through a one page demo of
all the different things that you can do
in html5 and you can look at the code
and it runs live and so I'm gonna try to
jump over to that and and get kind of a
a quick oops this up here
so this is a fun example and what you
see at the bottom or this is example of
using css3 things for doing things like
rounded corners and what you see in this
picture is we can all tell it's sort of
a picture of a cat right and if you were
to open that we need to correct that so
who knows who knows the proper name of
the Chinese anime I think that's key oh
you so even I think you set it with a
proper Chinese enunciation to write
Japanese Java or Japanese enunciation
so yeah this got little slow guy is is I
think in the US they call him Doraemon
Doraemon that's probably a really bad
pronunciation of the original Japanese
name but okay so not just a cat not just
any cat not just any cat this is a very
special cat and I'll show you why it's
special because you kind of like becomes
round in square kind of old-school to
modern so so some of the things and I
play with this with my son a lot he kind
of likes it so so you see here by
adjusting the CSS I can pull in the body
pull in the left eye and kind of make
them link at you it's kind of fun do the
right eye and it's and it's just
on-the-fly modifying the CSS there we
have all the things and eventually make
them smile but like that that's kind of
fun and what are we doing here the nose
make him bigger right the new Duke has a
much bigger nose if any of you have
noticed he's thinner and he's got a
bigger nose so there we are one eye is
like that it can kind of make him wink
and well the other one and that's kind
of really what you want you want the
rounded corners you want things to look
very nice but don't be afraid to use it
today you get a graceful degradation if
you were to open this up a nice
six you know you'd get sort of a look
here we're hoping for the network you
guys all turn your BlackBerry's off
right area and that's and that's what it
would look like so all right let me let
me repeat the snarky comment the front
the question was do you want a royalty
is to Apple to use that picture Kevin I
do yeah that's the bug I was talking
about Kevin this is gonna be interesting
we love we love our lady I know that
Steve oh here we go there we go he's
acting like he did something he didn't i
fixed it before you got here hang on
hold on here we go all right
interview we are presenters oh my god
this is not looking good all right
congratulations you know I should have
just went I'm going back to the browser
but I really should just stayed over
there but so the next thing I want to
talk about is canvas so canvas is really
great gives you a lot of features like
WebGL which lets you do 3d animation and
I'm guessing Steve will be a bit jealous
when he sees this demo though he's seen
it before but but I do think watching
the fish come at the screen and it shows
the power of what can be done in the
browser native browser kind of looking
at this demo and I think it's really
impressive so you know you don't need
necessarily to go to you know a flash or
something like that that you've done in
the past and this is all made possible
with WebGL which is basically a port of
OpenGL into the browser lighter way you
can see the fish they do really great
there's a whole lot of really cool demos
I'm nowhere near smart enough to write
something like this but this is really
exciting for me and I hope you guys so
Steve can I can I do that in JavaFX
okay that's a good question so I think I
think you are slightly ahead of what
we're doing in Java effects today so
what you can currently do with Java FX 2
is what we like to optimistically call 2
and 1/2 D you can take all of your scene
graph objects and rotate them use
perspective cameras in the 3rd dimension
which doesn't quite give you the full
capabilities of bringing in modeled and
rendered objects but if you remember the
keynote demo they showed um the loading
ship and cargo with the Navis docks as a
demonstration and that's actually
similar to this is what the next
generation of Java effects is looking
towards so so what you're saying is you
recommend folks use html5
thanks for putting words in my mouth
Kevin yeah anytime Steve so the next
thing I want to talk about is one of
these really confusing features and last
Steve if they have any great prefixes
later but
but anyway so you've got all these great
prefixes I got WebKit ones there's ie
ones there's all kinds of prefixes that
sit in front of things like the css3
transformations and you're wondering
what in the world is this why do I need
I've gone to this standard SPAC of html5
why do I need all these so I'll start
with a little background right so a few
years ago probably back in 2009 2010 I
went to lunch with Ian hick Seawright
the creator of html5 and I said what
what's the main goal of html5 there's a
lot of new features there's a lot of
things going on here you know what were
you really setting to go out and do and
what his answer was
was it he wanted to fully define spec he
wanted when you added a tag it does
exactly what it says it's gonna do when
you did JavaScript and you did unusual
things that you weren't necessarily
supposed to do it should be fully
specified exactly what should be
happening exactly what the behavior is a
simple example would be you know with
arrays what happens with the trailing
comma right what is the length is it one
more is is it one less is it undefined
at the end things like that and and so
really what he's setting out to do is is
to take things like dojo things like
jQuery things like Yui and a lot of what
their goal was was ie did one miss
implementation Firefox did another miss
implementation Chrome had a Miss
implementation and everybody's browsers
on the same code behaved a little bit
differently so you had things like
jQuery really great thing that would let
you write your code once and it would
perform consistently across all browsers
kind of sounds like a VM or something
right C so you mean that HTML doesn't
HTML Javascript don't behave the same
every well they sure don't behave the
same back in 96 I can tell you that or
seven or eight and unfortunately even ie
9 so folks folks love IE 10 but even I a
you get these these these these many
many problems so prefixes caused a lot
of confusion and what they are is this
ability for you to test out their
implementation today and you code too
this you can almost consider this to be
a draft version of their implementation
and then those prefixes will disappear
and this will just say text fill color
or column count rather than WebKit's
attempt at that and it also means that
in many cases the spec is in draft form
but we don't want to make you wait we
want to make it available to you
immediately and so that's what prefixes
are all about so skew do I get to have
fun with prefixes and JavaFX
well I mean we do have this ubiquitous
runtime called the Java Virtual Machine
and you know I'm gonna Java Java code
actually on different platforms works
exactly the same so you can write it on
Mac you can write it on Windows and you
can even run it on Linux and you get the
same behavior good
very good I'm gonna keep bouncing it
over to Steve and see if we catch them
sleeping over there all right so so
cross browsers like I talked about
jQuery Yui all these things really help
and make it an unambiguous spec right or
you know html5 is making a non ambiguous
spec and I want to show you a little
demo here with or with the acid test so
I know if any of you have heard about
the acid test
but it's really a test of browsers to
look at how well they implement the spec
right and so this is all for HTML for
stuff acid test 3 and you can see their
older versions this is a screenshot I
found on the web you can see 20 out of
100 tests passed in Firefox 72 out of
100 Safari a hundred chrome 100 and
opera who was always considered to be
the big leader in html5 and
standardization back there with an 85 so
so I'm gonna jump over and and show that
to you guys was full of good ideas all
right so here's the acid3 test I'm gonna
refresh it you can watch the count go up
and we have 100% success nice so that
means that you actually have a browser
which follows the HTML standard one more
time so the fact that you have it what
do you even have one
here we go when you do that a year ago
and you were fresh even in chrome you
only get 99 percent but anyway I think
it's really great so so you should try
out things like your blackberry and
watch it get like a 10 let's hope it
starts from this slide I think it well
if it even comes up here we go so jQuery
if you haven't tried jQuery it's a
really great thing you know I think if
we're going 100 percent html5 I think
you can code without things like jQuery
but that's definitely not possible right
there's a lot of old things that you
needed to support even even new new
stuff some of the iterators and things
some of the stuff that they do with
selectors make things a lot easier but
here's a chart that shows this just
massive massive adoption of jQuery so
this shows 56% of top 10,000 websites
actually use jQuery today so this is a
really exciting even james gosling loves
jiang james gosling loves jQuery
although he doesn't think he could build
a swing app in canvas I don't know he
was definitely pushing the swing keep it
alive but anyway so so if you haven't
tried jQuery it's a great tool you
should take take a look at it
jQuery UI jQuery Mobile very good thing
so here I want to give kind of an
example of jQuery you know and I'll jump
back out into a demo so those of you who
haven't seen jazz fiddle before it's a
really great tool that lets you kind of
take some piece of code up here so my
name is oops sorry
always Kevin and I push to run I apply
some JavaScript to it I apply some CSS
which I've actually done here in
JavaScript with jQuery and I run it and
my name is now always Kevin Nelson right
hey Kevin Wiese why is my name it pink
well well that was your favorite color
right you turned
Circle our team red team pink whatever
it's it's Steve's favorite color his he
always has different interpretations of
thing but well we'll walk through the
example here you've got some regular
HTML we're looking for dot right so so
does anybody know what the dot is that
stands for class so which CSS class so
you want a style as Steve and you want
to take the background color and set its
a Steve's favorite background color
which is pink that's what he wears a
blue bike outfit I think but then after
that we're gonna do something a little
bit more advanced so this is called
chaining right so you know in Java we've
got all this kind of getter and setter
nonsense that you know when you call
setters it's a void function but but
here in JavaScript the functions in
jQuery you're able to do chaining
because they read this is this kind of
like Java effects builders it very much
is
yeah I got it very much yeah so so here
in this example we look at the thing
style with the class Kevin and set the
background to be yellow grab its parent
which is the entire sentence my name is
always Kevin and where we out here we're
going to make it blue and then do an end
which is kind of like a pop off the
stack right because you're you're
basically querying the result that you
already have and end gives you the
ability to pop then you set the italic
font which only goes to Kevin because
that was the last selector and then we
make the font be red so it's kind of a
nice thing we're in a single line you
can knock out all that styling if you
were doing this and like a traditional
swing thing it would I don't know that
you would ever you like fit that on one
slide so so it's a really cool demo you
can make the changes and I think for
Steve we'll we'll bump them up to red
here and there we go all right my boss
would be happy now there we go yeah that
is not quite the right marketing shade
of wrapper or I got the wrong get the
wrong font look at the marketing people
to give us the right code yeah and it's
not Steve's presenting with me it's
Oracle that's presenting
so there we go all right back to the
slides back to the fine all right so we
talked about all these older browsers
right and we talked about oh gosh you
know how difficult it is to to make
things work correctly in all of them and
so I want to introduce something called
Chrome Frame
so what Chrome Frame is is it allows you
to take IE and in run chrome inside of
IE so the user never knows it runs as an
ActiveX control and it's and it's kind
of fullscreen inside of it and your your
user thinks she's running IE but he's
actually using Chrome you can use all
the you know your grandmother on her ie6
like old windows 2 mm machine whatever
whatever she has back there you don't
you don't have to be afraid to use html5
right so you add one simple tag at the
top of your page and you can have Chrome
Frame you can have the choice of saying
if it's there let's use it which is what
I do you know I say a lot of times for
for like I ate I'll say if it's there go
ahead and use it if it's not I don't
want to prompt but if you're using ie6
like my site there's no way in hell it's
even going to come close to working so I
go ahead and prompt the dialog and say
would you like to install this they say
no then we we send him I don't know we
send them to like to read I don't know
Steve on Java or something so yeah
another thing I want to talk about is a
tool called moderniser many of you know
Paul Irish she's kind of famous guy on
the jquery team a lot of fun and he's
one of the guys on moderniser and really
what it is is as it's looking at feature
detection rather than looking at user
agents right and so this is really a lot
of the future of how we determine what
features your browser has available
rather than trying to sniff a header
parse it up and determine what things
are so so I talked about jQuery a lot
but there's another tool out there
called bootstrap from Twitter that you
guys should look at it was you know you
see this is
github most popular watch repositories
and this is an older and older picture
here but you know you've heard a node
you've heard of rails you've heard of
jQuery
well bootstrap has more people watching
it than any of those and it's really
exciting it's it's very much around CSS
and responsive design which I'm going to
show you next one of the things that it
does and it's a really great tool a lot
of their ideas is about making all this
possible without any JavaScript so it's
a really great tool we should you should
check it out and kind of look toward the
future with with bootstrap there's a lot
of exciting things coming there so here
I want to show kind of a quick demo of
responsive UI and I think I always
thought that this was Steve on this
website but I'm not I'm not sure I'll
let him answer that and I have no idea
what this website means or does it's in
a language that's that I don't
understand I think it's French
but somebody can tell me afterwards what
this is all about but what you see is
you see this sort of menuing up here
something about the earth and then as I
resize the browser boom you get
something completely different so it's
the same codebase depending on how wide
things are so if you look at what is it
going to look like on an iPhone or a
Linux mobile device this is what you're
going to see what is it going to look
like in a browser thanks for doing me a
favor there yes yes I don't want to get
us in trouble Steve and/or if you know
and you can go out wider and make a
whole different viewed for a Retina
display or wide screen so it's kind of
fun but the coolest thing about this
website is the hoops is the guest
appearance from Steve here in the oh he
switched the keys on me oh oh he didn't
switch the keys on me I don't know I was
gonna zoom in for you guys I'll have to
do that on your own so responsive design
is definitely kind of the wave of the
future for what we have there so the
next thing I want to talk about is
blending multiple technologies together
kind of using the best of each
and one of the techniques this is a an
iPhone app I did a really long time ago
it was basically a location-based chat
thing and it was designed for things
like conferences where we could do a
chat and chat with those within 100
yards of us so it'd be just within those
here or within the building I have no
idea if this is running anymore and it
was a free app so it was a lot of fun
but but I I doubt you can find that if
you go and look well what's what's
interesting about it is there's a few
things one is we have a lot of styling
of text that we wanted to do here and
you know we wanted to make links
hyperlinks and read and all these things
and underlines and bolding of who said
things and for things like iPhone the
the best way to do that is with a UI
webview and so that's what we kind of
did here the other thing I wanted to do
was take a lot of the knowledge I had in
common in WebSockets and make that
available for push and so that's that's
that's what I did kind of here was I
actually implemented the the chat within
within JavaScript so that's kind of fun
so you can actually mix web technologies
with native I think we might be able to
use that yeah yeah so this idea has been
around a really long time taking the
best of the web getting an iPhone
getting the app store you know using mix
matching a little bit of the objective-c
a little bit of html5 and it really kind
of pull things together to do that so
before we kind of change gears I want to
I want to just close with how exciting
it is to see this green line finally
cross the blue line right so I don't
know if any of you are aware but html5
is here and alive today chrome is the
Green Line blue is the internet exploder
so the internet exploded is now got less
usage than what chrome does so you take
Chrome's usage put it together with all
your Android all your iPhone everybody
is using WebKit and I think WebKit is
really the key to the whole success
there
of having this one implementation that's
shared by all the browsers that really
implements things well and looks great
so so I'm really excited about you know
seeing Chrome kind of make it possible
for us all to be out there using html5
today how many Chrome users are there
out here clap your hands
Safari any Safari users Oh a couple
couple they don't like to clap though
that's okay anybody's still using
Firefox I like Firefox yeah there we go
there we go other guys like to clap very
good and in any II's no no don't clap
don't do not anyone no we don't want to
this session yeah yeah that's a bad idea
that's one of the things you don't talk
about okay so anyway I'm gonna pass
things off to Steve and hopefully we can
have some fun with Steve all right so
Kevin Kevin was talking about WebKit and
technologies that use WebKit on on
mobile and desktop and actually what I'm
going to talk about JavaFX toooo
happens to be another platform which
leverages WebKit we actually have a
webview component which is based on the
open source WebKit libraries in addition
to that you also have all of the media
graphics charting controls all the
things which you've come to expect from
Java client technologies and you also
get very fast performance where you know
the JVM and hardware acceleration from
your graphics card so all of your 2d and
3d graphics are fully accelerated and
now that Java FX 2 is based on all Java
API so you can you can use any of your
favorite IDE so what's your what's your
favorite idea Kevin you know I like them
all Steve so so on a daily basis I use
Eclipse I use a version of it called STS
I'll let you guys all guess what that is
but it's a really nice version of
Eclipse and that's what I like to do my
daily development in but sometimes I
write a whole lot of JavaScript in and
when I do
the code completion or the code
completion is okay but the the
formatting is really really bad so then
I open it up in NetBeans so that I can
format my code which is kind of fun it
doesn't happen very often usually like
so you are you saying you use a Java IDE
to develop Java Script yes I do yes and
then actually when I'm like really
stumped and I and I have like picking up
something that I haven't done in a long
time
actually use IntelliJ because the the
autocomplete stuff is like a whole lot
nicer but definitely I'm an eclipse user
that's what I really like formatting is
really great and NetBeans and
autocomplete intellisense is what they
call it is best IntelliJ so I don't know
what to tell you guys that I hope you
have a lot of memory on your laptop
because yeah yeah so I actually I use a
bunch of ID's as well although the idea
I'll be showing you guys today's
NetBeans you can use you can code JavaFX
and Eclipse
IntelliJ JDeveloper your ID of choice
and writing a Java FX application to
display web content is this easy this is
a full Java FX application that creates
a stage a stage is a window adds a scene
to it and then populates it with a
webview off of a website so let's so
stupid that doesn't look like the Java
FX and I remember from two years ago no
you're right this looks very comfortable
to me as a guy who's done a lot of
swings so yeah so there used to you used
to be a custom scripting language and
that was a requirement to develop John
with expert now it's all pure Java code
so you can use your existing IDs and
technologies with your Java FX code we
even have that great setter in there so
I love that yeah oh
NetBeans come on picture they're not
responding oh my god all right so so
sometimes when your ID doesn't agree
with you you restart it all right and
then and then it's all better that ever
happened to you with your with your with
the clips oh all the time oh yeah I mean
you know they're all the same that's why
I have three of them going at once
and you know there's a fourth one that
comes into the mix is when I really get
stuck with that JavaScript and I go over
and ask the really smart JavaScript
developers they pull it up in VI so yeah
you know I never I've actually never had
VI crash on me yet yeah and I'm like
envious because they're like so happy
and they're smiling and I don't I don't
get it but but it's it's it is what it
is you know okay so here's the the same
code running in NetBeans and let's let's
kick off this project as a little test
and show you guys what you can do with a
single file that's that's a feature the
Java flex guys are laughing because we
all hate it but that's a feature all
right and now it's it's using the very
fast internet connection here at the UM
look at that the hill tend to be some
familiar faces at the top yeah yeah we
know a few we know Martin and some other
people I should know here's here's got a
lot to learn before next year yeah yeah
thanks Kevin
thanks for reminding me yeah so and it's
a full WebKit browser so you can you can
navigate links and Traverse arounds and
display full web content within the
context of a Java fix application so let
me let me talk quickly about some of the
API switch which make this all possible
to integrate with your Java FX app
that's the backup slide just in case in
case the network is not so happy and you
know just to remind you guys this is
Steve showing you how you can use the
great power of html5 within the JavaFX
applications so yeah that's thanks for
explaining that Kevin yeah yeah so you
can also call JavaScript from your java
code simply this this creates a alert
and then calls engine execute script and
you can execute any arbitrary JavaScript
code you want from with the context of
your Java FX application to I'll show an
example of this but script different
behavior on the page using JavaScript
you can also call back the other
direction so how many of you have used
live Connect in the past right it's a No
thing that would let you kind of from
JavaScript call into applets a lot of
the same kind of idea where you get
these two technologies talking to each
other but we're all used to that applet
this is sort of Reverse with the job on
the outside nature yeah so live connect
guys will appreciate the next slide but
this this is a streamlined API for
calling back into Java so a quick
example of a Java FX application was
exposed as the exit method of Java FX
calls in and then gets the window object
and sets an appt member on the
application and because Java scripts
untyped
you can now call any methods on your
java objects you've injected so we've
injected app and in our page we can
click a little cradle button here or a
link which is going to exit the
application so you can do this by
directional communication between your
your Java FX and your JavaScript code
and here's an example of some of the
type conversions they're all because of
the nice dynamic language that you have
a JavaScript so at the expense of yes so
most of these are fairly straightforward
javascript has some types which don't
exist in Java
like undefined and also anyone who's
used the live connect API should
recognize a little netscape javascript
j/s objects reference here for the
wrapper object return to legend get
access to the die I do have a puzzler
question for folks would the string
undefined be equal to undefined in
JavaScript does anybody know I honestly
do not know the answer but I look at
this slide wondering if those are
equivalent in JavaScript so I know that
one in the string 1 are equivalent so
there's some really good JavaScript
puzzlers yes yes there are you could
write I think you could write like a
like a encyclopedia I mean you know josh
bloch has a book of Java puzzlers but
you're an encyclopedia of JavaScript yes
yeah all right so also if you think
about what Java FEX is acting as its
acting as a browser to the content so
you get callbacks for any time someone
does an alert or confirm or prompt in
the JavaScript code resizes the wind
tries to pop status visibility or do a
pop up all of these things will message
back your JavaFX application and you can
choose what action you'd like to take
for for example for pop up you might
just not implement it because you don't
really like pop ups does anyone like pop
ups yeah no you're probably really bad
implement unimplemented but it's helpful
to be able to respond to all these
events as an application whenever your
JavaScript code notifies you have
changes so I think I think we need show
an example of some of this so we have
the first use case I have two different
use cases I'm going to share with you
guys one is how can we take these
technologies kind of leverage the best
of the web and the best of Java effects
and not write a lot of code and
everyone's favorite favorite application
is a you know is the Google Maps except
for the iPhone 5 users that seem like a
bad idea
but I would love to have Google Maps
inside of my JavaFX applications yeah so
see if we can make that happen cats do
it Steve all right so here's a simple
Java FX application it's only it's only
100 lines of code I'm not gonna go
through it in detail but it's will be on
my blog so you can see we're creating a
scene here setting the title to Java
conference store and saying the width
and height and showing it calling down
to the create map method which populates
a few things and one of the ones here
create web view so the entire create web
View method is four lines five lines
with the return and it creates the web
view points it to our local HTML content
we're actually publishing an HTML file
with the app and also puts a nice little
JavaFX reflection effect on it that
would have been four lines in JavaScript
Steve because returns are optional
thanks thanks Kevin and then we're also
populating a bunch of conferences with
latitude longitude and probably the most
important part here is we have a
navigate method which is going to call
execute script and invoke the move map
method in our JavaScript code which is
shown here this is just you know
straight up
Maps API and I wrote the move map yeah
yeah this this is this is Kevin's
handiwork did you do this in Eclipse or
um or NetBeans I did on your computer
Steve so it was probably JDeveloper yeah
okay so you know to you notes what the
chances of that are but we won't talk
about that on stage all right so let's
let's give this all a petroi all right
Java conference tour for the demo gods
hasn't failed us yet not yet best part
all right all right so there we've got
JavaOne conference you click on this
area and it goes down to different
conferences so and that on the left is
JavaFX yeah the left side here is a Java
effects control as we go through the
accordion pane we're flipping on the
right here is a full-featured Google
Maps yeah okay so we this is where
somewhere around here right I'm gonna
switch to satellite view and you can
even see the reflection effect on the
bottom so so what do you guys think
pretty yeah there we are
pretty good mix of technologies
alright I've got one other technology
time I want to share with you guys
because you know HTML is good for
delivering contents in the web browser
but sometimes I mean they have this new
Apple AppStore Windows market you you
wanna you might actually want to get
those apps on the desktop which it's
really easy to do with Java effects we
have native packaging support it creates
he exceeds and dmg files and rpms for
Linux but how do you get your web app on
the desktop alright so you're saying I
don't have to use Web Start anymore if I
don't want to Steve yeah you I would
rather you not use web starter yeah yeah
yeah actually good alright so this is a
another small example and this is
actually running embedded GlassFish so
GlassFish has an embedded version with
cool api's you can you can launch it
directly GlassFish is packaged up with
the application kicks up a little server
we're loading a URL in a webview here
so pointing to the local instance we've
kicked up loading a URL and I'm running
the Vaadin mobile male demo you guys
familiar with Vaadin so GWT based Java
EE framework pretty pretty cool for you
know demos those guys and other UI stuff
so let's see let's see if we can get
this running as a as an application here
and this is this is bleeding edge stuff
so this is where you start praying Kevin
I didn't write any of this I don't have
to pray this is where you start getting
your own your in mocking ready your
knocks at me so you can see we're
starting GlassFish in the back in the
same process
loading java effects and we have there
we go in box so looks you know looks
kind of like a desktop app it's actually
running in a desktop window and I have
one more thing to show you guys I didn't
want to be one up to my Kevin
he put all this like responsive UI stuff
in the talk and you know we you can also
do responsive urs in Java EE there we go
so so let's resize the window here and
if you you get it to a phone form factor
oh look at that very all right what do
you guys think so a little a little
background on Vaadin well while Steve is
is working here it's based on the GWT
the Google web toolkit it lets you write
Java and basically you're writing Java
which generates JavaScript so basically
you're passing your domain objects or
your model objects across the wire
you're writing Java for the the browser
side and writing it for the server side
it's all very nice html5 web - oh you
know you notice Yanis would be proud of
you for that little bit so I was a GWT
fan for a while and it feels very much
like swing which feels very you know
Kevin you're the HTML guy all right so
you have a few events you wanted to talk
about yeah yeah so if you're sticking
around through the weekend I highly
recommend Silicon Valley code camp so
I'm one of the organizers of that
conference and you know it was it's
gonna be very big last year we had 2,200
people it's a free conference it's not
too late to sign up it's right in the
middle of Silicon Valley down at
Foothill College October 6th and 7th and
I know Steve will be presenting there's
a whole slew of Oracle people we've got
I think it was like 230 sessions so I
made the schedule for that and the
badges and it's a whole lot of fun and
it's a lot of those sessions you've seen
here that you missed because there's 30
sessions going on at once we've got 25
going on there yeah and it's all it's
all community around witches which is
nice I'm a big community fan people
people putting up things running it and
doing it for free so that's awesome and
then the next event is the dev fest from
the Google developer group so I run the
Silicon Valley Google developer group
well we're having a conference for 400
people down at Google headquarters in
Mountain View so if you're in the area
you should check that out and Java user
groups that Steve and I run were done so
well Google really liked that model they
came asked Van Riper and I if we would
start a program around that and now
there's 250 300 and maybe 300 groups
around the world so it's a great
difficult and quite quick announcement
yeah not as exciting Steve yeah okay
thanks for the leading Kevin so I talked
about this briefly at the keynote but
I'm gonna be touring this is actually my
tour map you can you can see the full
route on night hacking calm and I'm
going to be cruising around Europe
between October 29th and November 11th
actually live-streaming everything from
my little camera rigs so you can watch
it live on Ustream and will be
interacting with the audience so I'll be
sitting with some of these folks hacking
working on Java effects Java EE HTML
technologies and Steve does know all
these folks and will be will be having a
good time so join us at night hacking
calm and thank you guys for coming huh
