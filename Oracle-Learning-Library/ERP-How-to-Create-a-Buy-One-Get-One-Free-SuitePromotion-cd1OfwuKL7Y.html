to create a buy one get one free or BOGO
promotion using sweet promotions in
NetSuite you will see how to configure
the promotion and apply it on a
transaction and the discount they will
provide the customer
sweet promotions allow you to create
several types of promotions such as item
order or shipping type promotions a BOGO
promotion is an item type promotion
which means you can offer your customers
discounts on specific items included in
an order these promotions create line
level discounts for each item defined on
the promotion a BOGO promotion
specifically means a customer is
eligible for a 100 percent discount on a
specific item when there by a minimum
number of that item typical taglines for
such promotions would be buy one t-shirt
and get one t-shirt for free or two for
the price of one on t-shirts in our
example we will stick with the t-shirt
promotion so a customer will buy a
t-shirt and get another t-shirt for free
the buy conditions always specify the
item that must be included in the
transaction in order to be eligible for
the promotion and how many of that item
must be bought for a BOGO this will
always be one if you want to create a
promotion that offers a free t-shirt
when you buy two t-shirts or full price
the quantity will be two and so on
the gate conditions for a BOGO promotion
will always specify the item that the
customer will get for free these types
of promotions are always percentage off
promotions rather than flat promotions
and the value of the discount will
always be 100 percent let's take a quick
look at some typical scenarios and what
the customer can expect to receive
depending on what they add to their
shopping cart so we can see that if the
customer has one t-shirt in the cart
they will not be eligible for the
discount as the one t-shirt will have to
be paid for however if they add a second
t-shirt to the cart they will be
eligible for the 100 percent discount on
the second item if they add 6 t-shirts
to the cart half of them will be for
free so let's take a closer look at how
to create our BOGO promotion in NetSuite
using sweet promotions to create any
type of new promotion click lists
marketing promotions and select new the
new promotions landing page opens where
you can select the type of promotion you
want to create in our example we want to
create an item type promotion so click
item promotion and the item promotion
form opens in the basic properties
section we give our promotion a name and
description
our promotion does not need to be
scheduled nor do we want to make the
promotion exclusive but we can make it
automatically applied for more
information on these promotion options
please refer to the promotion's help in
NetSuite select a discount item for
accounting purposes we're ready to enter
the buy conditions for the promotion in
the what the customer needs to by
section select the spend a minimum order
amount or buy specific items option
check the specific items box and in the
item list to select t-shirts and click
Add check the apply the discount every
time the following number of units are
bought at full price box and in the
units field enter 1
now let's complete the gate conditions
in the what the customer will get
section enter 100 in the discount rate
field and leave the percentage options
selected again add a t-shirt from the
items list
you can choose to add the discount to
the cheapest or most expensive t-shirts
in the cart in our example we will
select cheapest item now we need to
create a coupon code for this promotion
on the coupon code sub tab we want a
multiple use coupon code that can be
used any number of times by any number
of customers and we enter a t-shirt BOGO
in the coupon code field this code will
be added to a transaction to apply the
discount we will not set any limits
regarding the type of customer that can
use the promotion where the promotion
can be used or how many times it can be
used so we click Save and our promotion
has been created
now let's apply the promotion to an
eligible transaction when any customer
adds any two t-shirts to a transaction
the BOGO promotion will be automatically
applied to the transaction and discount
100% of the price of the cheapest
t-shirt in the order
we can see the discount here on the
items sub tab immediately and at the
subtotal we can see the customer is only
being charged for one t-shirt and on the
promotion sub tab we can see the
promotion has been applied we have seen
how to create a buy one get one free
sweet promotion and how it is
automatically applied to an eligible
transaction thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
