session about arduino java me and
bluetooth this kind of integration how
many of you attendee our session on
Tuesday about a java me okay so we have
some different slides but we are going
to show more code then compare it to
tuesday but the main concepts is the
same and how many of you already work at
our triad arduino board oh nice coo nice
okay so our team we are three developers
in Brazil I am Venetia singer here
Marcelo quinta and we also have met
Maddon NATO could could could not be
here because he is working for a big
company now and he can't give talks here
so I work used to work much more with
Java EE and I went to maker faire like
40 years ago and going to make her fair
that fair put me crazy and i said i am
the wrong job and doing the wrong job I
want to have more fun and now I have
more fun I am more happy but I have less
money
it's good to to mix both things Java EE
and robotics and everything because our
money came from Java EE but Marcelo he
is the guy who is working in Brazil with
mobile applications in general so we put
our knowledge together to present this
kind of hacking that we are doing with
robotics and home automation stuff and
so we are going to make a brief very
brief introduction about our do you know
since most of the audience all right I
know about we are going to show how to
integrate Java ME devices with Arduino
using bluetooth and we have some demos
and we have an hour here to this talk so
we can open some arduino code some java
new code base it on the time that we
have at the end of this talk so that's
the Agena introduction arduino bluetooth
demos and that's it ok so we have a
large number of good good old devices
that are stewing in use in many
countries especially BRIC countries we
have a large number of not rich people
not poor people but not rich people that
have a high end phone like Android
iPhone that they want to buy Java me
application so features feature phone we
we see Nokia trying to to improve the
store the online store to this kind of
people and we have a new possibilities
with open source hardware so you can
have a lot of fun with Arduino Raspberry
Pi blue computer
and Java me because Java me had a lot of
resource like display gps bluetooth
Wi-Fi and if you put together our do you
know if java me you can save a lot of
money avoid buying this kind of
expensive components for arduino
especially Wi-Fi gps is not is not is
not cheap yet so remembering the polar
computer so NASA lands in the moon using
this kind of computer and so it's a very
good information to see how strong can
be a Java me device so you can go to the
moon using a Java me device but we used
to play angry birds with pod core
feature device so it's crazy world
nowadays you can go to the moon and
tweet it tweet from there from the area
that's it 30 so and we have a big market
and we have today more than 3 billion
fonts that runs java me in the world
second there is the Oracle site you can
you can go there and see text 3 billion
Fonz's it's good right as you can see
here java me is not operating system
right the platform that some operating
systems yeah give support to java me
like symbian OS like bada like Sony
Ericsson blackberry OS to
ring ring Oh dry as you can see here we
are not so smaller than iOS and Android
oh you have an iOS you have android cool
but probably you also have a Java me
device in your pocket Oh your closet
anyway okay the market share from 2011
symbian right order 55 dot two percent
school android 22 iOS 17 dot one bill so
the main main thing here is people are
not buying java me cell phones but but
still using it we have a another IT
department in your pocket maybe with
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS Apollo 11 didn't
have it we have E and we have a new type
of consumer what is type of customer us
we do not pro its device easily we all I
will not throw am I in night five I like
it it's cool i can make photos i can use
gps why are you throwing away in a buy
an apple by android oh I can't buy an
apple and android phone but I can carry
on my my n95 with me I can do a lot of
good things with it an example using
Arduino so mm I do you know is very
famous project since the last five years
is open source is not java and we can't
run java inside our do you know but it's
okay everybody saw james gosling talking
about see cold and they're running
inside my dismal microcontroller so
Arduino is mostly used to control motors
and read sensors and
two basic operations but we really need
for bigger projects we really need more
power of processing so that's the idea
to integrate arduino with some other
computer like a java me or Java Sea and
you can do that it's hard to plug a
motor into your laptop so arduino is the
bridge between the physical world and
your laptop or your device and is
intended for artists designers hobbyists
than anyone else it's very simple we can
see here an arduino are doing is based
on this microcontroller hm a guy 30 28
you can do the PCB by yourself if you
want or you don't need you don't need
the PCB you can use a proto board to
have an Arduino if you want so in Brazil
we have popular schools with poor kids
and we teach how to build their own
Arduino board and very inexpensive and
we don't need to import and pay taxes
and that's the idea and the other thing
about our do you know is that arduino
boards used to be strong when you are
using arm-based board you need to take
care about the microcontroller is much
more sensible and depending on the
project if you are dealing with students
kids and everything else it's better to
have something strong arduino help
limited resource we have 20 ports analog
digital we have spi I to see ports but
with some limitations inside that ports
like if you are aging temperature sensor
like
35 using Arduino and you need to have
many regions from that sensor you may
have a problem you need to delay the
readings because it had the conversion
from naila log to digital take some time
so if you have many analog components in
arduino you may have problem so our do
you know is mostly used to do just one
thing two sensors and now another thing
three responsibilities too much for
Arduino projects the default language is
whiting which is based on C++ which is a
language that would like to be Java but
but it's not you know so if you tell
someone that now this is java and put
put a 2 developer arduino code you can
add you can you will believe that it's
java but it's not but it's a real-time
microcontroller at least we have the
board here it's pretty simple we have
two microcontrollers actually we have
the USB serial converter the f key to 32
we have the io digital pins the
microcontroller a SAT button we have the
power supply with five votes three votes
and the analog ports and we have a power
jack that you can supply the arduino
board with external source our source
different types of arduino that's the a
good a good part of arduino having
different boards all around the world
actually china love this idea because
they have 12 different ports that they
are producing china
and this idea of open source hardware is
very useful because like in Brazil is
very expensive to import stuffs from
here from China or any other country so
we start to produce our own Arduino that
this one is the black one is our Arduino
is a bigger one but we already have
components to drive two motors we have a
AG bridge we have four transistors that
you can ASSU command a step motor or
anything else we have temperature sensor
and we have a light sensor also so it's
very easy to build a robot using our
board if you are using a regular do you
know you need to plug additional boards
that use its color dash arduino shoot
and the project can get more complex and
more wired if you are not using a
complete board we have the arduino mega
which is used by google google or do you
know is based on the Arduino mega and we
have that one the small one is a lily
pad which is an Arduino too I for
clothes so you can you can do a special
jacket for blind people using this
platform so Arduino is not perfect when
you are hardworking we far do you know
you have library help problem so you
miss it jars you know classpath and you
don't have how to debug or do you know
we don't have the debug process is very
primitive and sometimes you out that you
have to debug is a multimeter and the
microcontroller and then check that the
levels changing on the microcontroller
that's it
so why to use Arduino and Java me
together the LCD display is very nice
when you want to use a LCD display we
further you know the options that you
have in the market used to be expensive
and they they use many of your digital
ports and sometimes you can have problem
to put a display with another shield and
you have library problem so sometimes
you put the display on Arduino and
assault that you are going to do if they
are doing to use the display so when you
are putting together their do you know
and Java me you free arduino from this
kind of job and to use the gps arduino
has a very small memory to to to store
data so it's very good idea if you are
doing a robot that is exploring an
environment and walking through and
storing the data you will not have
enough memory to do that you will need
an SD shoot to store the data into an SD
shield so it's another shield with the
motor shoot and everything else so if
you have the the phone you can ride the
data in the phone and the phone can send
the date of using Wi-Fi to the cloud so
the phone is a very nice bridge for
arduino text message 3g how to integrate
our do you know with java me if you are
using i think that the next year's will
be the Wi-Fi will be much more easy to
deal cheaper and less power consumed
consumption for the next year's i don't
know if you have the opportunity to see
the electric imp from sparkfun is an SD
card this is an SD card
phenom ii embedded and it has Wi-Fi so
it's very nice board they just launched
two weeks ago I bought one and I'm crazy
too back to Brazil and start to use that
so Wi-Fi will be an option but nowadays
is easy to integrate using bluetooth
bluetooth is very inexpensive module you
can buy here in US starts in ten dollar
and the modem are expensive is like
seventy dollars and you can have who
either the integration especially when
you are dealing with another device like
a Sun sport or some other board java me
bored like Centurion microchip that they
announced it during the keynote so you
can integrate Arduino with this kind of
ship using I to see we did this kind of
integration with if I to see if someone
is working a project to do that please
send us an email and I can provide my
code my my trips and tea tips for how to
integrate Arduino with some Java ME
board using i2c spi is also supported on
Arduino but SP I had a disadvantage to
use for digital ports from the 92 I
think that is 9 9 10 11 and 12 so you
are going to spend four ports but using
for digital ports you have a faster
communication compare it to HSC and I
just see is very old protocol very very
old protocol but it's very useful or you
can use on USB host device like your
your board from sparkfun is another
option if you want to host the the Java
ME phone as a device into your Arduino
but the code will be much
more complex compare it to the other
options but this I oh you're bored is
that the one that Google used to
integrate Android to Arduino so you can
use the same board to do the same thing
with Java me phones so let's go to the
action for to integrate Arduino in Java
me we have to work in both sides in
Arduino side we can use a bluetooth
module bluetooth module is very simple
there's four pins round power in our
area rxtx are you XD X wired to Arduino
and grounding and power to it's easily
we we connect them George we know ink we
can make serial connections okay the
price let's talk about it about money
and not jumps sparkfun cells that blues
me blue Smith silver and gold $39 the
from for the silver and 6540 gold goats
better good they days they say that go
this a 100 matters mirrors oh we don't
think so but we also can use a bluetooth
be or are doing the Bluetooth Bluetooth
would be in the left that one are doing
a bluetooth in the middle is the aboard
with Bluetooth inside it and and seed
studio this decide also sells our
Arduino module and arduino board q if
bluetooth yeah do they sell this one yes
and this talk we you use it this one is
the blue is mere from a spark from k
we are big fans from sparkfun Ian yeah
is our paradise in Brazil is the
sparkfun website soon as you can see in
the code is very simple first we open
serial connection on the set up serial
connection serial connection and then in
the loop we receive data we receive data
every time receive data you read them
update the counter and we have the
leader okay it's very very simple this
kind of delay can be trick when you are
dealing with serial simple serial
communication we fought on any type of
control so take care with the delays
that you are putting and when you are
reading data if you don't put the delay
you will not be able to read this data
because is a serial simple serial
communication was a problem that we had
here in Arduino side and in the Java me
side too in Java me side we are talking
about Bluetooth right so you are talking
about jsr 82 jsr 82 is supported by a
lot of Java me devices not all of them
okay you can verify this who are you RL
jsr 82 list there's a list of the other
device that supports jsr 82 it depends
only on sale to see two modes you can
use a clock as a client or as a server
it have push registry enabled it's nice
and supports for protocols air have comm
is like a serial connection serial
connection you use it in our project sdp
l2cap and OBX there is a device and
services first you look the devices and
then you
as the device what service it provides
okay it is the API of the Java me for
Bluetooth online class implementation
simple process first find service find
device sorry first you have to find
device or device file found okay let's
find the service provided then you can
open connection and have fun the
interface is very simple for methods
device discovered service discovered
sorry search completed inquire completed
the first to find device the the second
the third and the fourth to find service
and open connection after inquire
completed ok and Arduino plus Java me
connection how how how I did it let's
show a demo we have this first demo we
already do just this demos during this
week but here we are using a nokia e71
the blue is move silver I have both lose
me silver and gold and I would recommend
you to buy the silver because the price
of the gold don't just fighter the
resource that you are going to they said
100 meters but it is possible for the
frequence that blue to fuse to to reach
100 meter and so and we in our board we
are we also have a bluetooth connector
the Bluetooth connector in our board is
prepared for this sparkfun module it
already do the the cross cable because
you need to put our eggs from the
bluetooth module into the TX of arduino
board so it's much more simple so
marcello will connect to the robot here
the robot is is right down
here sorry is not big as the pomona
robot is is a junior roller and I'm
going to use a camera to show the the
application after a Marcello demonstrate
the robot you can you can play with the
robot a little bit just to show that the
demo is working not so far Marcelo not
so far I think that we can we can do the
test here after the talk so it's very
simple it was a very simple hack to do
like we spent a two or three days to
write all the code that you are seeing
here so it's nice it's a very rich
remote control here yes yes sure sure
wow we have some adjuvant said students
like 13 years old and they are doing a
very good job very good job and they are
using exactly this platform and they won
a contest for the robot that do
explorations and everything else and it
was amazing experience because I teach
this specifically students how to use
pointers in C++ and it was kind of Wow
now we woke my door now I'm going to do
anything that I want I said that ok you
will see the light merry enough a horse
oh yes yes our a year with for students
is specific for the students is true
because sometimes Lego is very user in
Brazil Lego is very use it mindstorms
yeah so they already have many years and
so we are using this kind of robot to a
continuous development experience of
this kind of student so with a post Lego
Mindstorm platform that's it and we did
a framework for the robot specific for
Arduino robot with a programming
language in Portuguese okay with a
programming language in Portuguese so
the students can can write code in
Portuguese and is no no it's just a kind
of library father do you know that
sometime sunday will be a programming
language a full programming language
actually we would like to do some kind
of adapter chief programming language
where the students could change the
programming language by themselves so
they can use the verbs that they want
they they used to use so that's the
project we need we just need more time
to do that let's show the the interface
here in the Java EE application
here we go
so you can see the you can see the Luigi
here we are using Luigi and this is the
interface that we are using to command
the robot and actually we have a kind of
framework for for Java me to write this
kind of code with a Bluetooth device and
so here you are seeing that the robot
control and this those are the other
things are for home automation control
which is our next demonstration for this
demonstration we are using another
platform we are integrating Arduino with
another project that we you want the
Dukes Choice Award last year college a
home automation which is a platform for
for automation based on on Java that can
integrates with Arduino and can
integrate with Java ME android phones so
here we have Arduino the same board we
have a relay board and we have a LED
stripe color LED stripe that you can
change colors you can use outside
because this stripe is waterproof and is
getting more and more and expensive each
year so I think that in the future we
are going to use intelligent lights
inside our house and the color of the
lights can transmit some kind of
information grab some information from
the internet and change the color in
your house based on that information so
it's a pretty cool hacking to do so for
the home automation is it working yeah I
see the lights blinding
hmm toughen sooner okay so Jamie you are
changing the color okay it's okay
because every time that that I see the
lights blinding and it means that it
means that the Arduino is resetting one
nice that it's working in her so the
relay we are turning on turning after
relay so we have the the second relay
and okay the RGB are do you be light you
can see that the RGB light is combining
the colors and this kind of stripe is
less sensible is not a designer to to
move and make the animals and cross the
world in airplane but is working okay
and we also have a sensor reading it was
the hot the hard part should hard part
you to write the code because we have
some synchronization problem so the
first one is the light sensor okay no
problem is the first reading oops no to
some problems if the bluetooth we don't
know
check I promise that in my country it
works perfect but it's okay it was a we
need to to put some control in the
serial communication between the cell
phone and Arduino some crc to make it
better we didn't find the time to do
that but the base cooperation of reading
the control that the sensors is working
a lot more that's it okay behind behind
the scenes we have things API which is
an API that we are launching next week
the things API is a new API for internet
your things that promote the integration
between sensors and devices relays cough
machines with Java not just Java me but
java SE and java ee so we are talking
with oracle guys you have javafx
examples using our API with Jay home we
are ready use it things API to control
the house we using our glassfish
application server so we have ejbs that
can schedule the cough machine and
things like that we talk it a lot this
week about this project and we have
twitter module four things API so you
can follow sensors using Twitter you can
open a gate using Twitter and this API
is very generic and this API is
supporting Bluetooth devices also IP
devices zigbee devices and serial
communication so if you have an old old
but gold microcontroller like p.i.c you
can use things API if if you communicate
Syria with p.i.c microcontroller
and things API dot org is will be the
the is all right reserved it for us but
the website will be launching launched
it next week and if you want to receive
an early version of things API just
dropping a line and I send you by email
or i can give you some get permissions
so you can clone my get and see what we
are doing maybe help us so please come
back today your phone is working yeah
nice said this is a temperature sensor
connection with the Arduino as you can
see we have a 23 degrees Celsius we can
update the data you have to do some
number format yeah and the light sensor
the first reader we have this from the
first reading of the sensor we we have
some kind of a dirty but the next one is
ok so dark and this light sensor is that
one that is very inexpensive is the
light dependent resistor very simple to
use and what is amazing of this is that
this the Marcelo cell phone is really
old you can see that is you know my cell
phone swing with me sometimes yeah
sometimes you know he used to fish with
the selfies yeah the feature fun feature
phone that a feature for no no no is the
is analog value actually is from 0 to
120 for so we don't we didn't convert
the in a log Valley and you can see that
in the phone we are running the things
mobile so the things Bobo is a platform
from the things API that you can write
forms for mobile and it helps you to
communicate with Bluetooth discover the
process of discovering the Bluetooth
modules and the forms used to store the
relation between the sensors and the
Bluetooth modules so once you discover
and you did the first communication that
ings API mobile we are starting our
phone and you don't need to discover the
bluetooth module anymore we did it
because it's very hard to do a talk and
discover Bluetooth modules during the
talk because we have many phones and
this kind of predation can take a lot of
time and any sensible sometimes so and
next is like here is a piece of code
from the things API use it into the Java
ME application so we are we can see the
things dot anything and when you don't
know which device you have you can say
think dot anything that's saying and it
can send a comment to anything that the
API found in your environment so we can
get the things things not anything that
getting a URL so in this case we have a
string with the Bluetooth address URL
and we store this information in should
our phone and the last one we are being
more directed saying things that
bluetooth thing I know that it's a
bluetooth thing and I have a URL dot
sent a comment to that bluetooth device
so it's very simple API we are designed
designing this API trying to make it
very very simple for people that is not
a hardware developer so that's the idea
of this API the idea is you do not need
to know a lot of Bluetooth connection
you don't you do
just need to use it for discovery of
devices and score the service and then a
mute your mobile app that communicates
with Arduino it's a synchronous it's a
synchronous so you just have the
listeners and you wait for the feedback
and you can you can keep using your cell
phone when the discovery process is
started so that's the way so the next
step for the things mobile is to try to
restart the connection and try to
discover the device now we don't have
the process of discovery which kind of
device is behind that bluetooth module
we don't have a robot and I can do this
and that command and I have decent that
sensor and so you can have a flexible
you I that can connect you anything that
is running the things API few more so
ago we already used to do this kind of
thing using for forge a home automation
we have the discovery process and we are
going to to do the same with the robot
or a platform so here oops
here we have some arduino code show you
so this is the the robot code as you can
see for I student oops for I student is
very simple you just include this
library that will wrote the death bot
which is our platform for robotics and
this death bought API is also based on
things API and here is in Portuguese let
me translate this robot point set up the
battery the battery will be seven votes
the motor is six volts and here I'm
using an Arduino board that is a special
Arduino colored program e which is our
Arduino and here we are saying robot
start and the robot can have different
types of control and since I have a
button in my robot if I press the button
in the first mode I will be
communicating with remote Java ME
devices for the second mode I will be
communicate with Android device the 30
mode is to test the motors so the hobo
the robot goes forward backward and this
mode the robot will avoid dark so avoid
dark mode and avoid dark mode means that
if the robot goes under your bed it will
back in and go away it avoid going to
dark environments so it's a very simple
programming is this code so it's not big
doesn't matter what has inside but it's
not big it's very simple to cheat teach
people that is java developer or n
thing else and we also have the
avoidance avoidance mode the avoidance
mode is that one that they just present
today in the keynote the puranas keynote
is using a distance sensor or any other
kind of sensor and this method to avoid
avoid a battle but heat heat Sorry Sorry
to avoid heating objects this is the
decode to avoidance to avoid heating
links so it's very simple the robot just
read the sensor the distance sensor and
if the distance is less than 15
centimeters we have a reaction based on
the motors of the robot so this code is
integrated with Java ME application and
we don't have too much quote as you can
see here we just have the Arduino loop
is just delegating to the robot that
loop so this platform is very very very
simple and here is this testing mode the
testing mode reads the information go
goes forward go backward and that's it
so is the bigger methods but it's kind
of just to test out the behavior of the
robot and that's the Arduino part so in
the NetBeans we can see here the things
mobile app and here we have the app
things form things menu this is the part
that you are going to reuse from our
code so the things form already provided
Bluetooth communication and the things
form can relate the sensor or the relay
the actuator with the Bluetooth module
and we have the midlet the main midlet
and here we have two forms to make the
bluetooth setup so this it will be a
library
library for Java me and here we have the
forms that you saw Marcelo showing the
RGB form let's check inside the code the
RGB form we have these lighters inside
and we are just calling our our
classroom or the class constructor to
give a name to this form and we are at
making the layout here and so let me
show you when the key press send command
color and the value that we don't want
to to change the color is one value from
0 to 255 so the same command we just
inherited from the things form is
already we already did this method for
you and you have the same command and
read which is used by the sensors let's
see the sensor the robot will use the
same thing but with different commands
and for the sensor like the light sensor
we we have the form here and when the
button is pressed in the action / formal
event we use this method send receive
command light and we receive I string
with the valley from the sensor and we
can treat the string and present to the
user so that's it so that's some pieces
of gold that we are writing is not final
it's kind of better its prototype is not
better its prototype we are trying hard
to put some unity testing here but it's
not that easy to make a more reliable
disco Dan so the people can contribute
with some good things with us so that's
the part of code that we have we would
like to show to present you
and let's go to the tips and we have we
have the alternative module like ten
dollars bluetooth modules that you can
buy from a do X from China but these
modules sometimes they they can be trick
like they can work just with a I
specific baud rate and sometimes if you
have too much Wi-Fi sino it it doesn't
work so when you pay four times more for
a bluetooth module you are paying for
some controls that the Bluetooth used to
do when you have noise and so the
sparkfun module can modulate and can
treat the noise and we can do demos here
that is working with this kind of
bluetooth even having many other
Bluetooth devices and strong Wi-Fi sign
us from many parts so take care if you
are going to test the things in your
house is ok but if you are going to
present some talk or do something
professional is better to use to pay
more and to use this part phone model I
am using this model the last two or
three years and they aren't very very
nice I'm awful i buy i bought one from
ebay from ten dollars and i had some
problems that we can you can't trust
them chinese one yeah that's it because
I good actually the blue maybe eat me
work the Bluetooth main module it used
to cost like five dollars if you want to
to buy the bluetooth module are all
bluetooth module the expensive part is
to treat the sino and the noise around
and everything else so that's what a
bluetooth module from sparkfun did for
us and the bush acted bout hate when we
were were working together marcelo were
in a different seating brazil
with different a different bluetooth
module and we were trying trying trying
the problem is just was just about hate
so the bluetooth module can work with
any kind of hash of both hate you can
set up the bluetooth module from
sparkfun and and the Chinese one is
fixed at about rate and we use it Luet
the disease was a Marcelo development
from luid luige is a lightweight
framework far to build interfaces java
me does someone here knows Louis do it
ok you can build reach interface very
good good reach interface would have the
interface builder interface I think this
interface of design in Buda I don't
remember exactly but you have you can
code ensign separately separate them ok
and it's very nice it's in it's very
easy to because the Java ME default UI
is an ll see d Y LCD why right it's not
very beautiful but slew it is very nice
very easy to use you have a lot of
examples in the web so you can glue it
and use it very nice yeah for the new
phones for your new java phones like the
Nokia phones Luis runs very good and
especially for Bluetooth the the process
of testing the app is hard because you
need to transfer to the phone you need
to connect to the bluetooth module so we
are working on an emulator to save this
time and emulate the bluetooth module
marcelo did a research and there is
something I read in the internet but we
spend a lot of time like ten percent of
the time was writing the Java me code
and ninety person was testing manual
testing we don't have another way to do
that so we decide to stay
creating a Bluetooth emulator and to
help us in this process so you can save
hours of testing if you are going to
spend just one day writing code for
Bluetooth and doing this kind of
integration is okay but if you are going
to spend a month doing that you will
spend a lot of time testing with testing
so try to improve your testing method to
avoid wasting at this time so some links
here Arduino is part fun oui je home and
thinks API dot org that is our new
project that we are looking forward to
this project and our companies from
Brazil if someone for some reason go to
Brazil just send us an email and we can
show the good parts of Brazil and
another exercise and we still have seven
minutes for QA and our context is here
question
it's just the range is just your rent
arranged here we are using the cheaper
one the thirty-nine dollars is the
silver here so is working perfect we did
a lot of tests with big rooms crowded
people and let's go there with the robot
and see what's happened huh I would love
to work there but no no I don't worry
for a spark fun I used converting the
Java me side I read the analog value the
raw Valerie from Nidorino and I used to
convert our framework provides support
for distance sensor temperature and
light sensor so you can have the data
already treated or interpreted but for
Japanese Pacifica we are reading the
revaluation an Arduino yeah yeah and
actually there we are using a very
simple temperature sensor the this lm35
is very cheap but you can have more
professional temperature sensors like if
you are home homie Brewing beers you can
you can put a temperature sensor into
the water to check the water temperature
and for this kind of sensor will be
another cold inside the femur so our
library will not support this kind of
sensor you will need to extend our
library to support this kind of sensor
choo choo far height yeah to fire hi to
Celsius yeah no but is yeah really
simple to do that yeah we we just
received the data as a string from the
Arduino is just to convert it the
problem is that we will have a different
countries with different sensors in each
country and we need to deal with this
kind of fragmentation harder for the
fragmentation problem and so we always
support the raw value e and we always
provide some conversion but you always
can extend our library and plug your
functionality in our library so it's
pretty simple to do that you can do the
sensors internationalization it's kind
of thing
okay guys we can keep talking ah after
this session I would like to thank you
very much for coming for this session
it's very hard to choose a session here
especially in the last day so I think
that is a crowded room for java me talk
and for the last day talk after the
purge and show so huh thanks a lot and
we keep in touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
