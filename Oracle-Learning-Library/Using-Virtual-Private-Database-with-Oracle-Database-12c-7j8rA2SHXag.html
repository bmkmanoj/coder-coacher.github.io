for Oracle server technologies welcome
to this video
implementing Virtual Private database of
EPD first we'll take a look at the
background in context in which VPD
exists then we set up for a demo which
is primarily creating an application
context and then we step through the
packages and functions that the security
policy needs and we create a policy test
it and then drop it fine-grained access
control is a building block for Virtual
Private database it limits row or column
access which is done with the use of a
predicate that is returned from a
function so when a user enters an
unqualified select statement as in this
example then the function that is
associated with the table of view and
automatically executed or limits what
the person can see so in this example
the where Clause limits the manager to
seeing only the employees to which they
have access this page provides the
overview of what I'll show you next
connected to sequel + SS DBA we execute
some sequel + formatting commands then
we create a tablespace for demo purposes
and a user SEC which is like our
Security Administrator and we grant
privileges to this user
connect s the sec use and create the
application context is the sec user we
create the current m package and body
this is a simple example of where we
capture the user context and we can
output the ID name and email create a
trigger which fires after the user logs
into the database and sets the current
context login is this user we set the
server output and test the system
context is Swiss DB run the SEC user the
ability to execute the package that
creates policies the DBMS Alice package
contains multiple procedures for you to
maintain BPD policies who grant this
user to be exempt from them is the SEC
user create the package that is used by
the security policy to return a
predicate if you want to see the
predicate that the policy uses to limit
the rows returned from the M table you
can execute the query is displayed on
the screen so how does this work the
user making the query must have an email
ID that matches the database username
and the M user attribute in sirs context
is set equal to the employee ID of the
user so the predicate allows the user to
access only the records describing this
user optionally check as the asking user
that this user does not yet have access
to the employees table Connect s Lea
skin user and optionally display the
current context attribute to read this
statement please pause the recording
is sec our security administrator
implemented EP d policy that restricts
access to the Select command grantee
asking user access to the employees
table then login SS king in the executed
theory without a way a clause to the
employees table and you see our VPD
policy is in place the user only sees
his own record is the security
administrator you want to now delete the
VPD policy but what you have to remember
to do first before doing it so that you
don't create a security breach if you're
not sure please watch the last few
seconds of this video log on is the
asking user execute a couple of
formatting commands and then execute the
unqualified query which you have used
before and because no VPD policy
protects the employee table all rows are
being displayed so the security
administrator should have first to
revoke the Select privilege and then
modified the policy to not allow this to
happen this page shows you the tasks
that we just covered for the security
administrator thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
