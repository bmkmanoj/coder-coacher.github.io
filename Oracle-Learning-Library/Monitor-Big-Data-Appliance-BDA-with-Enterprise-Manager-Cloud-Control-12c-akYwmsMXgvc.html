Manager cloud control 12c demonstration
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum to
monitor the Big Data appliance with
cloud control we assume that its targets
have been already discovered and
promoted to being monitored by
Enterprise Manager cloud control in this
video we will show you all the pages
listed on this slide that together make
up PDA to access BDA or the Big Data
appliance select targets Big Data
appliance and you arrive on the home
page where you see all BDA machines that
are monitored by AM cloud control 12c
click a link and you arrive on the BDA
Network page the home page the BDA home
page shows the hardware and software
components of this Big Data planes on
the bottom you see a hardware schematic
which shows that this appliance is a
half rack on the top you have a hardware
overview which summarizes the number of
components in their status let's expand
the software overview below here you see
the essential software components per
host by the way I adjusted them a little
bit so that there is not so much
scrolling here we expand ideas in the
target navigation and you see the hosts
page this PDA whose target page
aggregates the host metrics at the rack
level and it shows here color
coordinated line graphs which represent
host resource use and network group
below you see the hosts status and the
associated TDH cluster as well as the
number of related incidents and alerts
the Ilham server targets are responsible
for displaying a number of disk failure
alerts for their respective service that
are received is if an MP tray and
in MP stands for simple network
management protocol and PDU stands for
power distribution unit two needle Cloud
Control to collect metric data and res
events for PD target this PDUs must be
configured to accept the SNMP qyz from
the agents that monitor these PDO
targets the SNMP is a protocol that's
used for managing and monitoring devices
but many of these devices are network
type devices such as routers switches
and so on each of these elements have a
very similar home page in this example
the Cisco Ethernet switch with a summary
job activity and below any incidence of
problems that could have occurred this
Hadoop cluster home page is basically
the dashboard which shows you on the top
the summary with the status and then
below we have the host utilization CPU
memory file system and network bandwidth
and further down the Hadoop performance
and at the bottom of the page any
incidents which might have occurred
Oracle is dependent on the Claudio a
manager for the BDA and hard of
monitoring and management
so basically Claudia is monitoring the
monitor as you can see on this page if
there were any incidents they would be
those that are directly reported from
the Claudio Manager the Hadoop
distributed file system or HDFS high
availability consists of two master
nodes called name nodes and worker nodes
called data mode when you place the
cursor over the graphs you get more
detailed information each of the data
nodes is also a failover controller
there are also journal nodes typically
three but they can be more provided that
it is not number and there is a balance
to balance disk space across the cluster
you can use this drop-down to filter by
group
and you can select a row and then start
or stop the element math reduce is the
job system in which MapReduce jobs run
using the HDFS file system the MapReduce
system consists of a master node called
job tracker and multiple worker nodes
called task trackers here we own the
zookeeper target home page zookeeper is
a centralized service for maintaining
Hadoop configuration information the
InfiniBand network is a set of DB
machine storage hosts and server hosts
that are interconnected with InfiniBand
switches the high speed network is
really the backbone of the DB machine
and allows fast communication between
the service used the InfiniBand network
page to monitor the status and health of
the current InfiniBand network the page
contains an overview section the
throughput section they chose the MB per
second for both the switch to note link
and switch to and switch link the IB
gateway switches are unique to be the
they have for special gateway ports
which behave differently as compared to
other ID ports they have been colored
different in the schematic in the
Ethernet port details section which
provides you specific metric information
on these ports now this page is the same
as other Exadata targets where you have
the notes section similar to the
switches and any incidents which give a
summary of incidents associated with the
network just as an example I would like
to show you how to drill down each of
these pages has a home page drop-down
and you can choose various options that
are appropriate for this topic in this
example I'm choosing topology and you
see here on the IB Network page all the
service that are connected to this we
showed you many pages in this
demonstration to give you an idea about
how you can monitor the big
data appliance with cloud control for
more information view the Oracle
documentation specifically the big data
appliance installation guide thanks for
watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
