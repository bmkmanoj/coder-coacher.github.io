can see that the last 24 hours there
were a lot of the threads samples that
show that JVM the thread were waiting on
on a lock this is actually a specific
application that I created for this demo
that creates a lot of locks and normally
anything over 2 locks is it asserted for
a longer period this is pretty bad I'm
going to the JVM performance Diagnostics
page and since this happens going for
the last 24 hours I would concentrate
still happening now so I'll concentrate
in the last 15 minutes just so it will
be easier to find the problem here there
are multiple ways to go about finding
the root code here and we will go with
one of them I'm adding a filter looking
at the locks so this is the list of all
the locks that I have thought word that
we found by looking at the it is running
threads and I'll sort this by weight
count and I see 38,000 thread samples in
the last 15 minutes that were waiting
for a lock just waiting on this specific
lock this specific object that was
locked and I can also see that it was
held a 449 time what I'll do now I'll
edit as a filter so I'll look only at
the thread samples that are involved
either by holding the lock or by waiting
for the lock I could have select the
filter only on locale the lock waiting
for this demo I'll choose all I click OK
and now the data that I'm seeing here is
filtered to show me only these threads
samples that are involved in this locks
with either holding or waiting to the
lock let's go to the thread a tab here
close the filter options it's still
working I just don't want it to take
real estate here and I can see the
executions of threads that are involved
that are waiting for these locks and if
Al and I can see this is will happening
all the time
maybe I'll minimize the time a little
bit to look at only a shorter period of
time to makes it even clearer let's see
that I will look at this
two minutes period from 338 to 340 p.m.
May 20 seconds right and now every icon
here represent one count of in a thread
law in the state of a thread life right
so we look at this one specific thread a
named executed thread 0 for Q WebLogic
kernel default self tuning that the name
of the thread this is the the process ID
this is the the native thread that
destroyed his executing as and we can
see that at any time every 2 seconds I
was taking examples and all the time it
was now only waiting on the lock so
let's see what it's waiting on and you
can see that the other threads and then
I can actually look at this some others
they are doing about the same thing
right 1 2 3 4 5 threads here in this
case so I'm going to click on one of
these examples and there since all of
them are the same what seems to be the
same at least I clicked on one and now I
can see detail on this thread so I see
this is the the current call which is
the actual requested we are processing
right now and we can see that the state
of the thread is walk and we can see
that this thread the thread that this
it's waiting on this lock that we saw
earlier and we see that the thread that
is holding this lock right now at the
time the time clicking on it was 1539 27
seconds is this one right here so let's
see what is this thread is doing while
it's holding the clock the lock I'm
clicking on
and now I'm switching the filter here to
Bigley to bring me that one specific
thread that was holding the lock and
indeed you see that this this thread is
holding yet another lock but it also
hold this one this one lock over here to
me Christmas green a little bit to make
it easier to see so um so actually here
we have it right we see that we had the
thread and actually if we would have
clicked through many other thread you
would see that they do the same thing
waiting on a specific object and this
object is being held by this one thread
while this thread is holding it we can
see the district is actually waiting on
the database so we actually can see the
sequel that is being executed select
star from wine for update and so the
state of the disability be wait and I
actually see the database while
executing this sequel is actually in
contention which means so just a problem
on the database let's skip that now and
concentrate on the problem here let's
see what this led said what is actually
holding this what method is actually
holding this this this object right the
lock and I can see it slept 22 so let's
scroll down here to def 22 right here so
in this JSP page in line 238 there is a
synchronous a line of course it says
synchronized sequence synchronize on
this object and this is my root cause so
the next step from here is to go to the
developer of this application look at
the code line to 238 in this class right
in this file name this is the parent
happen to be the JSP generated page but
it might be in any class in in different
cases and see what else is happening
what is happening at the time that they
hold that the lock is held and why is it
the day that we are holding the lock for
such a long time
