dashboards let me show you how you can
view analyses and dashboards that you
most recently worked on or you can
create new ones to begin creating an
analysis double-click the columns that
you want to add you can apply filters
column formatting add sorts and so on on
the criteria tab sort revenue to show
the highest values first you'll add this
analysis to a new dashboard the
dashboard will have a prompt that
filters the contents by both region and
brand for the prompt to work properly on
the dashboard you need to add a filter
for region and brand that uses the is
prompted operator adding a filter with
the is prompted operator for a filters
column flags the column is ready to be
filtered by a prompt this means when a
prompt is used results include only
records where the data in the column
that is prompted matches the users
choices view the analysis in the results
tab add the cust segment column to the
analysis add a chart best visualization
gathers information about the included
data and dimensions and then determines
the optimal presentation layout for the
analysis save the analysis to a shared
folder now create a new dashboard if you
want to create the dashboard for
personal use change the location to my
folders in dashboard builder drag and
drop an object such as a prompt or
analysis to which you have access to the
work area of the new dashboard page
notice that a new column and section are
created automatically into which the
objects are placed add more columns and
then drag other analyses and the region
brands prompt to the work area to save
and run the dashboard make sure the
prompts work properly
all analyses are filtered by the
selected values for the prompts you can
now see how well your brands are
performing for each region and customer
segments now you know how to create
analyses and dashboards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
