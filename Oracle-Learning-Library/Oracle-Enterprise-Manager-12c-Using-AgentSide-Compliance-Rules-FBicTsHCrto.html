Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series agent side compliance rules
are introduced in Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12 10 4 and greatly simplify and
shorten the amount of time needed to
create custom compliance standards they
essentially form a tighter integration
between the compliance framework and
configuration extensions this tighter
integration allows for the management of
the lifecycle of both of these
components together as well as
eliminates the need for complex sequel
query generation this simplified
integration has some requirements that
is that the validation must be performed
on the agent and only return violation
data because all of the data returned by
the configuration extension is assumed
to be a violation this data must also be
limited to a single column result let's
expand a bit on the details of the
integration between the compliance
framework and configuration extensions
first you'll notice that when you're
defining an agent side rule you will no
longer need to generate a sequel query
rather you simply need to choose from
the list of existing configuration
extensions and aliases second when you
associate a compliance standard that is
of type agent side the compliance
framework will automatically deploy all
required configuration extensions needed
for proper evaluation
that compliance standard and likewise
when you unassociated compliance
standard from the targets it will
underplay the configuration extensions
this significantly reduces the overhead
needed for managing of the lifecycle of
these components
in this demonstration we're going to
show how to create and use agent side
compliance rules and we're going to use
the following sequel query as an example
looking at the sequel query you'll
notice that it's essentially looking at
the password lock time property of the
profiles and making sure that the values
are not set to something other than
unlimited or default so this query
essentially meets the requirements of
being used in an angel side compliance
check in that it only returns rows which
are in fact violations to our policy and
second that it only returns a single
column however you'll notice that we use
is a little trick here by concatenating
the properties and some strings together
to create a single column but using the
multiple problems let's begin by
creating the configuration extension
using that sequel query so to begin we
click create we'll give it a name select
database instance database instance as
the target type and then we'll click Add
in the super query and just simply paste
our query in then we use it a meaningful
alias name because we'll be using
to find the age of Side of the Moon and
just to make sure that our query is
correct let's choose a test target
temporarily or to test this arm so
select a sample target and click preview
essentially this temporarily deploys the
configuration extension runs the sequel
query against the database and returns
the results and we can see here that in
fact this weary is returning to Rose for
this particular sample database so these
two rows will be treated as violations
if we use this configuration extension
as part of an age inside compliance
check so we click OK and then we click
Save to save this configuration
extension so if you have previously done
custom configuration compliance using
configuration extensions you would have
at this point deployed the configuration
extension before moving on to the
compliance creating the compliance
repository compliance check here however
we do not need to do that we're simply
going to move on to creating the agents
I'd rule because when we associate the
compliance standard it's going to be
deployed automatically for us let's
continue on in the process by creating
an aging side compliance removal so we
go to the compliance library under
compliance standard rules and click
create and select agents ID compliant or
agents I'd rule but continue here we
give it a name will change it to
production will leave
the severity we need to choose database
instance which matches our configuration
extension that's pretty much all we're
required to fill out on this page so
we'll continue on at this point when you
would have been creating a repository
rule you would have to use the sequel
model or to generate the sequel to use
it against the repository day in this
case we simply need to choose a
configuration extension alias
combination and in this case we'll just
just created here you'll notice that
this is why choosing a meaningful alias
name when you're creating a
configuration extension and the
specifics queries within it becomes
important so we'll cook okay now one
thing you can do is you can actually use
if you want the output of the column
that's being returned by the sequel
query in this case to be used in the
mess as the message of a non-compliant
message violation message you can simply
use percent value this will substitute
the output of that column with into the
value parameter here later again we can
run our test against the database sample
database just to make sure that
everything works okay and so again this
is temporarily deploying the
configuration extension getting the
results and then will show us the any
return columns as violations so again we
can see that again the column name is
incall value here and these are the two
rows that we saw earlier being returned
by the sequel so we click next and
finish let's continue on by creating the
compliance standard so we went to the
compliance standards tab and click
create we give a name and select the
proper target type and choose a type of
asian side and click continue will
change the life cycle state of vista
production and then right click on the
standard name and select add rules and
just like when you're creating any other
compliance standard you select one or
more rules and click OK adding this to
the standard you'll notice that
conveniently on the right hand side we
show the details of this particular rule
of the top as well as the check
definition coming from the actual
configuration extension so this makes it
nice and easy that it's all in one place
for you to see the actual check and
worry that's doing executed and that's
pretty much all we have to do so well
click Save to save on your compliance
standard at this point we're ready to
use our new compliance standards so just
like with any other compliance standard
we choose the standard and clip
associate targets and then click Add
selecting one or more targets again
we'll use our test database and click OK
we click ok and yes and we can see here
that in fact this compliance standard
now has an association count and
associated count of one target but let's
return to the configuration extension
finish to see what's happened there
you'll notice now that the deployments
has a one next to it or when we left it
there was none we click on the one we
can see that in fact the database that
we just associated to the compliance
standard is now has this configuration
extension deployed to it so we no longer
have to pre prior to associating a
repository standards deploy these
configuration extensions we now just
need to associate the agent side
compliance standard and these
configuration extensions will be
deployed automatically for us to finish
up let's go see the results of our new
compliance standard by going to the
compliance results page here we see our
new compliance standard which has one
target associated to it that's evaluated
in critical status and there are two
violations if we click on the standard
name it takes us to the result details
for the specific compliance standard in
here I can see the results by target or
by rule I can see all of the violations
for all of the rules if there were more
than one here or by selecting one of the
rules I get the details just about this
rule and if I click on the violation
events I can see all of the violations
for this specific rule and by selecting
one of the violations in the middle I
can see all the details when it was
actually detected the violation details
etc but again the most important thing
to note here is that because we use that
percent value compliant and
non-compliant message regions we're
actually passing through the single
column return from that sequel query and
because we use that trick of
concatenation concatenating together
multiple properties we can create a
enough context for the DBA to understand
what the issue is so they can go about
addressing which this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
