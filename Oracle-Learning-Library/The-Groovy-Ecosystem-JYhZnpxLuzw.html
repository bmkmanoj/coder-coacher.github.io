see that many people on this talk not
just because it's the last day of job
one after that great community keynote
but also because looks like you guys are
really excited by group easily see some
hands who has used groovy before okay
eighty percent you guys have done the
job already for me what are you guys
doing here you got you want to learn
more about the groovy echo system I
guess right okay so let's get started
well this is me I'm a member of the
grooby development team since 2007 I am
the current project leaf of the Griffin
framework and I have well I can actually
pass there a lot of the groovy project
leads which is some of the projects and
I'm going to show you today so what I
mean by that is that i think i have
sometimes a bit of insiders information
all these projects and i want to give
you guys so those information so that
you can make better use of these
projects if you really want to alright
so let's get a start with the first one
and i believe that perhaps most of you
already know this framework Grails am I
correct to assume this thing so I how
many of you develop a web application
okay half how many of you already make
use of rails the best framework to do so
okay a few hands perfect so a few things
about grails and let's go into I was a
little bit of light coating to show you
how you can make use of this framework
so grills was born e two thousand five
so it's quite mature it's influenced by
ruby on rails which gave us convention
over configuration don't repeat
yourselves a lot of things testing
command line tools and a brand new way
to think how we can assemble web
applications this license is Apache
License 20 so it's quite friendly for
open source projects or business
organizations it's it builds on top
spring hibernate side mesh and on some
others we're really well known open
source libraries out there this means
that if you are already nulla virtual
enough on or or you know these libraries
then you can leverage this knowledge if
you make use of rails it's no longer
close to 800 plugins I think that we
have broken this limit and it's about to
840 42 maybe last time I checked this
means that the Grails framework is
actually more like a good platform you
can extend the framework by installing
new plugins and it's easily approachable
you can use it for a small projects or
you can even use it for very large
projects so who knows which is the first
the first company in the 114 companies
in the world is walmart you know what
Walmart does with grails it ships all
the music side with it did you know that
did you notice is it fast yes it works
so later release is to talk to 10 and
this is the one that I have here so
let's see I'm going to go into a
different directory one level up let's
see downloading Grails is as easy as
picking up a zip file configuring a
command environment variable in this
case it has to be 0 grails home Krell's
will type all that which I have right
there and once you have it you have
access to the Grails command now there
is excellent support for grils in your
standard IDEs beat idea netbeans or
eclipse the social support for rich text
editors like textmate I think sublime
text 2 and of course the best editor
ever that's other then
you can you guys can laugh a little bit
yeah it's true it's being you see did
you see that the community keynote they
shall beam running right there it's true
no other ide was present if they didn't
show a Mac sorry ok so once you have
this the first step is create an
application so just type create app and
then pick a name I'm going to choose
chal one just because I want to and this
will boost wrap the application
structure in a standard way and install
some default plugins that are required
to lunch in the application and that
wasn't it was knew about well what's
neat about the latest Grails version is
that the command line tool in the past
used to speed out a lot of lines of
information now it's only concentrated
so now let's change into John one and
there's nothing here at the moment it's
just an empty shell of an application
the important thing is that what you
find in this directory Grails app is
where all the specific components of
your application should be place if you
do here's what we can find domain
classes which we don't have at the
moment well we make use of them in a
moment controllers views and whatnot so
let's see the first step will be to
create a domain class I'm going to stick
with command line tools and simple tech
satyrs because well this is this is what
everybody can understand and I don't
really like so much ideas but as said
there's plenty of good support so let's
add another thing here create domain
class and let's pick a name I'm going to
create an author here now this will
generate a domain class based on a
standard template and also if either
mistake it could probably create a test
for this thing but you can manually
create all these files and I'm going to
create using the command lines the
command line tools are just a nice
facility so it's just a second show
finished come on there we go
there it has created author and author
tests and we when we look inside the
domains directory now there's the author
class which is quite empty sorry about
that and we also have a unit test for it
right there which is also empty at the
moment good let's put some properties
here so all of you guys are already know
groovy you we know that we support java
properties out of the box so i can
define a name for this guy and also a
last name and this is all that I need to
do and I said now when I bootstrap the
application I will have an or table
already set for me and there will be new
things that I can add to this author for
example I can save it I can query it i
can delete it but i don't have to write
all those things the framework will do
the magic for me the next thing that is
to do is create a controllers can
visualize this guy so let's go again
back to the command line tool and in
this case I'm going to say create
controller and i'm going to pick the
same name as the domain if i do this i
will harness the power of conventions so
I don't have to configure a lot of
things if I follow my convention but I
can certainly breakout on the convention
and go into the configuration because
convention over configuration does mean
configuration is completely forgotten so
it takes just a few seconds I don't know
why is compiling the source files again
and it should create a controller class
and a controller tests for us there is
our controller this is the domain and
there is a controller there is it's
empty so I'm going to do I'm going to
choose a trick here and add a static
scaffolding and just because I him
following the naming convention I can
set that property to true if I want to
scaffold a different domain class say a
book in this controller just specify the
class name that's it
now the magic happens I'm going to
launch the server Grails in this case
I'm going to now use it in interactive
mode so we don't have to pay the price
of bootstrap in the JVM every single
time we issue a command and there we go
let's run app let's run the application
so most of the command names are
intuitive but in case that some of them
are not we have a full list of all the
commands just call the help command or
if you prefer let's open a browser here
let's go see safari and if you go to the
following page grails dot org there's a
tab assess documentation then user guide
and then we see an HTML version of the
full user guide it's also a PDF version
of the guide where it can tell you what
all the neat things are you need to know
about girls how to build it how to
package it deployed the differences
between domain classes views tag
libraries controllers and I was saying
commands all the difference commands
that you have access to ok so the server
is running at this point and we can
point the our browser to this URL and
there we have it just the standard
homepage for grades we can change it we
can tweak it we can add CSS we can go
crazy with this thing and here's our
author controller so let's click on it
and then we have a default view that
will list all our domains we can create
a new author let's say Graham rank has
published a buck oh it's actually the
world named see what I did there I put
his name in the last name so I was
expecting something else we define the
properties in name last name but the
view that the file scaffolding put last
name and name first because it's
ordering them in alphabetical order we
change this thing so let's say save it
for the moment then we can look at the
list there is the guy I can go back here
and edit it the what I want to hear okay
update so let's change this thing
another thing that happens is that if i
create a new author and just save well
there are now two authors with 10 dash
is invalid because there is no there has
no values so we had to clear these
things that's why we add constraints to
the domain class the first one will be
say that the name cannot be blank and
cannot be nullable and we can do the
same thing for the last name so
constraints have two roles first they
can set the order of the properties that
I want to name and last name that's your
that I want and also what are the types
of constraints if I want this guy to be
nullable if I want this time to be
unique if I want this this value to fall
within a range of two two numbers or
even your own custom constraints so
notice that I just save the file and do
a refresh
there's still the domain class there
let's see what happens here I create a
new author ah ok well I second this
supposed to work save it the server is
for still running ok and if you do a
refresh you still get the old one am I
getting beaten by the cash maybe on a
second let's quit this team stopping
grey silver we shouldn't do this as a
matter of fact every time that you make
a change the server should pick all the
new things and let's run it again of
course just come on are you ready you're
supposed to be ready hmm and think I'm
falling I'm finding a problem with the
cash various ok new author and it still
name last name hmm this is not right let
me do it full stop yes goodbye grails
run app not interactive mode this time
should work as any other system this of
course is not perfect and the problem
here is me not the framework ok toodaloo
toodaloo just a second and this will be
the last thing I'm going to show about
Grails because there are more stuff that
will have to see it today but I'm quite
surprised that that there was a lot of
people that didn't know about this
framework what I like about this thing
is that it really helps you to build web
applications in a snap just a couple of
minutes and it so happens that this guy
the whole Grails site is built in grails
as well ok now we have new author name
and last year's final is working we have
something here so let's try to create a
new earth or without setting any values
ha we got validation and if we happen to
to add resources for different languages
let's see which resources we have by
default Spanish I know spanish because
I'm from Mexico so let's look again at
the other third new author and this time
I'm going to add a new flag here lang
yes this will be in Spanish any Spanish
speakers in the house you recognize this
thing okay so now that I click create
this is in Spanish okay so whatever you
deployed the Colo color is using it
should work okay so let's continue and
let's add gram again and let's put some
spaces it doesn't allow me because I
said the property last name cannot be
blank of course it cannot be known so I
will not be able to click it but if I
put the right last name then I works
perfect move so you can extend this
behavior you can go beyond static there
scaffolding this is just a nice
convenience that will allow you to
create abuse without second thoughts and
then you can concentrate on the real
deal which is building the business
logic of your application you can either
rely on static scaffolding later for
production not that many people use it
some may use the static scaffolding for
canola cannons and administrative
console so you can use that alright so
next one now we get Griffin Griffin is
to the desktop what Grails is to the
well so it's kind of like a best period
of technologies for building desktop
applications it was it started in 2008
its spire back rails it actually began
as a fork of the great one one code base
so it also follows the same license
Apache 20
it currently has 174 plugins in
existence at least in the central
repository everybody can build plugins
in the same sense that you can build
plugins in gross it is polyglot aware
you can build applications in Java or
grube or other languages for example
scallop it also supports multi tool kits
you can build applications in swing or s
ability or the big thing with this
conference to JavaFX the latest release
is 110 anybody here has to build desktop
applications for the day job yes just a
few so pay close attention because this
thing can save your life so installing
Griffin is the same way just downloaded
zip file configure a variable when this
case will be the Griffin home variable
which I already have and then this gives
you access to the Griffin Burt command
which in this case let's see which
version i have should be 110 there we go
compile and release a few two weeks ago
so once you have this let's create an
application Griffin create app hey
notice the same command that we use for
Grails create app let's keep this guy a
name I will pick a vanilla one jar one
let's use the number one and yeah we in
Griffin like a little bit of the paucity
when when the apple com so this was used
to be what Grails output in 13 X but in
20 they change it putting in Griffin we
keep it so let's go into each other one
let's look at the contents of the
application there is also a special
directory called Griffin app where all
the components segregated by
responsibility go inside that we have
controllers we have models with abuse
and the view the default one is just a
frame that contains a label right there
what's nice about this thing is that
we're making use of a DSL for building
the UI so if I want to change this thing
and say
want to put two buttons using a grid
layout it's just a matter of specifying
well how many columns I want two columns
how many rows just one and put a bottom
here this will be the first quad and
then another one the second button here
we go so let's launch the application
this is griffin sort so which commanded
we use to run the Grail SAP run app
which command should we use for running
the Griffin app run up as well so if you
know Grails switch into desktop
applications with Griffin is just as
easy because you already know half of
the features and it so happens if you're
developing desktop and then go to the
web griffin and grails migration is also
quite easy now we're launching the
application notice the first thing when
you run a java application on the OSX
what happens the name of the application
is always wrong this is how you can tell
the applications java the second thing
is that it always has an ugly icon where
we have a nice Griffin icon that it's
almost not visible there but that's a
Griffin icon so you can see the
application squad river is just two
buttons on a grid and we can grow this
application and do more if we stall
plugins we can also go beyond the
default way to bootstrap an application
and choose something that we call
archetypes Griffin create app cool
archetype jump start this is one of the
predefined archetypes that we have in
the framework and this will create the
application using different templates
and we will also install additional
plugins now we will have something that
looks more businesslike why do we I had
the cool application already created
before so let's pick another name this
will be yes the cool one
okay there we go create the application
now cease more things so why didn't
resolve the jumps are plugging maybe I
need to install it Griffin install
archetype jump start there I have to
really delete the application i just
created if i want to reuse the name or i
can just select another one yes it's
installed then choose 11 create app
archetype on there's a typo thank you
cool too there we go this should work
now that my fat fingers typing on a
Swiss keyboard bad combination there we
go now is doing more things okay so
let's change into that one cool too and
first I'm going to open the source and
while that's happening I'm going to run
the application okay will notice nap now
the abused directory has more elements
the models directory also has more and
the controllers as well so what happens
now is that there we go here's launching
the cool to application hey it's not an
empty frame anymore we have a menu bar
we have a main content there and we can
react to the about menu in OS X so we
have native integration and there's a
new cool above menu not the default one
and have you guys make use of place list
when working with swing well this is it
there we go so all this thing is
possible because the Griffin framework
is also a platform that is extensible bi
commands and I think this is all I want
to show for Griffin at the moment it so
happens also one last thing that the
Griffin artifact portal is interesting
one to show artifacts
Griffin framework lorg this is a grails
application and here you can see all the
different plugins that we have c1
interesting tidbit about this thing
let's see tagged we have very two
different options for persistence last
time I checked Wales has about 12 or so
well pick one you like pick one you need
and there you go another main things
that you can see here this is open
source project as well liquid the grass
portal the Griffon portal you can check
it on github and fork it and use
whatever you want to with this alright
so next one there we go Gallic any users
of Google App Engine in-house a few okay
yes man i know you like Google App
Engine so you'll like this thing gaelic
is a lightweight framework for building
go up engine applications it wasn't
starting 2009 the the author the
framework is given LaForge he is also
the current project lead of the Griffin
project the license Apache 20 pretty
much all of the frameworks that you see
in the groovy ecosystem are our episodes
friendly and commercial friendly they
all of them almost all of them use
apache license or busy it has an
emerging plug-in system is not exactly
like the one that you have seen in grass
and Griffin but you can add a few things
the latest release is 11 if I know
mistaken it could be 12 and some people
have said and I'm going to say this in
the most possible positive light that
can be said gaelic is a PHP for Google
App Engine what does it mean anybody can
use it anybody can be productive in just
a couple of minutes this doesn't mean a
PHP is a bad language the jury is still
out there but anybody can write PHP
applications
anybody can write go go up engine
applications you make use of gallic it
also provides additional nice features
like dsl's there is a DSL on top of the
persistent service there is a DSL on top
of the ural service and the email
service so long gone are the days where
you have to work with ugly verbose Java
API just use a nice groovy dsl gaelic
has a little brother is called calif you
might have heard that beam where is
pushing is on cloud technology and it's
called cloud foundry well turns out that
calif is what get is to cloud foundry
but gaelic is to go up engine it is a
small lightweight frame work on top of
the services exposed by cloud foundry
and also another interesting thing is
that they share the same project lip
gianna forge is the author of gaelic as
well so it follows that the api is quite
similar even though the serb the
underlying services are different and
the latest release maybe i don't know if
it's 01 or 02 but if you gas ever had to
work with cloud foundry give Kelly a
look now let's switch gears and let's do
this let's forget about frameworks for a
moment and let's see everybody has to
build a project in some way which is
your favorite build tool of choice is
hit end yes I'm going to get too great
don't worry maven oh poor souls do you
love XML some of you do perfect but
there is a i will say there's definitely
a much better way not just because it
doesn't use xml is just because uses a
real language a scripting language for
defining what you want to do if you want
did you ever have the need of scripting
with xml you know that can get very very
painful wyd easily so that's why we have
Gradle here it was it started in two
thousands and and we have one of the
Gradle members in the audience by their
tyranny divisor which is also the author
for other the framework I will see you
later today and apache 20 again you can
think of Gradle as a groovy dsl for
project building another thing that it
has that maybe it doesn't really have is
a deep understanding of an object graph
so this tool can understand that the
relationships and dependencies within
each one of the tests that you write and
choose which tests should actually be
invoked to create a build you can also
extend the framework because it has
plugins and the latest release correct
me if I'm wrong the latest stable one is
12 so let's jump into Gradle and I have
a few examples prepared already let's
see it lets see a stand our Java project
sorry had to take a sip of water there
we go
sorry about that here I have a very
trivial java project because Gradle is
not only forbidding groovy projects but
any other one for there's a plugin there
is applying for skala closure sorry see
and I'm not so sure if there is an airy
already support for rejected see but
it's probably in the pipeline so we here
we have a very trivial java class well
somebody was part and really hard
yesterday night I fear this will happen
that my boss will be gone for the last
day so how do you build this theme if
you were building this thing with end
you'll probably copy the bill file from
some other project and then adaptive
right mangle the XML layout now kind of
build so let's remove this thing how
would you do the same thing with maven
well you can copy the file from another
existing project right and then mangled
XML or bootstrap the project using an
archetype but the nice thing about maven
is that it gave us conventions the bad
thing about maybe is that you still have
to specify those conventions in the palm
file what's the deal with that so let me
show you if you follow the mailing
conventions and building with Gradle
this is all that you had to do to build
a java project create a build Gradle
file and do this one line of code let's
see if it is does what it's advertised
so ray Braille installed which is also
download a zip file configure
environment variable called Gradle home
put in your path we had a grilled
command and there's another thing that I
can show you there and do clean let's
see what we have here okay up to date
let's do a build okay it took it was
really really fast and it did some
things it compile the classes jar them
up run
the test which in this case the one they
were none and do did some code analysis
did you follow the follows a check face
and it built in around two seconds so
let's see what happens if I attend to
build it again now it took a second and
noticed that all of the previous tests
have this cello marking up to date
because Gradle is a smart enough to
figure out if a task has to be run again
or not if it's found on the dag and it
has to run and it will figure out that
if the inputs and the outputs have be
changed if that is not the case then the
then the test can be escaped completely
so this is why great bills become faster
another reason why is that since version
10 they also have a demon mode so there
is a JVM running in the background the
first time you start Gradle you'll incur
in a small penalty of booster up in the
JVM but the next time it will be just
fast so if I make a change to this file
let's say welcome to shower one and
remember that the last time it took us
just one second let's do a build again
well quite fast let's do a bill again
much faster if you're still not
convinced how many of you had to work
with multi projects in maven a few do
you like it no okay let me show you
multi projecting rail so this project
there is a root project here and to
child projects multi-core and multi-x I
will help me I would make the extension
project except have a dependency on the
core project this is quite common so
here is all that I have to specify for
this particular project what I'm saying
in this dsl
is in the soup project node over there
I'm saying that every other project that
I it's below that belongs to my multi
project build should have the groovy
plugin applied so the probe replugging
also allows you to compile and run Ruby
test not just java source code and also
apply the maven plugin this is so that I
can publish artifacts to a maven
compliant repository then I also specify
my dependencies there's maven central or
I can specify any other repository that
follows the maven layout or academia
specified sorry local directory if
you're applying the glue be plugging you
have to define which group aversions you
want to work with because even though
Gradle has its own groovy version inside
it will not force that version on to
your project so you are free to choose
which birds we want all right so inside
this project now the core project i have
another mistake in a groovy class there
is and in the extension project i have
another group of class this could be
java classes call EXT extends from core
so let's see the build files for both of
these suits up to sub-projects empty on
the course of project and here i had to
specify the pendants ease the only one
that we really need is the dependency
are the multi-core I'm justified in a
dependency on commons lang to show you
what would be the syntax for adding
dependencies on anything that can be
found on a maven compliant repository
the last thing that you have to do in
order to close the circuit besides
specifying this particular bill files is
this guy setting start cradle without
this the multi project build will not
work in this file you specify which are
the name
so the paths of the projects that belong
to you multi build one this thing is
done then come back to the command line
tool and do Gradle clean at the root
level and notice that it actually calls
clean on the sub projects I'm going to
go inside the extension project and call
build our it at this point remember that
everything is clean ha it has figure out
that in order to build the extension
project we first have to build the core
project and in order to build the core
project because I didn't have group
installed it pulls in in the dependency
then goes and build the bills a cord
plug in there and then finish up
building the extension plugin let's do a
build again note is that it took 13
seconds out close to 14 seconds because
we queried the network and we did some
stuff now 1.3 seconds let's make a
change in the core let's bump the
version number 25 and let's call build
from the extension plug in again but you
recompile is the corp the guru version
of the corp project and then continues
with the extension and again if i do a
building once more time then everything
is up to date how cool is that i can for
this guy because I added naval support
called Gradle install this will generate
the jars for me and put the pawn files
this should be if they are not in the
route now there are in the sub projects
multicore i can actually see them here
the palm file for the core project is in
the differing from information that we
have for the extension project
it has a dependency some common slang
and my own multicore project right there
all this of course is tweakable the last
thing is great the last feature that I
want to show for Gradle is square for
see I environments because worry if you
cannot install Gradle on Jenkins for
some reason you are you are not a system
administrator and you can uninstall
Gradle on the machine that is building
Jenkins so what you do is that there is
a special file created right here well
we don't have it i think i have it on
another bill file i will copy it or do I
have it in another one hold a second I
try to make sure that i have it on
another one this is simple now there's
no the rapper way I'm going to copy from
the hood great bill file that I have
give hope Griffin so happens that grace
and Griffin are built with Gradle so I
know what to do with them build the
Gradle locate the rapper here is I'm
going to copy this task definition into
my route project there we go I think
this should be great 12 then once we do
this which is kind of like a recipe
let's call Gradle rapper we have to
bootstrap a command to that is called
the rapper and now have a new series of
files right here Gradle w and Gradle w
beth also this chart if you check in
these files into your project then you
can call them from the CI environment
just like this Gradle w and the same
commands that you will do with the
Gradle command so what this guy does is
it tries to figure out if you already
have a version of Gradle compatible
install if it does and it will download
from the network then configure it in a
way and put it in a in a default home
directory and then continue the job
so you can build a project wig cradle
and then ship it to a teammate that
doesn't grab have great on install as
long as you have the rapper then anybody
can build this project this is scented
something that's certainly not the other
build tools provide yeah I'll let this
guy run in background and then continue
with the next one everything we can come
back to it so yes the question is what
about ide support the greater where team
is actively looking into it there is a
good support in netbeans in Eclipse STS
and idea but it certainly can be
improved and they are actively looking
into it yes no question this is the it
just it supports coping like maven yes
Gradle has this notion of configurations
as a matter of fact the grooby library
that we had to add is one of the
internal configurations that they plug
in the group a plug-in adds to our bill
so maybe has just five or five or six
scopes with Gradle you can have as many
as you want you can have custom ones
here correct me I've mistaken Peter say
okay perfect for us another question
here
yes exactly so let's go into this multi
break file and at the top now this has a
blog and yes the plug-in was created in
at their box 2011 last year so it's
really good so if I'd add these two
dependencies here and these two plugins
ID on Eclipse oh let see it finished so
now I'm going to use a rapper let's
clean the this is everybody can see it
I'm going to use the rapper now and call
idea these will generate idea project
files for me and if I do the same thing
yep it's downloading what I need there
we go I can do the same thing for
eclipse I don't think there's a nibble
on for Grail itself it's an abyss flies
for Gradle model other way around and
this generates I'm in the right place
there are hidden files
there we yes correct so the idea can
also import an existing project so that
you can export import maven and you can
also import Gradle true and I have a
special visualization for greater
projects at least for the dependencies
last time I checked all right so what if
you are not able to use grade oh and you
are still stuck with end well there is a
nicer version with skull Gant Gant is a
groovier version of end both grilles and
Griffin use it for the command line tool
so the Grails come in and the Griffin
command use can't under the covers and I
think we are only the biggest open
source project that make use of gain
because believe it or not the Gantt
built uses Gradle to build itself Gant
it's still I would say this is kind of
like it's swinging is in maintenance
mode there are certainly all soft and so
many small features that may be added to
it so making sure that it's compatible
with the latest goober shop but no new
groundbreaking features will be added to
it but you still can use it but think of
the end as end which the ant is great
that you can tell it everything that you
want to do but it's bad because it's
like a guy that doesn't remember because
you can we have to tell it everything
you want to do and worse of it you have
to do it in XML take XML away put grew
bean that's can next one oh I switched
to fast let's change into testing
anybody here has previous experience
with ever driven development everybody
knows what we have a German development
s are supposed to be some people claim
hero driven development is test-driven
development don't write so what you
usually do is you say sit next to your
customer your stakeholder and write down
stories and from the stories then you
can fill out the blanks with code
there are many options out there perhaps
one of the most well-known in the non
java space is Cal Cooper from Ruby you
should come run in the JVM juice in
JRuby or you can pick this one ECB ECB
is a behavior driven development
framework starting 2008 also a patch a
license to it has good idea integration
with eclipse and some edid integration
in idea I'm not so sure about nevins
there are plugins for grace and Griffin
this means that you can run a CB s
scenarios in grails and ECB SN airs in
griffin and it so happens that I have
one of these things prepared but before
I move into ECB i also want to move into
the other testing framework that we have
that's what i can say there's the author
p rene de visser Spock and when I say
ass pop yes I mean this guy so a spark
is a testing dsl it's not just a testing
library think of it as j unit meets our
SPECT and some groovy magic and the
latest release is 06 and i had it from
good faith that the next release is just
few hours away Peter a few days maybe
it's close very very close so not to put
you on the on the hot spot right here
right so let's change into this
directory that already have this is a
Griffin application I love Griffin of
course I'm biased let's look at the
tests here I have a story this is my ECB
a story so what I have here is a groobee
asst script and I have a series of
definitions here an SNL with a texture
representation hey edition airy service
should file should be able to find work
Griffin and then a series of steps
separated by given when and then you can
see that the format is name of the step
some string and then a closure inside
that closure that block is where you put
the real code that exercises the
production code this is will be the
testing code
so it will read this thing we just get
the descriptions but it will run it we
will not only get a textual report of
all the steps that we have put also the
execution of the code now this may not
look so different from what you are used
to let me show you the spa conversion
actually has more scenarios what I like
about spark is that it challenges what
you understand from the groovy language
I'm from the JBL because notice what are
those method names there are strings
grube per set does not allow this is the
je vien de la la sit so what Spock does
is one crazy thing it talks to the
compiler and say hey you are no longer
in charge I'm gonna do what I want to do
and what I need to do with a biker and
this is what I'm going to do boom and it
puts everything in such a way that you
can assert code without making use of
the assert keyword is just an implicit
keyword because you are inside a special
block here using labels now if you found
power asserts in groovy 16 useful you
can thank thee a spark framework because
they were born in this spot framework
here I have another set of blocks here's
that the where I can expect that some
definition some butter ball will have a
special value may be equal to this
service code and notice that in this
other block I have something that looks
like a table like a data table when the
column names it so happens to match the
names that I'm making use of the
assertions so what's going to happen in
this method is that for every row that
is there the word Bible we take this
value and then the definition value will
check this value so this test is
actually three different tests and if i
use the unroll annotation I can change I
can even change the text of this method
to this make sure that this text is
substituted with a real value of the
variable given that particular iteration
so I'm going to run the tests and see
what we get as their result in the
reports this should be done by using
Griffin test app and let's run all the
tests I expect some than to fail because
I put it so that they will fail and show
you what happens in that case let's see
these were unit tests yes okay so there
we go we had three unit s happening then
one ECB story then we had three sparks
test happening and some other stuff that
is going over there okay let i will let
finished I do done one more time okay
there we go it's done so i can open the
reports target his report in HTML index
and there i see there is a figure that
was telling you a regular a
specification like the one we have
notice that the method name now uses the
real values substituted from each
iteration that this is definitely much
better now the story report is found in
another directory in another file this
should be test reports to sit ECB no
hTML is to be in unit there we go here
is a report that we as developers love
that has numbers and whatnot and this is
the the report that the stakeholders
like because this is the language that
they understand right let's go back
we're almost there guys we have a couple
more things to see konark corner is a
static code analysis tool
there are plugins for grills and Griffin
and even Gradle the what is it the check
face that we saw earlier when running
Gradle if you're running groovy code
then it will use code narc to check
their code or if you're running java you
use checks out now you can think of
konark as P and D meets check style
meets fine box for a groovy it's highly
extensible you can create your own your
own rules and it also has a lil sis
little brother called G matrix G matrix
provides basic matrix for your code like
complex cyclomatic complexity and if you
happen to run your project with awesome
and if it's great or not you run your
project with cover to wrap and
geometries you can calculate the crap
metric you can go to prep for j org and
you can see what you can read about what
is a crap metric then i also like to
introduce jeepers it's this is a library
for doing concurrent operations now you
probably have heard a scholar before and
for a while of maybe for a couple of
years the scallop people have been
pushed actors as the Silver Bullet for
solving concurrency problems that was
before now they have more options
definitely there are no silver bullets
so that's why jeepers not only delivers
the actor model but also other stuff
like and we have one of the authors one
of the members of jeepers a still at the
back there clinic I don't know if we
have SCM we certainly have data flow and
I don't have an example here but what's
great about jeepers is that in some
cases is a DSL on top of the fourth
joint framework that is providing jdk 7
so that's good and if there is in the
future integration with opencl believe
me that jeepers will be able to do that
too there are other projects that we see
and we
at a time there is a rat pack which is a
minimalist web framework in the rail
space we have Sinatra in the groovy
space we have rat pack so it's pretty
much the same thing you only define some
routes and then you're off to go it
doesn't provide the main classes it
doesn't provide persistency you have to
bring that into your application that
you really need it so Rat Pack is a nice
way to build rest-based interfaces the
other project that i do have example
here is g contracts and let's see that
in the groovy console i think i have it
in one level up yes groovy console key
contracts contracts test g contracts the
livers this time by contract on groovy
source code it makes use of annotations
smaller actually there we go i hope that
is visible at the back so what it does
is if you annotate your class with adam
variant at requires and an insurer's you
can define class invariants
preconditions and postconditions for
your methods now I know this is a very
trivial example where my preconditions
and postconditions are pretty much what
the business code is there but let's see
I can create an account and the amount
has to be bigger than 0 and at the end
the balance property of my account has
to be the same as the amount i sent as
an argument to the constructor if I
deposit something the amount has to be
bigger than 0 and the new balance has to
be equal to the old balance plus what I
had just deposit and if I withdraw I
cannot withdraw a negative number and I
cannot withdraw less than I have on my
account so once that I had this thing
set up I could create an account and
then deposit 100,000 actually euros or
some other currency and then withdraw 10
from it so if i run it it runs fine you
can see at the bottom barely that
balance is 1,000
then after withdrawing is 990 let's see
if I try to create an account with
negative amounts I don't know what you
want to do it what do you want to own
the bank before actually having
something with them I don't think so so
yes this guy throws an exception say
there is a precondition validation here
okay let's return to a positive value
let's de plus it some more and then
tried to ask the perhaps the bank for a
loan I want to the pass to withdraw
5,000 of course my account has less than
that and then it fails again another
precondition a nice thing about G
contract it also makes use of power
sessions so you can know exactly where
the failure is now contracts are not a
substitute for proper unit testing but
but they are a very nice addition and
complement to doing unit and integration
testing there are more projects that i
can show you but there's definitely not
enough time in one hour so you are more
than welcome to ask any questions that
you have and you can follow you can send
me any emails you have questions
regarding what we see in today or any
other group projects and really into the
groovy ecosystem so just let me know
thank you very much
so there's a question we are here at the
front what about grip plus plus plus
plus is a project that provides a static
compilation but you might have heard
that groupie 20 already provides a SATA
compilation a static type checking so is
there room for board implementations
well the grip plus plus project is still
out there but I don't think is now is
complete being actively maintained
anymore our this slice up yes they are
they are in a SlideShare and they will
be add up at the jarwin I want to also
tweet them when they are ready do if I
participate in rent a canoe yes I'm a
canoeing there is this proc already
canoeing you can hire us for free for
half a day we can come to your company
and do pair programming of course it's a
much better offer for people that are
currently located in in Europe but we
have done it in anywhere around the
world so if you are willing to have us
then we'll be there thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
