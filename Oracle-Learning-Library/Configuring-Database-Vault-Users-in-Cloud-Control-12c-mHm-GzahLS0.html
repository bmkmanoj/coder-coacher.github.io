for Oracle server technologies let's
assume we have two database instances
MRAP for cloud control and/or CL with
database vault configured the management
agent has discovered our CL and it is
promoted to be a cloud control target we
have three database void users in our CL
this video shows you how to set them up
to have access via cloud control connect
as an enterprise manager administrator
who has the privilege to create new
administrators then select setup
security administrators and click create
enter the information for the Oracle
user account in M rep as shown on this
page and then click Next accept the
default selected roles of M user in
public and click Next scroll to the
bottom of the page and Edie
select the OCR database instance click
this pencil icon to edit the privileges
and add the connect target privilege for
this user then click Next and now review
the definition for the léo DV owner here
then click finish note the new user has
been created create the other users in a
very similar way I'm not going through
every step I will just show you at the
end the review of each user so here we
are reviewing the definition of the beer
Account Manager on M rep with the M user
roles public role in the connect Target
privilege and we click finish and here
is the last user that we wanted to show
in this video
test as one of the new users the first
time you login you have a choice to set
up accessibility preferences which we
will do later you also have a choice to
set up your welcome page and I will
choose databases for this user instead
of the database load mapper I prefer
using the search list they can simply
click on the link of the database the
database homepage appears and here a
select security database vault and login
to the OCR database the user now views
the Oracle database void information
through cloud control so users just so
how to configure database void users in
cloud control they need to have at a
minimum the e/m user role and the public
one and then the connect target
privilege for their promoted target
