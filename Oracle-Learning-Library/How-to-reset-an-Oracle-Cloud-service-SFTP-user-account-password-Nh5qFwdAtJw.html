Oracle cloud service SFTP user account
password you use SFTP user accounts to
upload and download files related to
your Oracle cloud service now you must
be an identity domain administrator to
set up SFTP user accounts okay so let's
sign in to your Oracle cloud service on
logmein I'm presented with the my
services page and i have three services
listed database database to and java
this database is associated with java
service i'll go ahead and click on these
services and from the overview tab i'll
get details that i need that is
specifically service SFTP details for
this exercise what i want to know is the
username for this service which is trial
011 on a related note each identity
domain also has an SFTP user name that
SFTP user name is used for archiving
data so be aware each identity domain
has its own SFTP user in each service
has its own SFTP user so let me just go
back and show you compare that with this
other database service alright i'll
scroll down here so you can see a user
name here is different now these are
both lenders same identity domain name
so the this username for identity domain
SFTP users the same the subtle
difference but i want to point that out
and then likewise for java
let's scroll down to SFTP details this
is a whole nother trial user again okay
so let's go back to the original
database service let's click on database
let's scroll down so we're going to
change the SFTP user name password for
this database service this is trial of
11 so to do that I'm going to go to the
identity console click on manage users
you can shorten your search results with
that SFTP string okay there it is trial
011 or 20 11 select that click reset
password it's very important you select
manually change password
and then confirm your new password click
reset password and that's it passwords
changed successfully and now ready for
use with FTP transactions I'll show you
how to deal with data export in another
video but for now that concludes our
effort to set up an SFTP user account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
