some hints and tips for tailoring the
oracle enterprise data quality customer
data services pack so if we want to
tailor a CD s service how should we go
about it well I'd argue that the first
step is always to investigate what that
service does and how it does it so let's
take an example let's say that you
wanted to tailor real-time entity
matching what would you do well
associated with that service there will
be one or more jobs so you'd go to Ed
Q's director user interface and you'd
open the job so there's a job for
example called real-time entity match
open that job up in the director user
interface and from the job manager
you'll get a great overview of how the
service works and what it does because
of from the job manager you can see all
of the processes that the job calls
which order they're called in and you
can also see any data interfaces or all
of the data interfaces and any web
services that are used by the job you
can see all of that from the job manager
often the processes are really
intuitively named so just from looking
at the job manager you probably get a
good idea of what a particular service
is doing but if you want more detail you
can drill down from the job manager into
individual processes to really see
exactly what they're doing ok so the job
manager will give you a great overview
of our service works which data
interfaces it's using which web services
it's using this real-time or what stage
data it's using if it's a batch job and
also remember there are mappings between
the data interfaces and the web services
or stage data as well so start with the
job manager try and get an idea of what
the job is doing what the service is
trying to accomplish
now let's move on to one particular
scenario if you like which is adding a
new attribute to a CD s service so if
you want to add a new attribute what
should you do well first of all again
start from the job manager look at the
service look at the job the main job in
the job manager and look at the data
interfaces that that job uses so you'll
see that each process within the job
will have a data interface that's used
for inputs and the same or sometimes a
different data interface used for output
and if you want to pass a new attribute
into that service you need to add that
new attribute the new field in other
words to each of the data interfaces
used in the job or at least as far as
you want the the attribute to persist
through the job might not be exactly to
the end always so you need to add a new
attribute we to the data interfaces now
the way that the data will come in is
either it will come in through stage
data or if it's real time it will come
in through a web service so you also
need to make sure that you add your new
field your new attribute to any web
services or stage data used by the job
too and there are mappings from the web
services or the stage data to the data
interfaces because the data interfaces
are just attribute templates really so
as well as adding the attribute you also
need to make sure that you configure the
mappings so that that any value coming
in in your new attribute in the web
service is mapped to and is passed to
the appropriate attribute in the data
interface ok so do cake over the
mappings as well
now that gives you a new attribute a new
field but you can think of that as a
container and obviously you need to fill
that container that new field or
attribute with data you need to populate
it and the way that you populate an
attribute with a value is via a reader
and a writer win each process within
your job so within your processes you'll
see that each process usually will start
with the reader and will end with a
writer and the reader sucks the values
if you like in each field into the
process and the writer pushes them out
at the other end so you need to make
sure that as well as just having the
empty container the field you actually
pull data into it and you push data out
of it and that's a matter of configuring
the reader and the writer within each
process inside your job to make sure
that your new fields or attributes in
other words are populated at the outset
of the job and at the end of the job as
well when we push the data out so that
the value is there for the next job in
the chain and finally the last piece of
this really is to make sure that you you
think carefully about which processors
within your jobs processes need to be
configured to work with your new
attribute so what are the touch points
in other words clearly if it's a new
attribute to be used in matching one of
them would be the match processor but
you may have some other processors that
you need to push the data to to prepare
it as well so also bear that in mind so
two more hints and tips then for
tailoring CD s firstly make your changes
very visible why do that well at the
moment you may well understand what
you've been doing hopefully you do but
if you come back to the later stage
patzer in a year's time it
might not be so obvious so for your own
sake annotate your changes but even more
so it's going to be important for anyone
else who has to work on the process
you've been tailoring at a later stage
so always ask yourself the question
could someone else looking at what I've
done understand what I've done and how
I've done it and perhaps even why I've
done it and also it's important to
annotate your changes and make them very
visible in case you later have to
upgrade because then it's obviously
important to know what you've changed so
how can you go about making your changes
visible well the first tip is use
directors canvas notes so just
right-click on the canvas and add a
canvas note and you can use that just to
put in annotations about what you've
done and secondly instead of changing an
existing process within a job consider
adding a whole new process to that job
because then your changes can be
contained and isolated if you like
within that one new process and if you
give it a sensible name perhaps starting
with word tailored then it can be very
obvious that it's a new process you've
added which contains your changes so
make your changes visible make them
obvious so finally let me tell you about
testing your tailored jobs first of all
when you want to test a job that you
tailored run it from the director user
interface rather than the server console
director is the user interface that we
use for testing and development purposes
so use that one rather than the server
console which is where we run jobs from
for production live environments to use
the director user interface now when you
run the tailored version of the job to
test it you probably want to take a copy
of the job I'll explain why in a minute
and you want to run it with drill downs
on results enabled in the processes or
at least the process that you've changed
possibly all of the processes
so when you run jobs for live certainly
in CVS results drill downs are disabled
and that's because there's an i/o load
and IO overhead on writing out results
but for testing purposes you want to see
what your job is done so obviously you
want to be able to look at the results
and that means that you need to enable
the drill downs in on results and i'll
show you how in a moment or two now if
you're testing a real time job then once
you've put some test data in probably
using the web service tester you'll need
to cancel the job to stop it running and
when you cancel it there are three
options and one of those options which
is called stop as quickly as possible
will not save results so if you choose
that option you won't see the results
that your process produces which means
you won't be able to evaluate whether
it's worked so make sure when you stop
your real time jobs for testing purposes
you use one of the options which will
enable you to be able to see the results
afterwards which will save the results
and I'll show you that in a moment when
I demo it now lastly the CD s jobs and
the processes by and large aren't
designed to be run stand alone so if you
want to test a particular job or process
then usually you're going to have to run
one or more predecessor jobs or
processes first okay so you need to work
out what those predecessor jobs are
processes are and run them otherwise
when you try and run your job it'll
error out because usually there's some
data missing that it expects to be there
okay and what I'll do in just a moment
is I'll demo how to test a tailor job
and I'll show you all of that in action
let me show you how you can test a
tailored job in CD s now to test the
tailor job you need to run it usually if
we're running jobs in a production live
environment we do that from the server
console user interface that's our
operations user interface but we do add
development and our testing from the
director user interface which is the one
that you can see here so I min director
I'm in the ed Q CD s project there and
the job that I've been tailoring is this
one real time entity merch let's just
open it on the canvas and have a quick
look at it and you can see the processes
here and I've added a new process called
tailored standardization just to change
the way that standardization is done
before we get to the match entity
process at the bottom here so I've got a
new process there now I could run that
job in director just by right-clicking
in it and then selecting run and if you
look at the tasks window in the bottom
left hand corner you can see the job is
planning and in a moment it will start
to run but pretty soon we're going to
notice it error out to keep your eye on
that task window and about bottom
left-hand corner and the reason that it
will error out is the job is not really
designed to be run on its own some
predecessor processes need to be run
first there's the error okay so won't
work if you just run it on its own now
let's take a look at the real time start
all jump this is an uber job if you like
a super job that starts all of the other
real time services and before it does
that it actually runs the predecessor
processes which they require so let's
open it and just have a look and in the
first few pages you hear these are the
predecessor processes that it's running
and then loading various bits of stage
data that are required by the real time
services and then when it's done all
that loading right at the bottom in the
last phase that's where it starts the
real time services initiate real time
services there that's right clicking
configure and what we see there are a
number of triggers and each trigger
starts one of the real time
for the real time services and there's
the real time entity match trigger that
starts that job ok so I could test
real-time entity match just by running
real time startled but I'm not going to
do it that way why not well a couple of
reasons first of all we want to test
quickly because we may have to iterate
around a number of test cycles to get
things right and this real-time start
old job it's doing a lot of work that
isn't actually required by the real-time
entity match process so here its name
you up it's loading up individual named
maps but we don't need that for entity
matching okay we don't need to run all
of these phases and we don't need to
initiate all of the real time services
either that's just going to take
bandwidth and time all we want to do is
start real-time entity much and also
we'll look some of the processes if we
do that so let's not run real-time start
all as it is instead let's right-click
let's copy it and we're going to just
paste it into the jobs node so we're
going to create a copy in other words
just for testing purposes and we'll call
it to test real-time startled there we
go okay so now we have a copy and in
that copy let's just open the copy and
close up the standard version and that
copy we're going to disable the first
few phases which relates to individual
match preparation so we don't need to
run those because it's entity matching
that we're actually interested in here
so we can disable the first few of these
and we'll just keep the last few sorry
we need that one less to do with
entities and then in the initiate real
time services face let's configure that
right click configure we're going to
delete all of these triggers because we
don't need to start all of the services
we're even going to delete the entity
match trigger and I'll tell you why in
just a moment let me just get rid of
these triggers will leave the phase
there but we'll make it empty for the
time being and we'll save that test
real-time startled job
now if I go back to the real time entity
match job that's the one I'm really
interested in and if I just look at the
process i've added tailored
standardization let's look at the
configuration of it let's just double
click it so within the job when it runs
the results drill down is set to none
now that's as it should be for
production live jobs or processes when
they run with in production life jobs
because there's an i/o load and I
overhead if you like on writing out
results so usually we don't do that in
production jobs because we want them to
run as quickly as possible but when
we're testing we do want to write the
results we do want to have to be able to
do a results drill down in the director
results browser to look at what this new
process has done to the data that's
exactly why we're testing so we could
change this results drill down option to
all but obviously there'd be a little
bit of a danger that we might forget
we've done that and perhaps sir leave it
like that in the live production job so
instead of doing that in this job that's
again right-click the job real-time
entity match takes take a copy of it
we're going to clone it ok we'll just
paste our copy back into the jobs node
there we go and again we'll change the
name to test whoops oh yeah let's try
that again just rename it here instead
or you want that to say test real-time
entity match there we go so we're just
going to use this for testing not for
anything else and what we'll do in that
test real-time entity match we'll just
go into the configuration the runtime
configuration if you like of the
tailored standardization process that
we've added and we'll set the results
drill down to all so now we're going to
keep results that we can look at the
results browser from this Taylor process
we might actually want to do it for some
of the other processes as well to see
what they're doing but for now I won't
do that i'm just going to save that job
there we go and then I go into my test
real-time startled configured the
initiate real time services phase and
I'm going to add a trigger for my test
real-time entity much job and we'll save
that too okay so now I've got a test
version of real-time startled that only
starts the bits that I want to only
loads the maps and so on that I want to
load and I've got a test version of the
real time entity match as well with the
results drill down switched on so that
we can see what's happening in that
process you can switch it on and off on
a process bread process basis within the
job so having done that let's just clear
these errors from the task window and
will now run our test real time starts
all job there we go so it will start to
run now and you can see it's doing its
preparation they're loading up those
various maps that are required and in a
moment or two it will start and it's
doing it now the real some entity merge
jobs so without all of those other
things running it's actually quite quick
anyway I'll stop recording for a minute
and I'll come back to you in a moment
and we'll go into the web service tester
and we'll do a bit of testing so that we
can look at the results of our tailored
process so the real-time entity match
job is running you can see it running
here and let's go to the web service
tester and in the web service test drive
called the entity match service and I
put in some data in two records just
putting the name Lukas limited and a
website www Lucas net and I've put
exactly the same information in the
second record so we should get a match
let's send it and we can see on the
right indeed we have got a match that's
great not really interested in that
match what we want to do is look at the
results from our tailored
standardization process so let's go back
to director there is the process running
in the task window there let's right
click on the process and choose cancel
and we've got three choices here now if
we choose stoppers
is possible the results from the process
will not be saved and obviously we want
to see the results in particular those
from our tailored standardization
process so we won't choose that one in
some ways the best one to choose is shut
down web services because that will
cleanly stop any web services that are
running and closing the open results
windows but because I'm quite confident
that actually I've already sent one what
one package if you like through the web
service to the job therefore the results
window will be closed so i'm just going
to stop but save results generated so
far that's a bit quicker than shutting
down the web service in this case and
this will cancel the job for us and stop
it and in a moment I come back to you
and show you the results it'll just take
a minute or so to cancel it so you can
see in the tasks window that the entity
match job has stopped and so let's go
and have a look at the results then now
to do that we're going to open up the
process is node and first of all I'm
going to just show you what it's like if
we look at one of the other processes
from the real same entity match job so
if we look at let's say this one
standardized entity that's part of the
job as well now for this process we
didn't set the drill down to all auto
sample it was left and none so if I
click any of the processes can you see
here in the results browser just says no
results to display okay they results the
display and I'll say that for every
processor there and the reason it will
do that is because we didn't set the
results drill down but if we go into our
tailored standardization process here
for this one we did set the results
drill down it's not the most exciting
process in the world only one processor
I'm afraid but click on these sorry
click on the upper case here and you
will indeed see the results okay I'll
actually run this
time so that's why there's full records
there but anyway it has saved the
results all it's doing is upper casing
that was Lucas limited the the name that
I put in in the web service and there's
the the uppercase version of it okay so
obviously very simple process not a very
realistic example of tailoring but it
does show you how we can see the results
as long as we set the results drill down
to either all which is probably the
thing you should do most the time
testing or to sample and when you run in
production make sure that the results
drill down is disabled and is set to
none</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
