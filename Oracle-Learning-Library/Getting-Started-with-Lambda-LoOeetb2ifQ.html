coming to Java 8 and this video is a
quick introduction to lambda expressions
and an Oracle by example web tutorial or
obe on lambda expressions so I'm just
going to show you a quick example and
then hopefully you can take a look at
the obe
and dig in more if you're interested so
what I'm going to start with here is
we're going to sort a list of persons
and here's the class that defines person
we've got a give a name a surname you
know first and last name age gender
various attributes there and we're gonna
work off a list of those so let's look
at our test class here I have called
that comparator test I'm going to scroll
down here and the first thing we should
see is our list there on line 14 and
that's what we're going to work off of
and to sort a list one way you can do
that in Java is with a comparator and so
that's done here I'm gonna highlight
that and this is calling the collections
class and the sort method so you see
there we're passing in the person list
and then we're making it an anonymous
inner class out of a comparator out of
the comparator interface we've got you
see it's of type person or we've got a
compare method or we're passing in
person objects and then in the body of
the method you'll see we're returning a
comparison of the surname and so that
should sort the list in ascending order
so it's fairly easy to read but it's
still not perfect there's a lot of
brackets there are a lot of parentheses
it's pretty verbose for what we're doing
we just want to say sort the list
descending and we do a lot of work to
basically make that happen so let's
scroll down further and see how we would
do that with lambda expressions so with
lambda expressions
I can do the same thing here on line 30
and 31
so I'm highlighting that line and we can
see here that I'm going to sign the
lambda expression to a comparator
interface instance like that and notice
that the syntax is kind of the same sort
of thing but just a heck of a lot
shorter so I've got I'm passing in
persons again p1 p2 and I'm also doing
it compared to we have the arrow token
there that indicates this is a lambda
expression and I just give it the
expression that I've basically
accomplished the same thing I did up
above with all that code but this is
going to do a descending story so I name
the instance period instance variable
their sort surname descending so if we
go down here when we call our
collections class and the sort method
and see there that's quite a bit easier
to read between the two I think it's
makes a lot more sense and then let's
see what happens when we run this class
so I'm going to just run it and you can
see here down here in the output window
I've got a ascending list first and then
a descending was second so that's it
that's basically how a lambda
expressions work or that's a real simple
example so if you want a lot more
information and a lot of examples in
source code please take a look at the
