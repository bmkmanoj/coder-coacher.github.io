you a couple of features of the mobile
expense management module they are the
approval and rejection of expense
reports these features can be used by
approvers that are responsible for
approving or rejecting expense reports
with the mobile application the approver
can perform these tasks using their
mobile device from anywhere they can
make a phone call i will be using an
iphone for today's demonstration but
remember you can also use blackberry and
android devices as well as the ipad so
let's get started as you can see i have
added the expense management icon to my
iphones desktop so all i need to do is
tap on it to get it started this is the
user authentication screen for our
mobile applications all you need to do
is type in your standard JD edwards user
ID and password to get started tap the
login button the security model actually
uses our standard JD Edwards security so
I'm signing in as an approver so I can
approve and reject expense reports
here's the expense management home
screen as you can see we have three
separate menu options for expense
management as well as a very nice pie
chart this demonstration will be for the
approve expense reports functionality
since my role is an approver my pie
chart gives me the information on my
employees expense reports if I was not
an approver the graph would only show my
response reports to approve or reject
expense reports you can either tap on
the approved expense reports menu item
or tap in the area of the graph showing
the reports in the approver status so
I've just tapped on the graph so this
next screen that shows up is a list of
all the expense reports that are
awaiting my approval I'm going to review
the first expense report on my list and
to do so only have to do is tap on it as
you can see at the top there has been at
the least one exception item on this
report if I want to review the expense
exceptions I can also scroll up and see
that this
it actually has two of them so I want to
see what this car rental is all about so
I just have to tap on the little carrot
here and it shows me the detail behind
the report so for this example this
employee already gave me a heads-up that
he had a couple of items on his report
that were an exception and I've decided
to go ahead and accept the report all I
need to do is tap on the approve button
then I get this little approval
confirmation window and I press approve
again so once the approval is processed
I will actually see the next report in
the list for approving so this is the
next one forklift Miller I could just
have easily cancelled my approval if I
decided not to do it so once i'm here
there are some buttons here at the top
and i can actually scroll through all of
the other reports awaiting my approval
so I'm actually going to stop here at
Maryland Barrett she also has an
exception on her report so I'm going to
go in and look at it so there's a meals
expense that succeeded its amount you
can no that's okay but what I see here
though is that she's charged a meal to a
work order I don't think this is
necessarily appropriate so I'm going to
go ahead and reject this expense report
so all i need to do is tap on the reject
button and then i select the reason and
then i can type in a comment so I'm
going to to let her know that should not
be charged to a work order
when i'm done with that you just go back
up here and I confirm my rejection so
once the confirmation of my rejection
has been processed I'll go back to the
next report in the list so I'm done with
this task for right now so I'm just
going to go and impress the reports
button to go back to my main list and as
you can see the two reports that the one
that I approved and one I rejected are
no longer in my list you'll also notice
that there we have buttons here that say
home and the other one said reports you
won't see a back button on our screen
the buttons will always be labeled with
the information of where you're going to
go to next so as you can see from this
demo it's very simple to use all this
new functionality so be sure to view the
additional video on how to enter an
expense report and i hope you're as
excited about this new functionality as
we are thank you for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
