cloud control 12c demo series focusing
on the best practices foreseeable
applications management this screen
watch is part of a series on service
level measurement or slm for simple
applications welcome to part 3 of Siebel
best practices in service level
management in our first green wat we
show how to record daily transaction
using open screen in the second screen
watch we show how to model the service
based on the synthetic transition that
was created in the first screen watch
part of death service modeling include
performance and usage metrics in this
screen watch we will demonstrate it how
to create the service level agreement
based on the promise and use the g
metrics that we created in the second
screen watch the first step in creating
service level agreement is to configure
service level agreement second step is
to define one or more service level
objectives service level objective
measures Ottomans of one or more
indicators for a specified measurement
window therefore in thirst them will
Chris service level indicators service
level indicators allows service level up
tails to be measured and quantified
after we create our service level
agreement we can explore a service
dashboard and reports first we will look
at the performance and usage metrics
that we created in the previous can
watch in the previous screen watch our
demos really creating one metric for
performance and one metric usage after i
create the service i added more
problerms metric than usage metrics to
see our loved ones and use the D matrix
click the chart tab and you'll see my
performance metrics on the left side and
the UCD matrix on the right side so this
is the additional performance and usage
metrics that I created after service has
been created now that we've seen our
metrics we can build a service level
agreement based on this matrix let's
start off career answer
level agreement bringing down the menu
from generic service go to service level
agreement click configuration this is
the first step in creating new service
level agreement click create a button
and neymar service level agreement as
availability by default only time
periods with obstacles for the service
target are considered as meeting the SLA
requirements I'll change the service
level agreement period sdlc click OK and
now I'll include the blackout times as
meeting SLA including blackout times
means if your systems in down status due
to the plan down time we consider that
time period as available in terms of
computing SLA click Next in this step
will create the service level objectives
for our availability SLA in case you
have a multiple SLO for your service
level agreement it is recommended to
choose all service level objectives must
be banned let's create a 1 SLO for our
availability SLA all named our SLO as
stairs and set the expected service
level as 85% and one your level as
ninety percent since I want my service
to be available for 24 by 7 i'll set the
minimum window time as all day
monitoring however if you want to ensure
your serviceability during only critical
pd hours only you can choose appropriate
option from your opinions calendar click
ok and let's go to next step here we
define our service level indicators of a
target stairs to be up the service level
indicator is considered to be violated
if the rules specify below email is to
false next we can either enable the SLA
now or scheduled to be enable you later
once we enabled SLA we cannot enter SLA
anymore for this demo I'll choose do not
able in case I need to edit the SLA
later click
and we'll review our configuration
before we submit the job as you can see
our availability SLA has been created
and it will be remain in deposition
until we enable manually similarly I
create the preference SLA and associate
the CPU SLO to my performance SLA I
enable both availability and performance
SLA now that we create the SLA for
availability and performance let's take
a look at the dashboard by going to
service level agreement and dashboard in
this desk world I can see my promise SLA
is on the left side and my availability
SLA is on the right side for performance
SLA I have a to SL OH total response
time and cpu for total response time I
can also see the service level
indicators by clicking this one and I
will see the chart of my service level
indicators for my total response time
objectives if I want to see my cpu
service level indicators click the CPU
SLO and click the service level
indicators and you will see my cpu
usages and if you want to see as a table
view you can click the table view
service level agreement dashboard is a
good place to check your status of SLA
in an ad hoc basis you can check the
service level objectives and if there is
any validation you can examine its
corresponding service level indicators
if you wanna see the weekly or monthly
report on services or s delays we can
check by going to IP report and going
down to dashboard and click for services
an SLA dashboard and check the target is
our civil service and click continue
this dashboard shows are super services
and civil services SLA information it
shows our performance and usage in
matrix of our zebra service it also
shows a data for the last 24 hours in
last 7
days and last four months click the
stress button will bring to the
availability of our civil service for
the last 24 hours and if you want to see
the data for the last seven days or last
31 days you can go by view down here in
the availability click buy this feeble
test will show the status of our beacon
and on the table down here shows the
alerts that was generated for this
particular civil service so this
concludes our civil service dashboard
and SLA dashboard this can want to show
you how to create service level
agreement based on the metrics that were
created for receivables and daily
transaction establishing service level
agreement for a certain period of time
can promote the quality of service
lastly service provider can use
dashboard and reports to monitor the
compliance of SLA this concludes our
part 3 of a civil best practices in
service level management thank you for
