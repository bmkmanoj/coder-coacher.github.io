final horn for the course as you have
seen several times the project for this
course is based on this problem domain
that we need to build an embedded device
that will monitor shipping containers
specifically when the door the container
is opened or closed the temperature and
possibly the barometric pressure in the
container and the location of the
container as it travels all of this data
must be stored locally an available upon
request to be downloaded to a client
application for display and analysis so
far we have concentrated on making
individual midlet applications that be
combined into a single monolithic
application in Lesson four however in
this lesson Simon introduced the idea of
inter midlet communication so we can now
think about dividing the code up into
separate Suites in this proposed
architecture one suite is a system
controller suite which contains a midlet
to process communication requests via
IMC inter midlet communication and
record any messages received in the
local persistence store the rms separate
client-server midlet provides a way to
read the RMS and send the data to a
client via socket connection in this
design we can separate the sensors the
door the temperature and GPS sensors
into individual suites this approach is
advantageous for future upgrades and
replacement of an individual sensor
suite without impacting the rest of the
application in this architecture events
from the door are only sent when the
door is opened only asynchronously and
only when the door is open for a
specific period of time the temperature
and GPS sensors are also asynchronous
and they send events
put your reading or position and
velocity reading had regular intervals
that are determined by the sensor code
not by the system controller and finally
again the client can make a request of
the server of the client server rather
to get data from the RMS over a
well-known socket connection this
architecture is focused on separation of
concerns the system controller Swede is
only responsible for managing the RMS
every event string received by the
system controller is simply stored in
the RMS we could change the underlying
message protocol without having to
modify this is some controller in any
way likewise by separating the sensors
from the system controller we can
replace a sensor without having to
completely rewrite the application let's
see a demo of this design in action ok
I'm going to start by running the system
controller right click and I'll select
run ok then I select system controller
as the inlet that I wish to run and this
is the controller has started up and now
it's waiting for those connections
waiting for connections from the sensors
for data that data events that it will
then record into the RMS so let's go
ahead and start the other sensors so
I'll start by running the door sensor
and then I'll follow it up with the GPS
sensor and finally with the temperature
sensor and then let's go back and take a
look at what's happening in the console
so here we're now seeing the door sensor
is running GPS sensor is running the
temperature sensor is running the two
events the GPS is reading every 15
seconds the temperature is reading every
50
seconds now I'll hold down the button so
I'm going to go ahead and hold the
button down and then what will happen is
I'll get a door open event now if I go
ahead and run reader midlet we can see
all the events so I'm going to run that
project or run that midland rather so
there were 11 events that were recorded
at the time that the reader midland ran
and here are the 11 events so some gps
events temperature event gps event
temperature van so on here's my door
event record number 9 so now let me go
ahead and run the server midlet and plot
those using the visual client okay
here's visual client running now we'll
click connect I'll read the data so now
we're going to read all the data from
the RMS takes a little while to bring
over all the strings and process them so
these are all the events since i started
my application and here are all the
positions i've taken basically all the
data that I've collected I can now plot
and when i disconnect basically all I'll
disconnect from the RMS and I can read
more data at a later date so here I can
click connect and read again you'll see
more temperature readings have been
collected since the last time i read
this is going to plot all the way out to
whatever the last reading was at 180
seconds so what you're going to do in
this homework is you are going to build
or you're going to write the code
necessary for gps sensor and temperature
sensor to send their asynchronous
messages to the system control that's
the homework for part two of this lesson
and then later you're going to work on
actually having that using the system
controller
to to automatically launch those
applications so we don't have to go
through that process of manually
launching all that code so again if you
run it any questions or problems please
post your messages or post your
questions to the forum and we'll do our
best to answer them and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
