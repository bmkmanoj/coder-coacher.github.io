this test master database you'll see
that since we already know this is a
test master database the options here
have changed from what we saw earlier
and now we can create a snapshot clone
from the test master database on the
create snapshot clone pluggable database
page that preferred credentials are
again already set for me on the
destination side of the page I can
provide a meaningful name for the
pluggable database and a display name
means change the display name for now I
also need to provide a password for the
pdb administrator notice here I have the
option to claim the pluggable database
into a different container database I'm
claiming this pluggable database in the
same container databases production so
I'll leave this unchecked I also need to
provide the ASM credentials the test
master and the clone need to be within a
single ASM installation so the ASM
cluster has to be the same page we're
looking at actually has two flavors one
is the simple interface we just looked
at we can click the clone button to
clone this environment we can also click
on the advanced button to walk through a
more advanced configuration if we do
that you can see on the second screen
that we can change the sparse disk group
here and we also have the ability to
change other Peter be level options the
good thing about this wizard is from any
steps such as where i am now if you're
satisfied with all the inputs you can
immediately click clone rather than
stepping through the remaining step to
the wizard now I can watch the cloning
process again I'll do and expand all on
this so we can see all the procedure
steps so what we're doing now is
creating a snapshot clone of the test
master database which is your might
recall is around 560 517 gigabytes in
size I can just refresh the screen a
couple of times here and you can see the
process completes very quickly in fact
it's only taken about five seconds to
is equal for creating the clone and you
can see the sequel here what we're
actually doing is as you'd expect
creating a pluggable database from the
test master we specified this vast disk
group and we've got the snapshot copy
option on the command here the actual
execution of the script only takes
around 11 seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
