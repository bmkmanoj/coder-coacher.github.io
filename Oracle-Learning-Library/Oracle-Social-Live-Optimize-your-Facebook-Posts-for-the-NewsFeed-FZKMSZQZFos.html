social life this afternoon we'll be
talking to you about the facebook news
feed I'm Serov AB Ulis and I'm joined
with Sarah to thomas's both of us are on
the social partnerships team here in
North America we're really looking
forward to the presentation today and we
hope that you are too
of utilizing facebook posts to make your
brand really well-known so with that
Sarah Thomas this is going to leave the
first part of the painting as far as
talking to us about strategy and then
I'm going to move through and talk about
how to utilize their strategies using
the SRM tool hi everyone thanks Sarah we
made it easy for you we both got the
same names those different views that's
who we are there's two pictures up you
can tweet with us at the pump system at
Sarabeth's so jumping into this people
have made some changes to them newsfeed
they've made some changes to the
interface which you may have seen in the
news recently we're not really going to
focus on that today what we're going to
focus on are some changes they have made
to the back end to the algorithm it
really favors newsworthy content via URL
shares as a user of facebook you
probably have noticed this yourself when
you've been scrolling through your
newsfeed seeing more and more news
stories that have been either prepared
by your friends or shared by stages
shared by pages maybe even that you
don't even like but your friends have
engaged with that context what i mean by
URL shares there is those are the posts
that are the shares of content from
websites that have the metadata
associated with the original links that
hold the content on the website so brand
now that could be considered content
creators and that's just another word
for a brand that could be putting out
this newsworthy content that Facebook
would be referring either identified by
Facebook or just those content creators
that are putting out the newsworthy type
of posts they will be favored over other
brands that posts things like
promotional content sales related
content memes have become very very
popular on Facebook and Facebook really
wants to get more towards be a really
quality content over the kind of fun and
sticky sort of means that have been
really popular in the past
kind of year to year at how so Facebook
really wants to take the market share
obviously from Twitter that's kind of
seen a little bit more as a news vehicle
for social media users and they
obviously have the critical mass there
on their platform and so they really
want to start to take some of that
market share and to have the users
actually glean news for race from their
platform and not have to go surfing out
there so these are just some quick stats
for you forty-seven percent of u.s.
adults who use these Booker consuming
news and that's thirty percent of the
total u.s. adult population use Facebook
to seek out news so that's pretty huge
and for a brand maybe that are
traditional CPG companies or retail
brands that kind of creates a little bit
of concern for those brands that aren't
traditional publishers they don't have
content that they promote on their
website maybe they have press releases
that talk about product launches etc but
they don't have a blog they're not a
Huffington Post they're not a bud see
they're not even a yahoo where they're
pumping out stories left and right it's
a lot more of product related like press
releases and so that really if you are a
brand that has that is in one of those
industries that really will create some
need for you to strategize and figure
out how you want to take advantage of
this let's take advantage of it in a
very strategic way I always like to
recommend people to really focus on what
your core goals and objectives are as a
business is it important for you to
drive traffic to your website because
with this kind of new realm that we are
going into with Facebook in the
algorithm they are saying that these
kind of newsworthy URL share posts are
increasing greatly clicks to the website
if that's not something that poor need
for your business then this might not
really quite so much but really all of
the the when you think of Facebook and
all of the contents that's promoted via
Facebook and all of the content that's
promoted via your website really think
of it as a 360 degree feedback loop and
so you want one thing to be to the other
and vice versa and really something that
is may be published in facebook doesn't
necessarily even have to be published by
you if it ultimately leads back to your
brand presence
so talking a little bit about what we
know so some two points and this is
hugely valuable information and as we
all know Facebook does make changes all
the time so please do not take this as
thoughtful by any means but as of the
most recent discussions that we have
high we know that clicks count more than
life but less than comments or shares
and new algorithm and so that may seem
kind of confusing but what that really
means is that clicks are more valuable
than lightning content so for instance
it's on your website you have a buttons
and Facebook plugins that just show
likes and you you know obviously you
want people to like your content but you
also might have a facebook plugin that
is a share button so because we know
that sharing the content is very
powerful you might even want to get rid
of that like button because it's not as
valuable you want instead to give people
only one opportunity to share that
content also a comment on a shared posts
from a friend is the most powerful
metric and algorithm so similarly as I
just mentioned when you are creating
opportunities say you're a publisher
Earth Day you you're a retail brand that
created a blog that is is relevant to
what you're trying to do in terms of
your goals and objectives but also
relevant to what's going on in your
industry what's going on in pop culture
etc you want to give people the
opportunity to share your posts and
share your content or share your content
from your Facebook page and then inspire
friends to comment on it so when you're
considering the different kinds of
plugins on your website or the different
kind of copy that you're assigning to
each of your facebook post always
consider that you want to put some
coffee along with it if you're
publishing to Facebook that inspires
people to ask their friends questions
that to ask myself questions so they're
not just simply share
your content without any backstory or
supporting information so this also
means that you can increase post
frequency this is a huge one because for
a very long time brands have really kind
of shied away from posting even more
than day five times today trans have
tried to look at you know cut what is
their sweep thought it is usually around
maybe like 325 posts a day and really
anything that they would do that goes
over that kind of gives people a little
bit of you know anxiety that they will
be less and less and less and less which
over time the Facebook is dead as long
as you have been gauging news Wendy
content to support the increase in your
sub frequencies and that's a positive
thing and so this will have to take a
lot of testing and you'll have to look
at you what do you want to achieve for
your page what kind of content even make
sense from your page to publish and see
you know let's try for one month we want
to increase their folks frequency by ten
percent the next time by twenty percent
and always keep in mind if you have any
outliers or any kind of gentle events or
campaigns paid media that might skew
your data that's definitely going to be
something to take into consideration
next with increase of those frequencies
brands are likely to see a reduced reach
proposed but as a whole year each will
increase and this seems a little bit of
a no-brainer but definitely I think that
a lot of brands like to look at coats
kind of in a vacuum and it might make
you a little bit nervous and and think
that you're not successful if you do see
a reduced reach proposed but overall you
should see is doing a good job and you
have great content overall you should be
reach as a whole increase and for some
partners and this is a mess today you've
given us some clicks increase by willful
to thirty to forty percent and this may
seem crazy but some even 1000 percent
and so obviously that is a huge range
and that just kind of goes goes to show
the point that you this is different for
every single brand
industry and depending on your content
strategy and the core competencies of
your business this can mean different
things for you like I said before for
publishers it's a lot easier you can
very easily see you know we have content
on our website blog posts we have
bloggers as the editorial staff we can
easily push out this content but first
on maybe retail businesses they're going
to have to really put some thought into
putting content on their website so for
one brand that tested this new
publishing strategy and this is just an
example don't know the industry this is
just something that we got from facebook
net likes to the page stays constant
meaning as the page increased and
although there unlike although increased
but the net like stayed constant so
there wasn't any kind of disturbance
there like students skyrocket there
unlike staying the same similarly their
online student skyrock and skyrocket and
that's something to Alta sees in mind
because when we kind of tested
increasing post frequency in the past
with a lot of accounts we've noticed
that sometimes that causes a greater
increase in the unlike specialist and
obviously does something that we don't
want but sometimes we understand that
you are going to increase your fans but
you're also going to increase your
unlike but that's okay because sometimes
you're catering your content and your
eyes your communication strategy to your
target audience and you want the people
who are really going to engage most with
your content to be the fans of your page
so that's maybe not always a negative
thing but as long as the net is constant
than us a positive also al bound traffic
increase 78 / set in this example and
every positive metric on average
increase so that things like likes
comments shares etc and obviously then
clicks proposed increase as well so if
you think I'm just an example or take a
second to go on facebook and look at
maybe huffington post as an example if
you take a scroll down there
it will take you a really long time to
get to the day before the day that
you're currently on in terms of their
posts so if you go and you navigate to
the post by page and you're on their
final I Ninja Scroll scroll scroll
you'll be throwing probably for a while
so you'll see that upington post has
obviously adhere to this kind of new new
way of thinking and has tested it out
and it seemed a lot of success so
definitely check that out and see some
examples and definitely when you're
doing your competitive research or
you're doing it alongside your Oracle
rest always look at you know what is the
post frequency and does something to
keep in mind too when you're doing your
measurement and it's impairing
competitively how are we performing and
how our competitors performing if your
competitors are for instance posting you
know ten percent thirty percent three
hundred percent more often than you are
posting it becomes really difficult to
compare apples apples because they don't
have the same kind of content strategy
so always some things to just keep in
mind so this relates also to Facebook's
new trending feature so if you've maybe
seen there on the right side of your
Facebook page there is a new trending
module and that highlights breaking in
training news stories on Facebook
bringing brand posts on those subjects
to the forefront of the conversation if
you checked it out you can click on
these topics and pull up basically a
newsfeed of posts that relate to that
topic particularly content creators in
this instance get special focus in
facebook trending so for instance the
huffington post's been doing a very good
job at adhering to this new way of
thinking with the Facebook algorithm
shift their posts would probably be one
of the first ones that we will see and
this is just yet another reasons the
granny need to really listen to what's
trending around the web and most
importantly it relevant jump onto that
trend with published content from your
page that's in line with your content
and communication strategy and not
really not stress enough because a lot
of times when brands are noticing about
$50 algorithm is shifted they really
just kind of want to immediately fit it
and jump on whatever new change is
stopping and try to capitalize on it or
their brand this really is a whole new
world and has really kind of changed
everything that we had known before in
terms of especially post frequency and
content and so you really want to put a
lot of thought into this into your
strategy and say is this something that
makes sense for our brand how can we
jump on these friends and how can we
remain relevant in the States
so here's just one example from taco
bell and we'll just breeze right through
this but it's hopefully you haven't been
living under a rock because you if you
aren't living under a rock you know that
taco bell has a new breakfast menu so
that's pretty exciting i know i'm pretty
excited about that so their page didn't
even post that day on facebook but so
many news outlets and user shares help
the brand trend on facebook throughout
the day even retain the top spot and the
trend they did tweet about it on twitter
and is on the top trend there but it
really goes to show that they don't even
have to put out this content themselves
it's other people that are putting out
content that are bringing their brand to
the forefront this is also important to
know because this could affect your
brand negatively so if there are posts
or news stories that are out there that
are about your grant that you actually
didn't even put up even have a press
release it's not even about one of your
campaigns but maybe there's some kind of
negative story going around if your page
is is that your brand is involved in
that it doesn't even take your posting
about it to bring it to the forefront
for users to see so also just showing a
little bit of the data talk about
obviously like we said didn't post on
facebook on that day but it was the
highest day of fan growth during that
month after trending on facebook for
that day so that's huge so for Taco Bell
this was a positive day it was yay we
are getting waffle tacos and that's
awesome and we want to like Facebook our
taco bell on Facebook because of that
they didn't even have to post about it
but similarly this could affect your
brand in a negative way if there's a lot
of negativity circulating around your
brand that also is important to keep in
mind when you're looking at your metrics
incomes of stay comments or post on your
page if you have something that's
negative that happens with your brand it
might not be something that you've even
necessarily posted about if people are
going to your page or going
on your existing posts and commenting
and saying negative things and reacting
to what may be in the news this basic
training will bring that top of mind for
that is it something that people are
talking about and you might have to
correct for that those outliers and data
of people even though they're talking
negatively about about your brand but
they're increasing the comments and
replies on your page so this is just one
quick example and this can show itself
in many many different ways on facebook
this is just one example as I mentioned
before the newsfeed layout is changing
if you haven't gotten it already you
will likely get it soon and so don't
take this screenshot is exactly what it
will look like for you even around our
office we've seen millions of different
instances of how this actually looks but
as you can see here when a friend even
just likes of those stories users might
be stories like this in the news because
other suggestive content like a dead
just to show in many different ways and
fast in the newer way that it's showing
it's even more robust and possessing
more than even just two stories you can
see here that you can also click the
drop down but we all know that you know
users having to click the drop-down
create the extra step so they're
probably not going to do that but here
it will just make sure that users see
the content that is will lead into those
stories so even if you know your fan
base isn't necessarily sharing your
posts or people aren't necessarily on
your website sharing your content if you
are on trend and talking about things
that are relevant you can have your
content surface here to even people who
don't even like your page to the general
so that was a really great example of
we've been relying on paid media so long
for page growth and an increase in
engagement and this is kind of Facebook
throwing us a bone it's saying you know
if you're on trend you're sharing
newsworthy content even if you know
maybe you're not the most popular foods
in the world if you're doing
what you should be doing and you're on
topic and on strategy for your
particular page then you have the chance
to show up in users receive so this is a
little bit of an example of a couple of
different things I've used Huffington
Post example because that's probably the
easiest way to think of a publisher of
content unless we have a screenshot from
huffington post facebook page on the
right we have a screenshot of the exact
story on huffingtonpost.com this is a
great story really emotional pulling at
your heartstrings and as you can see on
the left they've entered copies go Kevin
go with a URL post now what I mean by
that is when you're posting a URL post
it is pouring in the metadata associated
with laurell that you're posting content
from so as you can see here it's going
up the title team with Down syndrome
joins the Harlem Globetrotters and
thanks three pointer which is awesome
and then has a little bit of a blurb of
coffee below that so if this is
something that your brand is important
for you and you know maybe you have a
blog you are a publisher and how this
kind of content it's vitally important
that you make sure that the image that
pulls through is high resolution that
fits the area that Facebook will pull it
into that your title looks I catching
that your description is applicable
because sometimes the metadata
associated with laurell that pulled
through is not actually good for posting
and that's where people kind of use the
big photo post write their own coffee
and just insert a link in there but
Facebook is actually preferring this
kind of posts over that kind of folks
and by no means take that as the gospel
that's what they're telling us and
Facebook Phil says you do want to have a
healthy mix of content but for
Huffington Post because they are a
publisher they probably should stick
with just as URL type of both that
doesn't mean that they can't write those
heaven though they can still do that
they could still tag other page
is you know recently from facebook also
helps to put your content in other
people's news feeds that maybe your fans
of those pages that use tagged so those
are great examples of things that you
can do to use the URL post feature
another thing I want to mention on
huffingtonpost.com is you can see that
they like share tweet pin it email and
comment and so those are greatly placed
right at the top right at the beginning
of the article they're above the fold so
users don't have to scroll down and find
them and they're making it very easy for
people to share as I mentioned before we
know that sharing the post is more
valuable than liking the post and
depending on your brand you might want
to get rid of the like altogether you
might want to just have people have the
opportunity to share things because you
want them to share the content to get
into people's and Steve and to hopefully
you'll be coming trending so that's
something that you have to decide for
your brand in particular if that makes
sense for you I also would recommend to
make these buttons a lot bigger
huffington post i think does a good job
but i don't think that there's really
not very many grants out there that are
doing a really stellar job of it but
make suttin bigger make it really easy
for people to interact and to share you
never want people to scroll around and
kind of search for where they need to
share your content it also if you have a
long-form piece where you have to help
roll a bunch of times to get to the end
of the article why not also repeat all
of your sharing functions at the bottom
of that why not share it also at the
middle of the article so that people
always have that top of mind when
reading through the article and they're
finishing the articles um also Facebook
kind of recommends to to repeat the
button multiple times that's not just my
suggestion just going to put your user
cut on and say if I was the user what
would make this easier for me and then i
create your strategy that way
as you can see here too it won't really
take necessarily Huffington Post to even
be talking about this article themselves
it's great that they did post about the
article themselves but say you how
things should post community manager
will sleep it on the ball or six that
day and they forgot to post about Kevin
but there were a large number of users
visiting huffingtonpost.com and they
loved the story it was really compelling
and they shared it this story could
easily become trending and Huffington
Post's wouldn't have I suppose that is a
doll that's just kind of comparing it
just to the Taco Bell example
so just touching quickly on facebook
paper facebook paper is Facebook's new
mobile app this is kind of just really
in line with where Facebook is wanting
to kind of become more of a new vehicle
so Facebook paper is taking the best
content from brand brand content
creators and displaying it in a rich
media a newspaper like formats so
Facebook's rewarding the best publishers
of the best content by showing them
predominantly at the beginning of these
subsections and these publishers may not
have even share the content themselves
facebook says if you want to be one of
the emergence emerging voices and well
known publications that paper gives the
preference to you've got to do great
stuff and keep doing great stuff and
that's a really simple way of saying
stay on strategy for your brand
capitalize on your core competencies
capitalize on either what your goals and
objectives are find a way to make this
algorithm shift work for you and do it
in a really strategic tested manner so
obviously you know basic paper user
stats are pretty sparse as of right now
and so don't worry you know oh we're not
included on facebook paper then we're
really not doing a good job if you're
doing is a job putting out great stuff
and your little doing great stuff and
you continue to do great stuff then that
will help you to increase the visibility
of your content in your newsfeed even on
desktop and on the traditional facebook
mobile app and then things like success
on facebook paper will just come as a
result because they're doing a great job
other places so that does it for me i'm
going to turn it over to deriv a buell
asst to talk a little bit about our
platform and how you can bring all of
these new strategies to light by using
the SRM thank you thanks Sarah um gosh
that was awesome I am I learned a lot
and I hope that the folks who are tuned
in and are watching this on youtube
later also learned a lot so thank you so
much for your point of view in your time
today I'm so as Sarah said I'm going to
move now into
live demo using the SRM tool to show you
guys how to manage all of the posts that
you can create using these great tips
and tricks that Sarah pointed out as
well as move into our analytics part of
the tool to show you where you guys can
manage your analytics to know how well
your posts are doing so that you can
figure out that sweet spot if you will
have mixed up content to ensure that you
are reaching the folks that you want you
you
so I'm moving over into my Safari now so
I'm logged in here to frm this is really
awesome and exciting and great to see
this happening here so I'm logged
incidence mr brooks farmers market
account which is a great brand that
we've created here at Oracle so I'm in
our published tool which is where we can
push out all of our content to our own
channels so our Facebook pages our
twitter account google+ all that great
stuff that we own all I want to do here
is go in and create a post
on the screen of those page we've got
tons and tons of options so what Tara
was talking about is making sure that
you post a lot of URL posts which I know
kind of goes against what we've all been
doing really for about the last 18 to 24
months is pushing out what we call them
big photos we really want to switch that
attitude to do more your elbows so we'll
just start here by entering our post
name fresh new veggies you know it's
spring so we're going to have some good
stuff coming out we also recently in our
SRM platform at it in work clothes so
you're able to select a work bro from a
drop-down menu here to make sure that
this goes through a specific class of
approval process so you can put in steps
in the workflow that include having
maybe I trade the post and then I have
shared views come in and add in the
content for the poster she adds in the
link as maybe well as the creative and
she can edit it up make it look really
great before it launches the facebook
then from there there and I have our
manager approve it so that way that the
content is approved before it goes out
so all these things can be easily
managed and workflow and definitely
encourage you guys to dive in and take a
look at some of that from here you can
select your streams that you want to
publish to so we are focusing mostly on
facebook today so i'm going to leave
that air and then we can put in our
content so we'll type in anything that
we want so come come on by today and
check out our brand new vegetables and
so then we want to put in a link
will do these holsters in here you know
in here all of the content is auto
populated as Sarah talked about the
metadata that it pulled in for a link so
our system allows you to select any of
the images that you want in here up to
then publish out about so let's see if
there's anything that I like if I'm
happy with entities images I can use one
of these but if I'm not I'm come in and
add in a new piece of media click that
button or i can come in and use anything
that's pre-populated so maybe I like
these these peppers that are in here so
I'll go ahead and use though
also what i can do is edit the metadata
go find out like this we'll call this
fresh new veggies we come in and write
in our own text so it's grace off the
first few characters of what of the text
that's seen on the website but we can
come in and type in whatever we would
like unlike Facebook is mandated like
you can't make these changes but here
within our system you're able to
so we've got that included in here we
can also apply tags to our posts
definitely recommend doing this a lot of
times some of our our customers will use
tags to not only talk about maybe a
campaign that they're working on we can
add in tags that includes URL post or
photo post so then you can get from easy
comparisons and the analytics part of
the tool so you can measure those posts
against each other to try to optimize
and figure out what it is your fans are
wanting to sleep so just keep scrolling
down we could schedule it if we would
like and for facebook options down here
we want to click into the photo option
setting so by default we have this
publishing at a big voted or a timeline
photo album who actually want to change
this so it publishes out as a link to
our moves in order to fully engage that
the URL benefit thats Sarah so aptly
went over so we'll make that change we
come up here and preview it are we happy
with how this post looks and if so we
can have their publisher or click on the
next page and review it so I'm here I'm
just going to click publish post
you
and we can see that our post is
currently publishing if I go to the
farmers market page here and refresh it
I can see that here's our post so we can
see here that you know Facebook has
changed a lot of the new seeds so now
you're getting not just those little
thumbnail images but a nice large size
image so it's got this nice and it
included with the text that we plugged
in as well as that description that
we've got down there we've got our link
that goes to the website that we can
click in in either spa so you can see
it's still a nice big visual image for
getting those added benefit of having
that URL reach
so once you have a few of these posts
under your belt you can come in and take
a look over at the listed and analyze
part of the tool
so in here we can take a look at our
overall fan growth on the dashboard page
as well as our demographic breakdown and
fan sources but we what we really want
to look at is indeed
so on the engagement page here what
we're looking at is the number of page
stories that have been created about the
post you can see the number of people
talking about you your number of engaged
users your page consumption as well as
your page stories so these are all
really great pieces of data for you to
look at to be able to to measure the
success of all of your hope
you can also see any of negative
feedback which would be things like hide
your content from the newsfeed unlike
your page reporting us spam all those
kinds of actions as well as your pops
and most engaged users so these are
really popular items within SRM
analytics to take a look
you can also come in in the all posts
section under post
you can see um let's see if we've got
let's choose a nice date range here you
can go back in time a number of months
and you can take a look at all the posts
that have been published during that
time period
and see the engagement rates on them
it's not loading for this particular at
this moment apologies for that but what
that will do is allow you to take a look
at your engagement rate for a particular
date date range a post versus posts you
can see your reach numbers you can see
exactly how many likes you've gotten and
shares and all that really great data
that Sarah was talking about that's
really good to measure but you can take
that not only on a post level but across
your whole thing so that way you can
ensure that you are doing nice numbers
overall sure you might lose some fans
sure you might lose overall reach on a
per post basis but in general your reach
should pop up pretty pretty high another
great section to look at here is this
post section what this allows you to do
is look at how the content that you
pushed so if I'm looking at this brook
street farmers market page we're posting
a lot of photos 73.8 percent of our
content is a photo and only 13.8 percent
is a length we definitely need to think
about this and bump this up to publish
out more links to fully take advantage
of what facebook has done with the
newsfeed
so we can also come in here and take a
look at our top post for that time
period and click in on them
here we can get a nice summary of a
particular post once this loads will be
able to see how many likes and shares
and comments all sorts of really good
data you can see any engagement that
happened on it as well as your overall
impressions and reach numbers these
obviously are really important you can
take a look and see so how many folks
are actually reaching you can also see
how many people clicked on your photo
with you publish a photo or if there was
a link County folks click on your link
you're still able to track all that
so these are just really great ways for
you can take advantage if there is
really awesome advice that she gave in
order to make sure that all of your post
are optimized be able to reach all the
individuals that you would like if
anybody has any questions you can send
them through the facebook opportunities
