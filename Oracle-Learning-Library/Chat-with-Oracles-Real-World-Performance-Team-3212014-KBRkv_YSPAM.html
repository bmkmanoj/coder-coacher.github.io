this Friday morning and/or late Friday
night if you're in Asia or Friday
afternoon if you're in Europe we want to
really talk about a series of things
that we're rolling out this year to
actually help you get at a database
performance as we as we we learn from
what we've been doing over the last few
years and so and what I'd like to really
talk about is what we're putting in
place for people to train themselves but
first I'd like to sort of introduce
myself and just like my boss I like to
gain boats that really the real-world
performance team is really all about
experience with the database and we've
been doing it a long time and we've come
to some conclusions fairly quickly about
watching people who have built databases
built applications on them and either
done extremely well in terms of database
performance to achieve incredible
metrics and performance and availability
figures and of course visit things on
the other end of the spectrum where some
systems are always seem to be a struggle
from start to finish and what we've
noticed is that people don't
accidentally get excellent performance
somebody usually did some engineering
work and usually involving numbers and
calculations and in terms of figuring
out what it would take to get good
performance and it's rarely an accident
and one of the other things we also
notice in terms of weigh groups build
systems and how they communicate and
work together is that most people get
the systems they deserve and this was a
statement given to me by one of my
mentors earlier in my career as I was
getting immensely frustrated trying to
convince somebody to build a system in a
different way to the way they were going
and I was running up against political
roadblocks and things where people were
determined to do the opposite of what
was good engineering practices and I was
getting quite frustrated and fortunately
I had a good mentor at that point in
time and harmed me down in my
and years and said you know actually and
you don't worry about it
people will get the systems they deserve
if they consistently do things wrong
they'll have a problem later and one of
the things that's really the mantra that
I sort of enforced within my team and
really is a good philosophy I found the
database performance work and is that we
really will not tolerate good enough
performance we should always be aspiring
for excellence because what I've learned
is what is good enough today is really
substandard tomorrow and so we should
always be aspiring for excellence and
getting the best efficiency and and the
best performance out of the hardware so
combination we've got too often I find
people compromising and going oh that's
good enough or I hear statements say oh
that's good enough to support the
business moving backwards and I take
very much more engineering approach to
database performance rather than
database performance by MBA and we'd
rather do as an engineer and get the
best out of the hardware and software
together and get them running as best as
possible rather than struggle to a bar
defined by nebulous terms that could be
reaaargh you'd every other week so it's
a case of getting the best out of the
equipment and succour we have and it's
not a bad idea to aspire for excellence
new engineers in my group if they ever
make the mistake of saying I think the
performance is good enough kind of knows
they've got the weekends working to
figure things out to aspire to
excellence and that's kind of our
philosophy on performance and really
what is real-world performance to us is
really is what we call sort of bridging
the chasm from today's performance to
what is possible and really you know we
can use the term chasm because very
often it it's quite a painful and a
difficult break to get between today's
performance and what is potentially
durable and very often involves quite a
lot of hard work with discomfort and you
know it's not always a technical problem
very often it's an organizational
problem and the challenge for a row of
bullet engineer
technical as well as sort of political
emotional head games to actually get the
work that you've done implemented in
production so the quality of a world war
performing for you man is half technical
excellence and then half the ability to
get these things rolled into production
and make the difference because we have
a huge inertia to change in our systems
and one of the things I try to McRaven
with people companies are what a
performance problem being unchanging
which my response is then you will
continue to have a performance problem
and you have to be able to initiate
change but the skill is initiating the
right changes okay so really a lot of
the real world performance stuff that
we're going to talk about has come from
what we've observed a lot of this claim
Apple for the changes in the use of the
Oracle database as and when Oracle
became a hardware company and we started
launching our programs like excavator
and who by that we came to a very big
realization that the database product
was not being used to its full potential
and when we actually make innovations to
the database to allow high performance
levels the biggest bottleneck was very
often the application code was unable to
exploit a lot of this paragraph and
because what we were asking the database
to do was run at orders of magnitude
faster but the application code wasn't
able to do that and in many cases the
application logic had been written 15-20
years ago and had been put together with
a view to small datasets serial
processing and haven't been able to
think about parallel processing and the
ever-increasing data sets that we work
with and those that work with bigger and
bigger data sets will realize that you
actually need a different set of
algorithm as the data set gets bigger to
do the same operation now the challenge
I get for face pack is that people don't
want to hear about this that they're not
using the database very well there's
usually a huge amount of emotion and
some capital in today's investment in
applications and it represents in many
cases
a change of direction if they were to
rewrite things or start changing probe
but any performance engineer will
recognize that usually the application
is the source of the problem and that's
the best place to make performance gains
and when I talk about performance gains
we're looking for orders of magnitude
games we're not looking for 20% in big
cities we'll implement the decimal point
and you know this is really the
challenge that we face on a daily basis
is that recognize that the code was
written a long time ago under different
hardware and software and even business
regimen and and this is one of the
biggest challenges as a real-world
performance engineer Basin to find the
bottleneck is in the code and in many
cases of IT organizations people say we
can't change the code and really this is
quite ridiculous you know most people
that I work with the studied exams and
they've passed exams in computer science
oh fully competent software engineers
but then they're not changing any code
and I always find this a challenge and
it's basically you've chosen not to
change the chrome and in many cases
those applications they're only growth
curve is is as long as as mortal or
keeps going on and our CPU speeds
increasing which they're not they're not
growing at a rate that they were and so
the other thing is that data sets are
growing faster than Moore's law so we do
need to make algorithmic changes to our
applications to keep up with the
datasets that are growing faster than
the CPU speeds are getting faster and
what has a trend that I've really
noticed is that we've kind of reversed
the difference between hardware and
software is we're very good at flipping
platforms and moving applications and
databases to new hardware and and so
this is a complete opposite of how it
was when I was growing up or it's where
the hardware was fixed and we changed
software to make things go faster now
people seem to change hardware
keep the software static and with this
in mind I can see that certain classes
of application with this mindset will
never scale and this is a big shame and
because there's a lot of performance
could be harnessed out there and we are
talking borders of magnitude performance
again so moving on from here on rural
performance group and we do have a
little bit of a reputation for being bit
tough on people and the reason for that
is because we go we're basically a
numerate group and with fact-based and
we've got hundreds of many years of
experience engineers spread around the
world and really our goal is to see you
get better and better performance out of
the database and our methods are
remarkably simple but remarkably
threatening at times examples we use the
product in a manner it was designed to
be used and that may sound very trivial
and obvious but if I actually go to a
lot of site they're not using the
database in the manner it would commute
and this can be from the top-level
sequel level but even down to not even
consistent patching maintaining the
environment in consistent manner and I
ask you how many people are running on
clustered when you actually got
different sized Oracle binaries on
different lengths of the classes this is
just telling us that we're not running
the product that we were meant to be
running most of our debugging techniques
there are pure numerical base and
logical be bobbing tightening and again
I'll give engineers a tough time when
they say oh I think this is happening
and I say show me it's happening and on
that side thing so that's quite a
different approach and our debugging
techniques are sort of contrary to a lot
of what we see in in the world is where
people just gather mountains of trace
files and bottoms that they've got
enough statistics and in trying to pick
for problem we tend to take a top-down
holistic view of the Apple function to
see where the choke points are rather
than just trying to look for symptoms
look the diagnostics and fix the
symptoms it's we look at a top-down via
web forms checkpoint
and then fix them appropriately we also
spend a lot of time on education and
that's what most are more important
about today is going to be about
performance methods and techniques and
really our goal is to avoid this what I
call this hack and hope a approach to
what people call tuning and you'd be
surprised to know that my engineers
change very little initialization from
inside database we don't set many
parameters if we do its you can put
bugging purposes and it's not to be put
into production but there is a culture
out there in Oracle though I put a
fiddle we'll be done the score
parameters and come on Andrew give me
some parameters I can surely make my
database go back and no I'm afraid it's
not like that good database performance
work is just by work but it's extremely
rewarding because we put the hard work
then you get performance gains that
you've lived for a long time okay so
these are the three big mistakes that we
see being made philosophically in terms
of performance told you about incorrect
tools and products and the other one I
alluded to earlier areas and not
understanding and the big data little
data design challenge people are very
often running big data problems with
little data algorithms and they get huge
performance problems and so one of the
things we talk about is you know are we
solving a big data set problem or a
little data set problem because the
correct solution is very different if
you were working with a million rows or
ten rows and you know this is really
important and you know one of the simple
analogies are you consider having to
process loans and validate a billion
rogue would you load a billion rows and
then validate would you load one row
validate one row and then run it in a
tight loop a billion times I'll let you
think about that and the other challenge
we also see is that everybody is always
looking for a solution in many cases
before they understand what the problem
is and and this is a common trait is
people are looking for hats and wings to
problem would go away but they never
really got to the root cause of the
problem now I asked you if you went to
the doctor that way and he gave
prescriptions just hopefully it is well
how would you feel like an intubation
but I'm sure you wouldn't like it but we
see this in the data bed space and in
many cases these solutions sound
fantastic in meeting room but they are
actually not based on any inputs and
it's just a hack in hope and one of my
engineers describes a lot of this
betting very confusing activity with
programs until you understand the
problem you can't solve the problem and
so really one of the challenges I do
when training engineers is getting to
articulate the problem before they come
up with a solution they can't articulate
the problem there's no way they're
changing anything and that's quite an
important part of your performance okay
so what a real-world performance
engineers do in my team well we deal
with escalations we also do some
benchmarking and PLC's and we do not as
much as we used to and but however you
know watching that vocs basically
reinforces everything I see is that I
see a lot of badly written applications
being benchmarked and with a relatively
simple structural rewrites
there's orders of magnitude more
performance that we made and yet people
seem oblivious to doing this side of
things and it's extremely frustrating we
also test a lot of new code coming out
of Oracle and early releases and we also
do a lot of prototyping of new ideas of
you code and we haven't really put very
much out on 12c at this point in plan
yet because we're still working with it
we're still getting street smart with
the new software new techniques and a
lot of our stuff is just tried and
tested and it takes a little while
before we get savvy we're happy that we
would actually go out and endorse a
technique and these are everything we
come out is road tested and one of the
things that it's really important for my
team is that they share their skills and
mentor others
and we're really really keen on that so
I'm going to talk about mentoring and
coaching other people now we have a look
at the Education activity impact we do a
lot more now than we ever did and we
have three levels we have a real world
performance class we have a performance
day and we're going to talk about
launching today is a Learning Library
where what we get a lot of the benefits
are the other two events online in their
own time and the real-world performance
class is something that's been going on
for a number of years and we now do it
with partners and customers and really
the key to this event is it hard work we
hit the tooth through with three big
topics with sequel LTP and data
warehousing and we usually leave all the
students gasping for air at the end it's
pretty tiring and it's probably four
months of training in full beds it's
given by real world orbits engineers and
it's really designed by architects
developers and DBAs and if you're
interested in participating either
contact my team or your local Oracle
team and it does require quite a bit of
setup and an investment by people
wanting to do that and we do look for
classes of about within 250 people and
but we would like to get out in the
field on-site we learn as much giving
the class as hopefully the people
tearing up but really to be honest if it
was a normal class you probably be added
four months learning the same amount of
it we do have people coming back from
repeats because they didn't get it all
first time around there's some great
quotes and then and you know really the
training is done mixture of classroom
demos hands-on examples and you know
it's geared towards the mistakes that we
see people hemorrhaging performance from
the system's the real-world performance
there's a lot of fun and myself Tom Kyte
and Graham and it's sort of miss mixes a
better theatre and a bit of Bollywood
and today we use big screens and big
audiences to talk about real
Gorman's and it's a lot of fun and it's
a great event to bring along development
teams or DBA teams and rocket packs to
just basically in a more sociable and
fun environment learn about database
components this is what we do and if
you're interested in attending those
please organize with your local user
group and directly with us and we do
look for 200-plus delegates and sort of
get the selfies with others and believe
it or not we have two events actually
taking place next week in London and
Riga in Latvia and we're looking for
bookings towards the end of exit this
year and early next year and such that
we can get all the presenters walk them
out and we've done a number of these in
Europe tastic reorganized and well
attended and it's been a lot of fun
doing it that way
and what we're talking about today is
however is taking all the demos and a
lot of the exercises that we've been
into the training the world war Woman's
Day and record them for your reference
so you can view them through the online
learning library and you can use them to
study you can send them to your boss you
can send the links to your boss's boss's
boss or the chief architect and really
what we want to do is give you the
information to win arguments such that
you can actually increase the
performance of your system by orders of
magnitude in many patients and people
need proof points they need clarity and
they need to learn more about so
hopefully by actually putting all this
information out in a more scalable
environment we download and give it in
their own time they can actually start
using them and using them as tools to
uptake a better system that's the front
page and at this point you know that's
our start point and the demos we're
putting out to start with are really
remakes of all demos that we made in
part and I'm talking about connections
pausing sequels sending sequences
available and the develop and mistakes
that get made
mural orders of magnitude performance
problems also touch on security issues
and really we feel this should be
mandatory viewing before even starting
to architect a system or writing code
and future videos that will be rolling
out the next few months and weeks and
when things involving classic developer
blog that we call methyl massive
performance problems and escalations the
challenges associated with middleware
and set-based programming techniques and
this is classic big data set problems
and we bake off in those places on
single row processing technique versus
set-based techniques and we run them as
ratings so those are becoming later this
summer as we roll those out okay so our
end game is to help you basically
increase the quality of your database
usage and realize the potential of your
database and hardware and get to use the
products in a manner they were meant to
use and we recognize that it's not
always easy we are working segmented
data and organizations that we've very
often has to spend a lot of time arguing
with people to make changes so hopefully
we've given you some paper and some
backup and really what would I'd like to
see is change performance techniques for
this last minute tuning and fiddling
approach in pack and hope mentality -
that were more professional engine more
Kristen and I said I certainly wouldn't
want to but Kleier an aeroplane that had
been last minute tweaked and fiddled
around with I'd hope that it was
engineered to fire with speed from the
beginning and I believe that performance
is not an accident it remains the same
it's not something new retro pin it
within one and at that point I think we
want to turn some them over some
question we have we're also going to
talk about collecting and some stories
and we're looking to collect stories for
people who applied real-world
performance technique
so we're going to challenge you can you
actually document the performance right
or wrong can you document and articulate
what was wrong
could you articulate your solution and
predict the performance gains and then
could you tell us of that story
so again over the summer we're going to
actually try and collect some of them so
some people might call them war stories
whether I have to say basically case
studies of really good performance
engineering and we're looking to sort of
find and promote the you know the best
real world performance story in the real
world and we'll hear a little bit more
about that level someone's an event
Walker and at that point time I think we
would be open to questions
you
it seems very quiet on the chat panel
see many questions
you
it's very quiet and I'm covered the
material and the route that we're
launching through the summer I just hope
everybody out there is enthusiastic as
much as we are to get to receive the
material use the material and you know I
just wish everyone the best of luck you
know just raising that performance gain
and getting more and more performant
gullible database and raising the level
of professionalism and communication on
performance issues and such that it it's
not a random process anymore it's an
engineering discipline
just got a message from one village that
they have been joining instructions so
hopefully and this is been written this
message has been recorded nicely and I
hope everybody enjoys watching the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
