in this second of a two-part demo
covering auto DOP you will see how auto
dlp behaves when the degree policy is
set to limited rather than auto as it
was in the first demo in part 1 of the
demonstration we enabled auto DLP by
setting the parallel degree policy to
auto we saw how the optimizer used this
setting in concert with other parameters
to apply parallel execution another PX
setting we used was the parallel minimum
time threshold the last value we used
for this parameter was one second and
remember that this parameter specifies
the minimum execution time that a
statement she used before auto DOP will
kick in now will change both of these
parameters first the degree policy is
set to limited in the lesson you learn
that this policy setting restricts auto
dop for queries against tables that have
an explicit dop specified next will
reset the minimum time threshold back to
auto which is the equivalent to 10
seconds ok we'll go ahead and check the
DOP setting on the sales table now a DOP
of four was set on the sales table back
in part 1 of this demo so using these
settings together we'll go ahead and
recreate an execution plan for that same
query that was used throughout part 1 of
the demo so the plans been generated and
let's take a look at it so the optimizer
has chosen parallel execution but notice
this time that there isn't a note at the
end of the plan table output this is due
to the combination of a parallel degree
policy of limited and a do p value set
on the sales table remember with this
combination the specified table do p is
taken as such and auto do p is not
even involved so since Otto DOP was not
in play in this query the minimum time
threshold wasn't even a factor okay so
now let's set the threshold back to one
second and we'll remove the DOP setting
from the sales table to see what happens
with parallel execution so the time
threshold is set to one second we're
connect to the SH schema and we're going
to alter the the the sales table in this
case notice that what we've done is we
have set the degree value for sales to
default which means we've basically
turned off the EOP for the sales table
ok now we'll generate and look at the
execution plan now the note at the
bottom of the plan table output this
time shows that Otto dlp was used and
the optimizer chose a dop of two for the
query now stated before when a degree
policy of limited is set and there is no
deal p value on the table auto do p is
used and in this case with a parallel
min time threshold set to one second the
optimizer selects parallel execution
over cereal because it's less costly ok
so finally we'll set the PX minimum time
threshold back to Otto and see what
happens alright it's altered connect to
the SH schema generated the execution
plan and now we'll take a look at it so
the optimizer chooses serial execution
the output note confirms this with a DOP
of one computed we have no DOP setting
on sales and the degree policy is set to
limited so therefore auto do p is a
player in this query however since the
parallel min time threshold is set back
to the fault which is about 10 seconds
the optimizer select serial execution
for the same reason it did in the first
demo the elapsed time is now calculated
as lower than parallel execution this
completes the second part of this
demonstration on auto dop
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
