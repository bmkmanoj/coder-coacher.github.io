my name is Mary Peake and I'm a
curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I'll show you how to
use Oracle service bus customization
files when propagating your service bus
configuration from one domain to another
it's likely you'll need to change at
least some environment values for
example port numbers server names URLs
file and directory names and so on
there are two ways to change these
values you can use the find and replace
tool in the service bus console or you
can create an apply customization file
find and replace is useful for a one-off
situation but for more frequent value
updating use a customization file also
using these files you can make changes
to environment values as well as
resource references for this
demonstration I've just imported a
configuration file from my staging
domain to my production domain through
the service bus console but on the
production domain the administration
server port is different it's seven one
zero one whereas in the staging domain
it was seven zero zero one in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
change the port number in all the
service bus resources using a service
bus customization file so let's get
started here we are on the service bus
console for my new production domain
called prod domain we're in the business
services folder of the resource browser
and let's take a look at a business
service that was just propagated from my
staging domain this order management
service and we can see that the port
number in the endpoint URI is set to
seven zero zero one as it was in staging
so let's go to system administration in
underneath this customization we'll
choose create customization file we want
to create the file for just the
resources we imported from staging which
was the order management and shipping
projects so we can deselect the system
project and we'll create the file and
we'll save it now let's move the browser
window over a little bit and you see the
customization file here this a LSB
customization file dot XML in this case
it saved it to the desktop as that's my
default download location for the
browser so let's edit the file and we'll
move it down and we'll do a find and
replace will replace the old port number
seven zero zero one with the new one and
we'll replace all closest that save the
file and close this window now that
we've created the customization file we
need to execute it to apply the changes
so let's go back to the service bus
console and first we'll start a new
session as you must be an accession to
execute a customization file now let's
scroll down and this time we'll go to
execute customization file let's browse
and from the desktop will select the
customization file that we just created
and click Next and here we see a list of
all the items that will be changed so
let's execute the file and we can see
that it was executed successfully so
let's activate the session and enter a
description
and submit now let's go back to that
business services folder we're in River
four and let's take another look at this
order management service and we can see
that the port number has been updated
successfully so it's that simple to use
a customization file to make changes in
your service bus configuration thanks
