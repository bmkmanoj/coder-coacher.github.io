global Java market development at Oracle
and I'm one of the producers of this
conference so as all of you in the
keynote thanks very much for coming this
is the first conference of its kind that
we've done at Oracle I want to take the
opportunity to kick off one of one of
the first sessions this morning Oracle
has been working with analysts and
researchers to understand am
machine-to-machine communication market
get a better insight of what's needed
and what people are looking for and we
contacted beach and research earlier
this year and hired beach them to do
some research first but also we're lucky
enough to have them come speak so
without any further delay I'd like to
introduce you to Robin here from he's a
CEO of Beecham research and he came on
over here all the way from the United
Kingdom they'll speak with us today so
Robin thank you good morning to you all
so yes Robin equally from beach and
research I came over from London but so
we also have an office in Boston so we
we focus primarily on the North American
market and the European market the title
for this was or is looking at the
results from a user survey in fact we're
looking at so the results of three user
surveys and I'll explain why in a minute
but I think the fundamental thing is
that we want to look at where m2m is now
and where it's going from a user's
perspective to try and give some insight
into what users are looking for for
their m2m solutions so very brief
introduction to me and the company I
founded beach and research in 2008 but
I've personally been involved in m2m
since 2001 so just over a decade beach
and research is based in cambridge UK
and Boston us or Cambridge us perhaps
and specializing in m2m and Internet of
Things
markets worldwide we do as a company
have significant prior commercial and
general management experience in
industry so for example I was in general
management in supply industry in the
high tech area so we are rather
different from most analysts in that we
have an understanding of business
requirements through actual experience
we've been researching the m2m for over
a decade since 2001 we do have a key
specialty which is primary research
which is user surveys we conduct
worldwide user we call them adopters
surveys and also market player surveys
players in the value chain we have
extensive contacts through industry we
do a monthly newsletter you can
subscribe to it on our website we did we
published what we call snaps as in
snapshots of the market number 51 in
September and we have an m2m blog at
blog into an apps com m2m apps is a
search facility for m2m looking
specifically at how to implement m2m
apps applications in the in the market
and we helped to launch that we are the
first analysts to study cloud-based m2m
platforms and we've termed it service
enablement services for a variety of
reasons we've conducted two major
multi-client service enablement studies
the first in 2009-10 the second in 2011
we do what we what we consider to be
market leading research and some results
are in this presentation today those
multi-client studies were subscribed to
by all major operators in europe and
most in the US and many other key market
players and the market segmentation of
all of our studies is in a sector map
which has become quite well known
internationally I think it's also
appeared in this conference a couple of
times
and we we focus on this because it shows
just how broad the m2m market is with
our buildings energy consumer and home
health care and life science industrial
transportation retail security public
safety IT and networks these are the
sectors that represent the majority of
m2m activities in the marketplace so
it's very broadly based and out here at
the edge are all of the types of devices
these are examples of the types of
devices that can be connected in each of
those sectors through which services are
delivered so our view of m2m is that
it's all about new services creating new
service opportunities in the marketplace
and then generating new revenue and I'll
come on to that in a bit more detail
shortly so the context for the survey
findings that I'm going to talk about
m2m started at an operational level so
many years ago it was really a thing of
the service departments and seeking to
reduce typically seeking to reduce down
time of assets in the field improving
support efficiency and saving costs it's
always been about b2b point solutions
we're moving much more towards internet
of things where it's a multiverse and
not so much point to point solutions and
I'll talk more about that shortly remote
devices communicating with a central
server via the internet and that's
really what has distinguished end-to-end
from previous or other application areas
or processes m2m is all about
communication via the internet telemetry
for example tended to be via bespoke
networks private networks and so forth
and it's obviously then to process data
that is also then distributed via the
internet
to whoever needs it to create some sort
of an action or service connectivity is
really the key enabler of m2m and the
opportunity is driving market
differentiation with an increasing need
to integrate data throughout the
organization and i'll talk more about
that as well so market growth has been
substantially sector driven those nine
sectors that I pointed out services have
been developed in each of those nine
sectors and there hasn't been very much
across those sectors each sector has its
own dynamics its own trends its own
technologies standards even and
regulations so trying to get cooperation
between different sectors has been quite
difficult but as I will talk about later
as we move more towards an Internet of
Things type of environment there is much
more need to share data across different
sectors and then the opportunity is to
drive new services by doing that the
purpose of service enablement end-to-end
platforms has been to reduce
time-to-market and cost of deployment of
new services by developing by developing
cross-sector structures and I'll talk
about that later on so we see that m2m
is now at a critical point it's a move
towards what we are all terming the
Internet of Things various different
definitions about what Internet of
Things is we have a particular
definition which are come to you later
we conducted a roundtable event in fact
in the New Orleans ctia conference in
may of this year it was sponsored by
ericsson and we had 12 leading market
players in the US and europe joined us
for that it was a closed session not
open to press and we then did a white
paper after that which is available for
free download from beach and research
and also from erickson
number of other a number of other
parties but the the focus of that was on
T and the issues in creating an Internet
of Things structure as distinct from an
m2m structure and the the focus really
of IOT is more towards B to B to C so
m2m has been about point solutions
business to business IOT is more about
business to business to consumer bring
in the consumer at the end looking at
consumer opportunities and lifestyle
issues and so forth related to that so
the difference between IOT and m2m is
really one of scale and scope and that
has big implications for the
infrastructure that we use so all of
this we think provides a context for the
survey findings that I'm going to talk
about which is the current and future
needs of m2m solutions so some of the
questions that we thought about for
these surveys and the most recent one in
particular is one of the primary drivers
now for m2m projects what are the trends
what are the major priorities for
solution providers what about the
application development environment for
future needs this is where we can bring
in the issues of Java relationship how
important is security in the future what
to do about it how to deal with the data
what value to derive from it how
critical is downtime importance of
cloud-based services integration with
enterprise IT and then some others like
how important is embedded connectivity
and how important is
internationalization and there are a
whole bunch of other questions as well
but those like a sort of highlights if
you like of the sort of things that we
wanted to ask so as I said they're just
now we've looked at three surveys for
this presentation the first one was a
qualitative assessment of m2m solution
requirements and we talked to key market
players
solution providers rather than
individual enterprises and the reason
for doing that is that we can get an
aggregation of what the solution
provider market is doing what end users
are looking for now compared with what
they were looking for in the past by
talking to the the solution providers
rather than individual end users that
means that we can do a more in-depth
interview of people that really
understand the market and where it's
been get where it's where it's going
where it's heading so it provides an
aggregation of end user requirements and
they market players that we talked to
was split by our leading mobile
operators leading SES market players
leading OEMs in particular in the auto
and a medical sectors we conducted 20
in-depth interviews at the sea level
primarily sea level and we had a
regional split between North America
Europe and Asia pack so that's the the
first survey but then standing on its
own it's fine but put it together with
some quantitative work at the same time
and it becomes much stronger so I want
to report also on a survey to which was
a quantitative assessment of IT
integration expectations this was a
survey actually conducted by acceder as
a result of their conference had a
conference in June of this year in
Cambridge Massachusetts that is and they
their conferences they get a lot of
adopters a lot of adopters who have
specific interest in service enablement
and service enablement platforms and the
opportunities that represents so they're
very knowledgeable in that sense as
interviewees and they surveyed seventy
nine of them for of m2m solutions all
using managed se services the regional
split was primarily North America but
also some your
and I have two slides related to that
that is I think very relevant to the
discussion that we're having about the
development of m2m in the enterprise and
then survey three is a quantitative
assessment of se services requirements
we conducted a survey we conduct surveys
all the time but this particular one was
a survey of m2m adopters conducted by us
those with service enablement services
experience and we looked at seven key
sectors the transport sector the energy
sector the health care retail security
industrial and also the consumer sector
because that's becoming clearly more
important and this was of 210 adopters
with a regional split of North America
Europe and Asia pack so out of it what
we've got is a quantitative survey of
nearly 300 adopters plus 20 in-depth
interviews with market players so it's
quite a substantial package of surveys
that we've conducted so I'm now going to
talk about the the first of those and
I'm going to go through a series of
questions that we asked and then the
answers and what that means so that the
first question was what are the primary
drivers behind any interim project
you're involved in implementing and the
one might discuss the percentages in
particular you can see those but the the
highest score was enabling new services
second highest was creating operational
efficiency and reducing costs and the
third was improving existing services
now when I said earlier that m2m used to
be about operational efficiency but it's
now moving much more towards creating
and enabling new services so this is
helps to reflect that it shows that the
operational efficiency is
important but we're now moving much more
towards enabling new service
opportunities and what that means is
that the companies involved with
implementing m2m are looking much more
at the strategic opportunities the ways
of differentiating themselves in the
marketplace and creating new revenue
opportunities in the marketplace rather
than just saving costs so it used to be
about operational efficiency and
reducing costs and it's now increasingly
seen as enabler for the new services so
that's that's a very useful finding
secondly which of these do you consider
to be the top three priorities in
delivering m2m projects now Judson
referred to this chart in his keynote
earlier on in a slightly different order
but it's the same slide and the top
three priorities as he went through were
ensuring into end security integration
with IT and coordinating partners in the
value chain em to and the with the
interim value chain are often being
complex so the point here is that
ensuring end-to-end security has become
much more important over the last two to
three years in m2m and that's coincided
we think with a greater need to
integrate the the m2m data with the rest
of the enterprise that I'll be coming
back to that with further findings that
support that so n2n security is now
really important all of the participants
in the survey stress that but
integration with IT also comes from
enabling new services as you need to
enable new services there are more parts
of the organization that need to be
involved in the activity so it's no
longer a service only type of support
function so it's all consistent with
with that and of course what we're
finding
is that over time m2m solutions are
becoming more complex because there are
more people know needing to be involved
in providing for them there's obviously
a real need for somebody to coordinate
these solutions to provide almost like
an ecosystem or a partnership structure
and that again is something that Judson
was talking about in his keynote
downstairs so that so the top three
priorities seen as those and the
co-ordinating partners in a value chain
is clearly seeking leadership for each
solution and making sure that those
solutions can then be implemented
quickly and efficiently the other point
that I would just make is that it does
not reduce the significance of these
other points so delivering within time
frame achieving cost-benefit constraints
ensuring into end compatibility and so
forth these are all important and in
individual projects they might be the
most important and that was stressed by
a lot of the survey participants but
overall most people view these ones as
being me the highest so skip one has
skipped one so the third one then is to
what extent would it be an advantage to
have the same software development
environment for all parts of the m2m
solution using the same programming
language this actually obviously brings
us towards a Java environment and the
opportunity for a Java environment now
if you were cinterion I don't know if is
there anybody from centering in the room
okay good so cinterion it's actually
kind of us and we know them very well
and they were launching this week an
updated Java environment for their
modules for their cellular modules as in
the m2m sector and they are pursuing the
idea of
the module being at the edge and then
looking for Java related application
environment at the center as well and
providing closer integration between the
two ends to create more of an integrated
over all clean environment so they they
are pursuing that and if we were to ask
them this question as part of the survey
they would say that it's a major
advantage to have the same software
environment for all parts of the m2m
solution now thats the type of people
that we were talking to was quite varied
some people providing solutions in the
enterprise end and some of providing
solutions of the consumer end and for
those that are providing applications
for small devices they have concerns
about the environment that is needs to
be supported by those devices small
memory requirements for processing
capabilities and so forth so they would
be in the category that we're looking at
a minor disadvantage or possibly a major
disadvantage in trying to have the same
environment that could be then Java but
overall I think it's significant that
forty percent thought that it would be a
major advantage to have one environment
a further ten percent that it will be a
minor advantage and then a further
thirty five percent thought there would
be no particular benefits or dis benefit
either way so if you take all those
together that's eighty five percent
didn't think there would be a
disadvantage but i think that when we
move forward yeah there there points was
that the device Slayer and the
application layer is very different the
data in devices versus processing in the
cloud the requirements are different for
those two ends but i think that where
we're going to see over time an
increasing need for processing at the
edge of the network in some applications
higher intelligence we're going to see
faster processing more processing so we
had the representative from arm
also joining Judson at the keynote and
they're looking to increase the
penetration of their processors or their
design processes arm processors in n
devices in the m2m an IOT space and I
think this is all consistent with a
larger environment a larger population
of devices at the end that support a
Java like environment so I think that
we're going to see over time these
advantages gaining ground and I think
that if we were to do the same survey in
a couple of years we would find I think
that we would find that those
considering to be a major advantage
would be would be larger those that see
no advantage now begin to seen advantage
so I think this whole thing will shift
much more towards there being an
advantage in in having Java but there is
a an awareness in the marketplace that
there's a lot of connected devices out
there that don't use that c++ c plus and
so forth and the engineering environment
also is used to that environment so
moving from where we are now to an
environment where they could be in to
end one software development environment
will take a while and it may never be
entirely achieved in some areas but it's
so this there's a lot surrounding this
that needs to be thought about and needs
to be signals put out into the
marketplace of the capabilities of
having a single software development
environment and the opportunities of
that might represent so the next one was
what are your primary considerations
around securing m2m solutions machine
data and I talked earlier about security
has become much more important over the
last couple of years for m2m so it's not
really a surprise that these different
aspects
the security all scored relatively
highly the only one that scored lower
was data must be secured to avoid bad
publicity and or- user reactions that's
obviously a reflection of the fact
there's been a lot of private data has
got into the public domain through
hacking and so forth recently but that
was felt to be by some to be more a case
of organizational issues rather than
secure and technically technically
related issues so that one's got a
little bit less maybe not so worth
commenting on this but the the important
thing is that it's not just security per
se it's it's all forms of security and
now seen as very important for m2m and
then the next one is to what extent you
consider it important to manage the
large volumes of machine generated data
to address performance and costs there
are expectations for much larger volumes
of m2m data in the future so Judson was
talking about big data I've been I've
been advised by Oracle that it's one
thing to talk about big data and it's
another thing to talk about large
volumes of m2m data and that there is a
distinction between the two but
nevertheless there's a lot of data going
to be coming out in these connected
devices over the next decade if you like
as we move much more towards a
connecting environment so it makes sense
that there needs to be much more thought
put into how that's processed what's
processed and the value that comes from
that one of the comments that was that
while volumes of m2m data requiring
storage is often not huge at presence in
the b2b sector it is expected to be much
more significant with higher value in
the future both in b2b and in b2c b2c be
to be because of closer integration with
the enterprise and more parts of the
enterprise
and there's findings in the second
server that support that and beta B to C
because we're talking about consumer
environment lifestyle opportunities
creating sense from much wider sets of
data and then obviously that that has a
life of its own more than once we talked
about complex event processing the
opportunities for gaining insights from
real-time intelligence and it was
generally felt that that could open up a
whole new world of solutions and there's
a separate question relating to that so
then the next question is which of these
provides the most value in extracting
intelligence from collected data all of
these options are really strategic in
their sense so we wanted to find out
whether clients have been talking about
trying to gain solutions in this in this
in these areas and that is the case most
of them have been looking at it not
perhaps being implementing it yet but
certainly beginning to assess how the
data can be used in more strategic terms
so this one the tailoring products and
services to meet specific customer needs
scored highest but also sharing
intelligence across departments within
user company also scored highly and
there's more about that in the next
survey and improving operational
decision making for example there
automating various things and that that
whole area of driving operational
benefits at a more strategic level not
just the support level that also scored
highly so all of these are growing
interest to adopters as I say increasing
interest in using m2m data for strategic
analysis and decision making but it is
very early days for this people are not
quite sure
how to use it in particular there's
they're not sure of what the value is
they need to assess the value to be able
to justify spending the resources to to
get it so what's the benefit of storing
large volumes of data what's the return
on investment and what data to store
these are all questions that people are
asking themselves at the moment and for
those people that already have
experience in data analytics and in
helping people to answer those questions
we think that there's a lot of
opportunities out there to be talking to
m2m solutions purchases now adopters now
to make them more aware of how they can
gain value and with what sort of cost
and so forth because they really don't
know at the moment key area how
important is minimizing downtime in your
n2m implementation this might seem like
a bit like a no-brainer but actually
it's not so eighty percent of
respondents said it was always critical
and twenty percent said it was sometimes
critical the thing is that minimizing
downtime of assets monitored has always
been a key m2m benefit one of the things
that m2m has offered is a feedback of
when an asset in the field is either
about to fail or has just failed and the
point then is to be getting technical
support out to that device quickly to
get it back online and thereby reduce
the downtime in a process so it could be
for example a printing press that's
about to fall over if a printing press
goes down during a print run then that
could be hundreds of thousands of copies
of the news of a newspaper go go out
late or not at all so yeah some of these
things are really really critical and
some more critical than others so but
basically minimizing downtime of assets
has always been a key issue in yeah
always it does depend a bit on what the
process is obviously I mean so a
newspaper is necessarily printing all
the time but then you'll get industrial
processes that are running 24 by 7 yeah
so if if in a paper you know that it's
there's a potential for something to
fall over just when you're starting it
up then you can do something about it
yeah no not necessarily hundred percent
of the time yeah although yeah it is
becoming much more one hundred percent
of the time depending on what the
activities are becoming much more
mission critical yeah that's a very good
point because we're now finding that the
m2m solution itself although it used to
be seldom a mission critical activity in
its own right it is now becoming so
because organizations are beginning to
rely much more heavily on their m2m
solutions because it's not just support
functions it's strategically related
services as well so the whole
expectation of minimizing downtime is
moving not just for the assets that are
being monitored but for the solutions
that are provided the monitoring yeah so
m2m is increasingly used to create
differentiation in the adopters own
market sector a competitive advantage
through better service which often needs
to be available 24 by 7 so it's really
confirming your question there and then
increasing reliance on m2m data
throughout the organization means a
greater integration with those other
activities and I got something more
about that in the next survey we need to
move on quite swiftly and then what
value can be gained from complex event
processing not so much from existing
interim applications the major
opportunity for this is really future
b2b and especially b2b to see
applications so from that previous slide
the insight from real-time intelligence
can open up a whole
new world of solutions which was the
sort of quote that came back to us from
that survey and examples of that are you
know weather conditions in agricultural
management's predicting performance
failure of large population of big
generators in the field pollution
management traffic management's
real-time human behavior profiling
facial recognition that would be very
much an issue for Homeland Security and
so forth you write
they're always
right yes yes that is the didn't we
explain what it was yeah yep
yeah yeah yeah okay many customers are
investigating this now is the sort of
response that we got back from some of
these solution providers so this is not
something that is really big in m2m and
IOT now it's more a case of this is
where we think it's going and this is
the thing that we the sort of thing that
we need to look at in the future and it
all goes back to what I was saying
earlier about assessing the value
assessing the investment that needs to
be conducted and then trying to work out
the return on that investment so it's
very current at the moment so we would
expect that whereas sixty-five percent
thought it was a high-value potential in
the future and thirty-five percent
thought it was a moderate value we would
expect this to increase over the next
two to three years and then what is the
importance should be given to
cloud-based services in m2m projects and
clearly you know the results really were
pretty universally very very important
but the key points here are m2m market
players are major users of cloud methods
there has been a pretty major transition
to cloud delivery services over the last
few years because it greatly reduces the
cost of complexity in delivering an m2m
solution it greatly reduces the total
cost of ownership for customers so from
a cost point of view it's a no-brainer
almost and from a benefit of getting
things to market more quickly it's also
something of a no-brainer so it's all
good news really in terms of cloud-based
self cloud-based and m2m are very much
interrelated okay that was the first
survey and I'm going to rush through the
others so that you can get some
complementary comparisons between those
so this adopter quantitative survey as I
said was it was surveyed by axeda
acceder as an m2m platform provider
based just near Boston and they operates
Marilyn North America but also in Europe
and some Sam also in the asia pac region
they do an annual conference connections
conference which was in june this year
and the survey represents leading
adopters of m2m platform managed
services so this what is your
organization's ERP CRM system
integration status what are you doing
about integrating with the ERP CRM and
in fact with data warehousing or data
analytics and the results showed that
eleven percent have already integrated
that have already started to do that but
the further sixty-three percent are
planning to or thinking about doing so
so these people that have been running
m2m applications for a while they've now
got through the operational
opportunities and they're now looking
specifically at how they can improve
that into more strategic gain more value
from a closer integration with the
enterprise so thirty-nine percent need
to integrate interested twenty percent
planning four percent schedule eleven
percent integrated so all of these are
relating to that okay and the second one
that there's this app is what business
functions would you be most likely to
share your connected product information
with and the highest scoring is
development and engineering and that's
because beginning to see feedback from
the field of how products are performing
and then using that information to
redesign products so that doesn't happen
in the future so improving the field
performance and as seen as hugely
important these other ones product
marketing so that's looking at future
future design as well and future
messages to the marketplace marketing
and sales it's been put to me that if
you can buy
product marketing and marketing together
it's actually higher than development
and engineering so it's it's a very even
mix across different departments within
the enterprise that are looking for this
kind of information so m2m data is no
longer the preserve of just the service
department that's something that I said
earlier but as I said this particular
finding helps to confirm that and why
now I'm going to move on to the service
enablement study but before I do I think
it might be quite helpful just to
introduce some more m2m market dynamics
how we see the market developing
generally and how we categorize that in
terms of the applications so in general
terms we have three ways of three
categories of m2m applications that the
first is is after market which is
basically stuff that's out there in the
field and you want to then connect it so
you go out there you connect a modem or
something you bring the data back and
then you process that data through the
internet that has loads of medium volume
per application it's an add on
networking it's a retrofit because it's
not it's not something that's been done
during during manufacture medium to high
cost per unit and it often requires a
high level of support so that has its
own yeah these are typical sort of
applications in those areas and that has
its own dynamic regulatory on the other
hand is where a new regulation is passed
and that requires then a new application
to be put into the marketplace good
examples of that are the toll collect
system in Germany which is a way of
charging for use of Autobahn for heavy
goods vehicles meter reading there's
been a lot around about smart meters and
in Europe it's progressing on a
country-by-country basis in the u.s.
it's progressing on a somewhat different
way but in Europe it's very much do too
relations coming in first of all of the
EU level and then secondly for each
country as to what is required to be
done in a particular time scale and
equal is emergency call which is
expected to be introduced for all cars
in the European markets the thing is
it's been shifting a bit from twenty
twelve to twenty thirteen then 2014 and
2015 and asked I think 2016 but well
have to wait and see so I put that one
at the end as it's going to be there
sometime but not quite sure when so the
thing about these are that these are
medium to high volume during the
installation phase because a new piece
of kit needs to go out there but it
needs to go into the installed base
replace what's already there and then
you know that hump of installation is
over it's an embedded networking kind of
thing it's a low cost per unit and it
favors a tendering process so that has a
very different type of dynamic to
aftermarket applications but then we get
the third area which is line fit and
this is OnStar telematics was a good
example of that where General Motors put
the connectivity and they put the
application into some vehicles to
differentiate them in the marketplace
and to gain a new service opportunity in
jet engines we've got people like Rolls
Royce who monitor jet engines in the air
to see when they potentially going to
fail and then improving the maintenance
of those the timeliness of providing
parts and so forth to reduce their
downtime in the air and then just
another example pumps many more pumps
are now being connected and that
provides the opportunity for the
manufacturers to move from selling a
pump to selling the capability to pump
something so they pumped so much of a
liquid in so much time and then charge
for that rather than just the selling
the physical pump so the these are
medium to high volume the embedded net
working because the manufacturer puts
the connectivity into the product low
cost per unit and an increasing requires
international coverage these ones in
particular introduce new business models
into the m2m market and it's the
business model opportunities that is
really the the big new opportunity that
m2m provides and just one further slide
related to this what that means in terms
of volumes is that you know aftermarket
is a relatively yeah there's a
population devices out there and once
they're connected they're connected so
there's not a huge opportunity for
growing that base regular tree will go
through a hump of implementations and
then start to die down but this other
one OEM based or line fit is the one
that we see most of the opportunity in
the future so as we move more towards
embedded connectivity we move much more
towards the future huge growth
opportunities in the m2m market so then
on to the service enablement study
itself and the survey results so a very
brief explanation of what we mean by
service enablement it's this bit here
that sits above network connectivity
which is you know the airtime the
physical network so it could be fixed
Network it could be wireless network and
the value-added services on the top
which we define as end user services so
the fleet management type of application
the telemetry type of application
bending our operations and so forth
these are all what the user sees and
pays for at the end of the day and what
we're getting to see is greater
opportunities for this middle area to
develop with a whole range of
application of end-user services and
help to get those to market more quickly
and at lower cost
okay I I could go on but I'm going to be
running out of time but they're so the
the sort of groups that we're talking
about are these from our last survey we
identified 22 service groups and a total
of 112 service elements that could be
included within these 22 service groups
these columns are there for a reason but
for the purposes of this presentation
it's just interesting to notice that
there are 22 service groups now and when
we did our first study we found 14 and
we found about 54 service elements
within those so we've seen a dramatic
increase in the opportunities in service
enablement over the last couple of years
or so and there are a variety of reasons
for that and one of the key questions
that we asked people was do currently
cater for these services with in-house
or externally purchased resources nearly
half said they were using in-house
resources at the moment both of these
being used both both in-house and
externally purchased thirty-seven
percent for perhaps different product
lines so product manufacturers using an
in-house method for one or externally
purchased for for others and then using
a hosted service only in in fifteen
percent so we see the market moving much
more towards a hosted service where
there is a division of responsibility
and expertise if you like between the
the managed service offering the
horizontal stack that can be provided to
an adopter to implement his services
more quickly in the marketplace and the
user who is doing that at the moment
though the majority of the market is
used as doing their own thing so we can
see a tremendous opportunity if you
combine this together there's a huge
jesibl markets of opportunity for moving
that towards a managed service but for
the adopters of in
House solutions doing it themselves we
think they're going to struggle to keep
up development initiative when you bear
in mind all of these types of areas that
are going to become more important for
differentiating products and services in
the future so we think that adopters who
are doing their own thing at the moment
will find it a struggle to keep up with
the developments in the marketplace and
we think the opportunity is ready for
the development of the managed service
market very quickly related to that I
keep looking my watch to make sure I
don't run a time network enabled
products shipped now and future we asked
people in the survey how many of your
product lines get shipped
network-enabled now and how much of them
do you expect to be network enabled in
the future this green line shows one to
ten percent of our products a shipped
network enabled and they expect that to
reduce over the net over the over the
period so this was asked in 2010 and
then in the future they're looking at
the majority of their products being
network-enabled increasing substantially
so what this is sharing is that it's
going to become more standard to embed
connectivity during product design much
more towards the OEM based applications
that i was talking about earlier so it
helps to confirm that we're moving the
market much more towards embedded
connectivity and the embedded processing
and everything else that goes with that
and then the other issue is the number
of countries worldwide where products
are required to be connected and what
we're seeing is the number of countries
the country coverage increasing
substantially over a relatively short
period of time so the peak in 2010 was
expected to be 225 countries the peak in
2012 expected to 6 12 20 countries and
the peak for 2014 is 21 plus countries
now I would stress that this is a psalm
and this is a sample of people who
understand service enablement it's not
intended to be a general statement of
the speed of change in the overall
market that would be somewhat slower but
for those people that really understand
what their requirements are and what
their requirements are going to be in
the future this shift towards
multi-country coverage is clearly well
established so end-to-end solutions are
becoming more international in scope at
the same time as becoming more embedded
as well just going back to the sector
diagram that I used earlier this is in
fact a simplified version which we it's
matt is perhaps more slide friendly but
it shows basically the same things and
the important point here is that m2m has
been as I said earlier about what's been
going on in individual sectors so what's
been going on in the building sector so
there'll be a building's related
intelligent buildings type of service
created that will be very specific to
that sector or the energy sector smart
metering smart grid and consumer and
home a lot going up in there like Kim
Kindles and things like that connected
devices health care and so forth so what
we've been finding over the last decade
really with m2m is that a variety of
individual services are grown up in each
of these sectors which have very
relation very little relationship across
sectors all right it's been vertical
silos but now we're finding a series of
new type of opportunities arising of
which smart city is one example where
you might find the need to share data
across say the energy sector the health
care sector the transport sector and the
security public safety sector you might
put buildings in there as well so
depending on what your definition is of
Smart City but the important thing is
that we're moving from individual
sectors to multiple sectors to create
new service opportunities and that's
where we get much more into the Internet
of Things type of issues the
infrastructure
support requirements for those and
they're bound to be much higher in terms
of numbers and the amount of data that's
there and the security that's required
for that then has been traditionally the
case in b2b so we see IOT actually as a
development of m2m we see m2m is the
starting point and evolving towards IOT
at the same time as b2b itself
developing so we see two trends
developing one greater integration for
b2b type of applications but
substantially still n2m and then the
development of a new environment and
Internet of Things environments which is
substantially B to B to C and a whole
new set of dynamics that will grow up as
part of that and we see that happening
quite quickly over the next few years so
just to summarize we then did a
projection of a forecast of value and
this bottom line is Network revenue so
typically airtime revenue this at the
top is the value added service revenue
what the user pays for that service that
he's receiving but then in the middle
here we've got this service enablement
area the horizontal elements and we see
that growing very rapidly over the next
few years as the need for platforms
develops in the marketplace and moves
much more towards an inter operation
between some platforms and then also
move towards Internet of Things so
value-added services our end user
services represent a large part of the
revenue stream but vertically aligned
connectivity is growing due to rapid
increase in m2m connections but is now
subject to aggressive competition
between carriers so the margin is
declining in that area adopters will
increasingly need to rely on high
quality service enablement services and
that means that is the fastest growing
element in our view of those three so am
i coming to some key take
weighs just these last two slides which
are talking about what do we make of all
this we see m2m as a primary prep that
the primary driver for m2m solutions is
now enabling new services rather than
just operational efficiency and cost
saving it's all about creating market
differentiation for b2b adopters to
deliver new competitive edge that's what
m2m is all about as a result m2m data
becomes increasingly important within
organisations so the implementation
priorities now are ensuring end-to-end
security integration with IT
coordinating partners in a value chain
and others as well having said that that
means that security has shot up the
priority list it wasn't always the case
but it's clearly very important now and
we see that as linking to IT and the
rest of the enterprise has really been
the game changer there because there's
much more need for security as a result
of that then there has been previously
we see integration with ERP CRM data
analytics now have high interest sharing
m2m data widely within organisations in
particular feedback to our Indies I
showed on that acceder slide data
volumes expected to grow substantially
in future both for b2b and for b2b to
see introducing the whole idea of what
to do with it how to process it thoughts
about big data and so forth indicates
the important trends developing be to be
moving to enterprise integration more
data use more widely and more
strategically at the same time be to be
to see new market developing in consumer
and lifestyle related services the
Internet of Things and once you're
talking about Internet of Things
processing of large amounts of data plus
in real time so we get much more towards
complex event processing that's the
first set of takeaways and here's the
second set so as a result of these
trends we see m2m solutions become
increasingly mission-critical minimizing
downtown and higher availability of
solutions we see the same software
development environment for all parts of
end-to-end solutions could be a major
advantage in the future but the
requirements for each point in the
solution is different so this was
emphasized during the survey and need to
be optimized for own function so the sum
of correct parts is key what's what's
key for individual elements of the
solution and then integrating it overall
but there is an opportunity clearly for
a Java like environment in each part of
that chain as the Java environment
adapts to be the correct answer for each
element cloud is key to m2m greatly
reduces the cost and complexity of
delivering m2m solutions and service
enablement is essentially cloud-based
the future of m2m is an embedded
connectivity in everything
internationally service enablement is
key for m2m and IOT market developments
we see it as a way of managing the
fragmented market and turning it in fact
into an advantage because of the
differentiation that can be introduced
but at the same time being able to
manage it to bring it all to market by
using platforms but we see these
platforms then having to interoperate
for Internet of Things to allow data to
move from one sector to another sector
to create cross-sector opportunities and
then more m2m services will come to
market with more sophistication than
adopters can develop themselves we
believe so we think that m2m adopters
will increasingly need to partner with
se SES providers to achieve competitive
edge in their own markets we see that as
an inevitability moving forward from
where we are now so that's the that's my
presentation so
I don't if there are any questions or
with it allowed to go for coffee yes
it's crucial back
industrial automation well in that's
that's interesting so industrial
automation adopted a lot of these
techniques ahead of most other sectors
so during the 70s and 80s there was a
lot of work on developing horizontal
platforms if you like that could
implement automation and control in the
industrial sector so if you like an
awful lot of the principles that we're
talking about have been adopted first in
the industrial sector and then spread to
a number of other sectors one of the
companies that we've dealt with in the
past is the looking at press and press
printing is Heidelberg in based in
Heidelberg and you could you could say
that they are actually part of the
industrial automation process but they
also represent an example of an m2m
application and the remote monitoring of
those applications and the development
of the platforms yeah
I can't actually hear you is right right
yeah
yep yep
right
yep
yeah I think well once you start looking
at cloud-based services then security
becomes very very important particularly
when mixed with the need to move towards
more strategic information that's
getting used more generally in the
organization I have to say that a lot of
automation and control is not
cloud-based so it's it's quite locally
based and that's to get three quick
responses that are needed for those
types of environments so in a way
there's a not a direct parallel you know
be the idea of using horizontal services
service enablement as a concept was if
you like prefaced in the industrial
automation space but there's no direct
parallel into the cloud-based services
and the security issues associated with
that because it's really gone in a
different path because of the local
requirements so you can take the analogy
too far i think and i think that's
trying to make it go to you well right
sorry yeah I think you were next
so for example i run a manufacturing
facility and we're looking at doing a
lot of this but one of the things we're
realizing is that that because i have
one
I don't need to
as we have to put PLC's right on the
price right we don't have to do that now
we can actually put sensors on the press
that are available to brighten collect
the data central right yep there are
trends around technology yeah well the
PLC environment is is a very interesting
one actually for service enablement
facilities but it is quite a specialized
environment as well so actually you're
talking about a subset almost of the
service enablement groups that need to
be tuned for plc type work and one of
our clients actually is very much
involved in doing that so yeah the
general principles are adopted but they
do need to be tuned for different
environments are thinking and that's
really I think what you're talking about
yeah yeah no they're actually
sir I didn't quite understand the
question right off the right a little
bit again return and everything but
actually well what we're seeing is the
numbers of connections moving
substantially in two different sectors
so we can track it from that point of
view we do do quite a lot of survey work
on an annual basis we don't necessarily
do the same survey exactly the same way
so we do have indications that
particularly awareness is increasing
among the user community and the
opportunities and the benefits that can
be achieved through m2m and greater
integration is also increasing and that
I think is reflected then in a greater
connections base and I it does that
answer your question right yeah okay
read what I actually like really making
the unequal particular laughter the
effect yeah I think from a user's
perspective they don't care so much
about the technology they care much more
about the overall solution and whether
it does what they want and whether it
does it cost effectively so it's really
the but that the players and the value
chain that need to assess that and I
think that so I gave the example of sin
Terry on earlier who have standardized
on Java for their m2m modules and they
see a tremendous future for them in
developing closer integration with the
cloud-based applications so that there's
an integration across the piece we are
seeing a much greater need in m2m
platforms generally to have software
agents that are either in devices or
closely associated with devices that are
then integrated with the application
platforms so over time we're going to
find that developing has become much
more of a standard activity if you like
so i think the opportunity for java as
part of that is going to be greater in
the future than it has been in the past
yeah that's not so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
