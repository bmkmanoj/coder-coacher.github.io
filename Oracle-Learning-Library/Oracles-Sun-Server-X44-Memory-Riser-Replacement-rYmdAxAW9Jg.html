procedures replacing a memory riser card
important the complete service procedure
for this task is available in the server
service manual see the link at the end
of this video to replace a failed memory
riser card in the Sun server x4 dash for
prepare the server for service following
ESD and components serviceability
requirements identify the failed card
using the server test circuits replace
the failed card taking care to replicate
the dim configuration exactly and when
you are done return the server to
operation to prepare the server for
service use our pile on the power off
the server to standby power mode you can
also use the operating system or the
server front panel power button before
going to the server use Oracle I LOM to
turn on the servers locator indicator
the locator indicator helps you find the
server when replacing a memory riser
card create an ESD safe workspace use a
wrist strap and ensure that the server
is completely removed from the power
source the memory riser card is a
customer replaceable cold service
component for cold service disconnect
the AC power cords from the server
remove the server cover the memory riser
cards are located inside the server
between the fan modules and the CPUs
your server might have for memory riser
cards or it might have ate the number of
cards depends on the number of CPUs in
the server to find the memory riser card
use the system font remind test circuit
the system fault remind test circuit is
a charged time limited circuit once
power is removed from the server you
have 30 to 60 minutes to use the circuit
press and hold the fault remind button
and look for the card with a lit fault
indicator the indicator is visible
through a small hole on top of the card
to remove the failed memory riser card
lift the ejector handles to their fully
open and upright position use the
handles to pull the card straight up and
out of the server set the replacement
card next to the failed card transfer
the dims from the failed card to the
replacement card taking care to
replicate the dim configuration exactly
tip transfer the dimms to the
replacement card one at a time to
install the memory riser card ensure
that all dem ejector levers are in their
closed position position the card in the
server by aligning it with the slot edge
guides carefully lower the card into the
slot ensuring that it is aligned with
the connector on the motherboard to seat
the card firmly push it down to prepare
the silver for operation install the
cover connect the server power cables
and power on the server summary when
replacing a memory rise a car and create
an ESD safe workspace use a wrist strap
and ensure that the server is completely
removed from the power source use the
system fault remind test circuits within
30 to 60 minutes of removing power from
the server when transferring dims to the
replacement card ensure that you
replicate the dim configuration exactly
