product manager on Oracle Fusion
Middleware my focus area is Oracle so a
suite in Oracle service bus today we're
going to talk about rest enabling Sowa
and we'll have a short demo for years
Oracle so a suite has enabled companies
to unlock the potential of their
enterprise information through
integration to be more agile and to
support changing business requirements
so a--
allows us to integrate different systems
to achieve a common goal one of the key
benefits of so a suite is the ability to
integrate to a wide variety of systems
from packaged applications to custom
applications all the way up to the cloud
and all the way down to the mobile
devices in our users hand through the
years of our experience with integration
we've learned that the channels of
access are ever-expanding and this is
where it work also a suite meets our
needs let's take a look at this from the
perspective of supporting mobile devices
much of the existing applications are
connected via Web Services commonly
understood as soaped based services and
even specialized adapters as our users
adopt mobile devices they look for new
ways to access Enterprise Information
on-the-go the mobile device platform
needs a lighter-weight way to
communicate with back-end services and
usually require rest based services a
rest-based service is essentially used
as common HTTP interaction patterns and
the data payloads moving between the
device and the service are typically
much smaller than a soap style payload
when faced with a need to add mobile
devices the enterprise needs to be able
to provide restful api s in a
non-intrusive manner and this is where
Oracle so a suite comes in using Oracle
so a suite companies can add restful api
s
and reuse the back-end services already
in use today let's look at a simple demo
scenario what we have is a sales order
application we need to receive an order
from a client we record the new or
in our order entry system we then
validate the payment information for the
order to achieve this we have two
services the client calls the process
order service with the order the process
order service records the order then
calls the payment validation service to
validate the payment what if we want to
reuse our validate payment service more
broadly in our enterprise using Oracle
service bus which is included in Oracle
SOA suite we can decouple our services
to promote maximum reuse taking our
basic flow we have defined our services
in Oracle service bus now our validate
credit and our process order services
are virtualized clients do not call the
services directly but use proxy services
to find an Oracle service bus this
allows us to change the underlying
services as needed while shielding
clients from those changes now we want
to address support so since we are using
Oracle service bus we can simply add a
new proxy service to support the rest
based interaction let's go ahead and do
that now this is my development
environment from this environment in
JDeveloper 12c I can work both with so
abhi pull composites and I can also work
with service bus configuration projects
another nice benefit in 12c is that I
can use all of the same adapters that I
use with so uh people along and so a
service bus my interface also looks very
similar what we have open is the
validate payment project which is a
service bus configuration project the
view that we have is very similar to a
so a composite it's not a so a composite
but it's very familiar in the top-down
approach the swimlanes we have on the
left hand side the proxy services are
the interfaces that we create and we
expose through service bus to be used by
the consumers the pipelines and split
joints is the message processing between
the proxy services and
business services and on the right-hand
side we define the business services we
can also define it call to another proxy
service let's take a look at this
particular service
this is a basic soap HTTP service we
want to go ahead and test this first so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right click the proxy service and I'm
just going to select run so what
JDeveloper is doing is deploying this
project to the integrated WebLogic
server and it has opened up the service
bus console let me go ahead and maximize
that console
this is a basic soap payload and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to open a
sample file and pick a payload from that
so I'll pick the payment info sample
authorized payload and I'll execute the
test so what I have is a request
document it's a payment information
object includes things like the card
number expiration date the billing
information in the authorization amount
when I scroll down I can see that I have
a basic soap style response in the main
information that I'm interested in is
the Status element which in this case
returns the status of authorized this
service will return either authorized or
denied so what happens if I want to rest
enable this service perhaps I have a
mobile device that needs to make a call
to validate a payment I can simply
right-click the pipeline and I can go
ahead and select exposes rest and this
opens up the new rest binding wizard
I'll go ahead and give my new rest
service a name I'll call it validate RS
for validate rest service and I can also
give it a description
I have a common resources area and the
resource path that I'm going to leave is
the root resource I also have operation
bindings and I'm going to go ahead and
edit this so the operation that I have
is the validate operation and at the
root resource and the standard HTTP
verbs are get put post and delete this
is a query API so I'll leave this is get
that can add a description here as well
now we did this based on the pipeline
which was based on a canonical ordered
definition or schema and through that
the wizard already determined the
following URI parameters now for my use
in this case I'm not going to use all of
the parameters I'm only going to use
some of them so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to select some of the
parameters the payment type the card
name first name and last name the
address line city state and zip phone
number and the authorization date and
I'm going to go ahead and remove those
parameters so what I have left is the
Cardinal expire date and authorization
amount but let's say I want to change
the interface that my consumers will use
I can do that right here so now the
parameter that the consumers of this
service will use is card number but that
map's over to the underlying Cardinal
object now I'm happy with the request
side of my service let's look at the
response side since this is a rest-based
service we use the standard HTTP
statuses which in this case 200 means
okay and I'll leave that as it is this
is defaulting to a rest XML payload but
I also want to support rest JSON so I'll
go ahead and select that
if this API did not return a payload I
could select the no payload now as a
developer I am interested in the payload
format that would be returned so I can
go ahead and generate a sample payload
so in this case this is the rest XML
payload and I can confirm that this is
the format that I want I can also look
at the JSON output and I can also
confirm that this is what I expect I'm
happy with the operation I could add a
fault binding but I'm just going to go
ahead and leave that as it is so I'll go
ahead and select ok here and I'm also
happy with the rest service binding so
I'm going to say ok again so J
developers in the process of creating
the proxy service and it's wiring it to
the pipeline so what I see here is I
have two proxy services the validate
proxy service which was a standard HTTP
soap service but I also have the new
validate RS which is a rest-based
service and both of these go to the same
pipeline which routes to the back-end
system or business service so let's go
ahead and test our new proxy service so
I'll right-click this and I'll select
run again JDeveloper is deploying this
to the integrator WebLogic server and
it's opening the service bus console so
what we can see here is that we do not
have the payload object that we had
before but the parameters that this
service respects notice that the first
parameter instead of card num is card
number let me go ahead and put in some
sample data I'll give it an expiration
date and I'll put in an authorization
amount I do know for my service that
$100 should be authorized and when I can
see my XML payload returned as status
authorized now let me go ahead and go
back what if the device connecting
requires an application JSON output I
can confirm that I have the same or the
JSON output that I expect let me go back
one more time let's just see if this
service would validate for $1,000
okay so for this particular account if
we go to $1,000 the status would be
denied so what we have here is an
existing service a back-end service to
validate credit cards
we had a proxy service that was HTTP
soap but we needed to add a rest-based
service so it was as simple as
right-clicking and selecting exposes
rest and so now we have two interfaces
for the same back-end service we hope
