on the oracle unbreakable linux network
or the uln this tutorial is the first of
a series of three videos the first
tutorial will demonstrate registering a
system with uon the second tutorial will
demonstrate using the uln web interface
and the third tutorial will demonstrate
use of the yummie utility to install the
available updates from uln for this
tutorial I'll be using a virtual machine
in Oracle VM VirtualBox
I have Oracle Linux 7 installed as you
can see I'm logged in as the root user
and the network also must be configured
to access you all n so you can see I
have one network interface card it has
an IP address assigned to it and it is
up I'm going to first register my
machine with uln and the command to do
so is UL n underscore register
following window appears the system
registration setup software updates this
assistant will guide you through
connecting your system to you all in for
some time for software updates you can
click on this why should I connect the
uln this is just information box gives
you some advanced some of the reasons
why you might want to connect to you all
in connecting to your system view Ln
allows you to take full advantage of the
benefits of a paid subscription
including security and updates and
support so again this is just a
information box so I'll click take me
back to the registration I'm going to
click forward now it's going to ask me
for my account information my Oracle
single sign-on login and a password and
my CSI so I'm going to provide this
information advanced networking
configuration just if you need to use a
proxy an HTTP proxy connect to you all
then you can configure that here for
this example I don't need to so I'm
going to go ahead and click forward and
then it asked me to create a profile it
wants me to choose a system name and
indicate whether I want to send my
hardware profile information in my
package profile information so I'm going
to give it a name a system name and this
does not change the host name by the way
this is just a name that's used for uln
I'll just call this ul and - video -
demo and you do want to ensure that you
have these two checkboxes checked they
are checked by default in order that
this information can get sent to uln
there's some box there's some buttons
here that you can click to view what is
actually is what exactly it's going to
be sent so this is the hardware profile
information what what version of the
operating system you're running what's
your IP address CPU information memory
and package information these are all
the software packages that are currently
installed on the system so in this
example I selected to install the server
with the GUI based environment packages
and that was all
so once you've given a system name a
unique system name make sure these boxes
are checked click forward and it's going
to send the information this takes a few
seconds
after the information has been sent to
you Oh in the next screen to appear is
to configure reboot less updates and
this is case splice and k splice is
going to be covered in another video
tutorial so for this tutorial I'm going
to uncheck that and not subscribe to the
Cape splice channel so I'll click
forward and I get a chance to review my
just subscription it does say the yum
rhan plug-in has been enabled and it's
automatically registered my system it's
and I and subscribed me to two channels
the unbreakable Enterprise kernel
released 3 for Oracle 7 and the
architecture is x86 underscore 64 and
then the Oracle Linux 7 latest x86 64 so
I've these channels you'll be
automatically subscribed to whatever for
whatever version of the operating system
you're running and for whatever
architecture your system has now through
the web interface you can subscribe to
additional channels and unsubscribe from
channels but these channels are you are
automatically subscribe to these
channels when you register your system
so I'll click forward and updates are
configured software updates setup has
been completed for the system your
system is now ready to receive software
updates if you're running genome or the
gnome desktop you will see this star
will appear in the notification area
when there are updates available and you
can update through the package manager
running on its accessible through gnome
but you can also update using yum from a
command line so I click finish and I'm
back to my command prompt
so my system has been registered this
concludes this video demo proceed to the
second video tutorial in the series
which demonstrates the uln web interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
