to show you something about our new
business application target within
Enterprise month the business
application target is intended to show
you the results of and user sessions in
combination with systems system
components that are already monitored by
Enterprise Manager and you can simply
create such a business application by
combining your end-user data with the
system data and pull it into a single
target I've done that here and I'm
looking at my own and press manager and
environment clicking on the link of this
particular target just gets me to the
home page once the home page is opened
we can immediately see a health
indicator which is calculated from
diverse system components and from the
information that's provided by the
end-user monitoring tools it provides
with readings that tell us something
about which users were logged into the
application what their sessions were how
much views they did things about average
loss time that kind of thing it also
provides us with the tracking indicators
of performance and violations that are
tracked by the end-user and if such a
threshold gets breached you'll see that
the status will change probably that
will happen in during my demo as well
beyond the home page there are several
additional features that have been
pulled into this to this overview one is
the metric page and the metric page is
all about showing all the end-user
metrics that were collecting in
summation within the Enterprise Manager
environment so it allows me to search
for particular users let's say that I'm
going for every user that has
user name so when it's not blank and I
search and I'm doing that for pretty
long periods for 24 hours but just bare
make me for our second and let me close
the search so if it means it gives me an
overview of all the slowest invocations
slowest clicks by end users that were
experiencing the application as you can
see the application is divided into
where we are the particular regions of
Enterprise Manager and what we did that
we had a command link or did we swap
something in the menu and what the
actual button is that was clicked and we
can also see these kind of instances in
aggregation so that shows us the all the
clicks that were done but then in a
timeline so when I look at the last 24
hours
Brin was there traffic on this site how
many concurrent sessions what's the
loading time what were the views and an
actions and I can just add any metric to
his view as far as I want I can even go
to session Diagnostics so that I can
figure out which clicks were done on
behalf of what user so now the system
starts looking at the same set of
information but then with a mind that it
knows which user was actually accessing
the application so let me take the
latest one where I was logged in as a
system and I did 27 pages what is it
gonna do is it's gonna find the
information all the clicks that were
done as me as a user of system within
the application and put them nicely into
a timeline chart once the timeline chart
is created you see immediately which
clicks were done you see
I've logged in went to the homepage
click the button went to the home menu
structure which is something you can
find on the business and then home and I
actually turned to the search direct
page like I've done now put in a couple
of values and then came back each and
every time I did one update you see that
there is traction of how long it took
and where the time was spent if you're
actually seeing how much time was spent
on the application how much time in the
yellow was spent on delivering the
application response to the end user
each and every click that was done when
a user can have one or multiple
underlying objects like in this case
there were actually two calls to the
back end to make this view go back to
the end user one of those clicks is
something that took over five seconds to
complete and by the kind of wrongish
color here we know that it was something
that was taking a lot of time up on the
application server so if you want to
investigate this we can click on either
this Java item or to the log ID this
correlates the information that we've
collected all of Jotham legit yet we can
click on this to see what the activity
was within the JVM so why it took five
over five seconds to complete what it
says is that in the JVM we were only
waiting for the network connection if
multiple samples would have been taken
you would see for example where the
waiting time would have been and if we
want to look inside the application
server can we use that same information
let's go to the log view which was the
other icon that was displayed so instead
of looking at it from a JVM perspective
let's look at it from an application log
perspective we're selecting the same
exact lick and for that we're using
on the oracle another stack something
that is called
easy that's a tracking ID that we used
to correlate events within the stack and
as you can see here within the logs we
can to fine tune notifications if we
click on those we actually get the
individual updates that were logged in
the WebLogic environment for this
particular event so we've just done a
trace from an engines accession saw a
problem and actually drill down through
the JVM into the message log on the
application server on what logic to do
diagnostics and Rilla let's go back to
our business application the other
situation that can happen is that you
actually have an alert coming to the
operation center so there were so many
people that were actually having a poor
performance so an outlier of a page that
took longer than let's say five seconds
when that happens the status turns into
red once the status is red it will
actually fire an alert these will happen
and coming to BM as instance if we look
at a couple of those events that were
triggered in the last 24 hour we
actually see that these are end user
alerts that were fired into enum besides
having the event we have some underlying
information we actually know what the
information was that was gathered what
the filters were in this case there were
page load time and every time that it is
larger than five seconds we actually
want to trigger this alert one of the
things that is very convenient here is
when you get such an alert is that it
directly has a link into that moving
metric page we just been through so we
click here it opens up a ruling metric
page in context of that particular event
so what it does now it to the timeframe
of the event and shows me exactly those
metrics that belong to the event it can
also show many instances that were
related to the event and I get all these
instances that were liking longer than
five seconds and I can immediately start
troubleshooting so when you get an alert
or an event in tells me these five
clicks were larger than five seconds
it's literally two clicks to get to the
bottom of it and figure out which
particular invocation to the back end
was taking so long and then do your
diagnosis to Vivendi or through the log
viewer asked shown before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
