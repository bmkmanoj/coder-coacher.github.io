platform with java x220 control that's a
second division 1 so we did one last
year and I thought maybe we could show
some improvements but well as we went
along with am what we propose to this
talk we figured out well we might do
even better than just doing doing a
second edition so on be up for some
surprise hope you like it so um it's
marking ASA from this design and nice
and lima so I'm with a nap in stream
team so we're both too hardcore swing
development on NetBeans platform places
for a day to job so yeah muddy gives a
shot yet okay so first let's have a
short flash background to what we did
what is shown in last year we've created
some views for new phone app its
platform just about just a short
question who of you has worked on knows
of NetBeans platform just the shortage
of hands and okay who of you has worked
with with it not just no sudden just
worked with oh okay so
not all couldn't could be better but
we've learned ide wars are over so
nothing to do about that Netan netbeans
just a short short introduction here
here you can see the NetBeans IDE it's
showing as a few frames what and it's
way too big ok what you see is the
window system of NetBeans of the toolbar
the Apple the the menu bar in the system
bar some top components and that's these
big components here and again the
project pane you see some trees and
these trees are modeled with a note
structure notes are some abstract
implementations to to make it possible
to have one representation that can be
displayed in several different views
like lists trees trees like here table I
don't have one what wait yes I I can
okay tables as well and would be half of
a property object that describes on the
name and the value of a property of the
note object with it as it is possible to
use one representation of your Delphia
data however it is structured and
display it in these different forms so
it that you only have to take care about
one structure and don't have to model it
especially for three or four table you
just have one it's very it's a very very
good advantage so what we did last year
is we created some summicron some views
that use the node structure of NetBeans
and display the values and the
properties in a job of X component tree
in inside the scene graph so we've used
the basic the basic structures tables
trees we've introduced a special one
especially for pictures and so less and
some graphical candy in here the
property sheet for the spring the
properties and the ideas well let's see
what what came of it now now less this
year in preparing the presentation we
improved the property sheet we had last
year and the embedded browser in
netbeans although now on there's and the
embedded web browser from java accent
that can display the values it still use
a the old swing frame for displaying the
back and forth backwards forwards
buttons
maybe could be it could be improved um
yeah so let's see let's see what we've
got I let me just start the application
so they here's a slightly browned
application will be in startup what you
see here is a basic swing view
consisting of a tree with some notes
some animations to show the sudden some
problems with the swing tree and one of
the reasons we try to convert the these
views to javafx the effect and the
effect you see here is the Dino Dino
displayed can have a an icon the icon
all is displayed in a displayed in its
hole size but the text of the node the
name and the name of the node is
displayed at the fixed point so that if
the picture is bigger than the pre
arranged size the text is written over
it not the nice
if you by converting it to Java vex
we've received some some enhancements
you so that these icons are displayed in
the Rose eyes and then the text follows
if you compare if we compared to the
original one and from that means basic
netbeans it's slightly different
experience and another advantage all the
rows indeed three are only tables can
have different in different sizes and
swing as many of you may know be certain
the size are fixed for for all the girls
all the entries in the tree or table
it's not the nice so tableview have a
view there's some compromise i'll have
to select an entry here and then these
there's some properties and that's read
that are read from the selection it's an
the background only and the
implementation there's some wrapping of
the origin and that means object to
object javafx understands there's a lot
of trickery involved unfortunately to
bridge the gap between the FX
application threat and the swing events
patch that so that you're always on the
correct threading third back end our
application back end that there are
entering is correct it makes a bit
difficult to do that but it's possible s
as you can see here it's should be a
proof of concept so it's doable the
United you we wanted to show not fund we
the nice view we did say it's a chef
view sheriff us and they spin this
picture on the shelf and you can iterate
scores on them let's see which one
should do you should try to take oh boy
oh yeah sorry
that's a bit under path I'm afraid
got it down to success
and adjust that to to declare the full
load that's to be taken for the pictures
and entered here
pictures should be loading
too many pictures today because too many
big creatures that ok what have you seen
its ESPN the pictures are I'll run it
and fixed size for about I think for
another 40 pixels and a drop shadows at
it and a small reflection nice you like
a week I think
more
I wonderful this mean
so the the improvement of the property
sheet i would just want to show you and
this in this view we have a project
linked to it that's displaying the
picture properties the jpeg informations
for the picture I'm just hoping that the
application is going I think I could be
putting folder
ok
maybe another one
sorry
guys
there's a property property shoot
so as you can see max our own aren't
always battled on the fast
yep
incorrect the end of my talk
yep maybe maybe we just should switch
over sorry okay so no not the end of the
session probably but I'm you see where a
lot of difficulties so there's
performance penalty you have always to
switch between the different UI toolkit
threads so that's gives the overhand you
have to wrap everything around back and
forth and do lookups and stuff so well
we thought maybe yeah well just kidding
what's wrong well what's wrong is that
we still have swing in there that gives
us really havoc as far as the actual
Java text implementation is so well can
we do better and well yes we try to get
rid of Swing so what do we do we try to
build a pure Java effects application
framework on top of all those nice
libraries and patterns and modules that
are the heart of NetBeans module system
registration stuff look up utilities
whatever you have and start to write
from scratch and FX application
framework ok so would you like to have
the same experience you have today with
anna prins framework for the java based
framework yes there's a yes so 12 ok so
probably for more
just me well you could could could
access rest api is whatever so it's just
the front end so it is but yeah if you
have your to force to be available
standalone you're probably well done
with html5 most of the time so okay so
and the idea was not to reinvent the
wheel and look deeper behind the the UI
level of the application framework and
yeah just just go ad there's a lot of
engineering effort that's already gone
into NetBeans until that means platform
and just just leverage was there in
terms of patterns and code and yeah okay
so we thought that would be a good
mission yeah take what's their best
practice is best patterns and just just
put effects on top of it sounds easy
yeah alright so what we did is some we
started to get rid of the swing things
so look at the API of the module if
they're swinging there well you're out
okay so we get the ransom container this
is the small you apart registration
things so the the low levels plumbing
you can think of okay you got no swing
so yeah you you got no window system
well okay so probably other parts mmm
well no swing no options so yeah okay
one done oh no explorin oh noes yeah so
notes have properties and properties
have property ages they derive and
inherit from Java Bean properties so
again swing hmm too bad so no swing no
explore unknown oats so it seems yeah we
are really getting not so many modules
as we expected to have as we start it so
whatever what did we do what have we
know already we get a prototype in work
we got the car well it was easy we saw
its writer window system so it's in the
early stages but um it works somehow has
some
or some nice features you need actions
on your toolbar in invent new Birds
report a state is broke probably nice
and yeah those things I call UI elements
that are I know I step components and
netbeans but I'm going to try to to
figure out a different name for them you
will like to have a kind of selection
subsystem so something that tells you
what's already but what's a what's
selected in your application where is
the focus what's the business object
that's blind behind and what are the
capabilities it is involved the
utilities action global context in that
pins term oh yeah and you'll prob like a
property sheets or one of the things we
read it first what still I had to say I
thought well yeah progress API up be
nice I can can just just reuse it well
yet showed up that there is a spring in
this progress API as well not only in
the UI but in the API as well so on okay
we have to do that again there's no
notification things in different map
pins yeah just popping up telling you
well yeah your netbeans is very fast
today well swing tell notifications bill
pending so yeah let's see um I've got a
short demo give you a shot look at how
it works and yeah let's see let's take
you through so we don't need this one
this time it worked somehow magically so
is here open is a netbeans 73 beta ree
with a plug-in to support a development
of this new project type so you see
where you typically have napkins modules
and a napkins platform application you
can now select a I EFX EFX application
so you just go there click Next and say
well yes that's my my nice n VFX ripoff
say shava one demo I say as an
application name you click finish you
hope for the best oh you got an
application say yeah run it that says
well what does it say okay so too bad
probably messed up the thing with the
branding token since I've put in the app
title a another Vela plane to creative
where is the damn thing there okay so
yeah I always try something you say I
put put a unicode characters and the
title of the application that worked but
I'm a 60 branding branding token is a
special kind of type so don't use dashes
so okay you see char one demo you see on
the top yeah you probably can't see it
the system menu integration so that's
new with javafx to dot whatever so there
they put their in name possibility to
say well it's my system menu bar and if
they're a platform support system I knew
boroughs and just put it in there so
that's quite nice you got an about well
that's still in the wrong place but um
we already talked to the effects guys to
figure out a way get a feature request
out there and so about and preferences
should be there where they belong on the
native platforms so they should be here
there should be there somewhere but you
can't access this to pick the moment in
javafx okay so you see you get the
forget your name in there in the
application you got the title so did not
up did not brand this is I can I didn't
Brown the splash screen so yeah you can
do this no problem just the default
netbeans way to you so you figure out
where your resources are and just do
branding stuff for it
well what's already here is a proper
cheat you see probably sheet coming up
seeing there well yeah what view be nice
wouldn't it so I see they are opening in
different parts of the application so
the same old thing from netbeans they're
saying you know you have the place where
your explorers leavin where your
navigator is with your property sheet is
your poop windows well I just a copy
that idea and well there you go you
could even say well I don't like my
properties a year I liked my Poppa do
somewhere else oh do it explore on it
moves to the left I can't put back where
it belongs dot into I call details on
step back there so and this this web
browser is really nice and can do pinch
to zoom can't see me doing it believe me
I'm pinching so that's really awesome so
it's just just the job xtube up you so
that's pretty good what else will see
you okay yeah i put in support for
starting the scenic view just lightly
touching to the actual application so
can fill it around with the values i'd
say i'm really really nice tool i can't
restrain you tell you to use it if
you're doing javafx helps you figure out
what's wrong and I they are a kind of
snapshotting tools so i can snapshot the
actual tabs helps doing presentations
yeah okay so you just get out of the box
already a lot of things so oh yeah i
never got there say i never tried this
but i have to so there's a nun duck
feature so you kind of pull out the tab
and having a different stage you can
even put it back where it came from and
on state should close and the next
version stage will be done close to
cancer but it's a stage preserved so
well there and you got ya get the
history things and stuff so good so
that's what you get out of the box not
too bad probably so let's start at least
what I'm trying to do is a more support
for creating trading stuff them so let
me show you let me show you what what
you have to do to get a proper sheet for
example so I'll see here is everything
we look at today it's the EFX the
platform part you gotta support part
that's the ID integration and you get
done at the end that's vm FX that's my
visual vm clone as I demo application
for the four port the air system already
is able to do so let's look at the
proper sheet you I for example i can
look here behind or easy for me so you
can read the code or shall i increase
the font size it's good ok so the major
thing is as you know from netbeans that
means there's a lot of registration
stuff using using annotations so no
fooling around with the well with xml
files where you can do typos where
things don't don't fit together all
those annotations RS s safe and s type
checked and less i checked from from
content well as you write those
annotation processes so there were a
couple of sessions HR 1 this year about
how to do good intention processing how
things were cause hack into your
compiler things from from yells of chula
and other guys in the team gives me
ah ok good so this was a a example how
the how r UI element is declared see you
you got the display name for that
element you can say okay that hint
should be shown on the on the tab you
say okay I got my unique identifiers so
the system can can figure out which
component you're talking about keep tell
them where it should open up you can say
well I want to have this open at startup
well understand so the perch it wasn't
so forth yeah works so he put in through
we'll just open up at the beginning but
it would tape reserve state so if it's
open and you close the application and
they restart it then it's open again so
there's already works I get it so those
are those are things that are quite
similar to NetBeans but I had things
like CSS so just register a CSS file
they can be pregnant by a normal
netbeans branding technology stuff well
and you could just by brining at the
complete look and feel from replication
so are from just apart today say I don't
want a bigger font size so just replace
that one with the correct CSS and the
reigning tag in the andaman when you're
done and this is already automatically
applied to the component that's created
so you just don't have to know how it is
um just put it there the system makes
sure that the UL there's really living a
CSS file and it's not crashing during
runtime and all this nice stuff the
temptation processes tends to you ok so
this handler ID stuff let's say for
creating the menu entry so I've seen
there was menu entry for the property
sheet well yeah ok we got it under FX my
new window that's the window menu you've
seen there and there's a position
attribute for ordering all the menu
entries so that's very similar to an f
in stars only NetBeans its action and a
job exits up to now its handler since
Java x2 not does not yet have action
so it may be there that will be coming
so up to now you have to figure out how
to deal with this problem that we ever
want to have a display name and icon and
whatever so now okay so that's that's in
the end all you do and I would like to
have Wizards for creating a template for
that so today given me a new tube
component and you fill in the
information in your and your wizard and
then you get this get this output in a
an empty tub component so that we be
nice if you don't have to remember all
this all those annotations and how they
and they are they they they work but
that's saying still work in progress
okay so what else did I and change
compared legends platforms and every
platform has this notion of notes the
notes of properties so now it's nice
properties give me dependency on swing
so that well this property contract well
it's not really between a the property
sheet on the node it's between the
property sheet and the properties so how
about just doing the properties and the
lookup of the note or my replacement of
the note so I'm just asking the know do
you provide properties I said well yeah
I got a property's provider might look
up take this and show them yeah
yeah yeah
yeah so then you will probably like
where is my API there's my p.i you'll
probably like my properties dot provider
interface that gives you back a
observable map of observable listing
properties so you change the properties
the probably shaped will display them so
that's more way more dynamic than what
that means actual has so I got all those
this well I separated those those
concerns if displaying things if they
are available to just the contract
between the property sheet you I and the
property sheet API I and if anybody
wants to do this well is fine I've not
well probably sheet just stays empty
that's fine okay so probably sheet so
how about the object thing yet so EFX
object that's probably the the note
clone so you gotta well you got object
you got children you just tie them
together till them to lazy evaluation
well yeah like nails and children and
that means platform the you gotta look
up and display name and I can yeah so
let's say probably a a a complete clown
nearly complete club so I got a model
here properties and not only get display
name but also property so there's the
possibility to change those what's nice
will this say FX up check is that you it
fits very good to the concept of the
tree view and table view from javafx to
so Java x2 has typed tree views so swing
tended to have well numb typed tree
elements so just mutable default mutable
tree node from whatever object you like
can just do this in the tree it was good
because we're flexible so the tree view
from from FX well it's tired it's all
type T same type for all elements on the
tree so you have to figure out a way how
you maybe not
the same type business objects fit into
this bill so you have to yeah so I wrote
a rendering thing that takes my FX
objects so you just create the epic
objects put your input put your put your
data objects behind them and you get a
display of the information so there's
the binding between my EFX tree view and
the effects object looking after the
children off the display names after
icons and put them in the view so it's
quite similar with netbeans does so you
have this abstraction from your from
from your object that you really want to
show and I just as well I'm of a type
that you can render in this nice tree I
don't care about everything else and if
you want to see more well ask my look up
go so yeah then I got fiddling in the
window system doing split paints one of
the nice things as the split paints have
an end split another to split like and
swing so it's quite you say well you go
one two three four five it's good and
you just start them a recursive thing
like I got the horizontal split pen and
they and i put in a vertical split pan
and the idea veriton split pain again so
you end up with all the nice things you
can become model on you can declare this
actual and the the layered file system
by will be nice if I had annotations
light as well so to make this just more
or less error-prone okay proceed API
webview yeah okay so he's all support
you so how it works what I'm doing is
I'm wrapping the at the moment I'm
wrapping the Daleks to platform
libraries so the JFX our teacher and the
the
native modules but I'm probably in a few
months to show you history just say i
need at least jdk 7 whatever or 8 beta
build or whatever and then you are
you're good to go without those things
since the boobie ship on the classpath
all right so well let's see this a bit
in action so I thought about well what
be a nice demo application that
shouldn't be relying on internet
connectivity should be visual appealing
and graphics and things and yeah
everything every ropa needs I have to
watch my vm so well I love rich things
from the jconsole thing using the vm
attached api's and so you see here all
the VMS running a vm that not running
you see there is a another icon there
it's bound by the properties and you
can't open this that's disabled so but
if you can connect you can click the
title pain and you see first relevant
information about you yeah ok not so bad
so let's see let's open the property
sheet I got the focus back in there oh
yeah so all system properties show up
and that's the view that you would have
seen in the am bfx popular sheet as well
so it would have worked so we backported
the idea so yeah and the UI is a
shameless copy of what they're doing and
singular and so yeah so it was so I'm
gonna graphics artist I'm just a
programmer so of all like something just
to try to copy it's an island don't
reinvent the wheel so yeah so this is
good okay so um we probably have some
work okay let's look deeper into a vm
you can see resizing it's still a
challenge shifter
to go where you want to put the sizing
things so okay so now you're seeing life
the heap usage cpu usage load of classes
threats ours is taken from the from the
MX beans there JP is well I'm saying
that's nice probably oh and then yeah i
like to say memory pool view her
Pepperdine put out there for for um for
visual vm and then um Burt some teasing
block articles from Gretchen about how
you could use javafx shots for that so I
thought well yeah I can so and this
again is a those views here again a
model after the same pattern and their
annotations for registering those those
views inside this panel so extensible
again so I try to apply what I have on
the platform level to my application
again as well just seeing the it's
running with the g1 garbage collector
here so i just wanted to try out will
work and yeah you can see the things
coming up here so but what we
interesting is the ambien browser so any
browsers now those tree view consisting
of esa objects not a rendered so you can
see well yeah I get kept my name it just
play name I got even like in here that's
nice so let's look here maybe we could
just have a look at the compilation now
now the
compilation I should look here it's easy
you see the properties from the
attributes from them XP nor shall there
as I step through the photo tree and the
only thing I did is taking the view the
things from the from the am from DMX
beans and wrap them and those EFX
objects putting the display name of the
properties on them and stack the root
object into this EFX tree I'm done and
it's lazy V evaluated so the tree is
opened and the nodes are billed as you
browse the tree so that's a very
efficient thing you can do with the tree
view from FX so just override how the
children are are created so then let's
say yeah pretty pretty good thing so I'm
saying it's pretty fast
alright so why don't ya I one thing I
had to do is well that's javafx now we
have to have some fancy graphics some
really fancy graphics so well yeah
there's a guy out there who's building
nice controls really nice controlled you
to follow him han Solo on the score like
guys doing amazing things I see two of
those from from Han Solo from Gary
Coonrod and action I know if is really a
well for like type of application an
improvement to have those controls up
there but well you can do and hooking
those two up well I was so easy part and
may would like some some some some some
column based view where you to say well
the top 25 is red and then you just
lighten everything up and if it reaches
the rat and so you see well yeah my
memory goes boom whatever it's so yeah
you can do many more nice things
rendering with a tech so that's just a
just an example so for memory you
shouldn't cpu usage so good yeah and you
still got the you still got a lot
browser sure mr. works
yeah so you got the undock you get this
moving moving things so we could just
say well Oh to see both of them let's
put it down there I will get to open the
publishing again so and you could say
well I want to have full screen mode
think of trust yeah works
so that's basically what you what you
get at the actual state of
implementation so there is a little bit
of persistence for the window system but
sizes are not persisted at the moment
window size is persisted the overall
window size persisted but not those of
the internal components so putting some
more time some more investment into your
writing or completing the docking
framework yeah maybe of interest but
well it's a pretty good start so so so
the way I did it was every time I got
annoyed by just having to click and
click and click into this and this I
started to feature complete this part of
the application so at first I had always
joking all the components and so no no I
just want to open up and show me the VMS
so I put into this the open and start of
thing and so I just went along alright
so that's pretty much it um can look at
the slides again see we get any anything
like this that can go back to your
presentation is always a pleasure
multiple windows multiple screens
multiple everything and that is hiding
it somewhere I don't know where so
looking for the presentation should be
out there it's not so let's try to let's
try to convince him to show me your
keynote it does not like it okay so um
somewhere hmm that was just a running
keynote to stay get confused too thanks
for mountain lion Apple all right good
so your time to ask questions yeah
okay the question is how easy to migrate
from a netbeans rcpt list this guy well
you probably migrate from swing to FX
but all the other concepts are quite
similar so in terms of learning curve
that's pretty pretty pretty easy but you
still have to rewrite your UIs that's
probably still a big deal but in terms
of migrating from swing to FX there's
probably more good news out there there
is probably a swing node and development
that may or may not ship with eight so
we will allow a run swing on top of FX
so that will make transition way more
easy and you don't have to do the
complete complete thing so but well yeah
let's say mayor name may not happen
there was swing note on the slides in
the keynote so I asked which bear and he
said well yeah there is a booking
prototype but they don't know if they
they get it in time but yeah they have a
prototype that but does what we probably
hall would like to have both ways and
batting effects and swinging and swing
and FX but it probably comes with a
price I imagine performance wise but I'm
onna we will see no come yeah
I guess there's not there is no official
thinking snow
versions yep we did start with the arson
yeah so yeah
so yeah prob probably if you if you
already get a running big NetBeans
platform RCP actually I ok so well he
was somehow burnt by using Eclipse
platform yeah and the question was I'm
he hoped to get some some hints at how
to go along with a going public on that
means platform to have to this kind of
type or um how you do this and them well
my personal point of view and then note
terms affiliated with oracle i will
assume that they with those things wing
integration of X integration things you
probably figure out a way more smoother
path from migrating than this say really
yeah it's kind of you you just burn down
your old application and start from
scratch but but still it's a the major
difference may be that you really have
effects all over the place from the
beginning so if you start you maybe
maybe it's such an approach could be an
alternative if you have a big investment
in swing you probably just wait a few
more months and I would assume that they
other big swing applications inside
Oracle or probably doing the same at
this moment yeah
where
survivor
for library
yeah you could use whatever you like so
there's no yeah
consuming
I think I'd say not probably not a thing
that's a depending on Java facts so it's
just if you if you're building a rich
client heavyweight desktop app you're
just looking for I for standard
libraries out there consuming rest api
is so so I'm yeah I'm out for swing
desktop no web know Jason though so
that's a hard question for me but uh
sorry to just interject there's a
project by Jonathan guides and yuan was
called Tata FX they can access api's
rest you're right yeah let's data
objection project they are FX data FX
yeah all right
okay so so the major thing is then we
put this talk up because we were asked
about this a few times already in the
conference that we just stay in a
samurai jack the original chalk and I
want to to get this out as soon as
possible that there are some things that
would like to change before hand to to
make sure it can put it on a very
unrestricted license so things that I
actually for this prototype to stay some
are copied from GPL code that should go
before her before I go but um yeah I I
want to do this yeah okay so it seems to
be interest in such a project all I love
you got the like I got the slides you
got the slide okay yeah there was a
slide is doing asking for him and
wolfman things so three two one yeah
that was the idea so I assume the
probably preferred place with the github
at the moment so uh we're try so um if
you follow me you probably figure out
when I release it so yeah there's
there's definitely interest in such
solutions same so lot of people are
looking for a framework for java facts
we do not want to start writing new
stage and I yeah I understand
good swing
what the yeah okay the question was a
about how to mix swing and FX and the
actual state so in the old times of
javafx script we have a we had swing
running on top of FX with the two dot
version and java-based API if you go to
the vice versa we got FX but you could
embed in this wing application and
what's missing is that we can again and
that swing and effects application or an
F X component somewhere so we we we did
a tutorial about how to rewrite the
swing and swing application now to
migrate to to FX that's one of the the
challenges that you have to respect the
the swing hierarchy so once you put FX
in there somewhere you can't have any
swing inside anymore so if you're
looking at the that hierarchy tree from
from swing perspective well you have to
just starting a deeper and deeper until
you finish at your root so that limits
the possibilities you have to to change
things so we would have liked you to
reuse for example either the swing
property editors yeah just trauma
completely pointless perspective that
would be really nice provide new ones
and FX and everybody who has a
customizer it just gets us cut it may
not look so good but it works but actual
you can't embed the swing coat and the
FX so that would be probably hopefully
in the swing note that would solve this
problem
right for the questions all right so
then safe trip home and thanks for
