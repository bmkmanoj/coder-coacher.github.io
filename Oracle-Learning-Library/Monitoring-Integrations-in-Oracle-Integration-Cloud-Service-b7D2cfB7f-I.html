the problematic transactions quickly and
be able to drill down to find the root
cause the solution is the monitoring
dashboard and integration cloud service
here you get real-time visibility into
the state of your business you can see
how you're running integrations are
processing messages such as how long
they're taking how many messages have
been processed and how many errors have
occurred you can also get a view into
the activity stream for your running
integrations such as details about
successful responses received from the
target application successful responses
sent to the source application and
target application invitations the
dashboard measures and tracks
performance of your transactions by
capturing and reporting key performance
data such as throughput latency and
violations of service level agreements
quickly search for and locate
transactions of interests based on key
business identifiers such as order
number or product names business
identifies enable you to track payload
fields in messages during runtime you
define up to three business identifies
on payload fields during design time
you can then identify failed
transactions and drill down for audit or
root-cause analysis and also review
resubmit and abort errant transactions
you can easily monitor errors by
integration by connection or by the
details integration name instanceid
error location and error start time so
that's how easy it is to monitor your
integrations and integration cloud
service
