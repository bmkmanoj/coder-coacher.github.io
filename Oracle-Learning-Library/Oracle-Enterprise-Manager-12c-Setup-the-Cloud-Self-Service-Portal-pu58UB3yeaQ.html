manager cloud control demo series today
we are going to focus on cloud
management more specifically talk about
using cloud self-service portal we will
see functionality to allow cloud
self-service users to create new
platform deployment requests through the
portal manage requested deployments
track metering and chargeback
information author and enforce cloud
policies
so let's get started Enterprise Manager
Cloud Control provides a self-service
portal which can be used by business
users or cloud consumers to request
cloud resources here I'm logging in as
John Smith who is an application
developer and wants to request some
WebLogic environments on the left hand
side John Smith can see his Gotha he can
see that he can request up to 50 servers
out of which his requested for already
he can request up to hundred CPUs and he
has requested eight already the portal
also allows John Smith to look at some
of the notifications that the
administrator might have sent for
example here he says that some of the
new software assemblies are published
for the self-service user to consume
John Smith can also visualize all the
servers that he is requested so far and
he can also look at all the requests
he's made through the portal so far
let's go ahead and create a new request
for a platform deployment as you can see
self-service users can only provision in
a specific zone in the cloud that they
have access to this allows that miss
traitors to control who can deploy where
in the cloud these zones could be tied
to a certain cost center or to a certain
business unit thus enabling the
administrators to charge back the usage
of resources in the cloud to a specific
cost center let's go ahead and pick an
assembly or a cloud service that John
Smith wants to deploy here you can
browse the published assemblies from the
Enterprise Manager software library and
use that to deploy the platform I would
give some name for my deployment
instance of web shop dev instance which
would basically be a deployment form of
web shop assembly
as you can see here this webshop
assembly essentially contains four
different appliances it has a database
appliance and three WebLogic appliances
the WebLogic admin server web logic
cluster and a separate web logic managed
server assembly designers can decide to
create these appliances and these
assemblies as per the best practices
that they want to enforce here you can
see that the assembly designer has
chosen to allow the cluster tier to only
scale up to two nodes and a minimum of
one node let's go ahead and configure a
specific tier here you can see a web
logic admin server tier John Smith can
choose to request a certain kind of
machine for this year here I'm
requesting one gig machine with two CPUs
for the WebLogic admin server we can
define a custom size administrators can
choose to only allow predefined sizes
for the machines that users can request
like small medium or large machines the
user can also specify a BNC password
which with which they can log into the
machine once the request is complete
they can also choose to specify
additional network cards or additional
storage for the machines that they are
requesting one of the big value adds
that Oracle provides is product
configuration not only Enterprise
Manager provides automation for
provisioning virtual machines through
the portal but it also allows for
configuration of the software within the
virtual machine so here as part of the
platform as a service solution you can
see that their logic configuration
parameters that are available in the DAT
logic assembly are exposed here John
Smith can choose to override the values
of the parameters that are allowed to be
overridden by the assembly designer this
is a good mechanism for assembly
designers or administrators to
expose different kind of cloud services
to different kind of users for example
for less sophisticated users they can
choose to default all the best practice
configuration whereas for sophisticated
self-service users they can choose to
expose these values and allow the user
to override these values as per the
requirements for the deployment let's go
ahead and schedule this deployment
resources in the portal can be requested
for immediate use or for future time for
example a tester might request some
resources for a NIC for next week when
they want to start testing let's review
the request and submit this creates a
new request for a platform deployment
let's go ahead and see some of the
deployments that have already been made
users can see their specific assembly
deployment and the different tiers
within that Assembly deployment they can
also see the machines that constitute
that tier let's drill down into one of
the machines that the user has requested
Enterprise Manager self-service portal
allows the user to view and manage some
of the deployments that they've
requested they can see the monitoring
metrics for performance management of
their machines they can also see some
configuration for their machines they
can take certain actions such as
starting stopping the machines or
launching a VNC console to access the
machines this empowers the users and
makes them do take actions in a
self-service manner without going
through the administrator for every
small need we can now drill down into a
specific tier and see that the portal
allows certain actions at the tier level
for example you could choose to scale up
or manually scale down a tier if you
want more resources or more capacity for
your deployment the portal also allows
requests for storage so at a later time
if the user needs additional storage for
the deployments
they can choose to make additional
requests users can also track metering
and chargeback information they can see
how much they are consuming in terms of
IT resources in terms of physical
resources for CPU memory storage etc
they can see here how much they are
paying for what they're using based on
the charge plans that are defined by the
administrator earlier on during the
self-service setup users are charged as
per that plan here you can see that this
user John Smith is being charged $0.10
per CPU per hour and here you can see
the aggregate usage and the total charge
similarly they can filter their charge
by a certain performance metric or
certain resource so for CPU they can see
how much they're paying for it let's go
ahead and look at the library where the
users can store their own deployments a
my library area allows a user to either
upload their own assemblies and
templates or save their deployments for
future use they can also share their
deployments or their assemblies and
templates with other self-service users
users can also define certain cloud
policies the portal allows two kinds of
policies to be defined scheduled based
policies and performance based policies
scheduled based policies could be
actions that users want to perform on a
recurring basis for example they might
want to shut down their machines at
12:00 midnight and start them back up at
6 a.m. because they don't want to use or
pay for the machines at night when
they're not using them similar automated
schedule based rules can be defined
performance based policies could be
workload management policies which take
into account performance metrics let's
go ahead and define a performance based
policy
here is a scale a policy that's going to
act on a specific tier within an
assembly the policy can use any of the
metrics as condition so here we're going
to use the cpu metric and what this
policy says is if average cpu
utilization is greater than ninety
percent for five occurrences of the
metric collection let's say a collection
happens every five minutes then for
twenty five minutes if the CPU
utilization of a guest within a cluster
is more than 90 percent then we can
choose to take an action like scale up
the tier within the assembly so
automatic scale up and scale down allows
for a very elastic dynamic deployment
which can grow and shrink as per user's
requirement here we choose to scale up
by one node at a time we review the
policy and save the policy once the
policy is authored it can be then
associated with certain machines or
tiers within the assembly let's go ahead
and create a policy group a policy group
is a collection of two or more policies
so let's go ahead and create an auto
scaling policy group that basically
contains a scale down policy and a scale
up policy let's now go ahead and
associate this auto scaling policy group
to a specific tier
this basically allows users to automate
the workload management for their
resources within the cloud the portal
also allows users to set certain
preferences they can choose to set
certain passwords which they don't have
to enter again and again when the
request deployments they can also choose
to say that all their deployments can go
to a certain zone that they have access
to they can also specify an email
address if they want to receive
notifications they can receive
notification you know the first
notification few days in advance or a
second notification before their
resources are going to expire they can
also an enable notification based on a
quota threshold so if they are going to
reach 80% Kota they might want to be
notified through email
thus a self-service portal allows the
cloud consumer to request resources
manage those resources see the metering
and usage details of those resources and
also set certain cloud policies to
manage the workloads and the deployments
automatically
