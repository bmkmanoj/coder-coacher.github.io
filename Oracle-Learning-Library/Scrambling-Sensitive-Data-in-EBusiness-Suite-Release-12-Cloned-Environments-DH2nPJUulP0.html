oracle ebusiness we template for data
mass impact with Oracle Enterprise
Manager 11g we will demonstrate the ease
of use of scrambling data in an
e-business suite application database it
is suite masking template explained in
detail in the following Moscow will be
showing example of the masking process
along the examples of unmasked and mass
data you can see from the Moscow
relevant information SD children
downloading and setting up the template
in your environment since the primary
focus of the masking template was to
mask personally identifiable information
and associated sensitive data we're
going to start by showing some of the
one last data in the human resources
application let's lock him in in the
human resource of the application will
create up miss predict Daniels and show
from the screen that her personally
identified information such as their
social security number age address phone
numbers or own production values is also
important to note that a lot of
sensitive data in the eb suite is stored
in what are called slash fields these
are generic database fields that may
contain a wide variety of different
information depending on localization or
other factors the heba's suite mask also
covers sensitive present identifiable
information that are stored in these
fields by development or localization we
are now querying up the ID of Miss
Daniel so we can find her again after
the medicine process is complete let's
now return to the application and check
out some of the data within the trading
community or a textured application this
also contains names addresses phone
numbers and additionally personal
identifiable information which is used
throughout the system searching on City
for Redwood City we can see in the
address column
that there is sensitive information
stored let's log out of trading
community application we also know login
names for the system known as affinity
usernames are also going to be masked
for the most part however we do have a
mechanism which we will be showing into
trance that allows for exempt users that
can be used for testing the application
after masking here we can see an
individual and then we will search on
Jay Frost which will be one of the users
that we will mark as exempt in the
masking application example let's exit
the application can return the history
template comes in a zip file format
let's go ahead and unzip seeding into
the unzipped directory we can see that
the template contains two variants of
the template as well as self prep
scripts for the generation execution
customers will need to run a simple
select in order to determine which
variant of the template to use on in
database in this case we can see that
the JZ variant of the script is used
let's go ahead for best practice
recompile any invalid objects before the
masking process once that's complete we
will execute the required pre masking
steps in the database
once this is complete we will move over
to the importing of the data masking
template into Oracle Enterprise Manager
clicking on targets then clicking on the
data masking definition takes us to its
home page here we will import the
template selecting a database to
associate the template to and then
browsing for the template note the
variant from earlier or the jg variant
that we will use in this example click
on continue
this process will import the eb suite
massing template that's edit and have a
view we can see multiple columns that
will be noted to be masked additionally
all dependent columns have also been set
automatically clicking on the advanced
option we can see that the power
execution has turned off by default but
we do support that option required for
performance reasons it also may be handy
to turn off the drug temporary table
option until a clean masking run has
been achieved this option is turned on
for the final asking let's generate the
script generation will take a little
time note that these warnings upon
completion of generation script are
expected after the script has been
generated as we had defined earlier the
template allows customers to define
exempt logging users who will not be
masked looking at this sequel that we
will edit now it shows us as an example
of how to populate the affinity user
masking exemptions table with users in
this case we'll use the examples in the
script since they match a demo database
in production settings you will provide
your own user you wish to test with note
that J frost is in the exemptions table
our next step is to ensure that the
required privilege is granted to the
user that will execute the masking
process
let's go and grant that privilege
we will now schedule the job to run this
we'll start the masking process at this
stage we have started the masking of our
EB suite database we will now proceed
with viewing the post masking
environment after successful completion
of masking process after successful
completion let's ensure to recompile all
the invalid objects and make sure that
there are no additional invalid objects
after accomplish
you remember that we previously to turn
there miss Britt at dining loss person
ID number 12
now let's go search for that person
login to our application since her
information is masked let's go ahead and
search based on her employee number here
we can see her information has been
masked in the human resources you can
see social security number addresses
birthday and all the relevant
information has been changed such as
phone numbers
additionally note that her password
detail has been removed
hence the information of miss peretta
has been sanitized
let's also down lock out of our
application and log back into the
training community architecture
application as we had identified
sensitive information in that
application allowing the customers
clicking on persons and performing
search on AB City based on Redwood City
here we can see that the address column
note that the information has been
masked
let's now also log out and then log back
in and let's look at the system users
insertion of the offender users names
that we must here you can see a %
username as we mast and then searching
for example of Jay frost that was a
empties ur note that his information has
remained exempt from masking this
completes the screen watching using
oracle ebusiness we template for data
masking with Oracle Enterprise Manager
