customers personally identifiable
information at be pretty yeah PII credit
card numbers with Social Security
numbers all encrypted everywhere I had
until the end of the month three weeks
to get all our applications change hey I
need this encryption done in three weeks
I figured I'd start with the
applications we development so I got in
touch with the development team and I
asked him how long they thought it would
take to get all the PII encryption done
you know I didn't get a firm date but I
think it was more than three weeks we
dbas could solve this problem but didn't
even ask hi-yah so I have a huge
encryption job I thought I'd try one of
our application vendors next we have a
really great support contractor hmm oh
this came for you over the facts okay
thanks Ari we're gonna need eight
million dollars hey did you see him
what's they were gonna charge hey Brent
hey we're gonna chase him he didn't have
to touch all those applications we can
do it all in the database with Oracle
advanced security he didn't even have to
find the columns to encrypt the whole
table space gets encrypted it's called
transparent data encryption because it's
transparent to the application quite
frankly it's pretty transparent to us
TVA's to takes just a couple of mouse
clicks to do it but he doesn't need to
know that PCI HIPAA breached disclosure
laws bring him on I'm ready nice job man
high five I'm gonna happen
alright
