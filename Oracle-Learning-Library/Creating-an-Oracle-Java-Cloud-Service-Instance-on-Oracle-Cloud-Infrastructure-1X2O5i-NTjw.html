Oracle cloud infrastructure resources
and created an Oracle database cloud
service deployment I can provision an
Oracle Java cloud service instance as
with my database instance before
provisioning the Java cloud service
instance I'll need to have the following
information available the availability
domain the subnet name which must be in
the same virtual cloud network as the
subnet that I selected earlier for the
database cloud service the object
storage bucket name the swift password
and the region I created with my Oracle
cloud infrastructure resources using my
service credentials I'll log into the my
services dashboard from the Action menu
for my Java cloud service account I'll
select open service console and on the
service console click create service and
from the drop-down control select Java
first on the basic service information
page I'll keep my Java cloud service a
name and select the region from the
drop-down list this should be the same
region that I created the Oracle cloud
infrastructure resources and database
cloud service deployment in as with a
database service instance selecting the
region spawns the availability domain
and the subnet fields I'll select values
for these fields based on the
information I recorded while creating
the infrastructure resources since I
want to use the default values for the
rest of the subscription details I'll
click Next and move on to the wizard
service details page here I'll under
critical information about my service
first I'll select compute shape that
will meet my load and processing
requirements note that I can only select
an Oracle cloud infrastructure compute
shape next on cert an ssh public key
which provides authentication when
connecting to a node in my instance
through a secure shell client i'll click
edit to open the public access key for
vm dialog box and here select choose
file to open my file system I'll select
the public key and then click enter and
the public key has been inserted now
I'll select enable access to
administration consoles so that I can
access consoles such as WebLogic server
or Fusion Middleware
from within the service instance
next I'll create and confirm an
administration password which I can use
when I need to access these
administration consoles now I'll select
the database instance I created in the
earlier exercise and enter the
appropriate username and password for
the backup destination I'll first select
both remote and disk storage which will
spawn these three new data fields cloud
storage container username and password
from a cloud storage container I'll
enter the URL for the object storage
bucket I created as one of my
infrastructure resources this can be a
rather long entry since I need to enter
the full URL in this fixed format the
variables in that format our region
tenant and bucket this is why I made
sure to copy the name after I created
the bucket now I'll enter the user name
and swift password I generated earlier
then accept the remaining defaults and
click Next I'll arif I the details of my
service paying particular attention to
the compute shape region availability
domain subnet and the storage
configuration those all look fine so
I'll click create in a moment my new
service will appear on the Java cloud
service console I can track provisioning
progress here in the service create and
delete history panel simply by clicking
details and I can see that my service
instance has been successfully
provisioned next I want to connect over
a secure shell to the Java cloud service
node on Oracle cloud infrastructure I'll
go to the service details page for my
new Java cloud service instance and copy
the public IP address then I'll open a
command shell and using the public IP
address make the connection
now that I'm connected I'll check the
hostname of the node to verify that it
matches the name of the vcn I set up in
the first exercise I can see that it
does I have now successfully provisioned
a Java cloud service instance an Oracle
cloud infrastructure and connected to it
over secure shell I'm ready to start
deploying and managing applications in
the cloud
thank you for watching creating a Java
cloud service instance on Oracle cloud
infrastructure for more information
