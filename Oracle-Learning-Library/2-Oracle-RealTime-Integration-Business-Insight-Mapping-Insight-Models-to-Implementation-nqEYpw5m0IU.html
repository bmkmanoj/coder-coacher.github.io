defined a series of milestones for the
insight business model of her company's
helpdesk integration flow milestones are
points in a business process that
represent important business progress
and mapped to at least one point in the
application implementation Nina also
identified indicators for each milestone
indicators are key pieces of business
data that are extracted as insight
observes the execution of application
instances indicators allow business
users to gain insight into the business
as a business user Nina focused on the
business model and not the underlying
implementation which includes an Oracle
service bus project an Oracle Scylla
suite composites now Carl the
integration architect will use his
knowledge of the integration application
to map the milestones to the related
points in the implementation the first
milestone will be mapped within a
service bus project Carl selects the
data connection to the service bus
server in which the application has been
deployed information about the
pipeline's and business services
deployed on that server is loaded and
displayed for Carl to browse after
selecting the correct pipeline an icon
to map the milestone of this pipeline is
displayed Carl selects the operation for
the pipeline from the dialog he's given
a choice between request and response
select and request means the milestone
will be considered passed when the
pipeline is invoked selecting response
means the milestone is considered passed
when the pipeline is complete for
pipelines without a response the
response option won't be available for
selection the mapping path is displayed
on the top of the page and next to the
pipeline some of the milestones will be
mapped to so a suite composites
composites are organized into services
references and components in addition to
mapping within a Scylla composite for
example to the request or response of an
adapter Carl can also drill into a BPL
process component and map a milestone to
a be pal activity the mapping can be
defined at the beginning of the activity
the end of the activity or in case of a
fault during execution of the activity
when Carl completes the mapping of
milestones the next
task is to define the extraction
criteria for each indicator using a
graphical expression builder the
expression builder creates XPath
functions to define how values are
extracted for message payloads are both
simple and xml types carl selects the
indicator and accesses the expression
builder which shows all the variables
that are available at the point where
the milestone has been mapped he inserts
the desired variable into the expression
and returns to the editor Carlin defines
the extraction criteria for the
remaining indicators completing the
definition of the insight model after
the model is saved it's ready to
activate when the model is activated
insight will begin to collect metrics on
running instances immediately within a
few moments the business user can begin
to evaluate the state of the business
using the provided out-of-the-box
dashboards you can explore the dashboard
features of insight in the next video in
this series thank you for watching
