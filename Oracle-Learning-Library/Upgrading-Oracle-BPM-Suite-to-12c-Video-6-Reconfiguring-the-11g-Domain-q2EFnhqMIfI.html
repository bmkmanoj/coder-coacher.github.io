is the sixth in a series of eight videos
about upgrading Oracle BPM suite to
version 12c at this point we're well
into the upgrade process we've created
new database schemas and upgraded our
database schemas and instance data in
the background closed instances are
being migrated as well in this video
we'll run the reconfiguration wizard to
reconfigure our 11g domain the wizard
will apply reconfiguration templates to
the domain it will also update schemas
scripts and other files that support
fusion middleware products we've said
this before but it's a good time to
remind you that if you are using oracle
business activity monitoring or bam you
cannot upgrade bam 11g to bam 12c using
the standard upgrade procedures refer to
the document on screen for more details
the topology we're using for our
walkthrough does not include Oracle BAM
so we'll proceed as planned recall that
for our demonstration we have two hosts
and both hosts have domain files we're
going to run the reconfiguration wizard
on the host with the admin server
reconfiguring the domain on that host
then after one more domain update will
copy the upgraded domain to the other
host will see that in the next video in
the series the reconfiguration wizard is
found in the Oracle common common bin
folder under the new fusion middleware
12c Oracle home we've added two
parameters to specify a log file at the
maximum logging priority to capture the
highest level of detail in the log
the first window prompts us to enter or
browse for the location of the existing
11g domain this is the domain that we
want to reconfigure and it will be
reconfigured in place meaning the 11g
domain will be modified and no 12c
domain directories will be created the
reconfiguration setup progress window
displays the progress as reconfiguration
templates are applied this prepares the
domain for reconfiguration when the
process completes click Next the domain
mode and JDK window displays the domain
mode set for the current domain it
cannot be changed here the JDK displayed
is the one that was used to start the
wizard if you want to change it for
example if the one you used previously
is not supported you can browse and
select a new one in our case the JDK is
supported so we just click Next if you
created any custom data sources namely
data sources that were created using the
weblogic server console rather than by
the configuration wizard when 11g was
installed then this window appears in
our case there's just one the opie ssds
data source we could use this window to
supplied connection details for this
data source but we'll have a better
opportunity to do so later on so we
ignore this for now and click next here
too we can advance to the next window
recall that one of the 12c schemas we
created in the video titled creating
database schemas for 12c was the service
table or stb schema on this window we
specified connection details to that
schema the ring configuration wizard
will use the service table to load other
12c schema credentials automatically
credentials for existing 11g data
sources will be preserved we complete
the service
host name and password verify that the
schema owner is correct and click get
our CU configuration to test the
connection if the test is successful we
can advance to the next window otherwise
we would need to fix the connection
credentials this window lists all of the
JDBC data sources and their connection
details we can modify the connection
information for any data source here we
must specify connection information for
any custom data sources that were
created using the weblogic server
console rather than by the configuration
wizard in our case there is just one
that needs to be configured we specify
connection details by selecting the data
source and filling in the details in the
top section then we deselect the data
source and click Next
here we can test all of the data source
connections at once by selecting the
checkbox at the upper left and clicking
test selected connections
we have all green checkmarks that's good
news so will advance to the next window
if the domain you are configuring is
using a / host node manager as ours is
then this window appears allowing you to
select the node manager configuration to
use for the reconfigured domain for node
manager type we're going to accept the
default domain location which is
displayed here note that it will be
under the original domain structure in
the node manager configuration section
we're going to migrate the existing /
host node manager configuration to a per
domain configuration so we need to
specify where the node manager is
currently located which in our case is
under the 11g weblogic server directory
so prior to the upgrade we've been
starting the node manager from this
location after the upgrade will be
starting it from this location remember
that the domain upgrade is in place so
no domain directories will be created
under 12c last but not least we need to
specify the new node manager credentials
the ones we'll use to start node manager
in the reconfigured domain for more
details see the reconfiguration wizard
screens section of the Oracle Fusion
Middleware upgrading Oracle WebLogic
server document if you want to modify
any advanced configuration settings you
can select them here and you'll see
additional windows according to which
ones you select for example select this
option to add managed servers clusters
or machines to the domain or modify them
or delete them select deployments and
services to customize how application
deployments and services are targeted to
servers and clusters our topology does
not require advanced configuration so
we'll just click Next
on this window we get a summary of the
planned reconfiguration we check
everything one more time and then click
reconfig now we can sit back and relax
while the reconfiguration wizardry
configures the domain when it is done we
click Next and that's it we have
successfully reconfigured the domain on
one of our two hosts the host with admin
server running on it remember that we
demonstrated just one path through the
reconfiguration wizard one that was
appropriate for our environment for more
details see both the upgrading so sweet
and business process management document
and the reconfiguration screens section
of the Oracle Fusion Middleware
upgrading oracle weblogic server
document here again are the steps in the
core upgrade process in this video we
focused on reconfiguring the 11g domain
the next step is to run the upgrade
assistant again to upgrade a few
remaining domain configurations then
we'll copy the upgraded domain to the
other host both of these tasks are
covered in the next video upgrading
domain configurations I'm Rosie pillar
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
