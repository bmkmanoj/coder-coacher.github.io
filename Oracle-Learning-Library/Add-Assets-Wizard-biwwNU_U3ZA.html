assets wizard an Oracle Enterprise
Manager opscenter so let's get started
opscenter can manage and monitor a
variety of data center assets such as
server hardware network equipment
operating systems virtualization
software and clustering software ops
center offers three ways to discover
assets using the add assets wizard
adding a configured assets such as a
servers service processor or operating
system declaring a server to be a target
of always provisioning and declaring a
nun configured Hardware acid let's
review some examples on using the add
assets wizard to discover servers and
operating systems the first type of
asset declaration is add and manage
various types of assets via discovery
probes you can use this option to add an
asset that has already been configured
let's go through an example of adding an
operating system and its server using a
discovery profile in a set of
credentials we start by creating a
discovery profile specific for the asset
we are adding by clicking the new
profile icon on top of the table of
discovery profiles to discover a profile
wizard appears on discovery profile
wizard we add a name and choose the
asset type from the three in this case
we're discovering an Oracle Solaris
system so we select the solaris linux OS
option let's click Next to see the
screen for setting up tags
attack is a set of information attached
to an asset each stack consists of a
name and a value tag names are specific
for each type of asset we are not using
tax for this example we now click next
to see the IP ranges table we can add an
IP range here by clicking the plus icon
on top of the table or reuse existing IP
ranges that have been created for other
discovery profiles we are skipping this
step as we are adding a single IP
address and the final step of the ad
assets wizard let's click Next to set up
the discovery credentials we need to
specify the SSH credentials here we can
either create a new set of credentials
or select an existing set using the
available buttons let's reuse an
existing set of credentials in the
management section of this screen we can
specify if we want to deploy an Asian
controller on the operating system this
is recommended to enable full management
of the discovered server we now click
Next to read the summary after we read
the summary we can click finish we are
back to the add assets wizard and we can
verify that the profile we've just
created is selected we can now type the
IP address of our asset in the host
names / IP addresses field if you scroll
down you can edit the credentials in
agent controller setup finally let's
click the add now button to start the
job
after a few minutes the job completes in
the server and os are added to the
assets three on the left navigation pane
the second type of asset declaration is
manually declare a server to be a target
of OS provisioning you can use this
option to declare a server on which you
later want to provision an operating
system let's explore the fields on this
single screen option on the manually
declare assets to oracle off-center
wizard we can declare very servers using
a discovery file or declare a single
server we are going to declare a single
server for this example we specify the
server name as we want to see it in the
assets three the IP address of the
server and select the appropriate modal
category and model for the server on the
ports and mac addresses table we click
the plus icon to add a logical port the
available logical port names RGB
underscore 0 through GV underscore 11 if
the server has only one network
interface we can use gb underscore 0
let's click Add port / back button to
get back to the wizard we are ready to
continue we now click the clear asset to
start the job after a few minutes the
job completes in the server is added to
the acid stream
the third type of asset declaration is
declare an unconsidered Hardware acid
you can use this option to declare one
or more bare metal systems in
preparation for service processor
configuration for this example we are
adding the following information one for
the number of servers to declare we
select the model category in model and
we add a name prefix that is used for
all the server we declare along with a
starting number in a suffix besides this
basic information we also need to add
the network on which the server is added
the IP address of the server and the mac
address of the server once this is ready
we click declare asset to start the job
this concludes our overview for more
information consult the OP centers
library go to docs oracle com look for
enterprise management and select the
