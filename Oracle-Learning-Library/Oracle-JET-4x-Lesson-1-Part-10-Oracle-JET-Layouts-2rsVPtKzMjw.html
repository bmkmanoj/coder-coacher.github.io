first of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle jet Oracle Jets includes a
collection of components patterns and
enhanced HTML tags that you can use to
control the visual layout of your jet
applications in this part you will be
introduced to the Oracle outer UI design
system and to the support for flex
layout which is part of css3 in the
second of the weekly lessons about jets
we will spend more time on this topic
and you will learn how to use each of
the related parts in more detail the
arico out the UI design system is a set
of CSS classes that are used to develop
the most recent Oracle cloud products
including a number of innovative mobile
applications with many more to come
in particular our core outer UI focuses
on helping you to create user interfaces
that are conducive to responsive design
techniques Oracle out to UI is a default
theme of Oracle jet for example the
Oracle jet templates are laid out using
oracle outer UI also as you saw in the
previous parts of this course the Oracle
out to UI CSS stylesheets are included
to make you style your applications
quickly and easily the flexbox layout is
a standard part of css3 it aims to
provide an efficient way to layout align
and distribute space among items in a
container even when their size is
unknown and all dynamic the main idea
behind the Flex layout is to give the
container the ability to alter the width
height and order of its items to best
fill the available space in turn this
helps to accommodate your application to
all kinds of display devices and screen
sizes a Flex container expands items to
fill a variable free space or shrinks
them to prevent overflow via Oracle jet
CSS classes the flexbox layout has been
integrated into Oracle jet and can
easily be used as you work on your jet
applications having discussed flexbox
let's now see how easy it is to use in
our Oracle jet applications here we are
back in our application as before we
have items in the navigation list for
loading each of our modules in this case
we're going to look at
customers module and play a bit with oj
flex and oj flex item here wrecking our
development environment we're in our
customers HTML file and we have a div
and we use the CSS class here AJ flex
this is a flex container within the div
with the class set RJ flex we create
another div where we use LJ flex item
and we add a few more now we have a flex
container containing three flex items
like in the browser we see nothing let's
go back and we will add here a panel J
panel and we will do the same for the
other ones and go back into the browser
now we see three panels horizontally
next to each other but they're very
close probably not what we want and
there is another class to help us here
called LJ margin and let's use a gem
engine here and also here
no back in the browser we see this a
small space between each of them what
you can also do to distinguish between
them is to use toge a panel and then l1
l2 l3 l4 l5 each of which defines a
different background color for example
we put out one here and let's put l2
there and I panel out five there for
example and look again in the brown
now we see three different background
colors something else that we can do
here is organize flex items within other
flex items this is possible if a flex
item in addition to being a flex item is
also a flex container here we have our
flex item our first flex item and in
here what we're going to do is we're
going to set this flex item to be a flex
to and then within that flex container
began to add a few other flex items and
to distinguish between them we're going
to use different out backgrounds here we
save this you look in the browser and
now we see that we have two flex items
within our first flex item which is also
now a Flex container the point of the
exercise is that we want to have a
layout that looks equally good when the
resolution changes so we'll make the
resolution of the browser smaller and we
see that the content still looks good
everything is evenly spaced out when you
make it larger again everything refits
itself automatically this is called
responsive design now imagine that we
would like to have these two items not
next to each other but vertically
organized the one above the other for
that jet provides a class called oj SM
flex Direction column we save this go
back into the browser and we notice that
now the two are organized in a column
when we change resolution again notice
everything again fits perfectly what is
this SM about SM stands for small and
what you are saying here is that from
the small resolution onwards the
direction of the two items within this
Flex container will be in a column we
can also say here SM only and so here we
are saying that the items within
Tanner will be in a column only if the
resolution is small back in the browser
we see the two next to each other and
now we change the resolution to small
and under these circumstances we see
that the two items are organized in this
way in this part you have been
introduced to two of the most important
jet features that help you control the
visual layout of your jet applications
for your homework exercise play around
with different layout options try
nesting RJ flex and RJ flex item classes
to see how different combinations behave
finally with the knowledge you have now
gained through the first week you should
have enough information to create jet
applications yourself starting from next
week we will examine the full range of
jet components and you will learn how to
get the most out of them when putting
your own jet applications together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
