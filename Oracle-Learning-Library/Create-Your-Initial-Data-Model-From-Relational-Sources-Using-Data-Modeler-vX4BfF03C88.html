adding fact and dimension tables and
then joining the two tables that were
originally loaded from a relational
source now you can with data modeler
I'll start by creating the model models
are made up of dimension and fact tables
and joints dimension tables describe the
data attributes such as customer name or
customer marital status fats tables
contain measures such as revenue or
build units and joins show me the
relationships between fact and dimension
tables in the data models the easiest
way for me to create a fact table is to
drag and drop the source table
containing the measures on to the fact
table area I add a revenue fact table
and then I add a dimension table that
holds customer data the customers
dimension table is now part of the model
to create reports I must join the
dimension table to a fact table next I
edit the fact table and copy the
customer column the new key column does
not have an aggregation method I rename
the copied column and join the two
tables using the new column cust key and
the key in the customers table I
validate the joint I continue by making
some modifications I change the column
names to be more user-friendly and I
rename the table to next I add a new
derived attribute to describe customer
segments that's created from an
expression I can use the concatenation
operator or pipe symbol to create a new
column based on the values of the two
other columns this new derived attribute
concat needs two arguments to form a new
expression I remember to validate the
expression to make sure it works as
expected and then make the cust type
column unavailable I keep making
adjustments by copying a column to
create a new column that contains the
email addresses of customers I can
include additional tables to suit my
business needs next I make the fact
table more user-friendly by changing the
table name and column names
and adding aggregation rules for the
measure columns an aggregation rule
defines how the measure is treated in
reports for example I might want the sum
revenue or fixed cost but average the
number of orders rather than counting
them I continue by excluding some of the
columns by marking them as unavailable
these columns are hidden in the fact
table when viewed in reports I review
the table
it looks like 8 measures are defined for
revenue metrics I validate the data
model and publish it to make the tables
available for use in reports finally I
create a data visualization that uses
the new data model I pick the data model
as a data source and use the control key
to select the data elements I want to
use and then drag them to the canvas in
this video I showed you how to create a
fact and dimension table and then join
the two tables I also showed you how to
add aggregation rules to the metrics and
then add concatenate and hide columns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
