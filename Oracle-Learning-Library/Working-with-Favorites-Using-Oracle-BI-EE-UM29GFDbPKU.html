I'm a sales manager and I have several
analyses that I work with on a daily
basis most of these analyses are saved
in the company shared folder so that
members of my team can view and update
analyses per my request I want to be
able to find the top 10 products
analysis faster so i have decided to
work with the favorites feature this
feature enables me to save objects such
as analyses or dashboard pages to a list
that i can access quickly i know that i
can add and remove objects by using
favorites on the catalog page I click
catalog the catalog page is displayed in
the catalog page I search for an
analysis that I use regularly this
analysis is named top 10 products I
click the search button I enter top 10
in the search field I select company
shared in the location list and then
accept the default for type I click
search top 10 products is displayed in
the catalog area I want to add this
analysis to my favorites I click the
more link to see the favorites option
and then I select add to favorites
I see that a gold star is added beside
the entry for the analysis to indicate
that it's now one of my favorites I
click the more link once again and
notice that I can also remove this
analysis from favorites by selecting the
remove from favorites option I click the
favorites link in the global header and
see that top 10 products is now in the
favorites menu I want to add one of the
sales performance dashboard pages to my
favorites I think I want to add the
revenue page but I'm not sure so I'm
going to run the dashboard first I click
dashboards in the global header and
select sales performance the sales
performance dashboard revenue page is
displayed this is the page that i want
so i click favorites in the global
header and then i select add to
favorites now i want to edit the top 10
products analysis I click favorites in
the global header and select top 10

to see it in my favorites list I click
favorites in the global header and then
I select remove from favorites

favorites menu using favorites enables
me to work more efficiently by helping
me to quickly find and edit objects that
