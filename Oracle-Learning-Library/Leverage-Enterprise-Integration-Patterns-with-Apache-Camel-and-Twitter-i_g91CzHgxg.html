manager for Latin America
I cover WebLogic GlassFish and Java EE
if you know Aruna Gupta I'm a good
friend of him so I mostly I basically do
what he does around the world I'll be
doing in Latin America just for you to
get to know me better
I'm a Java developer since 2000 I speak
at conferences for a while I've been
doing that for a few years I used to
evangelize patchy camo and another
framework Apache wicked in Brazil a lot
I'm going to actually give a talk
tomorrow about wicked I join your Oracle
recently to do exactly what a product
manager does an evangelist for Java and
know well by leaving some problem and
have a Golden Retriever marriage I like
to do video games and hike
when I'm not playing video games so we
are here to talk about enterprise
patterns enterprise integration patterns
how many of you are aware of what
integration patterns are okay good
that's good and how many of you have
heard about that she came up before
awesome
how mean of you player can do is color
coding ok not so awesome but I'm sure
everybody knows Twitter and which is
cool about their what is cool about this
talk is that I actually use Twitter as
the data source for introducing you
wicked I'm sorry
kamo and it's common so well most of you
know about this how many of you have
this book if you okay if you are into
you enterprise integration patterns you
have to have this book alright it's like
the Bible everybody have it and this is
a quote from Rainey Stafford a guy from
Oracle it's on that book if you are
involved with the operation
of enterprise applications that will
doubtless come a time when you need to
integrate your application so it's like
it's impossible to imagine a world where
we have independent applications living
alone not integrating with something
else so there will be a time maybe
sooner maybe later but you will have to
integrate that application with
something else then you're gonna have to
learn enterprise integration patterns so
why do we need well I just said that why
is it so hard because it deals with
asynchronous messages that that's kind
of complicated you have to be aware of
all that data coming from somewhere
going to somewhere you have to control
the stayed in so on it's very hard where
and when well I think the other
questions are very connected and in my
opinion it's like cloud computing
depends on it you cannot do cloud
computing without actually thinking
about synchronous messages and we when
you think about a synchronous messages
you're gonna have to think about
enterprise integration patterns so then
comes up a patch chicano framework that
has been that has been the being
developed I'm about English Kimmo is
from Apache foundation and it's like ten
years I think maybe more than that that
people are coding that framework so it's
an implementation for those patterns
with they came with the kamo framework
you can design the routes to manipulate
those messages moving around you can use
out-of-the-box components that comes
with channel you can develop your own
components like I did with kamo Twitter
of course a synchronous and synchronous
messages you can do that too and most
important connect distinct and
independent systems which is basically a
receive transform and deliver data so
the architecture behind Carol is
basically these kind of
of thanks there was a talk yesterday
about kennel and I think it was Kai his
his name and he gave a very good
introduction so if you missed that I'm
gonna just give you some points so
components components are about the
system that you are going to connect to
so let's say an FTP component that that
component hasn't acknowledged to connect
to a server and extract data or upload
data you have any points which is what a
component creates for you an endpoint is
the actual connection for some ftp ftp
server you have routes this endpoint
connected to these endpoint this is a
route and we have a changes in messages
what the endpoint sends to the other
endpoint it's an exchange and on that
exchange you have messages it can be an
int message and out message an in/out
message all there is about an enterprise
integration patterns actually and you
have consumers producers the consumer
basically is the part of the endpoint
that connects to the actual data that
system and gets data from and producers
are those parts of the endpoint that
uploads the data to that external
service system and processors processors
they are where all the magic happens
what you do with data so if you
transform the data if you enrich the
data if you split the data and so on so
this is a very quick overview let's say
we have two queues we want you we are
getting key messages on QA and we have
to put some of those messages on QB how
we do that we think about one pattern
here we have the message filter part
pattern so the QA is getting a lot of
widget quotes and gadget codes we want
to put on QB only the widget codes so we
apply the message filter
so thinking about the logic here is just
that from QA we're gonna filter that in
send to QB which in camel it translates
basically to these kind of Java DSL so
it's kind of it's very straightforward
it's very simple the java
domain-specific language and the spring
xml domain-specific language for camel
they are very tight they're very
connected to the enterprise dietary
patterns here so we can actually think
about the pattern when we see the code
these are more complex complex route
actually it's not that complex I've seen
worse than these but it's a route that
will connect to a file for actually a
folder and we try to see new files
coming into the inbox
it's a pulling and point component
endpoint and for every file that comes
here it will create an exchange put that
file our reference for that file on the
exchange and then you can process with
the processor for instance the XPath
processor here so it will get the XML
data and with XPath we can filter
basically based on that data and then we
will dynamically route to some other
endpoint so for instance we have widgets
coming from the file going to the
endpoint widget and gadget to the gadget
endpoint just like the the pattern says
for now it's color it's a one thing that
I really like about Scala is that you
could even last then in Java way less
than in XML so as so you get to know a
little bit about Scala in the details
about domain-specific language from
cameo for scholar you can do in two
lines a message filter you can not not
not really two lines
so the line was broken this one is a
router so it gets very very simple it's
it's not doesn't it that doesn't look
beautiful at the beginning but then you
get used to it
all right so what else about Kano so
like I said we have DSL for Java spring
XML and column KML provides a standard
URI for endpoints so we will always see
endpoints like this direct double dots
and some name or more more specific file
which caused the file component and then
some path so the first part of the URL
is the schema which connects to the
component that is able to deal with that
your I so we have also we have lots of
components like the patch kamo provides
you lots of components you can just do
whatever you want you can even let's say
connect to a wrestler and sends data to
RMI ERC IRC hibernate JPA you have a
s400 i don't know what that is
sorry we have a mail welled up and so on
so those are just a few of the
components that i could list for you
here but it actually has more than I
don't know 50 components and I'm just
saying about the components that are
provided by the upper actually came out
team from the Apache Software Foundation
you know so of course there are more
components Chi was showing the source
Salesforce component that he is working
on so you can actually do your own
component connects to some cloud service
in your every want one cool thing about
the last version of camel is that
integrates with CDI until the last
version you would need a web application
to
start your Kindle context to give to
give like a pap to really start
processing the messages now with CDI you
don't leave it you don't even need a web
module you just need a a GB three single
tall without a startup so then you start
the context and there you go about
social media social data we have Twitter
on this talk so social media the rise of
social media as a communications
channels this is an article from public
published by Oracle
it's called 2001 customer experience
index report the era of impatience we
are we are very patients now on internet
so let's say almost 30 percent of
consumers post negative comments on
internet almost 50 percent has posted
negative comment following bad customer
experience so social media in social
data it's very important for customers
for for business we have to get that
data and do something about it right
because if you if you if you if you look
at the end of 30% of that get responses
51 had positive reaction after so if
your business gives a response to that
negative comment the comes the consumer
will have 51% of giving a positive
feedback on that one in 13% deleted
their negative post which is well
doesn't work on the Internet
when you personally it leaves forever
but up at least they do something about
it so Twitter for instance we have
almost 4,000 tweets per second at the
beginning was like 2,000 per day now we
have 4,000 per second
we have peaks for almost 20 K tweets per
second on FIFA World Cup or something
big like that one tweet this is
interesting point we'd have 140
characters we all know that but the
message actually gets 540 bytes because
of the encoding and we don't we are not
even thinking about the road they
that goes to the database so we storing
all that data requires a lot of storage
right so we have to deal with that on
when we think about social media and
social data how to process that and we
are not even talking about Facebook or
Google+ here these are very interesting
code it's not information overload its
future failure right there is a lot of
information on social media we have to
know how to get it and what get it
because if you get a lot of data and we
don't we don't know what we are wearing
processing that much data it's going to
be even worse so I was wondering if I
could use enterprise integration
patterns to actually get their data and
do something about it so I was thinking
I can read status updates on Twitter
I can't filter based on keywords I can
identify the issue that the user is
having with the customer then I can
route to someone that can give him a
response based on that experience
replies possible in store for future
conversations and then we can customize
as needed so thinking about that I came
up with a cameo feeder component few
years ago 2009 I bought about this which
is actually the title of the session on
2009 trying to wondering if we could use
those patterns to process that that that
data so I submitted to Apache the ticket
KML 1520 I was at the Apache count 2009
I talked to the commuters about this
idea and there was a challenge because
the commuter said you know what why just
Peter why not every social media but you
know I thought yeah sure
so I came up with came up social they go
all simple a component that could be
able to
get data from any social network the the
URL was beautiful like social the social
provider and parameters that would be
like beautiful but I mean this this is
the examples that I I was wondering
about let's say I wanted to eat
something so I'm gonna send some some
information coming from that endpoint
that goes to social Twitter provider and
status that's that that there was that
was the original idea or something to
Facebook or searching events on Facebook
so oh by the way this is very Scala DSL
so this was the original idea but it
failed it failed because it's not easy
to standardize the social data that
comes from different social networks
it's not easy
the spring social team they are working
working really hard on that and from my
understanding it's not
they have different ApS for each social
network well if you do that that's okay
so then I would have to come up with
each component from camel for each
social network that would work but doing
one one abstract API for every social
data that's impossible right so it could
bring the component back to life if
someone of you are interested about this
project I I welcome you to get a code
and try to finish but uh this guy he he
was thinking like me it's not easy to do
an abstract API for every social network
so he called me send me an email and uh
he asked me to upload the code to github
so we could work together and the
original code is on my github and also
another guy and this is Brad Meyer he
just joined the hibernate team from red
head Ryan
Eugene Brian he had an support for this
Twitter streaming API which I'm going to
present you on the demonstration so I
owe a lot for these guys and uh none of
them could come to Java one but uh I'm
really appreciative preciate they help
they gave me so final version 2010 to
like 2.10 that's the version that
provides came on Twitter you can with
that version that component you can
tweet updates you can search you can
connect to the streaming API you can
read direct messages you can read this
is interesting you can read retweets
mentions or the home time line of sight
of some user of course all they're
provided by the Twitter 4j API library
it got an Apache Apache License recently
so that's why also enable the component
to be available from the Apache Software
Foundation so if you if you remember if
you remember the the social component
it's quite the same but of course behind
of that is that there's an API very tied
to Twitter for J and Twitter itself but
the idea is the same so here we want to
send a tweet from JMS we just put this
line on a route using Scala and then
every string that comes from that JMS
queue will go to the Twitter status
update if I want to read tweets I can
pull every five seconds and log the
tweets that's I think it's there's
anyone of you have worked for with
Twitter for Jay before nope
it's not that easy to to get tweets from
Twitter for Jay it's at least five lines
of code but with the components really
easy here I want to do dynamic search on
Twitter this is a feature that I
provided recently before a few weeks
before the release the 2.10 version to
provide dynamic keywords
this is this is wrong from that endpoint
if it comes with a header that has the
denim keyword that I'm going to search
so then I can do whatever I want I don't
have to change the endpoint every time I
want and you a different keyword so I
think I'm okay
I think they have time so I'm gonna do
the Twitter demo for you I don't know if
you if interview was getting my tweets
on Twitter I actually put the demo
online it's beat dot Li Java one live so
this is the the the the application
running on Amazon ec2 it has a html5
front-line connection with WebSockets to
Apache cable and Apache what apache came
of does for every tweet that comes from
from the that search Java one Oh W it
sends a message a JSON for every user
connected on the WebSocket server so
it's very very very simple code it's it
was it was originally coded by off
vision he came he came up with this
during the Olympics so what he did was
uh a page like this one word searching
Olympics that's all so when we click we
can see the bigger image alright so let
me show you the demonstration so what
I'm going to do here is run the same
code that I'm running on Java one live I
hope it works I use Alec use maven a lot
no it's wrong let me start the other one
the other sample here oops not this one
you know when you work with Twitter and
you want to make a demonstration you
have to be careful which keywords you're
gonna choose for the demo because people
are nuts on Twitter they post weird
stuff I mean really I mean is there how
many women are there I'm sorry for
asking this one two three four five six
seven all right I mean if I just put
like pick from pictures I get so many
pictures being posted on Twitter like 40
pictures per second but for everything
pictures - were just not rated I mean
it's crazy people are crazier I mean I
think Twitter is the most porn server on
the internet really I lost myself here
all right let me change the keyword TBC
on cameo searching for Batman can anyone
give you some term that I could search
for yeah people are not tweeting
pictures on JavaOne I mean people are
just tweeting not picturing right let's
see let's see what's trending on Twitter
now let's see if we can get pictures
from trends okay so oh yeah I'm the
driver one party's alright it's trendy
national boyfriend day alright let's see
how that goes
I mean it's risky it's risky yeah yeah
let's see beer I don't know people yeah
let's see Kampai oh oh I'm gonna take
the rest egg off just beer
there's also porn beer categories you
know some white comes up with that
someday right mm-hmm
there you go we are connected online and
streaming through WebSocket oh this is
the disclaimer but it's in Portuguese
all right thanks yeah okay it sounds
good
no no no that's good all right damn not
beer
all right next nobody friend a him let's
see well I put the hash tag no it's okay
well it's training on Twitter so let's
see how that goes our disclaimer again
you see how hard is it is that Obama
Obama that's good that's good Obama is
there any meat room in supported here no
all right I'd say Obama know what they
have someone supporting him Obama you
know let's see
when I started working on this demo I
was like mere men like the humanity has
no way to go it's like destiny are
doomed yeah
come on Obama Oh Dexter I love Dexter
alright see porn again but soft porn at
least okay yeah Justin Bieber is that
you it's kind of porn yeah so so what'd
he do what what did the the the route
does is actually it's it's coordinate
weeds can you see the the number going
up so it's actually connecting other
tweets and for every tweet that it gets
it's it checks if it has images on it
and then the first image he sends a JSON
object through a socket to the to the
page yeah Obama yeah see so it's kind of
cool you can you could put a like a huge
monitor on your room and see what's
going on in the internet you know kind
of life point life it's funny so let's
let's see some code let's see how this
works I'm gonna show you a little bit of
java DSL first and then I'm gonna show
you this color version of the same route
that I that I created here so this is
the the main code for this let me
explain to you alright so can you can
people back there read the text no good
now I'm kidding let me put a bigger font
here font size font size colors and
fonts what
on the base I didn't understand oh okay
I think this works okay okay so here's
the route the java DSL route you see
okay first let just explain to you the
the I have a processor for just the
statics
that I'm getting from Twitter so I keep
an instance an object on memory getting
those stats so it's a very simple
processor so let's say so this is the
the processor for every exchange that
goes through him through it if it's
status I just increase it to read count
if it's if it's a tweet that's not my
internal class that because it was
already filtered with an image then I
increase the image and tweet count that
goes into that statics object which is
our just a POJO right so I keep also I
keep the started own property that I can
get the the uptime some of you are seen
the uptime down right at the end of the
page so so if I want to clear just call
the clear method so alright coming back
to the route so for every for every
tweet that I get from the route this is
the simple road I using the type event
that actually connects to Twitter out
opens I streaming channel then tweets
sends me the component has a few options
it can be an event like that it can be
pulling so your component your endpoint
will connect to Twitter every amount of
time there's an option to filter two out
matically filter old tweets that you are
getting again it's true by default so
then I send to set up images which is an
endpoint in a synchronous endpoint right
this one so for every exchange that
comes through this route I extract the
image I call the statics processor to
get the data that I want you to save and
then I filter the body from this part on
only tweets with image will continue
then I make a throttle I make it slower
so then I want like send a bunch of data
through WebSockets Marshall with JSON
and then I sent to WebSocket through all
to the out to order the the the the
clients connected you see there's an
option here send to all alright
because WebSocket some of you may know
WebSocket is able to send just for a
particular connected user what else oh
this is their statistics they are sent
to the WebSocket using quartz so every
second I send the statistics through
WebSocket in a different WebSocket
channel on the same page so then I have
that update on the top on the bottom
it's just a JavaScript that gets the the
date that the server started on and then
on JavaScript just keeps going up
what else I have our web socket for
statistics so I can send a message
through JavaScript that clears the
statistics and also I have something
really cool that is an API that a Able's
me to change dynamically the route of
the the of my my program here so if I
send a WebSocket message with that
starts with search and then something I
remove what is about
set keywords ad routes where's the
remove route it has to be some some oh
here remove Road so it's so when I get a
message from WebSocket that's a simple
or search I'm able to stop the route
remove that and add a new route than
amply in run time right the the
component the the framework is able to
do that all right
what else oh here's the the component
being configured and then I have the
access token consumer and so on and so
on so this code if you want to take a
look at it
alright Obama if you want to look at it
it's on this code this particular Java
code is on github
Bruno Borges /t DC on camera
okay this is the the the the specific
code that are presented in the last the
last conference again all talking to
zero before coming here this is the Java
version of the route so TDC oncam Oh
Bruno Borges at /t DC on camera
now I'm going to show you the Scala
version of that route you see how much
code was in there so well when I saw the
announcement of Java 7 with lambda
expression that was yeah me maybe I
won't need skal anymore which is good
what I have to wait two years okay it's
Caledon for a while
yeah I'm a scholar Fame as a developer
and it's called a fail okay so this is
this color version all right so this
color version is I know not this version
sorry I have two demos here one is the
one that is online on Amazon which is
the jumper one life and the other one is
a tun tunic version of the route okay
so when you connect to the server for
the first time so let's say Beachley
javelin live you see that you already
got a few images right because that came
from the server giving you the last 1012
images that they got for you I added
this feature last night because what I
was happening is that we were connecting
to the page and we were getting nothing
until someone actually post something on
Twitter so the page would stay like
nothing going on for a while so I just
added that so I came up with this FIFO
blocking queue with 12 items
it's a LRU type of Q so what I do just
show you this color code if the
remaining capacity is equal to zero I
just removed the last one and offer the
new one so it's very straightforward
okay I have the JSON format component
here the message transformer I have the
header and then I get keywords from the
configuration file
alright this basically is the route this
is the Twitter out that actually sends
tweets to the browser all these so what
I do here is I connect using the filter
type endpoint using the event type of
connection with Twitter which brings
which gives me the streaming API on
Twitter and I add the keywords that I
get from the configuration file or the
comment line I process the the tweets
using these statistics and then I filter
when this under line here is the
exchange coming it's very crazy but
you got used to it so the underline
means that change so I get the ink
message inside that change and then I
get the object as an instance of status
and then I see if I get media entry
entities inside the tweet right after I
convert the tweet the status update to
my tweet object which gives just just
the user the text and the image URL then
I moved to you the process of the lru
images to get the last twelve images on
memory so I just offer the body to it
this is this is a functional expression
along the expression that Java 7 and
Java 8 will have know then I marshal for
JSON and then I sent you the WebSocket
so here is the send to all again and
statistics how do I send that to users I
just give them and the statistics every
second marshal two days on and there you
go in those first twelve images that I
get from the browser as soon I connect
the page this is the route that gives
that I get the URL there were you images
least I split that into several
exchanges and then I marshal each one to
JSON and then delivered to WebSockets
then there's a JavaScript on the client
side that gets that data and show show
that data on the browser so uh I think
what else can I do
oh yes continuing the presentation last
thing so this just the the what I showed
to you so what I did was connection
search swimming I feel great tweets that
I have media oh yes let's let me show
you the the enhancer demo with oracle
coherence so oracle coherence is a cache
distributed cache
that is able to store stuff in a crazy
way that's how I describe it so here I
have instances of coherence one here one
here another one here
they all talk with each other using UDP
so they know about each other in using
broadcast communication so if I shut
down this instance all the other ones
get to know that one instance is now
down so if I come with this instance
back again they communicate each other
through the network and then they start
to share the data in a concise way so
I'm storing tweets here if you see I
already have 33,000 and 886 tweets
stored on memory so when I was talking
about social media and social data is
that we need some some stuff like this
to store the data and if we want to get
more data we can just come up with new
in new instances so then you have more
space in memory then you can run your
code search for some stuff that you want
your aggregate data to get statistics
data base it on tweets that you get it's
really cool stuff so what
he maybe
well there are other other products on
the market that can do that
adjust the coherence has a very
straightforward way no configuration it
comes a lot of a lot of cool stuff by
default you know you don't you don't
waste your time tuning that much so for
this demo it was actually the perfect
fit because what I wanted was an
in-memory storage for as much tweets
that I can get base it on memory that I
have
so if I come up with more tweets that I
can handle coherence will throw up old
data to give space for the new tweets
coming so basically it makes sense if I
want you to treat social data I don't
actually need data three four years ago
you know I just need a recent data like
trending topics those kind of things so
for this kind of future of analyzing it
does it does great pretty much the job
done so the demo with coherence it will
check the coherence cache for tweets and
future duplicates if it's not there it
will add as a key viale the key will be
the image URL and the actual tweet as a
value then I go forward as the the rest
of the demo so let me show you that
particular demo here
okay TDC on chemo is out let me connect
to the kml twitter coherence
all right
okay receiving status stream let's see
the size 30 to 999 Oh connected the
coherence component for camo it also
brings up an instance of the cache so
they all communicate again so 32 971 so
let's see what's going on Oh what's
going on here
this is not my okay got it
okay let's stop all the instances
bye-bye
and then let's change the the keyword
for this one main resources app the
proxies now the key word is Batman
Batman Batman to be a bad one let's say
Java 1
Oh W there we go yeah it started
coherence because it can using the
coherence component for Apache cable
I don't need them yet but if I want to
increase I just start a new coherence
cache server instance and then they will
communicate with each other
automatically without configuration
that's the basic the default connection
all right so now let me connect to the
console
ok so you see that's why I hate the Java
100w what habit this H o vb i t okay all
right whatever you want
yeah I cosplay stuff I mean it get nuts
the first time I gave this talk I was I
wasn't using images just text and
somebody said I was explaining somebody
said look those hot chicks on the hall
and everybody started laughing then I
looked oh okay got it let's go to the
hall the talk is over let's see come on
okay Hobbit okay three tweets can you
come up with a better cure all right
what Amsterdam that's a good one and
Amsterdam
there you go Amsterdam
no is it spell right yeah
want me to tweets oh one cool thing
about coherence is that if you look Ohno
no not cool yet because there's no image
it only stores tweets with image on
coherence that's my router definition
right you know what I'm gonna go with
hard stuff just don't look to the screen
because what is cool about this is that
it's really fast you know I'm gonna
actually I'm gonna turn off the
throttling so then if come something
comes up we can just move let me open
the route and then we're gonna I'm gonna
show you all so I'm gonna show you the
throttling working so here's the
aggregation pattern for it Scala DSL so
what I do here is it comes there's so
much tweet coming that I only send I
only want to send to the WebSocket let's
say one tweet per second or own one
tweet per half of a second I have like
30 tweets per second
so what I do is I a granade whatever I
strategy I use but I get a lot of tweets
in these 500 and I only get the last one
of that of those tweets that I got in
500 milliseconds so what I'm going to do
here is turn off this so then it's not
going to be slow it's going to be really
fast there you go not aggregating
compile a Zack it's gonna be like peak
so we can come up with anything
I'm so sorry ladies all right not my
fault
Twitter's fault they are not filtering
you know I was actually looking for an
algorithm that could be able to detect
porn on pictures but nobody came up with
that yet so there you go there's a
chance you know yes there you go
so a lot of stuff coming from Twitter
really fast porn stuff as well and this
is the humanity we have we live in you
know this is there live streaming of our
society congratulation society I mean
crazy stuff so I can slow down a little
bit yeah I can slow down a little bit
but then the image will be like yeah and
no matter what image comes up you're
gonna look at the porn stuff you know
your brain goes their way it's really
cool stuff really funny oh so they go I
have one thing here is the publish I'm
just going to show you the tweeting
sample the retweet sample so I'm gonna
change this is the last demo right I'm
gonna change the the keyword just so I
don't get that kind of stuff and JavaOne
okay oh by the way coherence was running
so let's check the cache 303 thousand
and five hundred tweets on those minutes
right okay connect it again to the
application for Java one and Oh W let's
see okay so
see nobody is tweeting about anything so
what I'm going to do here is try to
tweet for you something let's say okay
Wi-Fi connection on yeah
no no demo for this part but I'm gonna
tweet something let me show you let me
open the console let me open the
WebSocket JavaScript that I'm using
cheat tweet for you I have the every
tweet this one okay so app retweet dodge
starch
oh that go one that's me it's me that's
me all right cool thank you thank you
sir some let's tweet dad using WebSocket
and camel okay so I'm gonna copy this
one here I'm gonna start it's started
I'm gonna retweet wherever you sent to
me here there you go done let's see on
Java one parties oh there you go jump on
parties that's the retweet okay so it's
kind of inception isn't yeah okay so the
code is quite simple it's just one route
small route this one so I expect
something coming from through the
WebSocket endpoint retweet and I got
exchanged ice at a body which rt+ the
message that came up and I just sent to
Twitter and that's it okay so it's
pretty much sums what I wanted to show
to you and let's see if I have any more
slides here about chemical here's just
this last one for to finish to sum up
what
wanted to tell you so I'm working on the
coherence component that it's a fork of
the eh cash component the camel cash
component so it will place the eh cash
and just put the the oracle coherence
component on top of it so then I have
the same features of that component I
can add check get remove or remove all
eight entries from the cache I can you
know then I can use that URI which is
pretty much simple the coherence to dot
slash slash came out cache name
coherence is LRU by default which for
this demo is really cool really great
it's also good for social data caching
in memory if you need more storage just
deploy new coherence instance on your
network and then those instances will
connect with each other and gives more
space for data all right that's it any
questions no yes
okay yes
like chemo is basically the framework
for using enterprise integration
patterns you don't have monitoring you
don't have start/stop web console
administration features like that it's
just really the framework so you have to
program every single thing that you want
to do so if you want to monitor live
things that are work going on you have
to build your own console for that if
you want for an enterprise FC buzz most
of the problems they come up with that
you just deploy the routes if you get
for instance the Apache service mix that
yes we can deploy Apache came on routes
so then service makes managers there
came routes okay yes yes yes anything
else you're really okay
I hate it I mean yeah they are they're
doing a great job I mean I'm I'm not
following very closed but uh well they
are trying to catch up
I mean kamo is on this for years and
springy people they have come up with
spring integration like two years ago
three years ago but up they're doing
great job I mean well you can use the
spring to define cameras as well okay
anymore
nope okay well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
