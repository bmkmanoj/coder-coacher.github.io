of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet a key feature of jet is its library
of components in the second week of the
weekly lessons about oracle jet we will
focus specifically on the oracle jet
components and you will learn how to use
each of them in detail in this part you
will be introduced generically to the
workflow of integrating oracle jet
components into your oracle jet
applications the oracle jet components
are all open sourced and available at
github.com slash oracle slash oracle jet
each of them is described in the online
oracle jet cookbook which you will be
using in this part of the course in each
case a complete recipe consisting of the
HTML view and the JavaScript business
logic are defined and can be copied and
pasted into your applications
in each case JavaScript documentation
defining each component is also
available in the demo that follows you
will be shown the online oracle jet
cookbook the related JavaScript
documentation and how to work with the
online oracle jet cookbook here is the
OHA chart that we discussed earlier in
the course using the new custom elements
in tax in the HTML file and here is the
data that is loaded into it from the
view model this is how the chart looks
in the browser notice that when we
change the type to for example bar and
go back to the browser we now have a bar
chart what would be useful for this
scenario would be to have a drop-down
list that lets the user choose either
bar or pie and then switch automatically
from the bar chart to the pie chart the
jet cookbook has a range of components
several of which could help us in this
particular context a simple solution
would be to use the Select component
notice that as we go into the Select
component section of the Oracle jet
cookbook there are a range of different
solutions that are provided the Select
component has many different features
each of which are illustrated in
different way
by means of recipes the simplest recipe
presents a list of different browsers
when a different browser is selected
notice that the text below the browser
is automatically updated we have an HTML
section and we have a JavaScript section
in the cookbook this presents the view
and the business logic of the component
that we see in the browser the info tab
provides some basic information
explaining how the particular recipe is
to be used directly within the browser
you can tweak and update the component
that you see displayed here for example
right now we see a list of browsers but
what we would like is to show the user
the possibility of selecting a pie chart
or a bar chart we can make the changes
directly in the recipe even deleting
lines and when the applied button is
clicked on the top right
notice that the component is updated and
that it works as expected
now that we are happy with the data
displayed within the component we can
copy the related tags and paste them
inside of our HTML file notice that the
value attribute refers to our property
let's get back into the cookbook and
find it there the property will be named
Val on the JavaScript side of the recipe
we find our property we copy it and you
go back into the JavaScript side of our
Oracle jet module and paste it there
again we see a KO observable and we will
initialize our ko observable with one of
our two types in this case by we now
have a property named Val knockout we'll
observe that property and update all
references
whenever it changes there is one
reference at this point to them a final
step is that we need to load the
component that we are making yourself
here we have the reference to the
component that we are using we copy it
from the cookbook and we paste it in our
JavaScript file now back in the browser
we see we have a drop-down list
containing the data that we provided
however when we switch from one type to
another notice that the chart is not
updated the reason for that is that the
type is hard-coded to bar what we would
like to do instead is to set the type to
the same property that we are using in
our drop-down list not only do we want
to refer to that property but we want to
do so in a very specific way notice that
here we have curly braces whereas for
this property we are using square braces
the difference between the two is very
important the two curly braces indicate
that this is a read/write property while
the square braces indicate that we are
dealing with a read-only property in
this case we want to enable the user to
change the Vail property by means of the
drop-down list and therefore we specify
it by means of the curly braces in
addition we want to bind the type
attribute of the urge a chart to the
same property now the value attribute of
the urge a select one component and the
type attribute of the earlier chart
component are bound to the same property
that property is set to be readwrite so
that the user can change it by means of
the drop-down list when a change is made
a means of the drop-down list the urgent
chart components type attributes will
automatically be updated to the new
value as you have seen curly braces
denote readwrite properties or two-way
data bindings while square braces
signify read-only properties
or one-way data-binding though you could
theoretically use curly braces
everywhere and make all properties read
write practically what you are doing
when you do that is setting listeners
everywhere what you don't need
everywhere so when you simply want to
display the value of a property use
square braces and when you want to
ensure that you can change that property
by means of a component use curly braces
the correct approach with the chart in
this case is to use square braces and
curly braces for the drop-down list back
in the browser notice that when we make
a change in the drop-down list the chart
is automatically updated as well that is
because the type property of the chart
is set to the same property as the value
of the drop-down list notice also that
back in the auricle jet cookbook in
addition to many variations on the
simple drop-down list a link is provided
to the related JavaScript documentation
all aspects relating to each component
are defined in great detail with example
code by means of the JavaScript
documentation also notice in the Oracle
jet cookbook that you can see how each
component looks on different types of
devices as well as on different
platforms by means of the Oracle jet
cookbook you have a complete guide to
each of the components that Oracle jet
makes available and you can copy and
paste components directly from the orbit
jet cookbook into your application after
tweaking them life in the browser you
should now understand how to quickly and
easily integrate Oracle jet components
into your Oracle jet applications you
can treat the cookbook like a pallet of
components that can be cut and pasted
into your applications without much work
in the second of the weekly lessons
about Oracle jet you will be introduced
to each of the components and about the
benefits of each in your enterprise
JavaScript applications your homework
exercise is to experiment
different components in the online
Oracle Jett cookbook and learn how to
integrate them into your applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
