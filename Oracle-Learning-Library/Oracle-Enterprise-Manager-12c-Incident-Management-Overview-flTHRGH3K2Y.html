Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demonstration shows you
an overview of the incident manager user
interface the all area of incident
management is meant to enable you to
monitor and resolve service description
in your data center as quickly and
efficiently as possible
as you know Enterprise Manager is
capable of managing very granular level
of events such as metric alerts target
availability compliance violations angel
failures for example however the set of
events might point to the same
underlying issue so instead of having
administrators managing each and every
occurrence of events Enterprise Manager
offer the possibility to categorize them
by incident and problems Enterprise
Manager offers a central you I called
incident manager from where you manage
your incidents so let's go there go to
the enterprise menu then monitoring and
then incident manager let's take a look
at the features offered by incident
manager starting from the left we have
views that allow you to work on a subset
of incidents and problems for example
there is a default view that shows all
the incidents and problems that are
assigned to you one view that lists all
the unassigned incidents incidents that
have not been acknowledged etc etc in
addition to these out-of-the-box views
you can create your own in the custom
section one has already been created
let's now have a look at the first stand
up view here the my open incidents and
problems view shows you the incidents
and problems that are assigned to you
let's take a look at the backup fail
problem
these operates in master-detail fashion
you need to click on the incidental
problem at the top to get the
corresponding details at the bottom of
the page
now you can maximize the detail region
of your page these section gives you
information about the incident details
like what type of incident it is the
date and time of the incidents
occurrence the tracking section allows
you to manage the life cycle of that
incident for example as you can see here
user super owns the incident it has
already been acknowledged but is not
escalated yet and no priorities set the
guided resolution part provide links to
other functionalities in iam that will
help you perform further Diagnostics or
appropriate resolution actions on the
incident this hopefully would have
provided you a quick overview of the
incident manager UI and conclude this
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
