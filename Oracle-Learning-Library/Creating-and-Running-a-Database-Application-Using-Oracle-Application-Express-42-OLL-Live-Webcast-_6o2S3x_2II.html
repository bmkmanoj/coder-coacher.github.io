database application using Oracle
application Express 4.2 is presented by
Auto comma Monday and Dimpy sar1
Auto Palma and MP are both coasts
developers in the server technologies
curriculum development group here at
Oracle so hello and welcome to this
online webcast about Oracle application
Express 4.2 so my name is simply Sharma
and my colleague under palma mangia will
be guiding you through this webcast
where we will show you how to create a
web based database application using
Oracle application 4.2 how to add a
mobile user interface to the database
application thereby allowing users to
access the application or the mobile
device and the third one is how to use a
responsive theme in your application so
the first two demos I will be showing
you the past two demos and the last one
about responsive theme will be shown you
by Anupama Mannie this is a standard
Oracle safe harbor notice basic notice
basically what it states is that this
webcast does not imply a contract
between you and I and that's what I am
presenting today should not be used to
make any purchase decision now let's
look at the prerequisites which in you
need to know try out these obese so for
this you need to have some working
experience with Oracle application
Express and some knowledge and P is
equal and PL sequel and in today's
webcast we are using some Oracle
products and tools like Oracle database
11g or later and Oracle application
Express 4.2 so today we are going to
show you demos days on the OB which is
given in the slide creating and running
a database application using Oracle
application 4.2
so let me give you a brief introduction
about Oracle application Express so
Oracle application Express is the web
application development deployment and
maintain
and screw it enables you to create
database centric web applications that
are reliable scalable and secure so
using only a web browser and limited
programming experience you can develop
professional applications that are both
fast and secure and it has seven
built-in features and without that click
in your development process some of the
key features are listed in this slide
such as reports forms charts calendars
themes and templates navigation control
logic and security so the tool has a
user-friendly graphic interface now let
me just tell you how Oracle application
works so the app the Oracle application
engine renders applications in real time
from data stored in database table
when you create or extend an application
Oracle application Express creates or
modifies metadata stored in database
table and when the application is run
the application Express engine then
reach the metadata and displays the
application so when you login to Oracle
application Express you will see that
the page displays four major components
which is listed in the slide first we
have application builder which is used
to build your application then we have
sequel Workshop which can be used to
view and manage database objects then
the third one is team development team
development is used to track new
features to-do lists and other things
which are related when and in which are
used when you work in a team and the
fourth one is administration wherein you
can go ahead and manage moogles and
group look at the monitor different task
manager your dashboard and so on so now
let us see what is the advantage and
benefits of using Oracle application
Express so using Oracle application
Express you can develop web based
database centric applications that are
reliable and past as well as secure and
scalable it has a user-friendly
interface which enables you to create
and deploy applications in a short span
of time and you can use the available
themes and templates to provide a
consistent look and feel across your web
pages so recs application uses a
declarative framework for web
application development this means that
you specify what to do writer than how
to do it no code is generated or
compiled you interact with different
wizard and property sheets to define
your application and it also provides a
platform independent environment
now let's move to the next slide okay
now let us see what are the types of
applications which can be developed
using Oracle application Express using
Oracle application Express within
develop enterprise wide applications
web-based applications to break projects
context customers xx' we can also create
web cheat applications then we can
create applications to look up people
and catalog items and applications like
lightweight business intelligence
applications with repose bar charts and
so on and we can also create mobile
application which is newly introduced in
Oracle application 4.2 let me explain
what is the application builder an
Oracle application builder enables you
to build database applications as well
expect sheet applications so what are
the types of applications in Oracle
application Express you know as so as we
all know that application is a
collection of pages the end using Oracle
application Express you can create
database application which enables
developers to have full control on all
aspects of the development process with
development with data with applications
developers can directly leverage the
sequel and PL sequel programming skills
you can manually go ahead and add and
customize the post page controls and
other shared components then via web
seed application virtualization is
geared towards the end user and requires
no prior development experience each web
sheet application is a collection of
pages designed for web-based data and CN
reporting the third one is packaged
application - packaged applications are
fully functional applications that have
been designed to address a specific
business needs you can install run and
use packaged applications and they are
you create an Oracle application Express
by running the create application wizard
and to run the create application with
the
you just go ahead and click the Create
button which is displayed on the
application builder home page now let's
see what are the database application
user interfaces so in your Oracle
application Express we have two types of
user interfaces first is a desktop user
interface and the second one is mobile
user interview I'll be showing about the
interfaces one demo in do be coming to
the themes the themes are used to define
the layout and style of an entire
application themes provides a set of
templates that accommodate every user
interface pattern that may be needed in
an application in a regular application
express support three types of user
interface cool with a standard custom
and legacy standard themes are provided
by application Express and we have also
a new theme which is called blue
responsive team that is used to develop
responsive web pages web applications
that can be used on desktop smartphones
and tablets Anupama we'll be explaining
in more detail about responsive web
applications please reserve for desktop
user interface so this is in the slide
the screenshot shows the page wizard for
the desktop user interface using which
you can add arrays various pages in your
database application that you can use
edge reports report and form forms
charts and so on so while creating a
database application there is a option
called clear arrays of infiltrate option
so in that if you choose include
homepage then your database application
will have two pages created by default
that is homepage and the login page
otherwise there is another option that
is start from scratch if you create
application choose choosing that option
you will have only the login page
created by default and you manually go
ahead and create other pages in your
application
so this slide shows the page result for
a database application using the mobile
user interface when you create an
application using the mobile user
interface a blank page called the home
page login page and the global pager
created the global global page functions
as the master page for the application
so once you have created your
application you need to run your
application and you can run your
application by clicking the run
application icon which is given in the
slide ok now let this start creating a
database application and add some pages
like repos master drill form and show
you how we can work on that so as you
see this is a home page of the Oracle
application Express wherein therefore
the major components which I have
already explained application builder
sequel workshop team develop and
administration so now I will create a
database application click on
application builder I then this is a
create button which is a displayed in
the application builder page and click
on this
and the create application wizard
displays here displayed here where let's
select database and click Next
okay let me give a name to my
application as test
database
yep so this is a field which is talking
about create option here you get three
option heart pumps patch include
homepage and use previously created
application model if I choose use
previously created application model
then I can create my new application
based on the already existing
application so right now I will select
include bomb page then coming to a user
interfaces LC we have two options
desktop and jQuery Mobile Smartphone so
cause this application I will select the
desktop user interface and I will also
show you how you can go ahead and add
jQuery smartphone mobile user interface
click Next
so as I selected the include home page
create option you can see a home page is
already created now I'll go ahead and
add a report in my application
for that I need to choose a table in
which I need to create a report so I'll
select
oh yeah customer stable and as you see
here the implementing implementation is
the interactive report so we have two
types of report here interactive and
classic interactive report is a report
where which enables the users to
customize their reports according to
their requirements
so I'll click on add page
and then click Next
here we will accept the default and
click Next
a date for MIT to be a constant
throughout your application just go
ahead and virtue a date for my
qualification I choose the second one
that is DD mo n bi bi bi pocket and
click Next
so these are the standard themes which
we have which we have in our Oracle
application Express so by default a
Productivity application theme is
selected so for my application I will go
ahead to the default theme and click
Next
so priests are you know you need to
confirm your selections in this page and
click create application
to create your application so here you
can see that right now we have three
pages in our application that is
homepage interactive report and the
login page you can either run each page
by sinking didn't I think we're all you
can click the run application icon this
stage where to run your application
here you need to enter your username and
password
click login
okay so this is the homepage of my
database app application here you can
see a navigational link to do here
customers to report tile click on this
link
and here you can see the report is
displayed so this is an interactive
report and in this report as I said the
interactive report allows you to you
know customize your report as your
requirement based on your requirement so
you have a search failure and you can
again you have actions manager if I
click on this I get different options
suppose right now I want a five rows per
page
so here you go you see that five roses
dictating the report in the format
option we again have some options
exhorting control big highlight compute
aggregate chart goodbye so I'll use
control pick and I will select customer
ID and click apply so now you can see
that control brake is applied on the
customer ID column so this is how an
integral report is created so let me go
ahead and create a market dil form so
this is a developer toolbar and you have
a different menu available here like
home home application whatever your
application number is and edit page
create session and so on sand peeps on
the application menu so off to create a
master detail form first I'll click
create page button
then select form grid radio button and
click Next
and select master detail form and click
Next
I need to select the table hamamass
retail form so I'll select
we are order stable and these are the
columns which will be displayed in a
report click Next
you
so here I will again select a table
which contains the columns to be
included in your detailed page then
select your order items table and click
Next
you
they will accept the default and click
Next
click Next
again accept the defaults and click Next
click Next again
next
confirm your selections and click create
button to create a form
you
so the master riddle pages have been
created purposefully now let's turn the
page
so you can see here this is a master
report if you want to go to this master
detail pump click the Edit icon here and
here you go
the first one is master form and the
second the boundness
which is available under the master form
is the detail form so whatever changes
you made in the detail form will be
reflected in your master form as well as
your report if you want to delete
something you can just check it and
click the delete check if you want to
add one additional row you can click add
row button and add your rows here also
you have some buttons available for
cancel delete apply changes
you
so now let me show you how you can add
jQuery Mobile Smartphone interface in
the same application let's
okay to add the other you I mean deeper
your interface click Edit application
properties
go to user interface
again user interface and here you get a
button called add new user interface I
will click on it
and select the type jQuery Mobile
Smartphone Duffus okay notice that the
URL which is given here is their home
your URL and be logging you are
click Next
so this is the only theme which is
available in Oracle application Express
core point to jQuery Mobile Smartphone
team 50 so I'll select the same theme
and click Next
now click create to create your
application
so here you can see they're three pages
created one is a login page then we have
a home page and the global page jQuery
global page so let's run the pages to
Syria jQuery interface
so here you can see this is a mobile
user interface now here I will just go
ahead and add one a report to show you
how a report looks in a mobile interface
we'll click create page
here you need to select the user
interface as jQuery Mobile Smartphone
and click in select report and click
Next
so L see we have a whole different type
of reports but India Mobile entire user
interface we do not have the interactive
report which you have in desktop user
interface instead of that we have a
ListView lip report so I will select a
list view report and click Next
give a name to my report
you
click Next
here I'll enter sequel query select star
from future
and choice
and click Next
so suppose you want to enable let's
search bar in your support so you can
check this enable search bar checkbox
and you want the first name and this
last name to be displayed in your report
so I've selected the first time and last
move and click Next
click create to create the epic report
so the report has been created now then
page
so here you can see that require a
person name and the last name is
displayed in the report
so if I suppose say men attack Nancy
click enter so I see Nancy's named
escape net is first name and the last
name with stayed in the report she loved
want to log out of the mobile interfaces
click log out button go
so let me show you when the temple
application we're wearing we have both
the desktop and the mobile user
interface
so here these are the package
application which are available for you
and just show you one of the
applications at example database
application
and to the username and password
and click login'
so this is one of the sample data with
application which shows the customers
the end products orders report details
so as you see there is a mobile link
available now if I click on this is a
desktop user interface so if we want to
see the mobile user interfaces click
mobile links here and here you go here
this is the mobile user interface
click on each of this to see in detail
if you want to create a new one you can
create a new customer by clicking the
create button and if you want to go to
the home just click this form email icon
available here
so these are different things this is a
calendar which is available
similarly we have reports some order
details and product details
so if you want to know more about the
you know different pages like calendars
charts the master detail forms different
forms in a in tech reports you can go to
our site that is Oracle Learning Library
and then you can search for all the
obvious which are available for
application application Expo
you
so these are the list of Obi's which you
which we have for a record application
expense you can go ahead and you know
use any of you Obie's to learn more in
detail about interactive repos or a
responsive design mobile user interface
and so on so I will hand it over to
Anupama will be going through the more
responsive web application so before
that we have a polling poll question
here which of the following is
responsible for processing and rendering
the web application pages
you
you
you
okay thanks Tim P and I guess all of you
got the pulling the poll questions and
all the answers right so this is one
from our unfamiliar a desktop
application to a responsive theme so our
basically application X this 4.2 has
introduced a recent user interface
design principle called as responsive
design so what is a responsive design
service also design is an approach to
web design in which a designer intends
to provide an optimal viewing experience
that is easy reading and navigation with
a minimum with a minimum of resizing
panning and scroll
of the wide range of dividing from
desktop computer monitors to mobile
phones so this could range from a
desktop computer monitors to your
tablets or to smartphones so this is the
definition that was provided by
Wikipedia so basically what is
responsive design for responsive design
is a way to design websites so that the
layout fits the available size are
different in five desktop or laptop
browsers as well as tablets and
smartphones so on smartphone and tablet
then they out adopts itself to the size
of the devices screen this is basically
done by having 13 elements shift the
position or resize or become hidden and
completely so the goal here is to meet
all essential content available in a
user-friendly and leading way on any
device that you run your application on
so Oracle application Express order 2
introduces a responsible interface theme
called as theme 25 so this theme
provides the basic building blocks and
templates that allows you to achieve a
responsive layout so it is based on css3
media queries which allow you to define
various styles based on screen size and
orientation ok so here is the screenshot
of what are actually Dimpy already
showed you so how our desktop user
interface looks like so basically a
sample database application that runs on
a desktop user interface so you can see
that there are various you can see that
there are various regions so you have
sales for both month top customers top
products and top orders by date so all
these regions are uniformly distributed
on the desktop user interface to
accommodate the screen size so this
would be placed of the page would be
displayed of a uniformly hour
in such a way that the regions
accommodate the whole desktop screen so
similarly when you run the same
application on a tablet or on a mobile
device so you will see that the screen
or the or the application basically
adjusts to the size of your device's
screen so you can see that the same
application went run on the tablet or an
iPad or something like an iPad so you
can see that the region's accommodate
densive on the screen of depending on
the screen size and similarly when you
run the same application on a mobile
device or smartphone so you can see that
the regions are stacked one over the
other so that you can just scroll down
vertically and view the whole page so
all the application Express or 4.2
introduced responsive design or
introduced responsive design and it's in
its product release so the what happens
here is that as far as in 25 or blue
responsive theme so this blue responsive
theme basically supports a desktop
tablet and mobile screen sizes so it can
it can run on any of these devices then
it also uses flexible grid layout that
can be moved on Queen cycle which can
range from largest computer monitors to
mobile devices and also interactive
reports are displayed appropriately for
smaller screens using both kolbar and
you can see that I'll be showing you or
I will be demonstrating that how you can
view or form of that that runs on a
responsive theme so you will notice that
the labels would shift about the field
and items will to standardize when you
run the application or the form on a
mobile device so to migrate an
application to thin 20 pipe so these are
some of the steps that you will have to
consider before you migrate an
application to think
25 suppose you will have to create new
and pipe on the repository then you love
to switch to pin 25 and then review that
in templates capability our
compatibility and then you will have to
view the application and run it on
various by run different various devices
so let me quickly demonstrate of how
warm you can create a desktop
application something thing with what
the India's already demonstrated but
this will be a quick a quick review of
what you've demonstrated and then once
we have the ones we have created an
application we will try to migrate the
application to use responsive design and
one the application or resize the
browser to see how it can how it would
look on different devices basically how
the response of how it becomes
responsive and run on different devices
so I'm creating an application on a peg
store oracle.com I have an account here
so I'll log into application Express and
create an application so we have the
application builder meetings of the
application builder to create a new
application so I click create so we have
different options I want to quit an
application or database application and
set a database and click Next
I'll give a name to my application let
me call it as responsive team demo and
I'll click Next
so here I want to add a form and select
form and I have different tables so let
me pick the EMP table
and I'll click Add page so I have two
pages currently in my application the
home page and the EMP forms page I'll
click Next
I lack somebody falls and click Next
so here I have a sort of standard things
I'll go by the productivity application
that is which is better the default here
in my instance so I'll just click Next
and then click create application so if
you want to create an application
directly at the time response of the
choose with responsive theme so you can
you could do so at the time of creating
your application it's a but I what I'm
trying to show here is that how you can
migrate your application this is already
being created using a different theme to
to a responsive theme so here we have
the three pages so I'll run my
application and login using my login
credentials and here I have an e EMP the
form that I created for this is how the
form looks like so let me let me go or
go to the home page and create four more
regions within the home page so when I
run this home page soap currently this
is looking like this so I just have a
navigation link to the EMP forms page I
want to create four more empty HTML
regions so let me try doing that I'll
add in four regions
click Next
and should I have
I'll enter the names of the region
reasons that I want to create I have
four regions and I will click create
regions button so when I run my
application or when I run the home page
so this is how the four regions look
like
so when I try to reset also when I try
to refine my browser so this is not
using but at 1:15 so when when I try to
revive the browser which means that when
I try to run it on different devices
like a tablet or a mobile device so you
will notice that
the regions are kind of getting smaller
but you can see that there is some kind
of overlapping of regions here that will
the navigation link is overlapping on
the title and it is not actually
accommodating well on this when I run
this using the Spain when they run when
I run the application using the moon so
what I would like to do is I would like
to before that let me just edit this
page and try to accommodate the four
regions next to meet each other so let
me place region two next to region one
and region 4 next to region P so to do
this I'll select engine two and edit the
grid layout of region two so I will say
instead of starting from a new row so
I'll select that as no that means that
it works at just the same row as a
previous region that has region one and
I would like to do the same thing on
region four as well that means I would
like to place region 4 next to region 3
so I'll change the grid layout or I will
just change this option here from yes to
no and then flick apply changes
so this is how my region would look like
now so I have four regions which are
placed side by side side next to each
other so let me see I let us see how how
your homepage will look like when you
change the theme so when you try to run
this on the responsive theme so what
I'll do here is I'll open application ID
that will basically go to the
application applications homepage of the
applications of homepage and I'll click
the share click on the share complements
option here so this tool with on this
tool I have themes under the user
interface section so you can see that
the current theme that is being used
here is productive the application that
is thin 26 so this routine was selected
at the time of creating the application
so I want to introduce the application
to blue responsive themes or cure I
click on create and clear and create the
theme from the repository that is the
blue responsive theme from the
repository posit or II so I select from
the repository and here I click Next I
accept the default as desktop user
interface time so here I get a set of
themes that are provided by application
Express 4.2 so in the repository I can
find new responses that is theme 25 I
select this option and click Next
and I click create
so here I have glued at once of theme so
but still you can see that the current
theme is still pointing to productivity
applications I want to switch themes so
which means that I want a name
blue responsive as well as the current
theme or the current active theme so to
to do that I knew I will click on switch
new and I'll select the currently active
theme as productivity applications and
the docs and blue responsive or switch
to theme I'll click Next
so the time of switching teams
so application builder basically map all
all currently used templates through a
template in the new claim using the
template last so here you can see that
there are various types of templates
which are coming from the productivity
applications theme and which need to map
through the template class in the
responsive theme so when you see at the
time of migrating an application or when
you switch between themes so you can see
that there is this complete
compatibility option so you get a
warnings or you where you might find
warning such as multiple matching
templates one or no template form button
with matching template class so to do
that you need to closely analyze and
think over and try to map the closest
template class from the theme that you
are switching as switching to and from
the thing that you want to switch to so
here let me just select optional
horizontal right align and here again I
would I'll select this
so I'm not particular about no tabs no
sidebar so that is perfectly fine
because both are similar and similarly
with the list type of templates so here
we have both similar options which means
that multiple matching templates form
levels there are three our templates
with the same template which are similar
to the same template class as the
productivity applications theme so we
will leave this as is and here I'll just
select standard region as the closest
template to which I want to map the
responsive themes standard region to the
template slash of the reports region
from the productivity application so
I'll click Next
and I click switch theme so here you see
that the current teen mouth is blue
responsive so when they try to run that
location
you
so when I try to run the application we
will notice that the four regions are
displayed side by side that was next to
each other and also when you try to
resize your application you will notice
that
when it is run on an iPad this the four
regions accommodate themselves to the
screen size of a tablet and similarly
when I try to resize to desktop or to a
mobile UI you'll notice that the regions
are placed one above the other are
basically stacked one over the other so
when I go back to this application here
I'll you will notice how on the EMP form
that we created looks like so this looks
pretty much similar to what it was
previously with the previous team so
here to accommodate this thing or to
accommodate this form on a to run it on
various devices can just change the
template of this form
I will change it to an alert region
which means that are the labels and the
fields accomodate to the size of the
device or the screen size of the device
that you are running that issue one so
here when I run this application so you
will notice that the buttons have moved
on so that I change the templates of the
buttons will move down so when I try to
resize or when when I try to run this on
a mobile UI you notice that the labels
have shifted about the field and
similarly the buttons have a are stacked
or basically are moved one over the
other
