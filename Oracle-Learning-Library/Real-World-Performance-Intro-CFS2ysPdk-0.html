the real-world performance team here at
Oracle and today we thought we'd get out
of the office and to one of my favorite
locations on a beautiful spring day down
here on the city front in San Francisco
but let's just talk a little bit about
real-world performance now I've been
doing real-world performance now at
Oracle for nearly 27 years and I really
learnt quite a few things about people's
philosophy and approach to performance
that yields good performance I've also
seen the other side of the coin and I
spend a lot of time coaching and hoping
that people will actually start
listening and making the right decisions
earlier my favorite sport being sailing
and we're gonna do more of that later
we're going to actually talk about what
it takes to win a race now a performance
project on your database is just like a
sailboat race it's all one before you
even cross the line it's all about
preparation practicing equipment
selection all these things are so
important to win races that basically we
have to put the preparation in and the
hard work so one of the points I like to
make about real-world performance is you
don't accidentally stumble on to
world-class performance on your database
it takes hard work maybe you don't like
to hear that but it really does take
hard work and attention to detail and a
certain passion inside of you to make
things go really well the next issue I
really like to talk about is that in
many cases people don't realize they
have a performance problem or right up
into the last minute ie the time when
they roll systems out into production
and this is like me attacking the start
line in a sailboat that I've never raced
together with a crew I've never raced
together I don't even know the course
and I have no idea what the weather is
so basically we may tend to find that
people get the systems they deserve it
really measures the amount of
preparation they've done and the last
thing we really have to do with is a
culture of good enough in many cases at
work we're not actually dealing with
trying to win races we're just trying to
be
good enough now this culture of good
enough is basically one of our biggest
challenges because it's a non
engineering metric it's very much a
perception thing it's a bit like winning
ice skating competitions you have to
please the judges ie your boss or your
customers or in sailboat racing we have
to win the race we have to come across
the line in front of everybody else
and so we need to be working at the
point that we're getting the best out of
the crew the best out of the sailboat
we're reading the weather the best and
we're winning the races and this is
different so really real world
performance is about maximizing your
investment in Oracle software and
hardware it's not about appearing to be
good enough it's actually measuring and
recording excellence perhaps we've got
the best metaphor behind me real world
performance is all about bridging your
potential performance and actually
delivering it in reality in many cases
in so many systems we see people have
got all the ingredients they've got
reasonably well written applications
they have the best software they have
the best hardware but they're not quite
delivering on the performance and this
are the performance engineering aspects
so it's more a case of taking what is
potentially good enough and reaching its
ultimate performance it's bridging that
gap many people ask about the real-world
performance methods and techniques that
we adopt and they're remarkably simple
and we'll just use the boat as a very
simple analogy and the first thing we
always make sure when we're doing
real-world performance projects is to
make sure that we use the equipment in
the manner that I think it's designed to
be used so you can see that I've rigged
my boat here in the manner it's to be
designed to used we wouldn't try and put
the rudder in the centreboard slot we'll
put the center board on the rudder we
basically use the equipment as its set
up and designed to be used there isn't
anything here that's not being used in
the manner that it was designed to be
used and that's one of the first points
to be made about real-world performance
the next thing is in real-world
performances we really are a data-driven
approach to how we do
sport or database performance for us now
we take inputs of data while we're going
sailing so I have a wind indicator to
tell me where the wind is coming from
lightweight I have
Telltale's on the sail to tell me if the
sail is stalling whether I've trimmed
the sails correctly or not now with this
in mind we also do the same with our
database we gather aw our data we gather
sequel monitor data to tell us where
we're spending the time inside the
database where a sequel statement is
spending its time to give us the truth
as to what is going on and we're not
guessing at what is going on so we can
do good performance analysis there's
barely really truly three real-world
performance problems unless again we use
the analogy of the boat to describe it
and the first thing is we're just not
using the product correctly we're not
using it if it was designed I rigged the
boat in front of you as it was designed
to be used if you're not doing that
you're at a disadvantage from the
beginning we're not going to win that
race because our equipment is not set up
to win the second issue is that in many
cases that we suffer in real world
performances the application code has
just been inappropriately designed for
the actual performance that it's trying
to achieve and perhaps we can use this
simple analogy that here we have a piece
of the boat where we have to actually
apply a lot of tension okay now if I
only used one piece of rope you can see
I'm not able to apply much tension but
if I actually start using mechanical
advantage I can actually achieve a lot
of advantage and you can see how much
I've bent that mast as a result of
pulling that on and we will have to do
that while sailing but the key point is
with just a single piece of rope how to
never achieve that advantage we see this
today in database performance because
people are writing row by row programs
rather than using set-based techniques
so if you can go with that idea a single
pulley versus multiple pulleys the
multiple pulleys gives you more
advantage and the third item of
real-world performance is we
occasionally actually see problems
inside the database
and what in which case we fix them just
like if I damage my boat because I have
a collision or something I fix it it's
as simple as that
now however people's perception of why
they have proof of holes on the system
is that it's always a component or a
data usually a database problem 99% of
people believe that they have a database
problem however if you actually get down
and do real-world performance you
usually find is one of those two issues
they weren't using the product properly
or their application code wasn't
specific now this sort of boat is called
a laser and we actually erase these and
the other boats are identical so with
all the boats identical the only thing
that is variable is the Sailor
however it's even funny in the laser
racing where all the boats are identical
the people at the back of the fleet are
always blaming their equipment whereas
the people at the front of the fleet put
their success down to hard work and
preparation this isn't an accident
additional things that the real world
performance team does is we spend a lot
of time training and teaching people and
you may have attended one of our real
world training classes or watch one of
our videos online showing you real world
performance in action
coaching and education is an important
part if people aren't meant it into
doing it right they won't do it right
it's as simple as that and the last
thing that real-world performance do is
we're really trying to avoid doing
performance by guesswork hacking bit
flipping trying and seeing we actually
want to know that we understand how the
products working how the hardware is
working and make sure that they're
running properly this is the key to
really good performance if you're
executing with the equipment as designed
you have a good chance and you can see
when I go sailing if I use the equipment
properly and I've rigged the equipment
properly there's a fair chance when I
line up on that start line I'm in the
game with a chance of winning that race</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
