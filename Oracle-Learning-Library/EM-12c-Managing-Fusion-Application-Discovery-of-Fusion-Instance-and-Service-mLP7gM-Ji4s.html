o'clock control 12c demo series focusing
on the best practices for a fusion
application management this screen watch
is for discovering fusion application
instance and its related products the
purpose of the screen watch is to
provide instructions on discovering
pigeon application instance an
enterprise media cloud control the
process of discovering pigeon instance
can be challenging without proper
guidance or reference through this
screen watch we will provide the
instructions on Oracle's best practices
for discovering fusion instance and its
related products such as identity
management bi and out of park service's
the step-by-step guidance will help
system admin to discover fusion instance
as less error-prone also maintain an
expanded system more easily and
systematically in addition to hear my
technical white paper the cover same
topic please refer to this link in OT n
to download the white paper the agenda
for the screen watch is following first
will demonstrate how to run the
diagnostic projects next we'll proceed
of discovering fusion instance third
once the feeder instance has been
discovered we'll show you how to add
other related products fourth in case
system admin wants to expand the product
families and refreshing instance is the
way to do fifth the latest release of
Ian call control provides the otto bock
services that can be easily configured
and added to the system mostly all show
you how to delete dub instance
diagnostic projects allow users to
identify specific steps or tasks than my
cause the discovery to fill Ian call
control provides the corrective actions
to resolve any discovery failure issue
therefore system admin can follow the
recommendation and fix the issue prior
to running the discovery process this
test can be run multiple times to make
sure all the steps are completed
successfully and user can be assured of
running discovery process successful now
let's start all right in the diner
diagnostic projects
to start the diagnostic projects go to
fusion application home page and click
the fusion application feature drop-down
list and select the target management
best practices select the one diagnostic
projects so here we'll set up the
information for running diagnostic
projects so first you'll have to find
the animation server host and provide a
username and password and you have to
create the unique vision instance
identifier click Next so this our
process will find all the product
families they belong to your future
instance once the system found all the
product variants it will show how much
how many proteins are found and you can
click close and click Next for the
verifying connection information so in
this us that you'll see all this product
pyramids are discovered and you can
choose the sum of the product families
that you want to run the Diagnostics so
let's choose couple of the product
families for the demo and click Next and
you will notice that the older
information was already populated with
the right server hostname port number is
defined for different product families
username and password are also
popularity and agents are assigned for
each product family if you want to also
include the down servers during the
discovery you can click this box and
click Next and you can click the run
tests to run the diagnostic projects
once you have the confirmation page it
shows that all the diagnostic projects
has done completely closed the window
and you will see the result pages
showing on so you'll have all the past
tests and if there's any field tests
that you can examine and you will check
the what's the impact of the failed test
and what is the recommendation to
resolve the issue you can run the
multiple diagnostic checks to make sure
there's no Phil test it is important to
resolve any field tests before you
proceed with our original instance
discovery this concludes the running
diagnostic protects fusion instance
discovery has a five step which includes
function and set up selecting product
family and find the target for the
product family and assign the agent for
the target that was discovered
previously and review the result prior
to discover in the fusion instance
adamant needs to ensure that the host
and database target the support division
instance have been discovered in the
clock control also make sure that the
proper credentials is set for all the
hosts that will be used for fusion
instance discovery once all this
prerequisite is taken care of we can
start off discovering the fusion
instance to edit with an instance come
to fill an application home page and
click the Add button and select the
fusion instance the process of adding
fuel instance is pretty much is similar
to run the diagnostic rechecks so your
selector administration server host the
same way you did with the run interpret
that nasty projects and provide the
right username and password and create
the unique fusion instance identifier
click Next
so during this process it will find all
the product families they belong to the
exclusion instance once the system find
all the product families close the
window and you will see all the newly
discovered product families under this
vision instance so select the product
families that you wanted to discover or
you want it to add on to your vision
instance you don't have to add all the
video and photo families in this step
you can just choose whatever
protofilaments that you wanted to add
and later on if you have have to add
more powder families that you can do
that by refreshing the fusion instance
so in this demo i'll choose couple of
the product families that i wanted to
add to this video instance and click
next step 3 is the final targets for the
product families that you have selected
make sure all the data information for
each product family is correct if you
validate the data then click Next and
you'll try to find the target for each
product families this step is to assign
the agents to the target those discover
for the fusion product family you will
notice that the agents are assigned
automatically as follows so if you are
okay with this target found and local
agents found for each product family
click Next and it will try to save all
the product family informations once the
saving product family has been completed
successfully close the window and you
will see the result of adding fusion
instance click finish this concludes the
demo of adding the fusion instance so
once you've finished all the process of
adding fusion instance you will come to
the field application home page and you
will find that the future instance that
you just created or be shown under the
target click the filter instance that
you just added and you'll see the future
instance home page this home page is the
summer review of your future instance it
shows the monitoring diagnostic
information ready target information and
that each target summer
re it also shows the status of your each
target and patch recommendations and
compliance summer as well and here on
the product family view if you click one
of the product family then you can drill
down to more detailed information of
your product families this is the home
page of the product family so in this
example we select a CRM product family
you will see the application
infrastructures informations and the KPI
and then topology of your part of family
so if you want to also drill down more
detail about the products under the
product family you can expand the
products tree and select the product
that you wanted to know more about it or
if you want to explore the your field
maneuvers day then click the web budget
to me and then click the serum domain
and you'll find the summary of your
métier informations as well this
concludes our demo of discovering the
future instance and explore the field
instance environment trillion discovery
process discover all of the targets that
are attached to the future instance
however there are other target types
that are not discovered as part of this
process such as business intelligence
identity management or a social network
Oracle HTTP server and web chat many
customer however want to make these
targets as if they belong to the fusion
instance Ian Cloud Control can
automatically added standalone targets
if it is registered as a proxy with the
discoverer domain in this section will
show you how to associate these targets
to the future instance please note that
this target needs to be discovered
already before we associate with the
future instance let's start of adding
this some additional product to the food
instance to start the additional
Association go to the vision instance
homepage and click the future instance
drop-down menu and click the additional
associations
here you have created on the create menu
you'll have a five different standalone
product that you can associate in this
demo choose the HTTP server for common
domain once the system found your target
and click select the target and it will
automatically associate this target to
your future instance and you'll find
this information under the WebLogic
domain as well so go to fill your
instance and monitoring and click top
weblogic domains and here you will find
the common domain for on HTTP server is
associated with our future instance when
you don't wants to add or delete the
product families under the discoverer
vision instance you can achieve this
goal by refreshing the instance to start
the refresh fusion instance go to the
video instance home page and click the
refresh your instance the steps for
refreshing vision instance is very
similar to discover in the fusion
instance for more detailed information
about refreshing vision instance please
refer to the white paper in OT n another
good aspects of freedom discovery is to
add out of box fusion service the
process involves of using Siri or aqua
88 synthetics quiz and then it'll
automatically deploy this screen into
the beacons you can also view this test
logically by instance for the family and
proto hierarchy let's start adding the
outer box vision service to add a fusion
service go to fill an application home
page click add and select the fusion
application service it will first find
the vision instance that you want to
create the service upon once it's left
the fusion instance click Next and it
will start to look for the service
hierarchy once it's completed close the
window from here select the product
family that you wanted to create the
service and test so we'll select if you
don't financial service
and go to next third step is to
configure the service as you can see
this table shows the service in the
hierarchical level from instance to
product family to a product level and if
you want to configure the test at the
instance level or product family level
then the same test properties will be
applicable to all the services you can
also add a new service under any product
family or if you want to remove certain
product service you can do this too so
let's start to computer service test
provide a username and password they
will applicable to the service there
will be displayed and you also have to
associate the beacons to your service
test so click add and select the beacon
that you want to run the service against
good okay
now that you notice that pair of melty
transitional has been configured but if
you also want to configure all of the
other services you can do so by clicking
the product family level and click
configure and also add it because
okay okay
as you can see that once you configure
under a family service level then all of
the soft services under the product demo
will be configured so now that you
configure the service test click Next
for adding target once the target has
been added completely closed the window
and review the result and click finish
the button here's the service that we
just created so we have a fission
financial service underneath we have
three service services payable
receivable and general ledger services
by clicking the product family level
I'll get the homepage of the financial
service and if you want to examine the
sub services underneath it let's click
the services that you wanted to examine
and we'll bring to the homepage of the
sub surfaces this concludes our demo of
adding the services there might be times
when system admin wants to wipe out the
whole fusion instance and here will
demonstrate how to perform the deletion
of vision instance to remove the fusion
instance go to fusion instance menu
target arrow and select the remove
target
when you remove the fusion instance from
the clock control that all of these
fusion middleware forms and all targets
associated with this vision instance
will also be removed if you confirm that
you really wanted to remove the fusion
instance click yes and it'll passi of
deleting the fusion instance enterprise
major toxicol control provides
comprehensive procedure for discovering
fusion instance usual can start with a
diagnostic pretext to check the record
steps are in place therefore minimize
the risk of failing fusion instance
discovery the discovery wizard provides
step-by-step instructions on discovering
feedin instance at the end of the
discovery the result page you produced a
report for any failed test with the
recommendations for you to address the
issue after system admin discovered the
core part of vision instance it is
recommended to explore other fission
application related products such as
application service to make the system
work proactively and add other oracle
applications such as bi or IDM tomato
oracle filium interested in consolidated
fashion please refer to the white paper
in OTL for detailed discussion of best
practice for amazing feeling application
we hope the screen watch helps the user
to discover the field and instance more
easily take you for watching this screen
