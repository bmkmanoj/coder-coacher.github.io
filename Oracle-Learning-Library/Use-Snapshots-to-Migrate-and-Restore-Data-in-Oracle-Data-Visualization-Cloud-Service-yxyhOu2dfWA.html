You want to save a snapshot of your pre-production service to a file, and then migrate the contents to a production environment.
A snapshot is an archive or back up file that enables you to restore your Oracle Data Visualization Cloud Service environment by capturing the application roles and the catalog at a specific point in time.
Application role definitions control access to functionality in the cloud service
and the catalog contains your projects.
First, navigate to the console in your pre-production environment.
Create a snapshot which contains the information that you want to migrate.
Enter a meaningful description that will help you remember something about the snapshot.
Consider taking a snapshot of the default configuration before anyone application role definitions.
Also, keep in mind that because you can save up to 10 snapshots, its a good idea to regularly back up your cloud service on a consistent basis.
Next, download the snapshot to your local file system and enter a password.
This snapshot is an archive file that has a “bar” file type extension.
Now, log in to your production service, upload the new snapshot that contains the service artifacts, and then provide the password.
Uploading makes the snapshot file available to the service.
You must use the restore option to make artifacts saved in a file, available in the production environment.
Generally, application roles differ between pre-production and production environments, so you may not want to include the application roles.
Restoring the snapshot completes the migration.
Be careful when restoring a snapshot as this can impact any users who are online in the cloud service.
Your production environment is ready to use.
In this video, I showed you how to take a snapshot of your cloud service, save it to a file, and then use the archive file to migrate content from a pre-production environment to a production environment.
