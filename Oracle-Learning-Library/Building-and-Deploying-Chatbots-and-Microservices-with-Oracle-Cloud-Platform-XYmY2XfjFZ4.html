session on building cloud native
applications where I'll be talking about
how to use a pis microservices and chat
box
my name is Sidharth Agarwal an iron
product management and strategy for the
Oracle cloud platform and you caught my
Twitter handle there so you know the
lives of developers are pretty exciting
right now because when you pick certain
technologies those technologies that
make it into production you know today
we're having to think about how to blend
different applications together how to
write applications with very small
release cycles so being able to release
within days or even hours we're going to
a paradigm where instead of having one
centralized team we're not having to
work in small teams which is great we
can release fast but then we also need
to be able to coordinate across those
teams we're going towards building
smaller components which are micro
services as opposed to writing
monolithic applications creating
engaging next-generation experiences
with chat box and then thinking about
API first design because you don't know
how your application is going to use in
the future
now as you think about building these
modern cloud native applications you
realize you're going to use polyglots of
multiple programming languages and
you're going to use micro services but
that's not easy with micro services for
example you have to think about
container orchestration scheduling etc
with API you have to think about how can
I catalog the API how do I secure the
api's how do I expose those API is there
developer portal devops tooling awesome
tools but then you have to manage you
know the installation of hudson or maven
chef and puppet the integration to get
so how do you manage all of these things
really easily and when you want to write
a chat part based application which i'll
show later on today you have to think
about how do i integrate with alexa and
Siri how do I integrated Facebook
messaging or WeChat or whatsapp and then
you know when you look at your
application in production you know you
don't you have the server less programs
micro services so you don't even know
the server topology and you have to get
data across the user experience
performance data and
the log analytics to get insight into
what might be happening so let's start
with looking at the example that I'm
going to use today which is this lady
called Jane and you know I know it's
hard for you to imagine me as Jane but
you know she has the mobile app and she
says she wants to watch the Warriors the
Warriors are doing great and how does
the stadium engage with Jane so for that
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you how first of all api's get
defined and api contracts get
established and then go into building
that API or implementing that api using
microservices and then finally consuming
the micro service around for example
beer or seats with a mobile application
and leveraging a chat bar based
interface or that mobile application
sounds like an exciting application so
let's look at the API piece first
I mean API is really critical because
you need to be moving really fast to
meet the user demand but as you expose
your API you need to be able to make
sure that there's security around the
API is because your business logic your
data your processes should only be
accessed by those who you want them to
access and then you want to get insight
into how are these API is being used
which api's have been used the most
so gaining visibility and insight into
these and Oracle has done is we built we
built a complete API design governance
management platform where you can
actually first fall design api's we
acquired a pack we acquired a company
called a theory and you can actually go
to a theory dot IO you can even do that
right now go to your browser go to a
period I oh and they're just for writing
a little bit of documentation we
actually create mock API is for you and
now you can give that contract to
someone and that person can test that a
contract and once they know that the
contract is right then you can actually
start the implementation of that
contract and you can test it in
whichever language you want in addition
we're giving you a platform where you've
got security for your API so we've got
an API gateway where you can have the
API gateway down in the public cloud in
the on-premise or within a third party
cloud
and then getting an insight into how
those api's are being utilized giving a
developer portal to be able to monetize
those api's so definitely check out a
period art io so here's how the API
platform works from Oracle so you know
an API designer works through a theory
if you read our i/o to design the API
and the folks who are implementing it
they go to a management interface on the
cloud where they can define policies for
how's the API is going to be used who's
going to use those API etc and then we
give you a gateway and a gateway can run
in different locations but here you're
able to have outbound requests going
from the gateway API policies being
implemented based on what the managers
had set and the applications that are
requesting those API s are now getting
you know fast efficient responses with
security across those API calls and as I
said you can run these across multiple
different clouds so now that you know
imagine that I've built that API now
what I want to do is I want to write the
micro service that's going to actually
implement that API so you know when you
think about writing a modern cloud
native applications you're going from
this monolithic interface or monolithic
application build paradigm to a micro
services architecture
and in a micro services architecture
what you're doing is you're taking small
elements of the business logic and put
it into putting it into applications of
its own and these micro services that
work with each other and the key benefit
of this is that because you're
externalizing the configuration and the
interface of that business logic small
teams can build those micro services can
release those micro services at fast
pace and so you don't have to test the
entire application before you can get
the micro service out so that speeds up
releases the speeds up implementation
and what we doing at Oracle is we're
building a platter we built a platform
that gives you a very quick ability to
build these micro sources so we're
giving you is the developer cloud
service which gives you pre-built
integration with git gives you Hudson
for continuous integration you can
obviously plug in Jenkins if you want to
give
you webhooks Bujinkan we're giving a
chef and puppet and I'll show you how
that works then we're giving you a
runtime environment where you can run
your applications be they written in
Java SE in PHP in node in Python and we
run those on a container based platforms
you can easily scale up and scale down
and then we're giving you performance
monitoring performance management and
API management so you have a complete
devops pipeline taking care of all the
way from development to production so
let's go to a demo off the cloud
capabilities here so let me switch to
the browser so let me go into my account
here we go so when I log into my account
I come into the developer cloud service
and this is live it's running off of the
Oracle cloud data center and I can see
the various projects that I'm working on
now as I look at these projects I can
see that you know the code what are the
elements of the code and I see that you
know I've got JSON files here the key
parts here are the server dot GS file so
here I can see you know the code that
has actually been written and then if I
go back I can also look at the manifest
our JSON file here which tells me that
this is a node based application using
version 6 of node and this could just
have been just as well up in a java SE
PHP application and all of this is pre
integrated with git and we also built
the complete issue tracking capabilities
in here so here is an issue that's
assigned to me it's a new issue about
building a micro service for code online
and here I can put in things around the
issue you know put in you know what type
of issue it is whether it's a defect
it's a feature it's a story or task so
my manager could also create some issues
for me and I'm going to the scrum that I
might be working on so I go into the
agile dashboard I can look at the active
sprints when I see the active Sprint's
here I see that here's me build this
micro service and I can easily drag this
over to say this is in progress and I
can update any comments on it so
immediately folks outside can see what
I'm worth
on and how things are going now you also
have the build aspects of it so I can
see that there is an Oracle Arena built
for that micro service that has been
written up and here I can see the status
of my bills how things have gone and I
can also click on the console you know
I'm a geek and I love to see all this
you know text that shows up on a console
so here I can see you know what's
happened
and eventually I can see that the this
was successful the build is very
successful so I go back here to the
build and now what I want to do is I
want to show you what are the various
things that we could do in terms of
being able to configure these bills so
you got you know the build parameters
out here that you can work with the
source control so this tells me where
I'm getting the bill from this is coming
from git I can see the environment in
which this is being done and the build
steps so here for example it's a really
simple build step but I can easily add
build steps here by invoking ant maven
Gradle etc their post builds elements
that can be set up so the lot of control
in how these builds it up now let's say
when I'm done with the build and the
build looks successful as you can see
here you know this was a successful
build then I can actually go and say I
want to deploy this application so all
of that is being done from this one
environment here oops I think I click
something wrong so when I look at this I
see that I've got the back end
application and that has been deployed
to the application container cloud where
all you're doing is you're putting your
code and the code is being deployed into
container base runtimes you didn't have
to worry about the runtime you didn't
have to worry about orchestration or
scheduling of the containers so when I
go in here to my back-end application
where the code has been deployed I see
the number of instances in the amount of
memory if I wanted to I could easily
change the amount of memory to four
gigabyte and change the number of
instances to three instances now imagine
what you would have had to do if you are
managing this your shop you would have
have to update the load balancer rules
we have a had to spin up new instances
it would have to have to deploy the
application
into those instances you would have have
to add that instance to the cluster
you'd have have to change the
configuration file to change the amount
of memory then restart everything just
by doing that and hit apply you we've
already taken care of all that under the
covers we're using docker and it covers
your code is containerized and you can
also define scheduling policies to scale
up and scale down so great that gives
you the ability to that shows you how
you can easily build a micro service
based application all the way from
development to deployment now let's look
at the next you know part of it which is
your line of business users is saying
look I want to have an amazing engaging
experience with my customers and so I
want to use box so what's happening why
are BOTS becoming important so today
everyone is downloading apps I mean I
fly a lot I download apps for Delta
United Lufthansa cetera and every time I
want to check in with a different
airline I have to bring up their app but
this is the reason why bots are becoming
very successful because the most popular
application on my phone is the messaging
application via facebook Messenger
whatsapp etc what I'd ideally like to do
is just be able to look go into facebook
messenger friend the KLM bot and say
check in and the KLM bot automatically
knows who I am and is able to know is
able to check which flight I might be
interested in which is probably the
flight within the next 24 hours and it
shows up the boarding pass and I'm able
to add that boarding pass to my wallet
there are two categories of bots these
days the ones that are very sort of
transactional where you know you're just
asking for your bank balance to be
updated but the more is a valuable a
powerful ones are the ones that are
data-driven and predictive where they're
actually using AI artificial
intelligence to be able to sense what is
it that the customer wants to do what is
the intent of the customer and to engage
with them in a much more intelligent
fashion and for that what we've done is
we've built the chat bot capabilities
within our Oracle mobile cloud
well once we pre integrated into Alexa
and Siri so you don't have to worry
about how to get the speech-to-text and
get
text into environment and we've also
integrated into platforms such as
Facebook so the beauty you don't have to
worry about how you get your bot running
in facebook then we've got a dialogue
flow execution engine so that that's a
state machine that keeps track of where
you are where the customer is in their
conversation we've got an AI engine
which is really there to be able to
understand the intent of what the
customer wants to do and then there are
custom components that make it very easy
to integrate this chat with back-end
assistance so for example in this
particular case I might want to find out
which seats are available in which case
I'm integrating to the backend my
inventory management system and asking
what are the seats that are available in
the stadium so let's go to the bot
demonstration and with that I'm going to
switch to my iPhone and show you the bot
experience on the iPhone so let me just
go to going to my art there we go so I
don't provide that's coming up okay so
that was not the right one that was my
Facebook page out there okay so here's
the the box that we've seen out here
so let's say I'm I'm Jane and I want to
find out you know with the Oracle Arena
bot I've just friended the Oracle Arena
bar dancing hello that wakes up the
Oracle Anita Park and they say hey
welcome to the home of the world Golden
State Warriors the world champion how
may I assist you
well what I want to do is I want to find
out when's the next game
you
great the
oh the box says a the next home game is
the Golden State Warriors versus the
Boston Celtics and you know what it says
it is understand the intent and saying
of some great deals and tickets for you
are you interested sure I'm interested
in the tickets I just answer yes and it
says what is your ticket budget you know
I don't have that much money but let's
say $300 and okay came up with a seat
wow that was pretty fast and it's
showing me what are the seats there are
different sections out here
Wow this section is really close to the
you know to the where the game is being
played and maybe I can do a high-five
with Steph Curry so let me pick this
this one right here section 114 for $299
so let's see
pick that okay please confirm the
selection well but if I use up to 99
that I have only $1 left which means I
have no no money left for beer and food
what that does is where you can go to a
game and not have beer of food let me
change this real quick okay here's the
list of these again which one would you
like
again let me just stick this time I'm
going to pick a cheaper one here 146
dollars but I might not be able to say
hi to Steph Curry but it tastes you know
I can use my binoculars to watch and be
there for the energy okay I confirm it
this time 146 dollars looks great and
now this box is you know too smart are
you running short on cash or who doesn't
run short on cash maybe will give me
some extra cash if I say yes let's see
what it does so yes I am running short
on cash
let's see okay congratulations what did
I win your special offer for you for $50
you can get to the Oracle VIP room
free beer ooh that sounds pretty good in
the VIP room from Oracle seems to have a
really good reputation then maybe stuff
will come hang out at the VIP room there
even it is called the Oracle Arena okay
so I will go ahead but let me just check
what kind of beer they have because
Budweiser and Bud Light etc doesn't cut
it for me
kind of beer
you
okay and ooh look at this
Guinness Pilsner Heineken lowenbrau okay
that's good that's good for me quickly
let's go add this before they change
their mind for 50 bucks I get beer and
food and the Oracle VIP Rena okay here's
my ticket looks pretty good yes quickly
generate the thing before you guys
change your mind this is good and go
ahead and add it to my generated
and there it is so that's a bot
interaction which is a pretty good bot
interaction here now let's look through
how we made that Bart interaction
actually work so we built in this the
Oracle Box platform one is the
integration so I already had the web
hook and the integration with the
Facebook so as a developer I didn't have
to worry about it next and I could very
well have talked to Alexa to do this
stuff as opposed to typing it in second
we have an intent classification engine
so for example when I asked for the time
of the game or the next game it started
understanding that the intent might be
to purchase tickets right and when it's
when we saw that you know you were
picking a seed for the lower cost maybe
that they could some do some upsell
across the let cetera then it has an
entity and traction capability built in
so that you know the entities are
tickets you know the entities are games
etc and you can act upon the entities
the seeds the beer and then you've got a
dialogue execution flow engine that's
built in which is using llamó where
we're maintaining the state of this
entire conversation so for example you
were to ask me what's the balance in my
checking account and then you say pay
mom at that point then you wouldn't have
to tell me pay mom from checking we're
keeping track of that state for you yeah
so these are all the things and the same
thing with the you know the bots that we
just created so let's take a look at
what that takes to build the bot out
here so let me go to my browser here and
let's go to oh let me just here we go so
this is the bot builder and you know
what I want to do is I want to go to the
Oracle Arena bot and I want to edit the
Oracle Arena bot so here you can see
here the various things that I can do
purchased is show a beer list etc you
can see a description of these things so
oh let me see here go to the bottom here
so here for example I can see I typed in
when is the next game and then I can see
the Bock engine is actually analyzing
what when is the next what are the
various things and what confidence are
is the intent so for example purchase
ticket is the intent when I asked when
it's the next game and there I can
either change the percentages here I can
train the bought engine or I can put in
you know log data from my previous
interactions or our customers
interactions to train the bots now here
you can see the various entities that
exist I move to the entity view there's
some entities that we've created for
example date number time etc but you can
also create your custom entities and you
can see out here purchase is you know
has synonyms of buy an order and ticket
as an entity you have synonyms of dicks
and tickets and when we looked at the
Bark before we were just able to put in
a you know when is the next game now
here I can also see what is the bot
actually doing when I type in when is
the next game so you can see out here
here's a JSON output that comes out here
is the response that would be a
delivered from the bar and here's a
dialogue flow engine the contract state
engine so here we've got various nodes
of code and we're able to define how the
you know dialogue flow is going to go
and this is currently written in llamo
and we're also working on making it a
very GUI driven engagement paradigm so
it makes it easier and then finally here
is the various you know integrations
that we've done so these are Facebook
you got slack you'll that LexA that's
already pre-built for you and if you ask
well how did you figure out the identity
or my identity on facebook messenger
we've built the three-legged OAuth with
Facebook so we don't actually get your
identity but we get a token from
Facebook that says yes this person is
who that person is and then you can
start using that identity so that shows
you how easy it is to build the box with
the bot builder that we have with the
bot builder
cloud service as part of mobile that we
have so let's come back here so you know
what what I've shown you today is the
overall platform that we have for
building applications cloud native
applications first of all the back-end
services so you can build your
application container or container based
services or if you've written Java EE
code you can have Java a web logic
running as the service in the cloud so
you can never Java EE based capabilities
in the cloud we're also working on
function so that you can have server
less computing available for you we
talked about mobile and chat pods so in
addition to chat pod within our mobile
platform we're also providing the
ability to get insight into how the
mobile application is being used giving
you insight into locations into where
the person is so you know how to engage
that person in real time now in addition
to giving you that the backend
application runtime environment we're
also giving you the ability to build
leverage you know to build front ends
either line of business users can build
mobile front ends by themselves without
writing any code or for example you know
you could use angular ionic different
mobile frameworks to build your mobile
applications we will also give you jet
which is the extension toolkit an
open-source extension to play with
javascript that adds in enterprise
direct capabilities of
internationalization localization etc
now you're doing this development you
need to have a platform that makes it
very easy for you to do DevOps so we
talked about the continuous delivery
platform that we're providing we talked
about the container based orchestration
that we're doing so either you can bring
your code to our pass platform or you
could take your containers as is onto
our is that form and we build
orchestration scheduling etcetera for
those containers so you don't have to
worry about that we're giving a
performance monitoring so you know as
you write your application today your
data is fragmented between the user
experience data the performance data
across web app database and the log data
what we've done is created a unified
data platform where all this data is
stored within that one platform and then
we build machine learning into the
platform
so you no longer have to tell us the
server topology we learned that from how
the transactions are doing what servers
they're going after you no longer have
to set the thresholds for monitoring
we're able to learn that between 8:00
and 9:00 a.m. this particular
transaction has this kind of performance
or response profile and if it is
different we'll send you an alert
etcetera so it makes it very easy to do
performance management monitoring we
built a eventing service because
microservices needs events etc so
instead of you having to manage after
fasters we providing that to you API
management I talked about identity so
for developers it's really important to
be able to think about how do I do
authentication and authorization as was
done with Facebook and then also how do
I provision users into my system so we
make that very easy with the identity
cloud service and you know Oracle
obviously we've been known for the
Oracle database but we don't want you to
think that Oracle database is the only
database that you can work against you
can work with my sequel we provide you
my sequel as a service so that's backup
patching etc is all taken care of for
you same for the Oracle database and
currently we're going to be releasing a
Sandra base no sequel service where
again you can see I want those sequel
databases but not have to manage the
scaling the back of the patching etc and
in case you're writing big data
applications we're also giving a Hadoop
cluster so that you can write a big data
based applications and all of this as
you write these applications one of the
key things is how do you integrate into
you know a back office applications like
the inventory management system or the
beer based API and so we're giving a
very easy way to integrate your
application with other staff or on prime
occasions and all of this is built upon
a very high-performance secure
infrastructure as a service where you
can bring any workload you want it
doesn't have to be Oracle workload we're
giving you bare metal capabilities with
nvme SSDs attached to it so your
performance is high we're giving you
network virtualization so you can bring
your own IP addresses as is so our data
center looks like an extension to your
data center and also you can connect to
it through VPC VPN MPLS however you want
to connect to the data center
now I said it's no longer just about
Oracle content we certified 500 plus
images that are bits Namie images that
now you can easily deploy on to our iOS
platform and we've also created a portal
called developer Oracle com where you
can see all the content that has been
created you can go access different
assets out there and engage with a
developer community that's pretty
vibrant and I would love to invite you
to experience the Oracle cloud we're
providing free cloud trials with $300 in
free credits at cloud.oracle.com slash
trial so with that I want to thank you
for listening in to this presentation on
how to build a micro services based
applications with API and being able to
create a very engaging experience I hope
you'll give the Oracle cloud a shot and
please feel free to provide us feedback
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
