console I create a session to be able to
add changes on my project first I add an
alert destination to capture a list of
recipients that can receive alert
notifications from Oracle service boss I
add my email address to the mail
recipient list a mail session needs to
be selected to send the notifications
I set the from name and from AdWords to
identify the email alerts in my inbox
the purpose of service level agreement
alerts is to inform the operations team
of issues relating to the health of
services services or the quality of
service provided I create a message
alert to send a notification when the
message total reaches a specific top
limit the summary represents the subject
of the email notification I select the
alert destination and change the
severity if the message count is greater
than 1 the service level agreement alert
is triggered pipeline alerts are
triggered based on message context
unlike service level agreement alerts
notifications generated by a pipeline
alert action are intended for business
purposes or to report errors Here I am
Korean an if/then action that includes a
condition to trigger the pipeline alert
the condition defines that when the
request includes Tom as the person name
some actions are executed inside of the
if then block
I add an alert action to send the
notification to the alert destination
this notification includes a custom
message built with a next query function
to concatenate strings
the alert summary represents the email
subject of the notification an else
condition is created to include a lock
action in case the if-then condition is
not fulfilled the lock message indicates
the name of the person who sent the
request
I save all of the changes completed in
the message flow the changes are
activated with the appropriate
description here I log into the Fusion
Middleware control console I negate to
my application home and select the proxy
service to test I execute a couple of
requests to trigger the service level
agreement alert one of these requests
include Tom as the person name this
triggers the pipeline alert I negate to
the service post dashboard where I can
filter the alerts by type I confirm that
the pipeline alert was triggered I
verified the service level agreement
alert is displayed in the dashboard the
alert detail is displayed when I select
the alert name I confirm the lock action
was executed with a proper lock message
in the WebLogic server console the email
of the alert is locked in the console as
well I verify that both alerts were sent
to my email inbox
the emails contained the same detail
information displayed in the dashboard I
can purge the alerts by searching them
in the alert history I search the alerts
by type and purge all of them at the
same time I can delete only a specific
alert if I don't want to remove all of
them and that is how to configure alerts
in Oracle service boss thank you for
