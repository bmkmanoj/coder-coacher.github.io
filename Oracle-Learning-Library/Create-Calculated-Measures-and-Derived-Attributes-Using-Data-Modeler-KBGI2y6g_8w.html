calculated measures and add an
aggregation level to one of the measures
which sets the grain for the measure
start by locking the data model a
calculated measure is a column that is
derived from other measures and created
by using formulas it can be either pre
aggregated or post aggregated a pre
aggregated measure is aggregated in the
database source table a post aggregated
measure is aggregated at run time I also
want to show you how to create an
expression that combines columns to
create a single column in a dimension
table this is called a derived attribute
create a calculated measure for average
order size and open the revenue metrics
facts table name the new column and
except before calculating because this
column is already aggregated use the
expression editor to create the
calculation for average order size
double click a column to add it to the
expression average order size is added
as a pre aggregated expression create a
second calculated item for average unit
price copy the column and then select
after calculating to create a post
aggregated measure edit the revenue
column and add an aggregation level for
the revenue measure to set the grain for
the line of business within products by
quarters select the levels tab to adjust
the grain use the slider for products
and drag it from detail to line of
business change the grain for time to
next create a derived attribute
sometimes you may want to see columns
combined in your reports and on your
dashboards you can add a column and then
use the concat function to do this the
concat function enables you to
concatenate or put two arguments
together you'll want this column to be
legible so add spaces and a dash in the
expression between the region and area
columns
then make sure the expression validates
successfully now that you've added the
derived attribute which concatenates the
region in area columns make the
individual columns unavailable these two
columns won't be visible in the subject
area when creating reports validate and
publish the model to begin using the new
columns the final step is to create a
data visualization project to view the
new columns select a subject area as the
data source expand the appropriate
folders and then select multiple columns
by using the ctrl key and drag them to
the canvas in this video I showed you
how to create two types of calculated
measures change aggregation levels and
add a derived attribute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
