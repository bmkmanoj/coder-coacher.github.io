transfer the first thing you see is the
Oracle managed file transfer monitoring
dashboard the dashboard has four
sections deployment transfer instances
source instances and target instances
let's look at the deployment section of
the MFT dashboard here is a bulk order
transfer entry when I select it you can
see some information about deployment
such as it was deployed twice and it has
runtime dependencies on the bulk order
FTP source and the file target with the
entry selected you can do things such as
unda ploy or disable the deployment if I
click disable it asks for some comments
I can disable this transfer temporarily
and I would do that if I know a point
will be down for some reason I don't
want to disable it so I will click note
back at the MFT dashboard I will look at
the metrics pane which you can reach by
clicking the dashboard link and I will
view the metrics for the last week here
is a view of all transfers that happened
in the specified time period
this shows the transfer artifacts and
not the sources and targets you can see
the most active transfers here and this
is useful if you want to see what is
taking up a lot of resources you can see
the payload file size the transfer speed
and the total transfer time which is in
average minimum and maximum increments
so using this dashboard is a good way to
see what percentage of transfers are
failing or succeeding additionally there
is a recent error section that is like
an audit log I will click one to bring
up the instance flow report there are
details available in this instance flow
report the icons here show that the
target has failed and the associated
transfer and source are in a warning
status the details show the cause of the
failure and a suggested action this
shows a Sowa target fail
this report is where our diagnosis or
root-cause analysis is exposed looking
back at the dashboard we have a
component called file finder where you
can see recent transfers you can filter
and search for files that start with MFT
this file entry shows its status and
that it's successfully completed the
source goes back to the same report that
shows the file name where it lives the
source name status and endpoint location
of where it came in you see that this
came in from an FTP server these are the
transfers that are associated with it
this is more advanced information about
IDs such as the user who sent it next I
will choose a file to transfer for this
example I use the Firefox FTP client but
Oracle MFT supports a standard FTP
client or a secure FTP client such as
SSH or SFTP it is important to note that
MFT uses the wls security layer or opss
and oracle identity management so the
MFT ftp users can be mapped to LDAP most
FTP servers authenticate using standard
operating system user permission which
can be a serious security issue I have a
folder that is set up for the transfer
notice that the file name is a XML PGP
zip file the transfer looks at all files
with a star zip filter and it compresses
the file and then decrypts the file the
resulting transferred file will be an
XML file now that the file is
transferred let's look at the active
deliveries section you can see the two
different targets so a target and file
target the intend flow of sending files
to two different endpoints is called
fan-out
if I click on the so ATAR --get I can
see information about the target
instance this shows the location the
endpoint and there is a target
pre-processing section that shows the
file was decrypted you can see this XML
file is what was sent across now I'm
looking at the Sohus wheat Fusion
Middleware control to see the so acum
posit you can see the flow trace and the
payload content the payload shows the
MFT wisdom contract which has an ftp
reference instead of sending a large
file as an attachment or inline you can
send an FTP reference which makes it
very small you can create people
processes that are faster and use less
memory the people process would take
that entire message and dump it into the
database in case it had to restart and
go back to a checkpoint in the people
process by keeping this small restart is
trivial to do there's a lot of
information in the payload file such as
a header file name filter used file size
user who uploaded the file link back to
the MFT console and more metadata that
helps with decision-making such as
manual task approval in the instance
view the flow trace shows the managed
file transfer clicking the MFT link
takes you back to the console that shows
the origin of the file the fan-out
symbol shows the file target and so a
target the summary shows an audit trail
of the file the file target shows the
actions associated with it and is like
an audit trail it doesn't show the
actions like decompress and unencrypted
the files reside in the filesystem and
the audit trail exposed in this console
is stored in the database the post
transfer notification shows that an
email was sent I can check my email and
see that the email that was sent has
things such as the file name user file
size source name like a partner name
timestamp and there is a detailed link
that takes you to the report so you can
view the source from isola composite ABI
process
or an email clicking the source transfer
link here shows the to target deliveries
file target and so a target back at the
dashboard the source instances is a
summary of all actions and shows the
most active sources and source
statistics and you can filter the data
you can use this to identify your most
active resources the graphs and numbers
are clickable links so you can drill
down to see the reports for more
detailed information the target
instances gives you similar information
so you can see the most active target
status and error ratio metrics
associated with the payload file size
and more you get a list of instances
here the type column shows that this one
is sent to an FTP target and this one
was sent to a web service in the left
navigation tree you can filter the list
it shows a report of all instances of
the transfer such as the bulk order
transfer it drills down to individual
files I can see the transfer and FTP
source I can see all instances of the
system going through that source and I
can page through multiple pages
I see dependencies the sources
associated with transfer and similar
metrics so we have coarse-grained
metrics in the dashboard but also the
ability to look all the way to
individual sources this is a really good
reporting feature so that's how you use
Oracle so a managed file transfer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
