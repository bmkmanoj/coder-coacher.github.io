stay here and go to that as well
tomorrow of course assuming you enjoy
which I expect you to your job we'll go
over who we are first and then we'll get
into more details of how everything
works and what we have so first of all
this is me shyla moog and that's my
partner and fish Bane and a little bit
about us for the past 20 years 20 plus
years I've been programming
professionally past 14 years I've run a
consulting company and worked mostly
with son Oracle later on and with
practically every operator and
manufacturer of any pretty much all
scales names you might have known like
Vodafone Verizon Sprint worked a lot
with docomo original device java based
devices that they produced I worked on
that project as well as other project
with those guys a member of the original
while stalker team a very important
member by the way that's a good inside
joke and also besides that what of the
time yeah never mind latest things think
that we've been working on was LeWitt
which had actually developed and i
joined it and all it can introduce
himself and then we'll go back to co
name one hello everyone my name is Trent
Fishman used to work for sun
microsystems now Oracle for the past
eight years or so seven eight years
during my time at Sun usually mainly
focused on mobile tools I teklet the
sprint wireless toolkit and for the past
four years or so I found it Lewis and
develop most of it with shy ok so that's
really who we are but let's talk a bit
about the problem because I find it's
the most interesting way of describing
the solution
well there's Java we all program java
I'm assuming that's pretty much a
pre-requisite for this room let you be
familiar with Java so what is the state
of Java on devices there's a form of
Java for android which is pretty good
actually on I'm all for having java and
is many devices as possible but it's a
different type of Java it's not quite
the standard Java you need to use the
Android emulator you need to use Android
tool chains which are good on their own
but it's within Android now the device
fragmentation on Android in my opinion
is a bit exaggerated there is a problem
but it's relatively minor especially
compared to the history here however
newer devices are starting to actually
create a problem there especially with
things like kindle fire and devices like
the nook where things they don't have
the android market and then things start
becoming problem and then real
fragmentation starts forming but that's
if that was the problem that wouldn't be
a big deal there's blackberry which has
a form of java is the form of java but
it's something it's j2me which is java
1.4 it's got all sorts of limitations
its version of j2me isn't very good its
own api is completely invented of its
own and it's one of the most i'd say
frustrating platforms to develop too
even though it's java supposedly it's
obviously a problem but those are the
good guys these guys support java the
other side now those are those horrible
horrible individuals that don't support
java I mean how can someone do something
so nasty so the guys with the iOS iphone
ipad desirable devices obviously there's
windows phone not so much but windows
tablet arty stuff like that well
Microsoft is a juggernaut eventually so
they'll do something and it's a valuable
and growing platform in that regard and
we want to get into those as well so we
don't really have any choice when we're
looking at that
we can develop for android that's great
but then we're locked in the Android
garden which might be wonderful but it's
that and as Java developers we can't
truly get the value of write once run
anyway which we've always had which is
one of the main things we've always seen
with Java well didn't really is the
right term here because we guys looked
at it and we said that doesn't suit it
we can solve that particular problem and
we believe we have solved it and the way
we solved it is the way the job always
solved this particular problem the way
it sold it in the desktop we just did
pretty much the exact same thing as Java
did in the desktop which is build the
entire stack for the developers and we
added some modern approaches that are
more appropriate for mobile device
programming that weren't available when
the original Java came out so we
reinvented reimagined I shall say Java
as it is as we always used it for the
mobile platform and we did that by
leveraging open source our entire
product line is effectively open source
and we made it free because lured by the
way which we developed is entirely open
sources will and we like doing that and
we got contributions from people and
we've got a major community so we just
took that spirits that community that
sort of development approach and we
merged into co name one now what is a
tree we'll start demo as the next slide
so I believe in showing first of all but
I want to say something about native
applications first so you'll have some
context of what we're talking about we
allow you to develop native applications
when I send its of application i'm not
saying like the phonegap guys say their
native applications yeah right you just
packaged HTML into an application it's
not a negative application it's an HTML
packaged into a local executable great
when we're talking native applications
we actually mean you can define a native
interface and invoke a coding of
active see and and embed the result
directly into your code an objective to
see obviously when running on the iphone
in c-sharp one running on Windows Phone
in dalvik when running under android and
I know technically when you invent an
embed dalvik it's not really native we
uses the word native hair to describe
the drop a language of the platform not
to describe see so dalvik for us the
java that's on android proper is what we
define is native hair so you can access
all the abilities of the device and
that's the important thing and that's
what we term as native so without
further ado let's show you what we can
do with these sort of devices so I'm
going to do the classic mistake of
actually showing you things live and not
record the demos and as you can see i'm
presenting this entire thing right from
my ipad it got white yesterday night
because Apple chose it as the perfect
time to send in an update by the way so
if something fails that design sold
everything this morning and from latest
builds and everything as you can see
we've got all sorts of animations and
stuff like that that you'd expect in a
modern application mmm ah you correct
I'm running ahead all the time I need n
to ground me here this is generally a
demo of how what sort of applications
you can build in terms of you I now this
is a relatively simple kitchen sink demo
we keep it simple and don't show too
much here mostly because we want to not
use the network or anything like that
see it was wiped so email doesn't work
now that's great as you can see
everything can adapt on the fly to the
theme of the device and provide also
very richest I you don't really see it
in the projector this theme is very rich
in terms of its looks very textured
that's it's got all sorts of shadows and
stuff
doesn't really properly pass through the
the projection here but as you can see
we can also show video embedded in place
and similar complex things like for
instance say cheese everyone huh damn
camera that's awful i'm sorry you all
didn't come out right but anyway let's
try making something that's really
matter let's show a demo within a demo
so him now is taking other devices and
he's going to show you those actual
devices running through our other demo
showing the exact same demo now notice
that here running on the android device
oh uh sorry thank you so now as you can
see when running on the android device
because the device is not a tablet he
has the UI's multi-screen unlike the
single screen you I you had on the
tablet and even more importantly the UI
adapts to the conventions of the Android
for in this particular case a like he
doesn't have a back button you know just
the scroll act and the way that it acts
an Android the title bar looks like it
doesn't android all sorts of things like
that that we lot of small or adaptations
now surely this is a service that was
lovely and I think I that's you know
that's why I said the live demo not not
a great idea anyway so that was the
samsung galaxy s let's show and that's a
nexus one yeah same thing only
gingerbread device slightly different UI
ok we can move forward let's show ipod
touch now here notice again it's an
iphone similar to this but obviously
here it has a that back button that you
you're familiar with in the iphone hand
isn't used to you
when I phone here we have a blackberry
obviously the coolest of us in the world
it's a very compelling device it's got
touch and here is one of my absolute
favorites the device that when it turns
itself into a screensaver loses its
network connection I kid you not this is
real this is entirely real this device
is going to take over the world with
that functionality but as you can see
that that's the actual button design
there that's not something we've
invented and this is a series 40 device
actually cooler amazingly then that
Windows Phone device an actual series 40
devices has four megabytes of heap I'm
not joking about that it has four
megabytes of RAM and it works rather
well and in terms of performance and the
things that can do so without further
ado I'm going to use the most elaborate
system of transferring to the actual how
we done it demo portion of everything so
the thing is up until now i showed you
okay what we can build in very high
level obviously we can build a lot more
than just a few things flying around and
it's going to show you how we did it so
here's that specific demo that we saw
earlier the kitchen sink Hannah's
running it in our standard skin ah
that's right he's running it to NetBeans
specifically we support netbeans an
eclipse as X on guys we're used to
NetBeans so we work with it it's it's a
habit I think it's also good but
specifically pick whichever as you can
see this is the exact same demo and by
the way he's running on Windows and you
notice that he's using an iphone I don't
know if you know to develop to our Apple
you must have a nap
machine you can't develop and fire from
without a Mac but here he has an iphone
skin on our from simulator iphone native
look running on his pc maybe you can
show us android development how hard
would it be no very hard to switch to
the android ok yeah yet you almost got
it wrong you selected the wrong in 34
seconds a occurs now as you can see you
can have it in a full full-size mode or
you can move to rotate it as well or you
can move to a scaling mode which is
sometimes more convenient to have the
skin scale do you get some drawing
artifacts but you can then work on a
smaller resolution display don't need
for instance for the iphone 4 you don't
need to have to buy a special monitor
just you see the whole screen it's it's
helpful sometimes when you when you're
on a trip and you don't want to carry
this around so anyway this is running on
the Nexus here and maybe we should step
into the debugger show some of that now
the kitchen sink demo is something we
hand coded because we wanted to show
sometimes developers prefer to hand code
sometimes they prefer to use a GUI
builder we have both we support both
both are great this specifically we did
by hand to show you how it's done to to
let the more coaches within you do that
will later show you how to create with
the gree builder same thing so here
here's that exact same demo running now
and here's a very point and as you can
see the code is really simple it just
adds an action listener if you're used
to swing awt all of that stuff he's got
a break point standard break point that
would you would get when working with
javis you notice the debugger is a
debugger you get from Java Sea not some
foam special foam for j2me or such stuff
like that you can inspect everything you
can see everything live can you change
skins to iPhone or something else that's
the Nexus skin is just huge anyway so
and live we can change the skins while
still debugging in the background it's
amazing absolutely now what's next we
moved in you yeah yeah great ah and
helps me help with memory thing it's
Cena anyway we're creating a new project
Thank You fine and here we'll create a
global de project where we define the
project name where it is all of that
sort of thing let's give it a name and
we'll just create something at the level
that works you should have done 12
actually there if yeah yeah oh it was a
good year but for Java once so and so
actually this one's better in terms of I
can tell you one thing it's better to
come as an onsen employee to Joe non
Oracle employee to Java one because we
get the tickets to the show lady yeah
they literally don't give us ticket
didn't give a stick it's lost here mmm
yeah food as well they don't give you
food you starve anyway so this is this
is a java project that we generate a GUI
builder project and as you'll notice
there for files here there's the theme
file which contains all the resources we
have you can also insert resources into
the jar if you want to although there's
a big benefit in having the resource
file it contains the actual theme CSS
lot
environment as you can see you've got
her hand can you reduce the size of the
themes area then so we can see ya great
where you can have actually the
selectors the data that you have it's
entirely visual and what you see on the
right here you can actually customize
the look of everything and what you see
on the right is a live preview of the
application that we've created actually
showing you can actually see the
application running here and when you
make changes in here you see this is CSS
like and its essence it's more powerful
in some regards we have nine piece
borders and other things like that that
you don't normally get in a in mobile
CSS at least and as you can see hun is
making changes right hand you can
instantly see them in the running
application now you can also open
simulator directly from here without
compiling or doing any other such
process and instantly see the changes
you can also run a device with a special
special application that we've built for
this and see everything changing live on
a device while you're building your
application right here so that's the
theme portion here let's show how the
GUI is actually built with the GUI
builder portion so in the grid will
build a portion you can actually drag
components into place now technically
later on you you'll wire them together
with swingline code so let's just yeah
great a button and let's call it
something javaone whatever and it's all
pretty standard stuff GUI builder that
you'd expect to get with layout managers
and everything that's standard with the
swing awt we improved on that a bit by
the way oh sadly not enough but we're
improving and there's an event tabs that
we can bind the listener directly to the
button now he'll because the IDE because
the binding goes to the griebel the once
you the whole add action isn't a thing
but we will see the actual callback
method here and then can just show a
dialogue here
do something like that now I apologize
this is a relatively simple application
but given the time constraints like I
said come tomorrow at ten to the
tutorial will show you a bit more of an
elaborate demo takes an hour and I think
and now in 20 minutes to just read
through the demo so that will be fun and
that's it that's a simple dialogue you
can get a Hello javaone everything ok
cancel and just let's run it and it
works on the simulator instantly you can
debug it obviously everything just works
now what do we do with that that's great
on the simulator we want to get onto the
device so that's actually the easy step
and just right click on the project and
you can right click yeah and he can send
the build for every one of the platforms
here oh and here he's sending a build
for ah someone didn't define a
certificate ah yeah it's a new computer
by the way just got it so among all the
things of losing the iPad we also had an
issue of installing a new computer so
Han can literally send the build for
every one of these platforms and it's
got a bit of an old version that doesn't
get include the Windows Phone that's
just launching now and once he sends it
that builds goes to our cloud service
which I'm going to talk about that do
the translation to the native code now
why do we need cloud servers here why
not just compile everything locally
because locally you need a mac and we
have physical max in the cloud to build
the iphone version we have physical
windows machines in the cloud to build
the windows phone 7 and the blackberry
versions and that's important because
you need to install like 20 different
things just to get everything working
properly and you need to physically
different machines to get everything
working so yes you can go to our source
code repository download everything go
through that whole set of huge steps
obfuscating and doing everything just to
build that native application or you can
just right click
and send a build for free we don't send
the source code I want to stress that
portion we send just the compiled binary
data now mmm over over secure HTTPS
obviously ah that goes I'd say it goes
without saying but it should be said now
this is the result of a build you can
actually get the APK download it and
upload it to the App Store it would be a
release version if it has a certificate
the the cool thing about this is that
every one of you can just pull out your
device and pointed there and install it
on the device survey like I'm I'm
expecting to see it like a a show you
know like in in the concert where
everyone lifts up their devices and scan
the QR codes I'm going to give you a
minute to cure arming androids what
everyone has an iphone ah thank you one
guy was saying word than the attack
right right so you can point literally
your QR code and install the application
directly onto that it's an impressive
application you'll get tons of use from
it as you can see but for something that
you built in like two minutes without
installing anything you just install one
thing our plug-in it's pretty cool and
it just works out of the box you don't
need to do too much about it and it's in
Java too far away we had our doubts if
it will work ah there's one yeah anyway
so that's really convenient you can
obviously download it and pass it to a
cable you can also press that small
email but until instantly sent directly
to your email lots of convenience sort
of things there in order to build a
natural native application now we're
going back to the slides right great so
let's explain a bit more what what we
saw there because I was running through
things pretty fast and mentioned the
cloud server and mentioned that stuff
there and I'm sure there will be
questions later and I'm going to try and
leave as much time for those questions
as well
so just briefly this is generally the
poor the parts left consists of codename
one now one of the reasons we call this
code name one was because we when we
started with that we needed a temporary
code name so why not find one and then
we thought you know after you find the
name you search for meaning for it so we
found the meaning foot we take these
separate pieces and make them into one
whole thing and we did take separate
pieces some of them we wrote some of
them open source communities wrote and
we unify them into a single solution for
all of us and the separate basic pieces
are obviously the API like you saw in
the terms of the UI it's small swing
like but it's a whole stack of API
networking storage cameras everything
you need and it's all integrated
together that means things like
observable streams so you're buffered
input stream is actually observable and
the progress indicator and the gree
automatically binds to it if you wanted
to that's the type of thing that we can
do when we truly control the platform to
that level there's the GUI builder the
designer that allows you to visually
build the applications there's a
simulator that allows you to work with
that and all of that arrives to you
through plugins we currently support two
major ID platforms I talked today with
the JetBrains guys we'd love to support
them to it's just obviously a lot more
resources as well but generally you just
install the update Center for on plugins
works that's pretty much it now this is
the interesting part the build server
allows you to just install that plug-in
do not have to deal with all the
additional steps should you do you can
if you want to if you want that extra
security you can do that we think the
value of having a build server rather
than actually going through all of the
steps to every one of the platforms in
the maintenance in the long term is huge
the
build server also lets you get back the
source code of the application if you're
paid subscriber by the way payments like
nine dollars a month if you take the
unlimited version it's free with a free
quota where one else because like I said
we're an open source project so we try
to be as free as possible and there's a
cloud server that allows you things like
analytics and stuff like that that are
really difficult to implement without
actually building server code so we both
a server code in a generic way and we
just let you interface to it you don't
need to if you don't want to and that's
a major point day now this is just a
subset of some of the features we have
whatever you don't see here we probably
implement it to some degree things like
SQL aren't even mentioned there so we've
implemented that as well and all sorts
of other things it's very complete and
if taking a picture then this is
probably the slide you take a picture of
because these are the resources you can
turn to now our documentation there's I
don't want to make it seem that sucks I
worked on it a lot we worked on it quite
a bit it's more than 100 pages of
documentation plus tutorials and videos
and everything as you can see we did a
lot of effort here we built quite a lot
it takes years to properly document and
build something like that with all the
tutorials all the paths everything we
can't possibly do that within the short
amount of time that we've actually been
on this thing alone so that is why we
spend an extraordinary amount of time in
the discussion forum trying to
personally help everyone there I
literally lurch there all the time you
can actually see my name on half the
posts there a marketing ninety percent
of the posts there and that's what we're
trying to achieve we're trying to help
you as a community to actually build
something whether you choose to take to
use our clouds over whether you choose
to work on your own and whichever way
we're trying to help
as much as we can because we believe of
the in the value of the community here
so feel free to ask questions criticize
or anything like that over there and
feel free to start with it right now
I'll go back to the previous slide which
is valuable but we're open for questions
as a mouth yeah i'm sure it will be an
instant hit that one specifically no
because then didn't include the
certificate day so that there goes the
fortune but if it includes yeah you can
it's we take no royalties nothing there
is i'd like to say one small thing we do
install a small call back to our server
on the first install to just attract
that there's an opt-out you can just add
a switch to the build and not give us
that information uh since we'd like to
just know how many people are using
applications based on that we'd
appreciate if you don't do that but
because we're open source we feel that
we must allow you to that transparency
okay we have a free quota every month
for everyone at three sets at the end of
every month so you get a hundred one
hundred build credits the that means up
to a hundred builds of practically any
platform except for iOS where it's up to
when you burn 20 credits with every
build now there's a reason it's really
really really expensive to host a mac
and the cloud you wouldn't believe it
how much money there's one company in
the world and switzerland of all places
really expensive and so that's why we
take more more credits from that but we
do allow it so and i know people opened
additional
our accounts and did all sorts of things
like that we and also just wait for the
next month worst-case scenario so beyond
that it's nine dollars per month for the
unlimited we don't make money off that
it's for us it just you know covering
basic costs yes I didn't care that yeah
okay oh good question good question uh
for the iphone you need specific iphone
certificates so the certificates are
something that's generated one time you
don't need to generate them for if we
build you don't need to generate them
for every application just do this one
time you do need the mac for that step
we usually point guys to mac in the
cloud where they can even log into a
remote mac do this one set of steps once
get the two certificates that they need
debug and production certificates use
them the rest of the things provisioning
profiles to flock that you can do
through the web interface you do need
the mac again to upload to the itunes
store those of you didn't try that
apparently uploading through the web
isn't good enough for Apple so once you
have your application complete you will
need a mac again to do that but
obviously you don't do that every day
and you can do your maintenance and
development through that and you can use
macs to the cloud just like that so we
want to simplify and automate that as
well by the way in the long run
obviously it's we've taken up quite a
lot of challenge on the way now you
wanted to say something yeah and the
plugin there is a setting there you want
to show them maybe that while I you yeah
do we support what no we don't support
opengl and at the moment we don't really
have plans to support opengl we that's
something that i didn't really mention
we're mostly optimized for applications
not so much for games so when some
people are using us for casual games and
study aids which are more interactive
but our general use cases or
applications like media and audio video
mapping business applications obviously
lots of stuff like that gaming which is
very 3d oriented and very intensive in
terms of graphics not so optimized for a
higher level level ap is at the moment
we don't since we have so much work to
do we don't have immediate terms plans
to support that yeah it's something that
I need to remove from the website
literally there's so much things to do
yet
oh okay okay oh yeah hmm yeah well
performance is a loaded question always
we find that performance problems off
and cross-platform just like bugs off
and cross-platform so once you build
your application two to three platforms
its performance improves across we find
that most of the performance issues or
things like people doing stuff on the UI
thread people not properly assigning
things to separate threads to models and
cashing in the proper way so when you
improve performance for one platform it
improves globally obviously there's lots
of stuff we can do on our side when
optimizing the iphone code today most of
our iphone code is very hardware
accelerated in terms of the UI but in
terms of the via implementation it's so
so our VM implementation is at the
moment very weak but that doesn't really
matter as much because most of the
performance bottleneck is the UI so that
we hand coded in objective-c and did it
very hardware accelerated so you don't
feel it as much you sort running on the
device so I'm saying if we can run on
j2me devices rather well the other ones
I mean how much megahertz is that a sure
thing it's a pretty fast gigahertz
what's fast full what is it the
gigahertz device okay we're running on
weaker devices in that as well it's by
the way it's his device thank you very
much thank you so much
gyro or sensors are geolocation we
support GPS and we support some sensor
information we don't give you the
fine-grained sensor at the moment
because like I said we were less
optimized for games it's something just
an API that we need to do it's you I'm
just generalizing that usually it's used
for games it's not true it's used for
some applications it's one of those
things we need to do one of the things
that I don't stress enough we allow
calling native code so you can call
objective-c call or any dalvik or any
other such API and you can implement
that sort of functionality that we're
missing and people have used that in the
past to contribute code to us and we
have received quite a few code
contributions just right now before
coming here again our community forum
just contributed the tcp/ip
implementation we up until now only
supported HTTP and HTTPS now we support
sockets apparently and we didn't write a
single line of code the favorite way of
supporting new functionality for in my
opinion I recommend it for everyone
anyone else yeah do it ah no we're not
nearly as good as java 2d java to diaz
very refined in terms of its support for
vector all the minut anti-aliasing stuff
and i had a long discussion with the
guys and support of JavaFX or things
like that the reason adobe is failing on
iphone isn't so much that apple is
blocking them from their internal api's
as much as the fact that they need very
refined vector graphics control now the
thing is that it's really really hard to
do that in a cross-platform way that is
actually consistent so we have some
graphics API you actually have a paint
and graphics and you can override it and
we have painters and wave styles and we
have themes and we have lots of the
things everything that you always wanted
to happen
we have it but our graphics object is
much simpler and most of our
functionalities in the higher level
components and in the theming and the
skinning and in that ability and we try
to stress more on on that level where we
have a strong multi DPI support strong
image board the support that sort of
functionality that we find is very
performance on all devices regardless of
device family and very consistent and
that's the huge value there when you go
into subjects are anti aliasing and the
device pixel the way the pixels are
organized internally the sub-pixels I
don't know if people are familiar enough
graphic geeks here it changes when you
rotate the device and during that in a
cross-platform way is technically
impossible so obviously Adobe wasn't
successful in doing that in a performant
way and no one can they cannot put flash
before there were phones like that and I
don't want to go into that ditch myself
so we'll improve that support but it
will never be nearly as good as jobs 2d
because Java 2d makes a lot of
assumptions that can't be made in a
performant way yeah you asked previously
sir oh well we have tens of thousands of
downloads it's I can give you the number
that we give to investors but it's
really a made-up number I'm talking to
engineers so you know it's one of those
or i can give you the we don't really
know because like i said it's a free
product people install it to an update
center we don't have an accurate counter
we know it's in the tens of thousands of
downloads there are thousands of
developers registered on our servers
sending builds working with the system
and the numbers of actual device
installs and things like that or
crossing the mayor pretty good six digit
number which okay go ahead again
reflection and what else Jane I okay
reflection we don't support we support
class.forname we don't support
reflection and technically if you'll go
out to say delva can android then you'll
be able to use that reflection over
there but within our vm environment you
won't be able to do that for the for the
foreseeable future and the main reason
for that is for instance on iOS if we
support reflection will have to actually
package in the entire vm and we won't be
able to obfuscate and remove rename and
do all sorts of things reflection is
great for development tools it's usable
maybe in some cases of EE and even then
they're trying to move move to byte
codes and stuff like that all sorts of
verses for bedded system for embedding
for small application you need to be
able to remove code to remove things to
optimize as much as possible and
reflection is a hindrance to performance
so I really don't want to support
reflection and technique technically
since we want to support additional Java
languages on top of this platform we
don't at the moment we might need some
form of something to offer to them and
reflection might be a solution there
obviously we'll have to pay that
ultimate price of size so I don't want
to commit that will never do it but I'm
hoping there'll be another solution at
that point that will be more performant
and more appropriate for mobile devices
what was the other question I generate
what we have is the native interfaces
it's not GNE I in any way because we
don't call to see for instance windows
phone doesn't have any sea layer on on
the iPhone you'd rather have objective-c
rather than see in terms of
the call and in Android you have C but
you usually prefer just dalvik and doing
your stuff over there that's the more
common use case so we don't support jni
it's just not available in all places we
support calling to native and in there
you can do the stuff whatever you want
you want to do J&amp;amp;I on dalvik that's
great you can but obviously we have
what's called native interfaces native
interfaces and as an invention of ours
which is a specific interface that
derives an interface called native
interface we recognize them on the fly
and we offer you you want to show a
right-click name we offer you literally
a right click on the native interface
where you can say generate native code
and you'll get a source tree with native
stubs for every one of the platforms and
you just fill in the blanks so for
Android you'll get a Java file but it's
a dalvik file for iOS you'll get
literally an M file for objective-c and
for C sharp ICS file and so forth and
you just stick your code in there and
you write whatever now it's not native
in the sense of J and I being native we
don't get that on Android specifically
which does have jni you can write J and
I but that's only within that particular
code that means when you write you our
vm you write in our environment and we
sort of sanitize it so when you're
running on Android you're running on
androids vm you're running on dalvik we
don't add a layer day but we don't let
you see it normally we you it feels when
you're programming on the pc that you're
programming to some abstract vm because
you're driveling to some commonality we
have there if you want to exit that
commonality you call to the native code
and then you get access to delve 'ok
when you're running on iphone then we
have our own vm because we don't have a
choice it has a garbage collection it
has all sorts of things sound set of
bugs but it's generally pretty pretty
much similar to that vm and we try to
give you the sort of
unified thing when you're running on
them we actually take your code process
it extensively and painfully and remove
all the Java 5 features from it so it'll
can run directly on the rim vm so that
we make that seamless for you in our
build server we make war of that effort
to strip everything and just give you
something that feels like a java 5 vm a
subset of java 5 because we want it to
be small and efficient still but you do
get things like generics and all the
stuff that you're used to and you can
still program for all the devices and
that's a general idea and I can get into
the technical details further but I'm
getting some yawns so could talk to me
later obviously that
as you as you notice that I didn't
mention html5 almost at all because
people constantly get confused people
turn to us and ask us are your own html5
solution and you know it's technically
if html5 is able to actually run this or
something that's of the level of j2me
then yeah then we will target html5 but
it's not even at the level of j2me in
terms of functionality things like
threads on the device I'm talking things
like threads mutable images I don't even
have mutable images properly the I know
I can't even use OpenGL there because
that doesn't work on the devices so it's
not there yet I can't target it on the
devices because it's not really
technically practical when it will be
hopefully someday when it's actually
html5 yeah why not well we can add it
right now I do want to add it for demo
purposes so we can actually embed the
live demo right now we can take our
application package it as an applet and
let people run it directly through the
web that works that's pretty easy to
build we don't offer it out of the box
mostly because of laziness from me i
need to actually sit down and write code
there and contribute him to contribute
someone anyway but i'm also one of the
other reasons is it's an applet people
hate applets it's a problem even if it
does give you an ability to expose your
application if it's an html5 and on the
pc html5 is a much better state than in
the mobile then yeah then that's a huge
use case and i'd like to offer that we
obviously support them bedding WebKit
let's built-in we have full integration
with the native web kit so you can in
theory just embed an html5 application
directly into our application don't do
that it sucks we don't give you any
benefit over you know just going with
phonegap so if that's what you want to
do that's why I want to use
at forum use phonegap don't use us don't
say you're using us because we don't
want to be associated with bad html5
applications ah and anyway so it's
obviously I think I answered the
question okay okay that's enough
identity yeah NFC okay the speed in
which the ad features is well a lots of
times people say you know they changed
you I and such in such way you'll do
that's less frequent there are new
features indeed like NFC and stuff like
that and mostly features that aren't
consistent for instance NFC is something
that is only on a few devices so
building it in is something okay we all
want to target that specific niche so
now for instance NFC is one of the
things that we didn't reach and like I
said earlier tcp/ip was just contributed
right now practically so sockets that is
we had HTTP HTTPS obviously sockets is
something that just got contributed to
so things are moving along all the time
because we're open source because we're
essentially a project-based like that
people contribute people can add things
and because you can access native you
can edit yourself in lots of cases we
just build stuff based on can demand
from users for instance SQL something we
really didn't want to do it doesn't work
on all devices it's inconsistent between
devices it's problematic and lots of
ways and we generally don't think it
belongs on the device but a customer
convinced us they just spoke with us
they paid us but that's a special case
there are cases where they didn't pay us
for instance things are progressing and
stuff like that let's hint you know and
we did it we just built SQL and it was
out and took us like a week to do
yeah and handed it so it's like hi it
was easy it was easy for me so so that's
just usually these things are pretty
simple to integrate because you're
generally interfacing to the device
capability ninety percent of the problem
is you I and there because we have an
extensible framework you can often add
your own widgets just thought you can in
swing and awt swing and swing didn't
have all the widgets that you need it so
you added them now the thing is with
swing a lot of the times you needed to
go deep and you couldn't because of the
long maintenance cycles from swing and
the fact that you needed the JDK
installed of that JRE on the user's
device to get updated with the new
changes from swing here everything is
embedded into the application so you can
make the changes and if we make the
changes you can instantly get that and
it's in the new version of the
application so all of the problems of
provisioning and swing and all of that
pain doesn't exist here so I think those
problems will always exist of some
disparity between what exists and but we
think I think we have several different
solutions here oh we allow you full
access for the APR we allow you
modularity of the APR and because we're
cloud-based we can instantly deliver new
features and we do constantly
jar the jaria the compound we read the
bar codes based on the specific platform
for platform we do something different
and it's not not as a it's not rocket
science what we do there is just for
dalvik for Android we just compile it
together with stubs that just call the
code and we have the libraries the api's
and ports for everything to every single
platform it's generally pretty simple
and if you sit down a bit with our API
with our implementation you can see how
it works it's not that complicated most
of the heavy lifting is done on the API
where we have the portability layer
that's the the big amount of code and
that's the the whole layer of the
graphics of all the api's for the
compatibilities and all of them pointing
to a single point porting layer which we
hand port for every platform and that
defines the commonality the differences
rather than the commonality between all
the platforms and the different
behaviors between all the platforms to
create that sort of feel of all the
different devices adapting and yet
feeling like a single device when you
program to them that's the heavy lifting
and that's pretty easy to see under the
server is just like vm stuff it's in
byte codes manipulation and sir you need
a subscription man yeah it's something
people do it a lot for most of the
platforms less so for iOS one of the
guys we as a habit say we don't support
you when you build outside of the build
server as a company not because we don't
support it but because we don't want the
maintenance we think it's a sort of
trial by fire to be able to do that
and if you know we'll give you hints but
we won't hold your hand through it
mostly because it's just really painful
to help you by users there who don't
understand the complexities of building
for iOS and actually trying that really
complex scenario and then asking really
questions where you literally need to
teach them everything so a lot of people
did find were a lot of people did for
blackberry lots of people did it for
j2me for iOS one guy did it that we know
of and post it in the forum other guys
sent build two builds to the server
downloaded the resulting source code and
ran it in the debugger because we do
release the source code that we generate
effectively what we do in the server for
iOS is generate this huge amount of code
in C and objective-c that implements the
whole thing in the native language and
you can just run it in Xcode we actually
use xcode we compile everything and sign
everything and do that whole process
it's it takes a lot of time to do that
and it's expensive on the servers but
once we do that for you we also give you
the source code if you're paying
customer oh nine dollars like I said
it's not for profit and you just
download it and you can then run it and
debug it and the reason i know people
did it is because they sent me bugs oh
yeah and the this and thus line and see
just fix that and you wouldn't know it
unless you did that specific process
obviously we'll need a mac for that part
of the deal
excellent ok let's excellent question
but first one great the barcode thing we
didn't implement barcode reading and
people asked us for it so I just use the
native interfaces and built a simple
barcode mo let's use the native
interface is based on Zach sing and it's
really simple it's one of our demos you
just use it and you get barcode scanning
just works and it uses native we intend
to incorporate that into our our actual
source tree when we have the energy to
actually do that just you know Matt of
tasks piling up so we do have something
then oh the applications there are a
couple of applications and iTunes tool
and that's pretty much it most of the
applications go to Android and rim and
stuff like that mostly because the
applications on you and because you need
to pay a hundred dollars for Apple sorry
because the platform is new and because
you need to pay a hundred dollars for
Apple which a lot of the developers that
are more amateur that or there at the
moment haven't done so you need those of
you don't know you have to pay a hundred
dollars per year for Apple to run on
your own iPhone that means you buy an
iPhone you can't actually run anything
on it it's not yours don't live under
the illusion it's only lent to you by
apple it's not funny it's really quite
sad and that's a situation so I hope I
don't disillusion you in that regard
that's building for the iphone you know
you just take your eye off a new plug it
in and just works with that you still
need to pay a hundred dollars per year
for them just to run a debug application
not to distribute it just to run it on
the device that's not something we can
control unfortunately it's Apple yeah
we use a garbage collector called Bowen
as technically the vm that was not
written by us was written by you I think
specifically was used inside there and
it does the actual work of the bytecode
translation am I correct by the way yeah
okay so he wrote our iOS vm by the way
yeah like I said lots of open source
projects in there yeah it's technically
a OT but really the specific code that
he generates is really it looks more
like a byte code inside will actually
look at the code it looks like a set of
byte code and just you know instructions
and so it's more like an interpreter
even though it's translated the code
that's mission critical the rendering
portion is handwritten by us and that
specific code is performance you'll get
the performance of a fast interpreter in
terms of the Java pure code running on
iOS we intend to improve on that the the
main issue I have with their specific
implementation is both the performance
in runtime but also the translation time
which is really long so when you send
the bill to iOS you wait a lot longer
than when you send a build for any other
platform so I want to shorten that
process yeah
that's part of our higher level that's
the full profit portion where we
actually charge much more force delays
and stuff like that guarantees ability
to install servers on your side stuff
like that that's the enterprise class a
subscription yeah we're going to make
money off you if and we're willing to do
so yeah bluetooth is in our pipeline to
do relatively soon we haven't yet issued
the Bluetooth again the native
interfaces that's an important one
technically that we need to we're
prioritizing obviously based on
requirements from you guys so we hear
stuff from enough guys and they're
banging on our heads in and do that we
eventually break down so it's but we're
getting lots of these bangings from lots
of people so don't blame us some some
people have stronger fists I didn't hear
that
okay oh it's huge it's literally huge
but today for instance i sent to build
most applications or six or seven
megabytes because we build both arms six
and arm seven but today are sent to
build are about to 20 megabytes
application for a really really small
application turns out i use the leather
theme which is really really rich and
then when I grab the photo of
essentially you need splash screens we
do that automatically for you you don't
you're not really aware of that but we
do that seamlessly on the server side
for you and because of the richness of
the theme just getting a picture in the
resolution of the ipad 3 both horizontal
and vertical took each one was four
megabytes in size because couldn't get
compressed enough so sizes balloon but
on the other hand relatively to the size
of applications on iOS no big deal like
I said we intend to improve that as we
go along sighs will also improve as much
as together with the build speed when we
get to that and I'll talk to you
afterwards I have some constructing
constructive criticism shall we say
anyway we're finished drawing okay thank
