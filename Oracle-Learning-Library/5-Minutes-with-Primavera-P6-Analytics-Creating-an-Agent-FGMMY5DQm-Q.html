hi I'm Scott with Oracle primavera and
today we'll see how to create an agent
in p6 analytics you can use an agent to
generate an automated alert about
project analyses dashboards or other
information click new and select agent
to create a new agent on the general tab
you can specify an agent's priority as
well as the user that runs the agent I'm
going to create an agent that delivers
an analysis of some of our quarterly
budgets so I'll set the priority to
normal and it's fine if i run this agent
under my own account on the schedule tab
you can set a schedule on which your
agent will run I want this agent to
deliver the analysis once a week and I
want the alert to be ready when I open
the application so all enable scheduling
I'll set the frequency to weekly on
Monday and i'll be sure to set the start
date to the Monday of next week at 12am
on the condition tab you can specify
condition that when met will determine
if the agent delivers its contents I
want my age into the liver its content
every time it runs so I'll leave this
alone for now on the delivery content
tab you can specify the content the
agent delivers within its alert an age
you can deliver an analysis dashboard
page full dashboard or briefing books
you can specify the format the content
is delivered in for example you may want
to deliver content as a powerpoint if
you want to edit data outside of p6
analytics when you deliver contents in a
certain format you can choose to deliver
them as an attachment with an included
note about the content for now I'll
leave this as the device default and
deliver the content directly as I want
to open it within p6 analytics I'll go
ahead and select my 2015 h2 quarterly
project budgets analysis for delivery
and in my subject field type an
appropriate title for the agents
delivered alert
on the recipients tab you can specify
which users will receive alerts from the
agent right now I'll leave myself is the
only recipient on the destination stab
you determine on what devices recipients
will receive agents alerts you can
choose to have the agent use the
recipients delivery profile or you can
override that and deliver the content to
a phone or email no matter what profile
recipients prefer this is most useful
for high priority content that needs to
be accessed on the go for now I only
want to access the alerts from the home
page within analytics so I'll deselect
devices on the action step you can
specify actions triggered by the agent
you can even set one agent to trigger
another agent in fact I'm going to go
ahead and do that I've already set up an
agent that delivers a labor cost percent
complete gauge view I'd like to take a
look at that too when my 2015 quarterly
budgets are delivered so I'll go ahead
and add an action specify my other agent
as a target my agent looks just about
ready so i'll save it and then take it
for a test run
you
back on the home page I can access my
generated alert looks like my other
agent triggered to and I have a quick
means of viewing my projects quarterly
budgets and labor costs percent complete
values that's all for now I hope you
