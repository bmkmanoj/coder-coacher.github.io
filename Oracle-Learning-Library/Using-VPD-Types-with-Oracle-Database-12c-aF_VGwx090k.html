for oracle server technologies in this
demo I'll provide an overview of of
policy types and their functionality and
as learning experience I show some steps
via first I create incorrectly a poil
time policy tested and then change it in
code executed correctly what do you need
to know about policy types you need to
know that the execution of policy
functions can consume a significant
amount of system resources and impact
your database performance you can
control when the policy function is
re-evaluated by specifying the policy
type parameter policies are dynamic by
default the Oracle database server
assumes that the predicate may be
affected by any system or session
attribute and therefore always execute
the policy function on each statement
passing and execution the policy
function of static policies is executed
only once BPD always enforces the same
predicate for access control regardless
of which user accesses the objects the
predicate is cached in the SG e and this
makes the static policies vary else each
execution of the same rewritten
statement can produce a different row
set because the predicate may filter the
data differently according to context
attributes or functions such as
sustained when the predicate uses the
sous context function and the attribute
remains the same the function call is
treated like a bind variable policy
predicates may be static for a
particular user session but different
for other users in some cases policy
predicates can change when certain
context attributes are changed within a
user session these policies are
context-sensitive if the namespace
attribute lists are not specified
then the policy function will be
evaluated for any context change within
the session not necessarily only for the
contexts related to a specific name
space and when you do specify the
namespace attributes list then the
policy function will be evaluated only
when any context within that namespace
list is changed within the session you
can manually refresh all the cached
statements associated with a
context-sensitive policy by executing
DBMS RLS refresh policy procedure the
sheer policies allow you to specify the
same policy on multiple objects now
let's look at one example of what you
don't want to do is the Security
Administrator you create a policy of
this type static this policy execute
only one in this demo we show you a
function that when a user logs in before
a given time they will see this context
and after that given time all salaries
less than 3,100 will be displayed maybe
that's not the most meaningful of
functions but we chose it to illustrate
the aesthetic policy connected as the
asst king user we test the policy and
you see that before the timeframe only
the one users being displayed so here we
waited after our chosen point in time
and you see that the the policy is not
re executed so we get the same answer
which is incorrect from the viewpoint of
our task let's change that as the
security user we first drop the policy
and then we created as a dynamic one we
check the system date again and create
our new predicate function considering
the new type as a skin user we test
again first by confirming the date and
then executing the query and we see that
King sees only his own record we wait
until after work audit time and X
cuting the same query you now see all
the employees salaries less than 3,100
so now that you've learned about policy
types we drop this policy this slide
shows your checklist of what you need to
consider when you design and implement
vpd solutions and in bloom you see how
this demonstration fits into the overall
strategy and workflow thanks for
