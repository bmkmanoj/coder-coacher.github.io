application using Java FX series my name
is Angelica said and I'm an Oracle
technology evangelist so let's start
creating an application that I described
in the introduction for this series
we're gonna start from describe from an
empty project I'm gonna be using for the
whole project a netbeans ide 7.3 8 a new
application Java FX FX application click
Next you can use any project name that
you want it I'm just going to use my C
up you can put it the location could be
anything that you want make sure that
the create application class is is
selected so this will create kind of an
excavator on for your application and
set as a main project so what it's gonna
happen if you have multiple projects
that are open at the same time the ones
that can execute a by default when you
click the Run button is the main project
so because we're gonna be using this for
the next step for the next exercises so
I do suggest you to select the set as a
main project so this would be the main
project and every time we hit them the
run the run icon we're gonna actually
execute this particular application
click finish and then we're gonna have
my very first Java FX application we can
expand it also we see the source
packages only one package and my java
application so this is actually your
very first java fix application so let's
run it and see exactly what it does so
we hit the run and again we have two
applications open the highlighted one is
their default one the main applications
this is the one that gets executed ok so
this is your first hello world kind of
application when you are creating your
java fix application you need to extend
for the application class so this is the
first line that you will see because now
we're back to java api as you actually
recognize the
method from java applications and we to
start there effects we use the lounge
method from application class we're
going to provide with any parameters
that you need in this case but before
we're just passing whatever we got into
java main call we just pass it to this
lounge code when you run your
application there are a couple of things
happening so we do have a stage here
it's called the primary stage this stage
is a top-level container for your
application
so everything in that window that you
see here is your a stage and then we
have what we call the scene and this is
your drawing area the drawing surface of
your application so any UI component
would be drawn on your scene that is
this white area right here so what we
have is we set the title for your stage
for your container in this case hello
world very simple
we create a button here in line 31 and
we just set the text a say hello world
and we define some events here so we
have your event what we're doing only is
every time you click it we're gonna just
print out something on the output screen
in this case it will be the console we
see more details how do you define their
events and the handlers later on in
these exercises supreme OSH you click it
and you will see the hello world bed
printed out in your console then you see
here that we have a stock panel the fact
panel will laid out all the components
in the back-to-front stack kind of
container and it will actually position
all those component all these children
following and specify alignment so it
could be in the center it could be to
the right or left is the predefined
alignment that you can actually set we
are going to modify this later on
because we do not want to have a
predefined position we want to actually
place the component as we want it so
we're gonna change the stack and we're
gonna turn it into apana we do that a
little later then you have your panel
and you add your bottom into your panel
so what is happening is in Java
your your component I'll actually render
using a scene craft so we have to define
who is the root for that scene graph in
this case it's gonna it's gonna be this
panel that we just created we're trying
to do is add a component into it and
instead of overriding the existing one
we need to get the current children's
for that route and add it into those
children so that's what we're doing here
in line 42 we get the children for route
and we add into dark children's the
bottom in this case it's pretty trivial
because there's no children's we just
created but is it that's the way we
we're gonna do it and then from your
state you have to set the scene this
drawing area and it's destroy an area we
need to give a scene and the scene is
created by passing the route component
the root element of the scene graph in
this case is gonna be my stack panel and
we just provide an area that we're going
to use for this scene right finally we
show the stage and this is what we have
here my hello world your very first
application so let's start doing some
changes so let's stop this and the first
thing that I wanna do I wanna get rid up
the bottom because if you remember from
the introduction we're gonna show an
image and I'm gonna comment out this
particular line as we mention we're not
gonna use stock panel I don't want my
components to be pre position or aligned
in any way I do want to have control
because we wanna actually associate bind
the coordinates of my image to the mouse
so we see that later so we're here we're
highlighting some errors and if I go up
here some of the inputs are no required
anymore so that's why they're
highlighted in yellow
so a NetBeans has a really nice feature
that is it will fix them imports for you
so you can right-click in the background
and select fixed imports it would remove
anything there is no necessary and it
will add the panel that we actually need
it okay so let's start defining the
components so we're gonna display any
so we need an imageview and we're gonna
call it c0 okay it's highlighting again
errors fix import right-click and you
just have it when the tool actually find
more than one class with that particular
name is going to provide it with the
different options make sure you select
the one that is under the same package
so make sure you have the scene image
image view ok selected okay now so far
my application is pretty empty so we do
not have any resources so let's create
here a package called images images
finish and one cool thing about NetBeans
is you had your favorite tops so let's
add your favorite so hearing your
project will have some options you have
projects you can see your file system
now you can see your services we're
going to bring some favorite that is
actually some pointers on some resources
that you use very often so you have them
handy so if I go to the window menu you
can actually select favorites and right
now I already have my JavaFX but let's
see how you actually bring something to
your environment so you have your
favorite you can right click to it and
you select add favorite it's gonna
happen is it's going to go to your
directory and you can actually select
which one you want to add it so you can
say added nothing's gonna change because
it was already there but the cool thing
is here you will see your resources your
directory that you mounted it here you
have it handy for doing copy and pasting
so here we have some resources we're
gonna be using so we have C 0 this is
the image see one another's image from
the same and kind of yellowish one will
have a shark that we're gonna be using
and we have the close icon so we're
gonna select all of them right click and
we're gonna copy those and I'm going
back to my project and I'm gonna paste
that in today
images okay so now we have all those
resources available in my application so
let's go back to my program and what
we're going to do is we're going to
clear here C 1 C 0 C 0 equal so we have
a new we have image in NetBeans you have
code completion so you can click
controller space and it will actually
provide you with the choices that is
starting this game with ima and we have
image view okay we just double-click
you're going to create an image view
provided a new image you can control the
space we do want to provide with a
constructor for this one in this case
and we want to provide with the input
string okay and that particular input
string is going to be the your resources
so we're gonna point to where C 0 JPEG
is so we're going to get resources so
the resources can be taken through your
class name so see app dot class you
select the class for your application
that gave resources as a stream and then
we probably provide with the string that
we need in this case we're going into
images as large and C 0 okay see we must
be missing something here so I missing
and that's it okay so now we create it
now we need to display right so we can
go back to the scene graph to route and
instead of adding the bottom we are
going to add Z 0 we're gonna leave the
it is the size of your window the same
and let's run it so if everything goes
ok we should see an image now so the
same window and then there we have we
have my image and I can actually stretch
these and you can see there is a pretty
large image
so the next step what I want to do is I
want to create a window I want to click
the image so you saw that is a pretty
big image so we're going to create a
rectangular area where you're gonna see
it through it so let's create that so in
this case is gonna be a rectangle a
rectangular area so they're gonna create
a rectangle and it's gonna call it c0
clip okay then again click some import
right-click again make sure you do not
select the AWT rectangle you need the
fx3 rectangle okay now we're going to
define it create a hit right here so
this is your roll clip equal new
rectangle remember control space and
okay and we are going to use this one
where we provide the size of my
rectangle then it's gonna be 300 by 2
toy just a little smaller than your
window then what I want to do is I want
my rectangle to have rounded corners so
I can do this but calling the method
saved arc width and let's provide it
with 20 and also they hide out of the
space it will actually finish it up for
you okay so pretty much does it so we
create a rectangle we set some
properties for that particular rectangle
now what I want to do is I want to set
that rectangle as the clipping area for
your image so I'm gonna take C 0 and
we're gonna say set clip should be one
of them methods and then it's gonna be C
0 clip onto the space okay so we set the
clip the rectangle area as the clip and
as the clip area for C 0 that is my
imagery and then nothing needs to be
added because what is actually being
displayed is the image field it does the
UI component so let's run it one more
time
and now you can see your application if
we make it bigger we only see in part of
the image remember we know the big image
is underneath we just seen through this
particular clip and we have the rounded
areas now I want to do something that I
love about JavaFX you can actually get
rid sometimes you do not want to have
this window around your application you
want your application to nicely blend
with your background so let's say I want
to see this window kind of floating on
my desktop so I'm gonna get rid of this
window and this black the white
background so what I need to do is of
course then we do not need a title for
this right we're gonna get rid of the
title and we're going to set the this
style so we need the style controller
state in its style and we're gonna use a
state stage style and there is one style
that is actually transparent so we want
my window to be transparent okay then
I'm gonna separate because I want to
have the scene that we're gonna use that
that that white area I want it to be no
I want it to be transparent I don't
wanna see any extra space if there is no
components I don't want to see that so
because I'm going to set some properties
of this scene I'm just gonna take it
outside here I'm just going to create it
so we're going to create the scene here
scene we're just going to create it
exactly the same right we don't need any
changes to 50 okay
then when we set the scene which is
going to use that one we just created
okay and what I wanted to is I wanna
change some properties of SAP that I saw
that scene and is to set the feel the
feeling and in this case is gonna be not
in that case that means I do
want to have any feeling okay so the
stretch we'll run it again I'm hopefully
we don't have anything around it so you
see that we call rid of the window that
we have and we don't have any white
background anymore just my component is
being rendered so it's good the only
problem that we have now is how I'm
going to close it so let's move into the
next exercise and we're going to play
with events to be able to close this
application that is already running
we're going to use NetBeans for that you
can see here in the upper window you
have this red area red square you can
clear it and your application will be
terminated okay so let's moving to the
next exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
