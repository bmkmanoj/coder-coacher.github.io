how to upload a batch of user account
first thing you'll need to do is create
the CSV file okay so to create a CSV
file you can use Microsoft Excel google
spreadsheets notepad textpad or it could
be some output from one of your
applications that can export users in a
CSV file format you need to have this
specific format and that is first column
be first name second column is last name
followed by email and then the fourth is
user login if you leave this blank the
system will use what value you put in
for email okay so for the sake of time
I'm going to paste in some users that I
created previously and so here I'm going
to spread this out for you as you can
see in some cases I've left user login
blank and others I've actually specified
a value so we'll compare how the system
handles that and then of course the next
crucial step is to save this in the
appropriate format so we're going to do
a save as other formats select save as
type I'm going to select CSV
and I'll click Save okay so you now have
your CSV file saved and you'll upload
that from the application which will be
the next step so log back into your
service as the identity domain
management console administrator
next step will be to navigate to the
manage users link here
and we'll click on load users so we'll
click on browse and I'm going to go
ahead and click on upload user 7 the
file I just created click upload and it
says file has been successfully uploaded
user records are scheduled to be created
shortly ok so this point we're going to
go ahead and wait until we receive email
notification that the users have been
uploaded ok so i received my user
loading completed email notification
from the application and it let me know
that a total number of seven records or
process and of those seven six process
successfully and more uploaded in one
fail and here tells me the details of
that failure for Jeff Allen and SNL
comma or could not be created in reasons
because it's not a proper email format
it's a comma here instead of a dot and I
did that intentionally to point that out
okay so now I'm back in my identity
domain management console I'm going to
go ahead and type in SNL as my search
criteria click search and here we go
there's one two three four five six
records as the message stated Jimmy
Fallon is one that's missing you'll
notice also that where I indicated a
custom user ID those appeared sotif a
Fletch Amy PO for instance otherwise
they defaulted to the email address
given so at this point I'd go back and
fix any errors but other than that I'm
all set so you've now successfully
uploaded your users today to any console
okay so what you've accomplished so far
is we've created your CSV file and
uploaded that to the identity consoled
all your users you received email
confirmation of the upload you reviewed
for any errors and of course if you have
errors go back and fix those and reload
or add your users manually and then the
next steps will be to assign roles to
your users and provide access details to
users so you'll need to send them the
URL to the identity console so they can
change the temporary signing credentials
and a link to the service so they can
actually get up and running and that's
it that completes this demo hope you
enjoyed it and take care
