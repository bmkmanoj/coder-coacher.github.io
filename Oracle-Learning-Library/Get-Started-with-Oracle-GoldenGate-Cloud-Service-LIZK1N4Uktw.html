service involves these main tasks
creating SSH keys so that I can securely
connect to my new virtual machines
creating a storage container in Oracle
storage cloud service for database
backups creating a service instance in
Oracle database cloud service to host
the replicated data creating a service
instance in GoldenGate cloud service to
perform data integration and replication
and finally exploring the GoldenGate
cloud service console for service
information for some of these tasks I'll
need my Oracle cloud identity domain as
well as the name and password of a user
in this identity domain
first I'll create my SSH keys SSH keys
come in pairs and consists of a public
key and a private key later when I
provision my VMs in the Oracle cloud
I'll supply the public key then if I
ever need to access my VMs from a
command line I simply connect with the
private key if I'm on Windows I'll use
putty to create my pair of keys
SSH keys can include an optional
description and the private key can also
be password protected first I export the
private key as a file
and then I copy and paste the public key
text into a separate file
if on the other hand I'm on a UNIX
platform or if I'm running a UNIX
emulator on Windows like cygwin I'll use
the ssh-keygen utility
you
next I need to create a storage
container in the Oracle public cloud
Oracle storage cloud is administered
through REST API
I'll create my container by using curl a
popular command-line restclient tool
that's included in most UNIX
distributions and is also available for
Windows the first rest request
establishes a session for my Oracle
cloud user
the response includes an authentication
token value I'll add this token to my
next rest request which creates the
actual storage container in the Oracle
cloud
GoldenGate cloud service requires a
running database for hosting its
replicated data so next I'll create a
service instance in Oracle database
cloud service be sure to select the
database as a service option when I
create a database cloud service instance
I can choose from several different
billing options in software releases
I also choose an appropriate compute
shape to meet the workload I expect on
this service instance an Oracle compute
shape defines the amount of virtual CPUs
and RAM that is available to the VMS in
this service instance here I provide the
ssh public key file that i generated
earlier this will enable me to remotely
log into the database vm by using the
matching private key file
I'll pay particular attention to the
database administrative passport I'll
need to know it when I create my
GoldenGate cloud service instance the
Oracle cloud automatically backs up data
from my database instances and older
backups are automatically moved to my
storage container I simply need to
provide the fully qualified name of my
new storage container along with the
credentials I used to create it
after my new database instance is
provisioned and running I can move on to
the next task
now I'm ready to create a service
instance in the GoldenGate cloud service
first I need to name my new GoldenGate
cloud service and give it a proper
business description so later on my
co-workers can also identify it I
provide the name of the same public key
file I created earlier so that I'll be
able to remotely log into my GoldenGate
cloud VM by using the matching private
key file
before I create my service the wizard
shows me the version of Golden Gate that
I'll get on my virtual machines
next I need to name my replication
service VM I focus my description on the
source and target databases I also
select a computer that meets the
workload requirements of my replication
the replication VM needs the connection
information to the target database I
select the database cloud service
instance that I created earlier and
supply the credentials to connect to
this database
you
now my new GoldenGate cloud service is
being provisioned and they can
periodically check its status
after my new GoldenGate cloud service
instances up and running I can access
its details
for example I might need to find the
name of the replication database service
instance or I may want to copy the
public IP address of this VM so my
source database can connect to this
instance on this page I can find any
detail I need for my service instance
in summary I use my GoldenGate cloud
service console to create new services
search for existing ones review failed
instances
and delete any unwanted ones
thanks for watching this video about
getting started with Oracle GoldenGate
cloud service a companion tutorial is
also available that documents all the
steps I just presented welcome to Oracle
cloud
