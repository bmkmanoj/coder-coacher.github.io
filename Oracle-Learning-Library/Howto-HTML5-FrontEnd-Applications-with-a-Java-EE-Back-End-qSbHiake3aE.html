let's start so this is our safe harbor
statement today I would like to talk
about why is html5 relevant first a
little bit and then dive straight into
one application case a little bit about
us I'm David this is John or JB we
bought from Oracle for last several
years we've been working primarily on on
tools for developers for you guys
now why is html5 for other ones and
especially how does it fit into Java
Enterprise story like there are many
honest with stupid questions and
probably what html5 means
so I would like to I would like to
answer it by quickly looking at a day
like quickly looking at the history of
software development one of the earliest
projects I work on looked like this it
was system from 80s it was UNIX server
connected with text terminals the only
reason why I'm mentioning it is actually
very similar to the only reason I'm
mentioning is that this is very similar
to to current web model basically
everything runs on a server and it's a
browser or text urmila in this case
which displays stuff from a server in in
90s when with cheap pcs this the text
terminal solution wasn't like sufficient
enough so it got like it people uses had
wanted to utilize the power of the PC
wanted to use their Mouse graphical user
interface and a locally connected
devices like printers so so and this
started for me like a period of writing
native Windows applications and biggest
problem of this of this solution was the
lack of out update like any when you had
a problem and you need you to patch it
you would have to manually walk around
all your 50-100 workstation it was job
for said all day so later the native
native solution got sort of superseded
by the browser-based solution and
because everything runs on a server
again you don't let out a bit problems
it's actually what I find interesting
it's very similar to that model from 80s
basically everything runs on a server
and browser displays data
one other thing I would like to which is
worth to mention is a method of look and
feel the moment you start writing native
applications they strong push to comply
with look and feel for the operating
system and and for some reason like for
some reason this was never never issue
for for web applications like how I used
to be criticized a lot then when we used
to write read client application that
the java application don't look like a
native windows applications but with a
browser-based solution nobody ever
complained it for example Gmail when you
run it on your laptop on a gonna which
runs on the windows it doesn't look like
a native Windows application and my
point of looking at the DC story was
basically to show that what we
experiencing now is actually not dead
not that different from what happened in
1990s that we have new devices you like
at handheld devices like tablets and
iPhones and and these devices have new
features like geolocation or touch
touchpad or camera or different sensors
and basically users expect that their
applications will run on these on these
devices so what what that means for us
we can we can either start writing
native applications again but the
difference from 1990s when Windows very
quite dominant operating system is the
fragmentation these days you have you
have iOS you have Android your windows
and different devices around different
versions so it's really unless you love
writing one application three times then
it's really quite difficult choice so
what are other other options other
option is to evolve web and that's where
html5 is it's important because html5 is
a step towards this goal to to turn like
a web into bright ones around everywhere
platform their html5 allows you to write
web applications which can run without
server in a low flying mode or you can
talk to device specific capabilities
like I said sensors like geolocation
things like that and
and also you can store data locally in a
browser in a form of database or some
other format so as Java programmers
which I assume most of you are we are
familiar that with bright ones are never
always safe like a promise but it's
definitely doable it's there will be
challenges use it or complain that our
applications don't look native enough
but then we may be may follow it or we
may not even try to make them with
native or for example with new latest
greatest api's there may be we probably
will be always little behind and it's
like a web-based solution but then it
depends also an application which which
you are we are writing like for
enterprise applications which are
primarily about data and forms I
wouldn't think that's a that's a problem
so now so so it's great we have html5 we
can write client applications and but
our current web applications are written
on a server side and how are we gonna do
it how for example if you write things
like a part of your application which
run offline from a server or which
communicate to like a your device camera
how will you write it on the server side
that could be could be not writing on a
server side could be writing on a client
and that's I would like to do one quick
recapitulation of a web application
development like it all started with
static pages internet used to look like
just like the Kapadia and then we came
with going to use the dynamically
generated pages and by dynamically
generated pages I mean I mean pretty
much everything from CGI celluloid JSP
JSF and this sort of model solution has
the problem that the server is really
like a server is in charge of everything
like whenever browser needs to do
something it needs to talk to the server
and server generates the response decide
what to do next and so obviously this
server is like a potential bottleneck
and crippled application responsiveness
there are a few other issues like we
need abstraction from a low-level HTTP
protocol defected on a server the data
are sort of mixed with video
presentation template and sent to the
browser also means that the
such a such a output from a serie is not
like a cable the browser always have to
keep asking for for example even for the
same page again again so over the time
we came with the build lots of
frameworks and they helped us to sort of
more carer or so so solve these problems
and work around them but unfortunately
none of none of these frameworks is they
got quite complex over the time but none
of them can claim to be like a king of
all frameworks later into use Ajax into
this to to make pages little bit more
responsive and basically the exchange of
data from a browser to the server is not
limited to request request and response
cycle but page can ask for data but the
model is the same the complexity is even
increased by the HX and now if you
imagine if you put into this into this
like a support for offline web
application I think it will get even
more complicated so there should be
easier solution now if we look at it
from a company from a scratch and and I
think there is like if when we look when
dynamically generated pages were
introduced it was it was in the time
when broses we're like a fairly immature
and so we had to do like a most of the
things on this server though but that's
been a long time ago and these days we
could move some of this stuff for myself
and do it on a browser and make sure
early doing it for for example with Ajax
we do little bit of templating on a
server then the page goes through
browser and browse it through HX or
JavaScript talk to the server and and
just a little bit more templating so why
not to move everything from a from a
server to the to the browser now this
may look like I'm just sort of shuffling
things from the left to the right or not
on my picture but this change actually
is like I have like a fundamental in
plication for application the figurative
templates are static and are on a client
means that means that client like
browser can be very responsive it didn't
have to visit all it needs for my server
our data and apart from the interaction
will use it can be really like very
sponsored the other thing is that
templates are like static files they
done don't need to be generated by the
service so that means that these static
files you don't even have to add them on
a server you can have them locally and
that's where
that's what we actually need if you're
going to write the offline web
applications to be able to have that
page like locally and develop on it like
that and one of the server benefits from
this arrangement as well especially in a
performance area because server doesn't
have to do doesn't have to hold session
data which belongs to the brows in a
first place
server doesn't have to generate the same
sort of template again again for the
client so so I think overall this would
be like significant significant
improvement now I think this in a hoof
theory or history and let's let's dive
into my application ah I wanted to use I
wanted to use an existing application
and just give it a new new front-end so
one application which I found which was
written by my colleague from the beans
is called a fable beans and it's a let's
maybe show it first so if I run it let's
look what it does so it's this simple
shopping cart application there's few
few departments you can click on a dairy
Department but get it milk and eggs view
your shopping cart and proceed to
checkout this is just I don't have like
certificate for it and then you fill out
a bit and make a purchase so it's simple
application like that and it's quite in
detail described on a on a on our on our
website is a tutorial so you can you can
just google a fable beans and you'll
find it it's a regular EE application so
it's using there's a MySQL database then
they are JP entities for it I don't want
to sort of spend too much time showing
you the source code but there are JP
entities then there are ejbs which
manipulate GP entities and troy heaven
used in age map framework he used
directly JSP pages and brought his own
set of led which does the transition
from page to page so now if we look at
the application and decide to write a
new client what we will need will need a
you needed data from service so what
data is going to be so it will be list
of these products
you can create a page and after the card
is after usually put something in a card
we'll need something to make to make it
to make it check out to make a purchase
now how are we going to get the data
from from it from a server to client
there is lots of options you can use
Bristol services we can use WebSockets
we can use service and events and the
old appends but what body or your case
is like in this case we just really need
to like a receive the products from a
service and later make a purchase so we
really stressed it all the rest for
services but if you need it by the
actual communication between client you
could use WebSockets or if you want want
to be notified a synchronously that
something changed some other user change
something on the server you could use
server sent events to to send the data
through your to application ok let's
let's look at the rest services I
haven't - your services your department
service and purchase service I won't go
much in a detail how you write web
services but I would like to talk just
about this one a little bit so this
service for given category it it
responds with with a list of products
and I specified it I want this rest
service to produce a chase
Jason response because Jason is really
easy to consume am I on my java skill my
on my browser so there's a format that
the encoding of my or encoding they say
that the format of my choice now in a
signature of the method I'm using this
product
Jason class which is which is here which
is like simple simple Java wrapper I
could have used directly JP entities
because I have JP entity for products so
I could use the demise signature but I
think this indirection this wrapper
around the JP entities gives me like a
more flexibility it also depends how
you're going to use it a rest service if
rest service if it's public rest service
then the contract is basically API
contract whatever your service generate
so you want to maintain that contract
and you can't break it in the future so
having this wrapper allows me to sort of
develop in evolve JP entities
independently of it and into
my wrist service number occupation to be
different different different interface
because it just prepared I haven't
bought it to writing Gator status I just
put a few public fields and I have
control what all gets and code encoded
from JP entity into my chips and
response now other question is how the
question you should be asking is who and
how encodes the the Java object into
this jason stream and that depends on
what implementation of jax-rs
specification you using in my case I'm
using GlassFish so in glass be using
Jersey so I will be talking primarily
about Jersey checks are a specification
has this HPI where you can when you can
which implementation can implement and
provide different encoders so if I look
at Jason recommendation they have they
have several I would say too many
different ways how to how to how to
encode the DJ's and a poacher way chucks
be way with four different notations and
a low-level approach so let's look at
how these differs but first how do you
how do you set up how do you configure
any application which Jason provide is
gonna use be used and again Jack's
specification says that you can either
enumerate resources and providers you
want to use any application or you can
just let jax-rs to scan class path of
the application server any application
and whatever it finds it will use or
then there are if you in my case in a
Jesse case I can use proprietary way to
XML so let's look at let's look at that
I will use this playground project and
so here's my application subclass and
I'm in American city I'm in American
resources sites I specified it I want to
use Department service in a purchase
service and then later he later here I'm
using I'm saying that I want to use
Jackson Jason provider which is which
corresponds in a Jersey terminology to
that poacher forger one I'm using cost
for name here only because I don't wanna
have compilation dependency on a Jackson
library but I know that in run time it
will be there so it's a little bit like
okay way to do it so let's run this
service and have a look what it produce
so let's test it this is okay because I
need to specify the they category so
this is one output now let's have a look
at it if I if I comment out my
enumeration and open this in a new
window so now just by just by letting
Jiggs RS to scan everything when it
spots on my class but I could complete
different jason encoding and the reason
for that is that jersey by default you
prefers to use juggs be encoding so
that's something to be aware of and if
you if you look at it i if you look at
it is like few differences for example
in numeric values like integer or or
price are injects b ches encoded as a
string which i think is nonsense this
doesn't make any sense this similarly
map in the left example i can map maps
really well to Jason because Jason is
basically just like map it's a property
value map so I would think that it
should map to Jason really naturally but
in this jerks be case there's always
like a map entry key dollar type things
which so choice of choice of a encoder
you use is up to you and I guess if you
write in client and the server you can
you can decide and you can you can stick
with it but you should control which one
you guys use I mentioned it is other way
the proprietary Jason way
Jersey way
to configure this and it's via WebEx ml
if I open my web external I could now if
I want to use Jersey Way I could now
completely delete the application SS
class and just in my in my cellulite
also in my web.xml I'll come in this
section and use and I'm specifying that
I want to use directly the Jersey
servlet container and through its
specific parameters I configure I can
configure it and tell it what to do so
for example he's a attribute to specify
packages to skin so I specify my rest
package so only the purchase and a
product service will be found and then
we are this attribute POJO mapping
feature which I'm setting to true I'm
saying Jersey used it Jason I think now
again really use Jersey or jax-rs let's
up to you but there's one good reason
which we may need to use a Jersey
proprietary way I personally would
prefer to use non proprietary way
because then the obligation was portable
but in this case we may have to wait
till till checks RS to to help us and
that reason for Jersey is a same origin
policy same origin policy says that your
page video JavaScript can access only
resources from the same domain in the
same port and same protocol so at first
sight it may look like a reasonable
reasonable and but if you imaginary have
some public rest service then basically
same origin policy prevents you from
from accessing that resource similarly
in our case I would actually want to
have a glassfish which are on my server
side having being separately for my
client which are developing locally so
same origin policy is very restrictive
in this case so how do we bypass it over
the time there are many different
solutions for it it will work around
solution there was JSONP using iframes
but the way to go is to use cross-origin
resource sharing on course
course is a specification which which
all current browsers implement and the
specification basically allow allows
browser to ask server first whether but
if it's remote resource it can ask the
server can I access you even if you are
remote and the server can decide to
answer yes or no this answer is is
implemented with wire on a server side
where you have your servlet run herb
server which is behind your rest
services that service needs to sort of
specify few headers and they're all
prefix by this access - control - ello
and through that you can control which
origin can talk to your rest service so
you can in this case I use I I give
anybody can access me but I could
specify certain host the similar I can
control which methods and which headers
can be called so
all right thing in this part I think we
are getting to the end with the service
side so I think at this stage we have we
finish this service side we edit to rest
services we configure them to produce
the JSON format which we want and we
also allowed them these mysteries to be
called from anywhere or maybe one thing
which I forget to show you guys is
actually how to do this course stuff too
and this is the way why I have to use
jay-z because jax-rs specification
current doesn't allow me to configure
the headers but in jax-rs to the zero it
will be possible so for now I have to
use Jersey API which is a container
response filter and I'm implementing it
to setting these headers and then in my
web.xml I in my configuration of a
service container I specify this
parameter container response filters to
use and I specified in my one so this is
how I doing it to Lee Jersey
so this is our server side
ready before we move on to the client I
would like to say that in NetBeans we
try to make this really easy for you so
whenever you creating like a new rest
service you are given choice value wanna
you j0l jax-rs way when we generate any
code we pre-configured a generated code
to use that simple JSON that simple pojo
jason provider again you can change it
similarly with the course cross-origin
resource sharing filter we have a visit
switch just create this all for you and
edit to WebEx and automatically so now
let's move to the client this is if you
are server-side program like me this
like going to the client is one
fundamental problem right now and it is
dead on client there's no java this only
HTML CSS and JavaScript and it may
change but right now that's all what
there is and I don't know how what do
you think about just gave it about my
experience until recently haven't been
very good like I might be also prone to
I tried first time a long time ago and
and at the time tooling wasn't very good
you would write some JavaScript code you
would run it and nothing would happen
the browser wouldn't do anything and
also didn't tell me about any errors and
I had no idea what's happening similarly
the lack of compiler it's really
interesting when you're trying to learn
new language and you don't have compiler
it's like a what I what I wrote is it
doesn't make sense the Java skippers
it's just complete rubbish
so compiler actually that would help if
there would be some and similar lack of
documentation but I think this is all
passed like if you look at if you look
at JavaScript today that's it's real
actually as a language it's not that
different from from Java it's not any
more about writing this index page where
you have like a script tag into which
you place some some JavaScript it's more
it's really about you can pick up from
dozens of much it doesn't but there's
lots of MVC frameworks JavaScript MVC
frameworks you just pick one build your
application on the poor fit the
framework give you everything what you
would expect from a VC framework and
then they're like a dozens of a really
good libraries to use you like writing
unit tests well there's no reason why
you couldn't do that in JavaScript
there's good support for writing unit
tests and the stability
tools are getting better and better
it is excellent just give debugger so I
think these days javascript is very yeah
it's very different and I've been I must
say that writing writing the client part
in javascript is actually it was really
refreshing it's like comparing JSF
server-side programming with Swing Java
swing programming it's not a complete
different models and yeah I found it I
found it quite quite
yeah quite quite enjoyable and let's do
that let's let's look at the client side
the MVC framework which I build my
application on top of it is angularjs
and it's MVC framework it's really good
MVC framework it is this super magical
dependency injection it was written from
a scratch to allow unit testing which i
think is really excellent idea if you
write unit tests you know that to write
unit this is really easy but the setup
around it is sometimes the most
difficult part so
solving some of these issue directly in
a framework that's this really good idea
and and it's probably more let's look at
application let's look at the
application so the application itself
basically it looks very different and
it's primarily because for styling and
layout I use their base for supply base
I choose one which is named bootstrap it
was done by by two twitter employees in
their spare time and it's I think it's
really good library and but apart from
that the portion will look it does the
same there are these departments you can
you can add something to card here the
top the number of items in my cart
updates I can go to the card see they're
all there I can proceed to checkout and
I can make a purchase so application
does the same as if you look at there
are a few differences were to talk about
this if you look at my URL it's run to a
s server but it is really lightweight
say we just serve the files or it
doesn't do any server-side processing
everything is basically local now the
templates as I say the templates are low
cost and only only communication to do
server is done to fetch the data for my
list of list of products so once these
get once these get fetched the
application is really responsive so if I
add something to the card if I go here
and if I remove something from card it's
like it's responsive as it gets other
thing to mention is the layout I'm using
the bootstrap fluid grid layout which
which follows the web responsive
principle
so they layout adjusted it to the size
of my like a viewport
so if I if I'm here find like a maximize
you can see that images get a little bit
of boobs they're like images get a
little bit bigger if I make it smaller
they get smaller if I make it even
smaller the previously horizontal layout
changes in the vertical one similarly if
I go to list of my products the here the
layout is that it's a menu for choosing
the category and then this list of the
products so if I if I make it smaller
the menu moves above it if I make it
even smaller the image is start scaling
down so this old what I got for free
basically just by using the bootstrap
bootstrap library now let's look let's
look into the application how I
implemented in but one thing I wanted to
say that the layout is implemented
actually using the css3 and and all that
media queries
let's yet it's like it's worth the note
and ok now let's look at application I
think even if you are not Java
programmers or JavaScript programmers
which I think you are chore forgiveness
what all of you most of you I think even
if you're on a Java program is I I think
you will appreciate it a set of this the
beauty of the other simplicity of the
application and its beauty Hey so on
client I'm running everything a little
bit bigger I'm running everything it's
just an index.html page which an ID I
have I have here this this head part
then this this little menu at the top
that black line at the top my menu bar
which would be in all pages and the the
most important stuff the the body of my
page for that in my index.html
I just specify this displays holder and
ended ng ng - view that's a directive
from angularjs framework which says this
is the place where you will be putting
some sort of templates
it's yeah and let's look so somewhere
else I have my templates I have a
template for the for the for the
department which is playing really
simple HTML now how does the framework
knows which which which part which what
to put into the body of the page if you
look at the URL the URL has the this URL
part the index.html and then it's
followed by the fragment by the dead
fish part starting with a hash that's a
fragment and if I look at the products
you can see the fragment change into
Department / 3 if I put something in my
card and go to the card it goes to the
slash cards so that fragment part allows
me to bookmark the pages and get to them
if I need to and also it drives what
page is going to be used here in a
JavaScript folder I have one file where
I'm configuring where I'm configuring
angularjs route provider and telling him
ok if you fight fragment of your list
Department / some number use template
partial departments and it's template
it's going to use Department controller
now let's look at let's look at the
department controller that's the one
which we see if I'm if I'm here so
department pages again I think it's very
simple this is just this menu which was
the left side and on the right side
there's the list of products so how this
is implemented is that army I'm
basically saying in angularjs through it
ng-repeat directive iterate over all
products and for each product generate
the line of the of the table and now
these products but it is how does it get
there if you if you remember his are
still yeah here's our JSON and basically
the product will be this JSON debate
came from a server this will turn in the
jaws cabinet like adjacent objects and
we will the list of these JSON objects
will be what's in the in the in the
product so in my temple
I can refer directly to whatever it is
that is named a price and I'm referring
it to hear this no other conversion is
to say to done no nothing else let's
look at our essential part behind the
template and there's the controller
whole code for my department controller
is this one so the dollar scope the
products did this MVC thing it's really
it's really confusing because there's so
many different interpretation what MVC
and MVP and I don't know all these all
these other acronyms but an angularjs
again their own view what they say is
view where they say model but for the
sake of simplification let's say that
this code dot product it's just model
and it's and so I put in my product
model I call this shop query which is my
service I will get to the services in a
second so I'm calling this service to
basically talk to the server written
list of JSON objects put them in the
products and then that's it and I can I
can show them I can show them here I'm
not doing basically anything else if you
look at on my page there is that up to
Cart button so the button is done on
this line is basically just button where
I'm saying if user clicks it call method
up to card from my controller and give
it this product product which is
represented by that line
so again very simple in my in my
controller
I had to cotton method it gets the
product from the from the front of you
and I call second service called card
and add product to it now let's look at
these services i one thing i like with a
video angularjs that it sort of gives
you this sort of by default template and
until and it gives you certain like a
layout and with certain files and tell
you controllers which put into
controller JS services you put in a
separate file and it makes make sort of
little bit easier to start and structure
the files initially so if I look at my
services basically this like a little
bit bigger this
is my this is my shop service I may look
a little bit cryptic and I still
struggle with it a little bit being a
new to just sort of new to JavaScript
but if you look at it it's very simple
it's just URL ended by giving this
dollar resource method which is from
angularjs by giving it a URL for my rest
service that's all I have to do and
client is able to then to talk to my
rest service and do all the updates both
get and everything but I need one thing
you can see here I'm giving it a string
string name shop and I mentioned it
angularjs have the the dependency
injection and I found it really almost
like freaky like a magical ever but by
by giving your service a name you then
the way to get it injected in your
controller for example one of the ways
is the idea you just specify the name of
the service in your method signature and
and angular JS bill injected
automatically so to me from coming from
a Java committees is like really weird
because this there's no such a time as a
shortcut but but it works really well
it's quite powerful one other thing I
haven't said about services the the
angularjs basically treats the services
as a as a singleton ejbs they you know
you just you don't manage the lifecycle
you just get it injected and you just
define a service and and the framework
takers about the rest my other series I
have actually three services so it's a
shop one which talks to my one service
then there's a purchase one which talks
to the other service and my third
service is the shopping car which is
which is like very simple Java Java Bean
which is list of products and a
listeners I it's my shopping cart so
items to it and it files
events and notifies listeners as you've
seen here so if I want to add something
to the cart just called card add and for
example that part which here at the top
which shows the number of items in my
cart that's done through this cards that
is controller which air
which I just say card a listener to it
and when the listener is notified it
files for it updates the model it says
the the model your either empty or you
have some items on it I think this will
be probably as much as I wanted to say
about angularjs and yeah overall as I
said I'm not a JavaScript convert but I
found it really easy to sort of
comprehend the project how it worked
it's really easily readable if you it's
it's fairly short and it does it works
really it's a good yeah it's it worked
well so there are a few other benefits
writing it not in Java but in Java which
are obvious probably like I didn't have
to compile it no I didn't have to
package it I didn't have to deploy it I
didn't in this server because the the
client is separate from a server sever
business logic I think it's good it it's
sensible thing to do to separate your
business logic from a UI on the other
hand a7 duplication data validation some
validation which you doing on server you
still have to do on a client and you
have to do on board ways to make your
applications like get defensive now to
make it really easy we've been really
busy at NetBeans and what we did with
7.3 7.3 release which should be
available sometimes today maybe tomorrow
is that we provide a full support for
writing this html5 applications this
there's too much to say but I would say
that JB it's going to have a session at
3 o'clock which will even go into detail
with it so if you wanna if you wanna if
you want to know more you should you
should visit it I may just depending on
the time which I think we still had we
still had a good time so let's just
spend few minutes on showing maybe few
other things which I which we did in
NetBeans so
so you may seen a little bit of it on a
key note what we did is that we
integrated tightly the external browser
to Chrome with a with ID so for example
if I'm in my controller and I just write
here some sort of nonsense and ah maybe
that's too much nonsense and I press
save at the moment when I save the files
in an ID they automatically get reloaded
in browser as you can see at the publish
that NetBeans IDE support plug-in is
debugging this tab this is the the
feature of Chrome that chrome basically
tells you you shouldn't use native
Chrome's inspector and debugging tool
because NetBeans is doing it for you so
and unfortunately you have to keep it on
if you close it that basically disables
this communication between ID and a
browser so what hopefully they will get
it a bit sooner you can at least close
it or minimize it but so I saved my
javascript file
I got reloaded here if I now click in a
category nothing happened is something
wrong if I go to IDE I can see that here
is that my browser log and here I can
see that AI is not defined at this new
department I click on it in and I'm
decorate the place so I can I can really
quickly figure out where the problems
are save them page code reload it now it
works if I want to debug what up to card
does I can just put a breakpoint here
click up to card and I'm ID
I can I can hover over it and see what
what product I'm what product I'm adding
so debugging is really easy
that should help as well oops I did run
and I mention unit testing I didn't look
into this let's let's spend few minutes
or on what spend few minutes on that
sorry I should do dead eh knife because
otherwise it'll stop Oh unit tests let's
stay with it control I have one unit
test en what I really like that as I
said the setup is really easy so for
example for my my unit test I can say
that if if if the angular JS frame out
gets this URL that my code is calling
that URL instead of
talking to the server just mock it up
and responds with this data and then
later I can hear below test this data
better but it is but it these data
arrived from a server already total
words and all these things so it's
really that's really that's releases you
can mocking for example that you can you
can part of the framework you have like
support to deal with separating your
unit tests from from remote resources
the the unit tests actually with javis
communities if you're interesting how
you run them and there are probably many
ways and one because this final
application you run it in the browsers
you are in Chrome and Firefox one of the
ways which we support now is to run the
unit test directly in these browsers and
that's done through to integration of em
something which is called jstestdriver
let's some open source project what it
does it starts the server you connect
browsers to that server uninvited I mean
that you open a special tab in that
browser and connect to the server and
then the server sort of can send your
JavaScript to these browsers they will
execute it they will collect collect the
results and send it back to their to the
server and we show it an ID so in this
case I'm just going to use let's say the
Chrome as a browser can start it it
should start it should creddies this is
the sort of slave top which now I just
ignore it and it just this diversity you
think it was cool on just this driver
that I'm running on Ubuntu but JB's left
of the window so he could just open his
internet explorer and basically connect
to my server if I gave him my my my-y er
Ola and then his internet explorer would
become another's life and I could run my
unit test on it and then what I need to
do is just to yeah just test run test
and it should have been on the
background and when it's finished how I
get out come here it was run only on
Chrome otherwise I would see all the
other browsers and I think this will be
probably
probably everything from me if you want
to know see more this lolly styling and
lots of other things go to the JB
session and the application I wrote I
put it on a big bucket so you can you
can have a look at it is both
server-side client-side you can come
look at the source code have a look and
yeah that's pretty much all from me I
think so guys we have questions let's
let's go for it
so again please what are the
alternatives to use the easel pretty
much what easel was designed for was to
kind of emulate what you do in the
browser tools today so if you're using
Firebug here you're using chrome
developer tools or something like that
you can get a lot of that same looking
field adjustments and so forth but from
the CSS side of it and then you cut and
paste whatever changes you made back
into the source code we try to eliminate
that with education allowed me to do
that in source as far as the JavaScript
debugging and things like that there
yeah I don't really know there are other
tools out there to provide some
JavaScript debugging but we implemented
it in a way now that hasn't been done by
some that have done but not in the way
we're using that debugger is actually
using the remote WebKit debug directly
into weapon so what the information we
get back is coming from the browser
itself
we're not parsing it ourselves we're not
trying to figure out what the source
looks like we're actually getting it
from the browser live and then just
doing the rendering I don't know
no no this is just one so the question
what is what we think about html5 versus
JSF or Java FX and those things we will
JSF die or whatever absolutely not what
we're really looking at is evolutionary
time they there are multiple approaches
to get to the end solution we're not
even talking here about native solutions
you could be and what about PhoneGap and
all these other things that you can do
for native it's just a time where
there's there's a lot of ideas and a lot
of concepts and we're trying to make
sure that within our tooling the job
developers have those options to try
different things to meet the needs if
you're a contract I mean give you your
contractors out here with you managed by
show of hands how many times does the
customer tell you that you're going to
use a certain technology for client
versus server or something like that
yeah all the time so that's really what
we're trying to do here when I setting
up you have to go do it this way we're
trying to say that these times are a
very fluid smoke out of time and if you
have to use CSS and html5 responsibly
our studies are showing that responsive
web design is not only a trend it's it's
most of the designers that are out there
doing this for a living feel it is the
Munich period so that's we're working
with in trying to go that direction but
it's it's one option of multiple things
that are out there right - all right
jobs always keep that in mind and I'm
going to get this behind enough yes yeah
so html5 is kind of a buzzword these
days it really is the reality of what
most people call html5 is css3 and
JavaScript be honest html5 itself has
elements of new tag structures it has
you know WebSockets support and all
these other different server side bends
that kind of stuff is definitely html5 I
don't think there was really no no I
don't think there really
I would think that they will work on
different yet the bill the angular JS
bill around as a framework so they build
around on all the different browsers but
when it comes to checking for certain
like a features of a browser data other
libraries there's like is it respond
this some other levees which they feel
you can which can test you better did
feature is available in a browser and
you can write these ifs and write it
this way yeah there's lots of yeah yeah
yeah so what are the things with the
whole supporting browsers not supporting
browsers I mean quite honestly we chose
WebKit so I put an easel it was our
integration we're actually integrated
directly into the into the WebKit API so
we use Chrome and then there's also
using Java FX what you and your hip with
it based as well and so we have an
internal browser that you didn't show
here I'll service after noon but that
that tight integration works with those
browsers chrome you could probably use
Safari we haven't done a lot with it but
you probably could but if you wanted to
go run it off the fire box or someone
that it'll run the page but you won't
have all that information and then live
freshen refresh update live CSS there's
all kind something son so you have to
kind of stay there we're looking at
moving into those other things and this
afternoon I'll show a few more things
about graceful degradation and so forth
within r2
tips there's documentation within
documentation is icon you would probably
support that so if you're starting to
use a CSS thing it's not supported there
or it'll show you alternatives we help a
little bit but we don't do it directly
something that's been requested and we
may do it inversion but we had to go
somewhere with version one question in
the bathroom yeah it's just simple a
matter of your on your on your source
debug it in Chrome you have to figure
out what it is and then go back over to
your source over there
really honestly you know when we do
usability studies and so much that we
got people that hate IDs and they
perfectly comfortable in the browser and
that's your world live with it and go
what go there you know that's fine right
to a read job again we're just trying to
eliminate that whole cut and paste stuff
that so many of us soon through seven
years you know I love to browser tools
don't get me wrong they have great
capabilities they writing everything
down and figuring out you change things
in your CSS to make it look pretty
perfect
currently yes yeah yes yeah so there's a
lot of questions a lot of desire to see
that show up in PHP there's desire to
have that capability show up inside of a
JSF PI already got a job - yeah we're
looking into off being able to do all of
that but in the first release yes
that's one of the html5 API is that you
can you can basically API to store the
data in in a browser and the I didn't
show it but it's like yeah just you just
it's just so simple daddy I didn't show
it really sorry can't really can't
really comment with this one I really
don't know but as long as it's in a
browser yeah oh yeah yes yeah jQuery is
about like am i think jQuery is more I
think Jacob is little be like html5 to
Jake raise everything but jQuery I think
I I is a Java server site programmer I
think to me is just something for like a
visual effect could put things together
while angular JS is more like a MVC
framework which give you modal view
controllers and how to variety
application of the structure but if you
wanna for example my application if I
wanna something like I have some sort of
visual effects then I would use jQuery
for it maybe I maybe I'm too harsh on
jQuery but it's sort of just one of
these like bases you get that's what
angular just does for you I remember
there was the Modell part that Dora
scope and then the Jade angular JS if
they have that engine and there'd be
automatically whenever you change model
in a Java Script it automatically
refreshes the view there is real it's
quite it's quite incredible in there and
I would just go to the website and it's
like lots of really good examples how
they do it how it works
yeah
rest services are by default they are
stateless right so you could catch the
risk I would out this the definition of
the rest services that you could you
would catch the request for the data you
all that static pages that index.html
which I had it on the templates they
could be all cash because they will
change only when I put a new version of
applications they will change once and a
half a year maybe once in at each month
so this all could be like a cached and
beep be static yeah that's I would say
that this is like a low-level browser
issue browser doesn't filed Emma back
that you saying you use a browser you
are not very efficient you keep
retrieving the resources from a server
which are not necessary which you should
have all in your cache so I sort of
delegated to the other domains program
but yeah you could look at it probably
in the in the inspect tools in the
network panel and see what it really
does but just plain good application I
can see yeah it just yet I think it does
the job I actually started with backbone
and I really liked it fit was my first
year Hey look at it this it is really
evolving a lot which which is quite nice
on it that is always something new
happening and people are really
passionate about it's really vibrant
community around JavaScript and well for
example at Java Java frameworks is I
think it's settling down and calming
down there's not that many new Java
frameworks I guess be settling down on
Joseph but I had a look at lots of them
just read the forum's and a big bowl and
try a few of them at a big board oops
backbone I like the most because I think
it was the least sort of it's a library
which really it's easy to integrate with
everything else it does you it does only
what you tell it to do and which is good
but then also this disadvantage that
when it comes for example for templating
you you can pick any templating engine
e1 and it's suddenly trying to use the
unless these handlebars and underscore
and all this and I found it yeah I think
the backbone is mandated more
then when I angularjs is I think the
version 1.0 was released maybe like
three months a few months ago and when I
look at it I was I was really impressed
with it because I thought they put all
these things together they tighten it up
do you have less flexibility maybe you
have to like fit bits in that framework
but a framework with us does think so
well that I yeah that's why I basically
dumped a big bone to be to be honest but
it's it's a wizard that you if you have
a running rest project so you have the
source code to the rest project you can
run a wizard that will generate a
backbone NBC off of your rest will code
it inspects the code finds all your all
your you know your resources and writing
else and then just generates the whole
MVC side and you can even there's an
option in there to generate a table
sorter UI on top of it too if you want
to starting spot it just generates an
html5 with a bunch of we're not html5 in
just HTML file with a bunch of templates
and so forth in there but it defaults to
no UI so you just generate the
infrastructure but we decided to write
that one off of backbone originally and
that's it's still there off of it one
other thing with the angular JS HL I
guess did support for like a unit
testing because the fact that you don't
have compiler if it's really hard to
make sure that the application is still
like a run and everything so you
actually have to write more unit tests
than you would do in Java compiler helps
a little bit so there was other strong
argument that I I think the unit testing
is essential
from IntelliJ guys here yeah into
Jigga's yeah question here
yeah
I think because they are completely like
a different they they don't question
each other but any application I guess
you would have to sort of mark set in
line but it might be difficult like I to
try to create the same EUI of the same
behavior so unless you you wanna wrist
it if you have worked for any
application and a half of the workflow
is the old one and the how the help is a
new one submit a little bit so I guess
if you sort of make a cut through
application inside this part this subset
of functionality I deliver right into
html5 first then yeah it should it
should be really easily doable there
should be any conflict or clashes it's a
basic like a completely separate way and
then you would just basically link from
the new part three old one there will be
some tricky issues but yeah I'm not it
install it should work yeah but we have
done it yeah I can't say yeah there is
everything Devils in the details
yeah try it your mileage may vary
whatever other word I can put in there
yes over you can do that I think that's
about the people that's what people do
Lydia you would set up that server you
would have it run on a big round and
then Jenkins will be executed yeah yeah
Stefan I think if you have what I think
how and I it just in theory I think they
do have your Hudson or Jenkins and that
would run the unit test and you can
specify the URL of this server on which
to run this there under unit tests so
you could on the same box you can run
the survey with few browsers open or you
could have a process open somewhere else
on somebody computers and it would be in
your internal you would just connect to
its end it there because in theory if
you want up as different operating
system then you need to have to remote
you will have Windows box Meg box and
yeah so it's 12:30 unless there's any
other questions we've gotta wrap it up
you get on
right tool right job if you if your if
your environment allows you to run JSF
and you know JavaFX or whatever in that
and that's what your developer staff is
most comfortable with that's what your
customer wants you to do then go ahead
and use that direction this is simply
one of those opportunities that is the
as this the delivery's landscape changes
we want to be ready to help if that's
what you want to do I
I honestly I'm not exactly that question
honestly I because I haven't spent
enough time out there with all the
customers understanding exactly why
they're doing one thing or another
I think responsive design is something
that is really starting to take off in
desire because you're writing one app in
it and it actually adjusts down
depending on the device it yeah sure you
could yeah definitely good and I don't I
don't think anybody's going to give if
anybody does give you a nail when you
ask that question and they say oh it's
just this isn't this be very skeptical
because I don't think it is there could
be I mean I again I've got a really old
phone and running JavaScript on my phone
sucks but if I'm running on an iPad or
something like that then it's really
really quick so yeah I don't I don't
know that there's an exact answer for
that yet I think the question is still a
valid question and it still needs to be
shaken out by a lot of different people
and it depends on it was it an
enterprise that has everything locked
down to BlackBerry's only and say no in
those secure environments or is it just
you know a start-up that's that wants to
make sure everything runs on you know a
jogging app that makes it runs on your
phone or whatever iPod while you're out
running around it's it's right to a
right job and as long as we're providing
from the tooling perspective which I'm
the p.m. for easel so I look at it from
the NetBeans side not necessarily the
larger technology stuff in that regard I
want to make sure that we're providing
the capability so that if you do run
into it you know you run into a
consultant
job where the guy says yeah I've got all
this ee stuff and we've written restful
services but I want I want you to be
able to put make all my stuff html5 and
they don't know what html5 is and you
guys say okay I'll read it and CSS and
JavaScript from it I'm going to use HTML
4 and they'll go alright they don't know
but if if that's what you're being told
to do you have the opportunity to do it
and work with it that's that's why we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
