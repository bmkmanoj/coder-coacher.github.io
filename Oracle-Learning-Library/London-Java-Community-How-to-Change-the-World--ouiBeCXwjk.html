community and how to change the world
and you'll be pleased so this
presentation isn't very slide heavy at
all and we want to try and get questions
in as soon as possible so we're just
going to give a greater dishonor who we
are and what the ljc JCP committee is
dr. J's are docked OpenJDK and then open
up for questions will also help to clear
up some of the acronyms that are in this
slide as well over the course of this
presentation so who we on my name is
James Gogh and I joined the London Java
user group after finishing University in
2007 my story was I was pretty much a
social member for two years and
occasionally attended the pub and things
like that and when we started with the
JCP group that was when I got more
practically involved and worked on the
docks Jessa and adopt openjdk hi my name
is Richard I was having a chat with Jim
at one of our meetings and in a pub in
London and we're discussing some of the
JCP issues and Jim suggested I should
probably come along to a JCP committee
meeting since we had a seat on the EC
mm-hmm that's a pretty good idea and
I've been more involved subsequently I
was helping out on the dock chair cell
program on 310 and also on lambdas where
we've run a couple of hack days and you
know just generally interested in
getting more kind of feedback and
evidence into the standards process hi
i'm ben evans i started getting properly
involved with the java community in 2009
after being pointed at them after i
attended devoxx and that's where i'm at
martyne and started helping organize
events and then I think I was probably
one of the people who was yeah running
running for the EC was probably
partially my fault we basically we'd
made some quite vocal comments about
about the need for fresh blood to be
injected into the standards process and
it was said to as well essentially why
don't you put your money where your
mouth is
so that was that was kind of my fault
I'm just a G my voice has been gone all
week so i hope this mic is on which it
wasn't on sunday and i joined the london
java user group in 2008 because i was
looking for a job and i figured the best
way to look for a job is to try and meet
other people who do what what i want to
do and find out who's hiring and i
basically got more and more involved in
the ljc because i kept making the
mistake of opening my mouth and having
opinions and it's my fault we had
monthly pub nights I think I think that
was my idea and yeah so as I got more as
i had more opinions about what was going
what wasn't working so well in the
london java user group then i got
invited to do more organizational stuff
up into the point where we joined the EC
and i actually nominated myself for that
i think in just said yes this is
something i'm going to have a lot of
opinions on and and I do cool so I'm
going to hand you over to Ben's who
introduced introduces to what the JCP is
okay so how many people are actually
members of a Java user group of present
okay that's interesting I'd really be
interested to find out why that's the
case I've noticed that the at this job
one there are a lot of people who aren't
actually involved in there they use a
group I mean I realize America is a big
place and a lot of people may not have
one which is that local to them but if
you know afterwards if you'd like to
come up and talk to me about where you
are and you know if you're in a major
city where you don't attend your local
drug I'd be very interested to and to
hear that I guess that's because you
know we basically there there seems to
be no downside to being part of a jolly
user group you know just talks about
getting jobs you know making friends
networking go find out what's what's up
there drinking drinking what's out there
in the technology space so you know yeah
it's been pretty much uniformly positive
experience without any obvious downside
apart from the time commitment which is
you know minimal one evening a month if
that it so anyway so yeah I'd like to
hear those those viewpoints so if people
aren't familiar with with Java user
groups how many people understand what
the JCP is few people okay um so the JC
the JCP is it stands for the jungle
community process and it's effectively
the way that new java standards are
produced now i know that developers are
often on that aware of all that
interested in standards work but it's
absolutely essential for part of what we
what we do innovation is after all the
lifeblood of our industry but without
compatibility and strong standards it's
actually very hard for you to have
transferable skills I mean yes you can
you can learn a you know a proprietary
technology stack like spring and it
feels weird it will be about spring in
that way but that's effectively what
it's become it's become a you know
something which has no standard
different versions behave radically
differently and there's there's nothing
which which guarantees consistency of
versions or backwards compatibility
whereas if you if you learn something
like like go sequel for example you
expect that the
there are still big differences in the
implementation but broadly a sickness
equal select statement is going to
behave the same way across across
implementations so standards are
important unfortunately they're also not
that interesting to a lot of developers
except when the things actually come out
you've gotta finalize standard
developers start using it oh and now
they find all the problems with it so
whilst standards are important to
developers it's not necessarily
something they think of getting involved
with so what the JCP does is it tries to
to make sure that community members bday
people that produce the technology
people that use the technology
developers user groups academics the
whole raft of people that are involved
in the java community have a way of
getting involved in the standards
process and that could be something as
simple and the JCP has a few strange
things about it because it combines that
really two separate groups of standards
so the standards of cookie is ours java
specification requests and they have a
life cycle like any other standards body
standards are proposed talked about you
know draft versions of them beaters if
you like are produced above the standard
then a reference implementation and a
testing kit are produced and then each
stage of the process those those
standards are voted on and who they
voted on by well the executive committee
so the the JCP executive committee which
collectively that london java news group
we have up we have a seat on we are
responsible as the executive committee
for voting on all of the all the
standards that come through so the
having a seat on the EC is a very rare
thing so there were less than 30
organizations you know vendors there's
us and so Java to represent the user
community there are a few distinguished
individuals but mostly it's some of the
major companies and with less than with
less than 30 seats it's quite a
responsibility so just give you some
idea of the amount of work which goes on
I think in the last year I think dude
shall say we'd had we'd had 20 new
standards be proposed so that's trying
to specifications which need to be read
you know wherever possible we try to
make sure that
we look at the testing kit as well look
at the implementations check to make
sure that everything is happening in an
open and transparent way you know we
have to think about IP concerns we have
to think about you know is this
reference implementation is it open
source is it possible to implement the
standard an open source project so
there's a lot of things which go on
which are really about IP management and
the mechanics of standards and technical
politics and there's actually not that
much in the way of actual technical work
which goes on so it's kind of not
interesting to it or to a lot of
developers but at the same time you know
it's stuff which really needs to happen
if we're actually going to have
standards which you guys can rely upon
moving into the future okay so how do we
do that how do we make sure that we that
we represent balance and represent
individual developers in the best way we
can well we have a committee so the OJC
JCP committee is a group of about think
there's currently seven people isn't
matters there's four of us and martyne
and two others and really what we do is
we try to poll our user group as best we
can but we've got 3,000 people in our
group and so trying to get a
representative sample of them is
actually quite difficult so there are
really only two ways you can approach
that problem either you can turn it into
government by referenda and at every
decision put it up for you at the pole
that doesn't work very well because it
means that certain you know if your
sample sizes are small people with
extreme Athenian skew the pole and that
and also there are there are other
technical problems in the we sometimes
have to deal with information which is
not yet public and to talk about it
confidentially so that would mean that
that approach wouldn't work for anything
which was confidential so instead we've
taken the approach that we we have a
small committee which talks to a larger
group of people within the LGC and then
from that we talk trash talk to as many
people in the world community as we can
and with your best and we don't always
get it right we always say to people our
doors are always open there is always
more work than we can do so if people
want to show up and help and feel
strongly about this more sharp sharp and
help us work on this stuff that's great
and generally speaking instead of
framing it in terms of turn off and do
some work rather than turn off and you
know you know we all some sort of
mystical power it's it's actually much
easier to to weed out the trolls so we
haven't had any problems with that yet
and so the committee really just
operates by rough consensus we get
together every month or so talk to any
any new issues which have come up any
new standards which have been proposed
we reach a consensus position on that
sanity check it make sure it's sensible
make sure we talk as much as possible to
community to make do the larger
illiteracy community and to make sure
that people have views broadly being
represented and kind of take it from
there and touch wood I don't think we've
actually had anything any serious
complaints so far okay so that's that's
really the committee and how it operates
and hopefully also demystified the java
community process a little bit if you're
interested in any of the standard stuff
then then do get in touch because we're
always always interested in hearing from
ordinary developers who care about
standards okay so I'm going to hand over
to Jim no
so I guess been as well as talking about
some of the non technical stuff that we
do we also done two initiatives which
have been really hands-on and helped to
impact Jess ours so you talked about
this from the perspective of Jer sorry
10 which is the new daytime API and how
I got involved with that and kind of how
we've outlined the adopter Jess our
program Jim can you explain what a jay
sowers yeah it's a Java specification
request so i think it's been described
it is basically before you can change
language you have to submit jess r which
will then go through the various
processes before being accepted and then
moved into the jdk
so the question is how does the jsr
start as life well I think basically
anybody can submit a jazz hires up is
that fair to say I think you have to be
a JCP member but that's free for
individuals anyway yeah so you basically
you make a proposal and then there's an
initial vote by the executive committee
which says whether people are happy for
you got for everyone to move forward
because if it's something which is just
going to get instantly voted down at the
end there's basically no point in
starting so there's and put the barrier
to entry the beginning is pretty low and
then you kind of go into a period where
you're basically you just kind of work
on the specification request and then
you can have one you have one or more
early draft reviews so their periods of
time where you're obliged to be open to
the public frankly you know the early
draft review idea is good ideas it does
require people to say here's a version
that people and try out and test but
some some jsr suggest you know
effectively an early draft for you
permanently if they're things which are
done completely in the open of people
play around with and then two and then
once it hits the end people basically
have a big bone to the end to say
whether they're happy to standardize the
specification itself and there's that
you know there's a whole bunch of rules
there you know do you have a reference
implementation is there some tests to
ensure for possibility of the
specification does is are there not any
horrible legal issues which are
outstanding and hopefully we try to do
some technical review as well so that
the sands produced aren't just terrible
BF that's the basic process and it's
what we also worth pointing out here
there are a number of different ways
that people can contribute so so so
under the the current version of the
process under which was brought in just
just last year everything is required to
be done in an open and transparent life
so you cannot have a private mailing
list for your for your project it must
be an open mailing list in the sense of
open for people to you know to subscribe
and read it you don't have to have one
which where anyone can post to it but
everyone must be able to read it
there are also these different project
roles so the simplest way to get
involved is just as someone who's
contributing reading mailing list and
contributing you know a few bits and
pieces here and there you know maybe
that you're trying out different
versions of the specification as its
developed the next level up is with
what's called a member of the the expert
group and the expert group is that the
body which is responsible for delivering
the standard so once you pass your
initial vote to say we're going to
create this chase are that creates an
expert group which is run by a spec late
so the spec lead is the person who has
really a lot of influence over the
development of their particular standard
they're also broadly responsible for
collecting managing the IP contributions
and that that's that's actually quite a
complex topic so the best way to get
started is to just look at some of the
the group's you're interested in
hopefully they're ones which are
producing coding into the public view
regularly try out some of the beaches
start contributing mailing lists and
then when the time is right you might
some you might get asked to become part
of an expert group or to think this is
something I really care about and I've
got a lot of experience with so I can I
should just put myself forward
okay so I guess right at the beginning
and I was in the same position i had no
idea what any of this stuff met I'm and
as we join desert java user group i went
along to the fair session and had a chat
with ben Martain trish just to see what
was what was going on and Jerry 10 was
something that struck me as being
absolutely critical for job right so I
thought I'd get involved so the first
step in getting involved was I thought
well maybe I'll just drum up some
support to start with so i did a
lightning talk our local jug and i'm
actually met Steven to go through some
of the content and sort of reach out to
him and say hello here's what we're
doing and why our plans are and as time
went on we kind of got more involved
with the process so Richard I met at one
of our sort of monthly meetup sessions
and he was basically interested as well
and came along and from there we
actually as well as just evangelizing so
going around in lining talks we actually
and started helping with the design
reviews the actual jazzaar I think the
first step of this is always contact the
spec Lee it's good you can get a lot out
of actually talking to people before you
start so that's always a definite
starting point the other things that
we've done our things like running half
days which basically is get gather code
and there's a lot of in terms of openjdk
eight there's binary builds that you can
get and just get people to come down and
play around with the technology as
feedback to the spec leads what's what
people think the library is where the
problems and that early feedback is also
what helps drive drive the standards
forward so Richard would you like to
introduce openjdk at October jdk
so I talked OpenJDK is a kind of
effectively a partner program that's
being run to try and get drugs to be
involved in the OpenJDK so that's the
reference implementation for the java SE
standard and E so the things the things
that people have been doing they're
insulting off with a fairly low barrier
to entry something that many developers
and contribute to our just making small
warnings fixes and bug fixes there's
been an ongoing program to build up
infrastructure around giving people an
easy-to-use virtual machine that they
can play around with and you know it can
be quite a pain in the neck to build the
thing if you're not running Linux and
the the you know the overall the overall
goal of adopt OpenJDK is to try and get
more participation into working on the
reference implementation in the same way
that the dr j sr is about getting more
people involved in working on the
standards process and I think there's
there's also an element of evangelism to
a doctor IDK about encouraging
participation in the wider community and
getting more people to use it but yeah
and i think but but primarily it's about
broadening the contributions one point
which probably should be to be made and
is that when people think about new
versions of Java coming out in new
standards does this job sometimes think
about those as being just one thing and
most jaya cells which are run do not end
up being part of the job receive build
with ships most of the time when you're
talking about developing standards
you're talking about something like the
server spec or something which defines a
library and like juice or the new
version of spring for example the
dependency injection jsr that that
that's not going to go into the core and
it never will so that's what I mean
about the the JCP having having this
sort of this sort of dual role because
we have were called the platform jrs
which are the standards for java SE 7
java SE a de we know Oliver Oliver
the core platforms that are defined but
those are not the rule they are the
exception the majority of Jer cells
which are done described the way that a
library on top of the yes the
implementation is supposed to work so I
know that's a bit confusing and if we
were redesigning the process from
scratch right now we'd probably wouldn't
do it that way but that I know that
that's a point of confusion often so so
openjdk is the open source project codes
all under the GPL which defines the
reference implementation for for java SE
but the actual you the specification
which describes how SE must behave is
covered under a JSR so i know that's a
bit confusing
cool so this might not like to open up
for any questions on any of the material
that we've been covering or anything
else
cecilia in london i get the feeling that
people are quite then very nice yes it's
a centralized year population yet yeah
and it's quite make that do you think
that's part of your success I think in
terms of the the user group itself I
think it definitely helps I mean we are
geographically located London is
extremely heavy on Java developers I
mean all the banks use Java and we've
got a lot of banks in London so there
are a lot of job developers close
together and it's very easy to get them
all together so we've got nearly 3,000
members and we get easily you know 80 to
100 people turn up to any one event
without a lot of effort and not the same
80 or 100 people it depends on which
subjects were covering can freeze
I think one of the things we'd like to
get better at because we don't need to
because we're quite dense is things like
using parlays to video our sessions and
get people involved online through that
sort of thing using webinars using
Twitter to you know feedback questions
from outside of the room we haven't
needed to do that sort of thing but
there's definitely there's lots of
mechanisms for that sort of thing and
I'm just going to say as well since you
know well Jess ours now have it open
mailing or well moving forward have an
open mailing list it's pretty easy for
people who were perhaps in a small area
region then maybe they've been gone
maybe they've got a few people who
locally can contribute to kind of get
involved with other people working on
things in other parts of the world
communicate mention things on the drug
leaders list you know there's all sorts
of things that you can do to try and get
in touch with other adults jsr groups in
other countries in other areas and to
collaborate on these kind of things so
it's it's a lot easier I would say to
get critical mass when you're when
you're working globally then if you're
working in some small town somewhere I
just wanted a quick straw poll of the
audience so can put your hand up if you
live in a city or more than let's say a
million people okay so a lot of people
are are actually living in smaller
smaller cities okay so that that does
interesting we have just as typically
bad at the telepresence stuff but what
we what we have noticed is that it's now
is getting better and better so I was
actually presenting last week at the
Silicon Valley jovi user group javafx
easily went and they actually had a
relatively sophisticated live streaming
solution which you know is certainly not
out with the the realms of possibility
and it was just pretty standard consumer
embracing the kit and they were actually
able to the live stream and basically
double the size of their audience just
by having a channel on ustream
and you know that the more time you've
done quite a lot with working with
Google Hangouts but for some of your
open source projects as well really I
think you know one of the one of these
you can do is just to to start thinking
about more inches you want to scratch I
mean that's that's always the way to get
involved with community development or
social coding it's you have to care
about what the individual project and
starting starting a Java user group if
there's only 10 Java developers in your
town well unless you get on an oval they
all are it may not be viable but on the
other hand if you if you find some
project wishes is run by a larger javi's
group quite awful you know I'm sure
they'll be interested having the right
contributors that's a good way to get
involved and I think there's ways we can
learn off other use groups as well so if
you're in a smaller tower and there
aren't that many Java developers there
are developers doing other things as
well and we can learn quite a lot from
the other languages was someone saying
that some of those standards came from
were borrowed from net we there were
some who was talking about that then if
you don't so one of the disadvantages of
being in London as you only speak to
Java developers it and the other JVM
languages you don't get a chance to
learn off other other types of languages
and other types of communities which i
think is a good thing so if you're in a
smaller area you can use a broader
interest in tech to bring each other
together and learn off each other the
only thing I was going to answer that
was that basically what is a java user
group it's just two or more people so
there's no reason why you can't just
have a job user group way you're
interested in lambdas for example and
you can pick up the materials from some
of the bigger jokes and reuse that maybe
in your workplace
Michael
is that the group in Rotterdam all right
beginning this just Duchess counters are
javi's group as well could I lewd of
course it does no I didn't know okay I
that was Bobby Fry's an audit what I
meant was it is that how you better find
yourself I did it yes okay so of course
Duchess is not Geographic so there are
Java user boots which I'm not purely
defined by their geography so Dutchess
is the one for women in Java and there
are a few others as well on there which
are which are geographic yeah
it's an interesting point hei there's a
couple of the was at one of the OpenJDK
one of the lambdas hack days we have a
few people come along who didn't use
Java and that they stay development job
at all there was a guy who for a while
was using Java and they're moved to work
them for a ruby based startup who is
playing around who is quite interested
in the in elounda side of things he felt
it was something which Java is
historically week on there's also quite
a few people who are just kind of off
along I mean in in London because we
have a reasonable number of universities
you will get a few students just pop
along and they're just kind of happy to
learn or just interested to learn
something new all together I think
contributions are that are really good
weather especially from people who don't
have a necessary technology specific
background
cool any other questions so I think
we'll go to our slide of pretty cam
questions for the pre pre ten o'clock so
some of these I think we've already
answered but then maybe you could talk
to how we make our voting decisions okay
so ting decisions are made by okay said
some of this but it's difficult to know
how to represent you know a community of
3,000 people so the answer is you just
keep talking to people and you do you do
the best you can and if you make
mistakes you publicly acknowledge them
and try not to make them again so that's
that's that's how we have how we do it
so we have regular pub meetings every
every month for the whole ljc so as many
as possible of us try to turn up to
those meetings try to talk to people you
know we posed to the mailing list about
you know the minutes of all meetings
decisions that were taken we might
comment you know we're always looking
for additional volunteers and the
digital people to help out because the
holding of an ECC and actually trying to
do justice to the amount of of Sanders
are coming through is actually quite
difficult so I think I once estimated it
that it was it was about 15 hours worth
a week I mean between a committee of
seven that's manageable because that's
just a couple of hours each but you know
if you were a s'more user with holding
in ECC I could see how that would that
would quickly even napped up so and then
basically we talk to as many people as
we can you know anything which which
appears to be a broad interest to the to
our overall mailing list will post up
mailing list and say hey what people
think about this and then from that will
will kind of try to synthesize some sort
of sense of what communities feeling is
and talk about it when we get together
on a monthly basis or for certain
critical issues we may actually and talk
about it privately on our mailing list I
think there's only have been a couple of
things we needed to talk about you know
very urgently but without
waiting for the next meeting and then
from that once consensuses is achieved
that's that's the position of the group
and it's kind of a cabinet principle
that once we once you've made our
decision does the decision and everybody
everybody supports that if there's if
there's a dissenting view I think people
are all grown up and professional enough
to to not let that Lake outside the
discussions of the committee I'd like to
ask the question what did you guys
expect to get out of this session anyone
anyone
what to do
as a user group or just as easy group
generally one way is a success have we
covered enough of that I I mean I can go
into a lot more detail about what we do
is a user group if you want I'll just do
a quick couple of minutes um huh
drinking coding um we have we have
events like at least weekly if not
sometimes two or three events in one
week I think we didn't use do we used to
have a couple of a couple of months as
as we got bigger and as we got more
people who have their their different
interests we actually have a number of
different leaders of the London job user
groups so the people here are the people
involved in the JCP committee staff but
we've got loads of other members who
aren't on the JCP committee but they do
other stuff inside the community so we
we run various events various things
which are more formal presentations
bigger presentations we used to have a
lot of vendors come and talk to us which
is a good way to kickstart your jug
because vendors always want to come and
talk to developers but as we got bigger
what we really wanted to do is get
developers talking about what they do
and it's more engaging than I have a no
vendor come and sell at you so we we saw
a couple of endocardial of vendors now
we have a lot of developers coming in
telling their war stories or something
they've worked on that's cool that's
difficult or they shouldn't use we do
still have people coming along and
telling us about cool technologies as
well from outside of the jug at those
events we usually have if we can at two
or three lightning talks beforehand and
that's how we try and grow some of the
speakers from inside the jug because and
that's how most of us started right we
first started with a 15 minute lightning
talk my first 15 minute oh sorry 5 47
minutes 7 minute lightning talk on I did
it so minute alive and talk on the JCP
committee that was my first talk and
then that way you get used
the idea of speaking in public and then
we can go talent from within the user
group we also have monthly pub meet
which is I didn't always want to come to
all the presentations because I don't
need to learn about this particular
technology i'm not i'm not using it i'm
not going to i'm not going to remember
any of this stuff if i'm not using it i
just wanted to come and meet people so
we have our monthly pub meeting was that
last Tuesday of the month first years of
the month something like that and we try
and make it nice and central because
lunds is a difficult place to get around
and if we have it in Shoreditch where a
lot of the training events are its i'm
in west london is too difficult to get
to that so this usually central and we
have what else do we have well um days
so let's say the encourage chair
co-chair hack day so people have some
topic someone bring where there's a you
have to implement a solution to things
people bring along their alternatives
and discuss and kind of review
collaborate kind of generally learn
about what the different options and
thought processes work there's hack days
you've been running on standards there's
the JCP committee itself knowing that
there's also the well basically early on
we decided that that the community was
there for developers and for developers
to improve their careers and so what
that means is that individual groups
sort of solve and special interest
groups within the LGC but then very
quickly if that's popular that they find
that apps you kind of take on a life of
their own so we have this sort of
principle of the urgency thing kind of
like a mothership and that there are a
lot of other smaller communities which
are connected to it you know so for
example our scholar community started
that way our closure community started
that way but as they grew in size they
sort of moved out from underneath us and
to retain a relationship with them but
there and this will kind of part about
overall LGC does 40 but then they're no
longer you know purely a subgroup of the
ljc so because of that it's it's kind of
quite difficult to get how
on how much stuff were actually actually
doing at any given time because when a
group that's large enough they become
effectively autonomous and we have this
this principle that anybody can come
with they've got a good idea for an
event you know it's probably going to
run but to the point about vendors
though we now have very very strict
rules about how we can we deal with
vendors the amount of value that we can
bring to a vendor you know is very high
you know they want access to developers
we have you know we know a large high
quality group of developers and that
that represents a significant assets so
if they're going to access to that it's
on our terms and that means you know no
hard sell no sales pitches you know no
thinking that they can they can access
to all databases and or anything like
that which vendors marketing people
sometimes want to they have to send this
technologists you know early on you may
have got a product evangelist or you
know somebody from marketing a technical
evangelist would be fine but they would
actually have to know their stuff so if
they sent us you know just some product
drone or loose leaf and it's bad for
their brand it's bad for our brand it's
no good for the people that actually
turned up and go get their time to come
listen so yeah does there's a bunch of
stuff there's the open conference every
year so once a year we run running I
think Jim was going to talk about the
urban conference everybody whether you
know it's just going to say because the
open conference is a really interesting
thing for my perspective bar just it but
let people know what it is so an open
conference is the idea where we just get
92 I think 150 Java developers together
on a Saturday and at the beginning of
the day we define the content for the
day so there is no real structure
there's something there's usually a
keynote kick step off but after that is
all our members presenting things that
they found interesting from either of
the conferences or just things that
they've been working at their place of
employment so it's a really good way to
just collectively get people to
participate the other great thing that
I've seen from this as well is for
example Ben Martins relationship and how
that began at the session after the
unconference where effectively there
were
very much sort of talking about the
things we are now like how there's a gap
between people that come out of
university with they know they know
about Java they know how to code a
little bit but they don't there's
something about taking that next step
and together they wrote a book about it
which was released towards the beginning
of the year so that was purely from
attending a Java user group and that's
one of the things that you can get out
of that and I guess since the book you
guys also formed a company together yeah
so so that's that that's really what
what we want to do with the Odyssey is
to provide an environment where things
like that can happen where you know
people can can actually find people who
are going to be you know important to
them professionally in premium oh yeah
I'm personally I met my boyfriend
through the ljc King cool has I inspired
any further questions from the audience
no
mexico next cam question is for Richard
actually hey Richard how do I were in a
hack day how'd you run a hack that
that's a good question so specifically
on the on the jsr front we have been
running a few hack days which we can
getting surprisingly good feedback from
expert group members what a an expert
group spec lead the other day said it
helps keep him saying so that's always a
good thing to hear you basically you
kind of want to start off pick a topic
of focus some something you can focus
around so a JSR could be good the
OpenJDK itself could be good but if you
know something is broadly OpenJDK you
probably want to target something at a
niche within that so running a warnings
day or a bugger phone or something that
draws to fix a specific problem a
specific area once you've done that
you're going to need some kind of venue
so another were quite lucky to get to
get available venues but you'll probably
find that if you ask around someone will
have a free space that's available maybe
a company who are happy to lend you one
of their rooms for an evening or
Saturday as long as long as you say
thank you very much to them especially
if they're trying to recruit developers
once you've got a space and a topic you
need to try and it's best to try and
contact who I was actually in charge of
the specification or whoever's working
on the area inside the technology
vendors such as Oracle to try and see if
they have any particular area they want
you to the pad and to try and
communicate and say hey you know maybe
you're going to get some patches back
from the end of this or maybe i'm about
to send some feedback to your mailing
list in a day's time just give you a
heads-up then you need to promote your
event because you know a hack day with
no attendees it's not very helpful and I
mean we've just been using our standard
kind of you know drug mailing this where
we have quite a few people signed up you
promotional stuff but you know social
media is great for this kind of thing
you might find that if you've got enough
followers and if you have the right hash
tag you'll get a few people who just
wouldn't turn up to other things coming
along to come along to an event like
that on the day it's always good to have
perhaps a quick introductory
presentation just to tell people why
they're there what the topic is but not
as it's already last for ages but you
know something that just gets people
into the into the into the feel of
things gives them a chance to finish off
drinking their coffee and wake up and
then it's also quite good when you're
running the thing to have kind of people
who are helping out so if you're so the
the the the hack days which you've run
on kind of lambdas we were running we
had probably five attendees to one
person who is kind of just around to
help them and make sure that if they got
confused or stuck they weren't even hand
of go board and go home that they could
think they could have someone to ask
questions duvan you a little bit more
about what was going on you don't
necessarily need to know that much in
order to be a kind of helper Martain
will testify to this but uh yeah
probably but you but you do need to know
a little bit and then once you once
you've run it it's always good to try
and kind of summarize what you've
learned perhaps have a quick chat to the
attendees whilst it's going along or at
the end and then try and send hopefully
try and send feedback somewhere like a
spec mailing list or maybe if it's if
it's an open JDK bugger font type thing
try and send patches to the right
OpenJDK mailing list but if you're doing
that make sure that you told the people
that you're going to send the patches
for so they don't accidentally have a
huge diff and then be very very worried
about what to do with it
so I'm going to pick on Martine again if
you will stop typing for a second would
you mind coming up here and explaining
about going global because we've
discussed adopt jsr and adopt openjdk
and I guess they kicked off in the
london java community but one of our
efforts has really been to push those
two other user groups make them
available for other parts of the world
so sure the expert welcome he was trying
to get some work done yeah exactly uh
expert yeah not quite it's something
we're still learning about and working
on a great deal I guess our strategy
initially was to contact the other jug
leaders on the international leaders
list and Oracle also holds yearly a
leaders of user groups conference once a
year for the global and also once a year
for amia and asia-pacific and other
areas so this the idea was to meet other
drug leaders face to face explain the
idea of what we were trying to do and
then give them some basic materials on
kicking off their own efforts and then
just following up with them with some
regular skype calls and things so it's
been reasonably successful today
especially well-organized jugs like so
Java in Brazil if you've seen Bruno
running around with this Brazilian flag
he has an incredible team of very
passionate have been Jellicle type type
people in his leadership team so they
they've certainly start off their own
efforts we are trying to push it further
though because we found that it has
stalled a little bit as of last year in
terms of spreading it out
internationally so i think it was
mentioned before but the idea of having
either live streaming workshops and
talks as well as the ability for people
to download actual materials coating
materials workshop materials so they can
just literally have a workshop in a box
as probably the next thing we need to do
because it is really really hard for
other smaller user groups or user group
said i have english as a first language
to actually pick up on your ideas and
run with them so yeah that's where we're
going to try and go next basically
the point about non-english-speaking
user groups is actually an interesting
one because I mean there are some some
very large groups who you don't have
english as a first language the
Brazilians for example have some crazy
number like 30,000 Java developers and
their years ago and although it was only
a maybe ten percent and speak English
well enough to cope with materials so
what we found is that you have to kind
of find a group of them well if you're
English we can start with you find a
group who share a corn language with you
and then use those guys as a bridgehead
to actually bridge into the sort of
hinterland of people that the only speak
the native language the French user
groups are an interesting case in point
because they the francophone and tend to
not be too keen about about doing stuff
in English dorrough exceptions of course
but they are you know a very large user
population thing I've ever have a great
many jugs and they actually have a kind
of kind of a good network of smaller
jugs that all talk to each other within
France so you know it's a it's a great
potential market for doing some of the
more global efforts but you just have to
figure out how to have approached it now
to get in and get that get the message
across to people well London is quite a
good place to start that though because
i read a stat which says that it's the
city with the most languages spoken in
it in the world yeah so we could find
people inside our own community which
can provide some of those bridgeheads as
well
we can any questions no okay I'm now
going to wing some more questions and I
guess a feature is could answer over the
last year of what we think we've got
what I guess the highlight has been
about being in the JCP group starve
attrition Oh a JCB group or the LJ CM
JCP i'm going to do ljc as well I'm the
last year well actually that's a very
good question I'm my first Java one was
last year and I came here to pick up a
chick's Choice Award actually and i am
prepared and Marte and dragged me along
to every single JCP meeting that they
were invited to to every single jug
leaders meeting that they could get me
into and my my boss at the time he
dragged me to a bunch of other things as
well this was a really great event to
meet people and I met a lot of people I
met Regina and the Duchess ladies I met
all loads of the Oracle folks and and
sort of three and i also did my first
presentation I co-presented with someone
else and since then i've i've done i've
gone to a bunch of conferences and done
a bunch of presentations which I
wouldn't have been able to do if I
hadn't done my first lightning talk at
the ljc and I had it I'm met and I
wouldn't been out to do without having
been at javaone and met the JCP guys
have met the job guys um and it hasn't
really necessarily changed the course of
my career yet but it's just it's just
been an amazing journey and I've just
I've learned so much in the last year
and I can see now so many more options
open to me personally and professionally
it's and it's only been 12 months it's
been incredible and so that's purely
through my involvement of being in the
ljc and our connection to the JCP you'll
notice how Trish didn't list meeting her
boyfriend at this I am a him to
yeah that's a good point now I met him
before the last year I just got together
with him in the last twelve once nice
gastrous um god I last year okay well
the last year has been off the chart in
pretty much every way that i can think
of so i'm probably starting a company
with a bunch of guys i met from from the
OJC we're not i think i probably that
has to be it what about your book Oh
getting my book published somebody I
have to go go see it's available in the
bookstore I'm not really sure what a
good highlight is but you know the ljc
did end up winning two awards of this
conference so that's probably a good
thing to pick on ya so I think I'll go
with that so I think for me the biggest
achievement this year has been actually
feeling like I've made a difference so
contributions to jer's r310 and actually
helping to keep I guess that roughly on
course and even this week there's more
meetings about that to make sure that
that actually happens and goes into Java
rate will probably have a bigger impact
there than people will ever realize but
it does give you a pretty good feeling
to know that you've been directly
involved with that and I think the main
thing for me is um I've met so many good
friends I mean I think then was one of
the first people I told that I was going
to have a child this next year so you
know that we were all pretty good good
friends from the whole thing and I think
you know that's that to me is that's why
I guess why come along
so before I tear up are there any other
questions or should we go get a coffee I
think it's coffee time it's great thanks
everyone thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
