cloud controls 13c demo series this
demonstration will show you how to set
up security for bi publisher thought
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13c or at least one we will look at
what's new in this version of cloud
control then the VIP security model and
how to implement that model you can use
the links here to jump straight to each
section we'll just move to the time for
the sections in cloud control 13c bi
publisher is not only installed
alongside the OMS but it is configured
out-of-the-box
meaning that bi publisher is ready to
use as soon as they are MS is ready to
use
this is true not only for single server
installations but also whenever you
expand your site with a highly available
topology finally you have full
flexibility in highly available
topologies to run the OMS and bi
publisher on each node or just one or
the other
bi publisher has a hierarchical security
model through Enterprise Manager cloud
control users at the bottom of the
hierarchy we have the amb IP viewer role
cloud control users with this role can
log into bi publisher and run the
out-of-the-box reports and potentially
any other reports created for your site
next we have the mbrp author role cloud
control users with this role can create
reports within bi publisher the mbrp
author ole automatically includes the
mbrp viewer role so authors can also run
reports the EMB IP scheduler role sits
to one side of the hierarchy cloud
control users with this and the mbrp
viewer role and scheduled execution of
any other reports they can view within
BL and publisher at the top of the
hierarchy is the EMB IP administrator
role in a non LDAP cloud control
environment super administrators
automatically receive this role to allow
them to perform initial setup tasks all
of the other roles are included in the
EMB IP administrator role in this
demonstration we will work with for
cloud control users and their privileges
against to manage database targets a m13
rep and OIC L AM user one has the am
user role in cloud control and the view
any target privilege and we will give
them the EMB IP viewer role only AM user
2 has the TM news of role in cloud
control but with view privilege only on
the OSE own database instance and we
will also give them the mbrp view role
only VM reports has the a.m. or viewer
role in cloud control and we will give
them that
a MBO p author role so they can create
custom reports finally a.m. admin has
the a.m. all administrator role and
cloud control and we will give them the
MBO p administrator role so they can
also administer bi publisher
out-of-the-box Oracle Enterprise Manager
cloud control 13c includes an item for
bi publisher under the enterprise
reports menu
but without implementing VIP security
the reports are only visible to super
administrators when we login as a
standard administrator we are told that
we do not have access as we can see here
bi publisher roles need to be explicitly
granted to cloud control users through
the Enterprise Manager command-line
interface am CLI we log in to M CLI as a
super administrator in this case the
system and user we use the am CLI verb
grant bi publisher roles to grant me a
publisher roles to Cloud Control users
here is the command to grant the EMB IP
administrative role to the am admin user
when utilizing repository based
authentication a different parameter is
used for external authentication note
the use of uppercase for the Cloud
Control username now that we have
explicitly granted a VIP role to the am
admin user let's revisit the reports
page to see the effect as we can see now
we have access to the reports and
clicking on a link here opens a new tab
for being a publisher where we log in
and view the report
back in AMC Li we will finish mapping
the be upon the rolls to our cloud
control users will grant the am VIP auto
roll to the M reports user then exit
from this a.m. satellite session and now
we will grant the am VIP viewer roll to
M user 1 and the M user to using am CLI
in interactive mode note that in this
mode the parameter values are single
quote delimited
you
let's our management of the BR publisher
role is finished so we can exit the MC
Lyte interactive mode
thanks for watching this demonstration
