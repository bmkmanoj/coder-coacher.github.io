about is actually how we send sequel to
the database believe it or not this is
where a lot of programmers make a large
amount of mistakes and give away
literally orders of magnitude of
performance and in the demonstration
what we're going to show is we're going
to show a very simple online gaming
system application and we're going to
show it literally being coded at its
most inefficient and we're going to take
it through to its most optimal
performance and you will notice that the
performance jumps from about 300
transactions second to over 40,000
transactions a second now that sort of
in performance gain cannot be achieved
by just throwing hardware at the problem
this is the result of writing the
applications properly and using the
Oracle database in the manner that it
was designed to be used in the most
efficient manner and I can't emphasize
this enough because it isn't being
taught at school it's not being
understood and there are also side
effects to doing things incorrectly
that affect system availability system
security and these are all extremely
important I cannot emphasize this enough
and this is just part of everyday life
in real-world performance we identify
inefficiencies in people's applications
and there is always a large amount of
reluctance to acknowledge it go back and
modify and change code and there's a
motivation to think well surely you have
some magic parameter to solve this
problem well I'm telling you there
aren't magic parameters within the
Oracle database otherwise we would have
them when you got the product when it
left the house okay so it's all about
learning how to use the product
correctly and in many cases the audience
of this video will know this already but
I'm going to challenge you and say how
many people junior people within your
organization have you trained and
coached and mentored to do this
correctly since they joined your
organization and better still have you
put these sort of coding standards into
the requirements when developing a new
application have architects learn these
things so they can specify them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
