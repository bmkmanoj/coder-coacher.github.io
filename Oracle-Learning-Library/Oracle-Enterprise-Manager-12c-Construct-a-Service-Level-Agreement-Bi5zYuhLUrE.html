Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
construct a service level agreement or
SLA in cloud control
first locate a service to create an SLA
for in our case this service is the
configured entry point for a composite
application system its name is received
purchase order before we can create an
SLA we first need to configure the
performance metrics for the service this
option is located under monitoring
configuration we can browse the
available metrics for an SOA composite
target which is the container for our
service for this demonstration will
monitor service throughput this measures
the number of completed purchase order
requests per minute you could configure
additional metrics to monitor but this
is sufficient for our SLA and now we're
ready to create the SLA locate the
service level agreement option under the
target menu no s la's yet exist for this
service so let's create a new one an SLA
has a name and some other optional
descriptive fields
you must also specify the time period
for which the SLA is validated by
default its monthly but for our
requirements quarterly will be
sufficient an SLA consists of one or
more objectives that are evaluated next
we'll create the first of these two
objectives each objective has a name and
can evaluate either service availability
or performance our first objective is
related to high availability you then
need to specify the expected service
level as a percentage along with the
percentage that will trigger a warning
alert for this objective we need its
condition to be true at least
ninety-five percent of the time remember
that in cloud control you can also
define business calendars and apply to
them to different features an enterprise
manager SLA czar one of these features
will simply stick with the default
calendar which includes all dates and
all times but you could alternatively
evaluate this SLA only during business
hours for example for availability
objectives you simply need to specify
which status values make this SLA
objective evaluate to true in most
instances this means the up status next
we'll create a second objective for the
same SLA this time let's configure a
performance-based objective
you now need to define the metrics or
indicators that this objective will
evaluate against for the service earlier
we configured a single metric for the
service which is now listed here just as
with the first objective we must specify
the condition or conditions that should
be evaluated for this demonstration our
performance objective is met if the
throughput is at least 30 messages per
minute after creating the objectives
you're ready to save this SLA you can
specify whether this SLA should also be
enabled so that Enterprise Manager
begins evaluating it alternatively you
could create the SLA and schedule it to
be enabled at a later date you then have
one final opportunity to review the SLA
in each objectives thresholds indicator
metrics and evaluation schedules our SLA
is initial setup is complete and it is
enabled and running next let's check the
real-time and historical status of our
new SLA from the same service level
agreement menu select dashboard here you
can view the current status on the left
as well as historical status on the
right the status is given for the whole
SLA as well as for our two individual
objectives
