video training series this is a video
recording of application testing suite
12 three new features and updates my
name is carolyn louie and i'm a senior
product manager for application testing
sleep this presentation covers new
features and updates we have in oracle
application testing suite release 12 3
the video recording will run for
approximately 36 minutes in the first 10
minutes we will talk about the new
features for open square for functional
testing and general enhancements in the
next five minutes we'll discuss the new
features for open script for load
testing and oracle load testing in the
remaining 21 minutes we will discuss new
features for oracle test manager we will
begin with an overview of the new
features or open script for functional
testing and general enhancements open
script wat da 3 introduced chrome
browser playback for web ad f and J de
functional test modules in addition
there are many new enhancements to the
script encryption feature such as the
ability to password protect sensitive
script data in putting different
passwords for each script in oil T
scenario command-line arguments for
script encryption and saving passwords
to an alt or otm database starting with
1203 there will be an open script only
installer downloadable from otn Oracle
flow builder is a new feature that we've
introduced in 12 3 which allows users to
generate script based on keywords
without recording against the
application the script can be created
via web or excel user interface Oracle
flow builder is shipped with 3,000
pre-built components and 200 pre-built
script and flows the first feature i
want to introduce 4 12 3 functional
testing module is support for Chrome
browser playback chrome browser playback
is supported for web ADF and jde
functional test scripts on Windows
machines the playback is supported from
open script you I command line orgullo
testing and orgo test manager scripts
must be recorded with ie or Firefox and
to play back in Chrome browser go to
open script preferences and configure
playback or chrome in this example I
will playback a web functional testing
script with chrome browser to do so
simply click on view open script
preferences highlight browsers under the
general section and select chrome or
playback after clicking on playback it
will launch the chrome browser and play
back the script
another feature I want to introduce is
enhancements to script encryption in 12
dot 3 users can now encrypt sensitive
data in their scripts a passwords
require for script playback otherwise
the sensitive data cannot be decrypted
the encryption password is stored in
open script process memory boring or
kalou testing or oracle test manager
database but never in an external file
which makes the password secure users
can configure a different password for
each script instead of setting a global
password in open script which was the
case in releases prior to 12 dot 3 as
you can see in this screenshot to set a
password for encryption click on the
Tools menu select script encryption
encrypt and then enter the password when
the script is opened again user will be
prompted to enter the script encryption
password before the script is encrypted
if there are any password in the script
itself if you go to Java code view you
will see that the password is not
encrypted after script encryption you
will see in Java Cove you that the
password has now been encrypted if we go
back to the same script that we just
play back in chrome and go to the Java
code view you will see that the password
is not currently encrypted now let's go
to tools script encryption encrypt and
enter a password you will see right away
that the password within the script is
now encrypted and during playback the
decrypt function will decrypt the
encrypted password so that the playback
will succeed this slide shows the API
parameters that will be encrypted after
an encryption password is set for the
script when re encrypting a script open
script will look for the literal wrapped
in decrypt API and the decrypt function
and re-encrypt them with
orca load testing when a
password-protected script is added to
the bill scenarios tabbing olt the input
scripts password dialog box will open
and prompt the user to enter the
password user can store the script
password to the oil T database which
will be linked to the current oil t
logon account if another user logs on
with a different account now user cannot
access the script password this means if
the other user wants to add the same
script to their scenario we will have to
enter the password for that script once
a script password is stored in the
database the user will no longer need to
enter the password for that script again
in current and future scenarios as
mentioned previously different passwords
can be used for different scripts in the
scenario one thing to know is multiple
rows are displayed in the input scripts
password dialog window only when user
adds the script which has script assets
and two or more of them are encrypted or
when user opens a safe scenario which
includes multiple encrypted scripts in
this screenshot that we have here we
have an oil t scenario with three
encrypted scripts when the scenario was
opened user is prompted with the input
script password dialog window the dialog
window displays the three encrypted
scripts and prompts the user to enter a
password for each there are a couple of
checkboxes on this window which is worth
mentioning the first one is applied to
others if this checkbox is checked oil t
will apply the same password to the
other scripts listed in the dialog
window the other checkbox they store the
correct passwords to database if this is
checked olt will store the script
password to loyalty database the
validate button will check if the
passwords entered are correct if the
password is not correct then a wrong
password message will appear in cases
when a new oil t scenario is being
created the user will only see one row
in the info scripts password dialog
window let's go ahead and demonstrate
the new scrip encryption feature I will
go ahead and build a new scenario with
three encrypted scripts and you
we'll see that as I add each script I am
being prompted to enter the password
I will go ahead and save the scenario
let's go ahead and log out a boil tea
and log back in and open that scenario
and here you will see that because there
are three encrypted scripts within that
oil tea scenario I am being prompted to
enter the password for each script and
this is where I can use the checkbox to
apply to others if this is selected in
the same password will be used for the
other remaining scripts within the
scenario let's go ahead and click on the
validate button and you'll see that a
green checkmark is displayed meaning
that the password is valid for all the
scripts and this is also an opportunity
where I can choose to store the password
to database after the password has been
entered the scenario will be open from
otm when a password-protected script is
added the correct password needs to be
entered into the open script password
field or else the script will not be
added this password is encrypted and
stored in the otm database for each
script bring playback otm will retrieve
the password decrypted and then hand it
over to the asian manager for further
processing there are a number of new
command line interface arguments added
in 12 dot 3 to allow users to play back
in encrypted script from the command
line some examples are encrypted
password encrypted password global and
encrypted password prompt these
command-line arguments will feel
different needs please visit the open
script user's guide section a23 for more
information the Oracle technology
Network download site now includes a new
zip file for installing the open script
application standalone for Oracle load
testing or Oracle test manager agent
installation please use the micro
install or complete install zip file the
upgrade installation file will no longer
be available therefore please use the
migrant install file for upgrading oats
in 1203 we introduced orgo flow builder
which is a keyword driven test script
generator which generates grips based on
keywords open script for functional
testing scripts can be created via the
web UI or excel UI using
pre-built components inflows shipped
with Oracle flow builder this is a
separate download from 80s and a
dedicated training will be made
available at the Oracle Learning Library
here is an overview of the new features
for open script for load testing and
oracle load testing itself open script
12-3 introduced correlation library
enhancements for fusion ADF Hyperion and
PeopleSoft load test modules the
Hyperion load testing module contains
further enhancements such as a recovery
settings for server response new API is
for more robust scripting experience and
use that group creator finally there are
additional enhancements to the command
line execution for running low test
scenarios in 12-3 the open script ADF
correlation library is updated to
provide a more reliable correlation of
component IDs and attributes for
variables from a BF rich responses as
you can see from the screenshots the
12-2 correlation rules are still in 12 3
in 12 3 there are two new correlation
rules to provide a more reliable
playback and they are set context ID and
new window ID let's go ahead and take a
look at the new correlation rules for
fusion ADF click on view open script
preferences and go to correlation
section and highlight ADF load there are
two new variables for parameters
specific to a BF and one of them is that
context ID if we select this variable
and click on the source tab the regular
expression pattern for the selected role
will be shown this is the pattern that
opens scribbler look for doing recording
when it's detected the correlation will
be done automatically in the script
similarly for a new window ID you can
also highlight the rule and check out
the rule the source and the target in
1203 there are a lot of the rules added
to the Hyperion correlation library in
12 too there were 22 correlation rules
and in 1203 there are 54 coral
rules for hyperion the reason for this
is we have taken the feedback from our
own Hyperion load testing team and made
the correlation more robust and
automated to ensure a smooth playback
you can check out the new Hyperion
correlation rules by opening or creating
a new Hyperion load test script and
going to open script preferences to see
the details in 12-3 the open script
preferences now has an Oracle Hyperion
load test section to configure server
error message handling this was added
because playback for hyperion
application is difficult to verify for
example getting an HTTP air can mean the
server's throwing an exception and
getting a status 200 doesn't mean that
the script works at all usually this can
be taken care of by adding custom
verifications such as checking for some
text in the server response or adding
global checks for some known errors
however since these verifications are
not generic and depend on a specific
Hyperion product or version it is not
possible to add a global check for the
server error therefore we have added a
way for users to define how they want to
handle server error messages and this
can be configured by going to view open
script preferences playback error
recovery section another enhancement we
have made for the Hyperion module is we
have added new ap is to encode and
decode strings and validate server
response for example the Hyperion yet SI
encoder API can convert a line feed to
an ad site please refer to the open
script programmers reference guide for
code examples we have also enhanced the
Hyperion load test module with new step
grew creators to provide an easier way
to understand the script flow this
provides a more effective way to test
the server and provides a more
meaningful low test report open script
nail parses 44 patterns during recording
of a Hyperion application the patterns
are shown in this table if one of these
patterns are detected open script will
create a step group with the title
includes in the tags or API
in top three the open script peoplesoft
correlation library has also been
updated to provide more automation and a
more reliable playback similar to the
Hyperion module quite a few new
correlation rules have been added these
roles help reduce scripting time by
automatically correlating dynamic
variables and Dom input so that the user
does not have to you can check out the
new PeopleSoft correlation rules by
opening or creating a new PeopleSoft low
test script and going to open script
preferences to see the details another
new feature we have for oracle load
testing is we have added enhancements to
our support for running a load test from
the command line in 12 talk to em
previous releases Ranieri scenario from
the command line is limited to starting
and stopping the scenario starting with
12 3 in addition to starting and
stopping a scenario from the command
line there are many more command line
arguments that can be used to achieve
different needs for example you can add
an agent or Asian group from the command
line you can also specify how you want
to run the session specify ramp-up
settings export or import a scenario
generate a session report and many more
place the Appendix C of the orca load
testing users guide for more information
and examples here is an overview of the
new features for Oracle test manager
which is an area in 12 dot 3 which
contains a lot of enhancements the test
execution tab has been revamped to
include exciting new features for
executing test sets or co test managers
test tab right-click menu also has a
minor changes and additions in 1203 we
know automatically save changes made in
the run manual test window so user will
not accidentally click on cancel and
lose the entire result in addition we
have provided a major enhancement to the
clone project feature so that both the
project data and structure is cloned in
12 degrees test execution tab we have
enhanced the UI to provide a more
organized way to present the data this
is what the test execution tab looks
like in 12 at one in 12
in 12 3 we now have a new section layer
along with new options to execute a test
set the sections remain the same however
there is a more distinguished look in 12
2 and previous releases when the Tesla's
became very long user has to scroll down
to the end of the list to see the run
history section starting with 12 3 there
is an expand and collapse button for
each section so it's easier to get to
the section you need to get to quickly
another obvious change is the test run
status has been removed from the header
section this is because you can now
create multiple test runs for a test set
therefore the test run status is tied to
each run and not to the test set so
having the status in the header does not
make sense anymore another change we
have made is we rename the execute test
that link to create run this is to
accommodate the new feature of creating
more than one test run per test set
other enhancements include the ability
to pull up a test run to view the owner
and status for each test case there are
no buttons too long G test run and set
results for a test run also there is a
progress bar indicator in the run
history section in 1203 you can now
pause and resume a test that by pausing
the test case and we will talk more
about this in later slides otm top 3
allows you to create a test run for a
test set by specifying run name and run
parameters the create test set round
window is actually very similar to the
test run info window you see when you
execute a test case from the test tab
here you specify a run name which is by
default that they in time the run
parameters configured by the otm
administrator will also be presented in
this window to be completed by the user
after a test run is created it has
displayed in the test list section has a
drop down the user can select which
tests that run to view by selecting that
run from the drop-down creating a test
run does not kick off any tests which is
different from 12-1 and 12-2
in 12 1 and 12 2 there is no concept of
a test run therefore after clicking on
execute test that the run is started
immediately however in 12 dot 3 more
than one test run can be created for
test set which is a great way to
represent different test cycles one of
the major enhancements we have in OT m12
dot 3 is both manual and automated test
cases within a test run can now be
individually executed from within a test
set you do this by clicking on the green
arrow icon next to the individual test
cases if you want to run the automated
test cases sequentially then you can
click on the launch button which will
bring up the test set run window this
window will display all the test cases
listed in the test set however manual
test cases will be grayed out in only
automated test cases will be enabled the
reason behind this is because the user
needs to manually kick off in manual
test case and enter the test results
therefore it is more streamlined to
exclude manual test cases as part of an
automated test launch so in the test set
run window user can select which
automated test case to execute after
clicking on run these test cases will be
executed in the order of which it is
listed a couple of things to know is
test cases added after a test run has
been created will not be included in the
original test run this is by design so
if you have created a test run and you
want to add to the scope you need to
create a new testament also just to note
if the requirement is to run automated
test cases in parallel this can be
achieved by going to the tests tab and
scheduling the test cases to run at the
same time on different otm agent servers
in 1203 we have changed the way that
test set run details and results are
presented in twelve thousand and twelve
to clicking on the test run link under
run history section will display the
result parameters and result detail
sections in 12 3 this information is now
presenting a pop-up window the test that
runs summary is display in the header
section for that particular test run
with the results for each test case
displayed
clicking on a manual test case will show
the test that results under the result
details the section and clicking on an
automated test case will display the
open script result report under the
result details section in 12-3 you can
now pause and resume a test set for
manual test cases this is achieved the
same way as in previous releases
clicking on the Save Run button will
save the current test results to resume
the run simply click on the green arrow
icon next to the manual test case please
note that the progress indicator bar
will display incomplete status until all
test cases have been executed for
automated test cases clicking on the
pause button will instruct otm to pause
the execution after the currently
running test has completed in similar to
a manual test case the user can resume
run by either clicking on the green
arrow icon next to the test case or by
clicking on the launch link again the
difference between the two is clicking
on the green arrow icon will only kick
off that test however clicking on the
launch button will allow the user to
execute the remaining automated test
cases the progress bar indicator is
another enhancement we have added to otm
in the 12 dot 3 release the indicator
bar is display for each test run in the
run history section the progress bar
indicator will show green for past
yellow for warning red were filled and
purple for user-defined statuses a
floating tooltip will display the number
of test cases not run in this example
the floating tooltip shows that two out
of six test cases have not been run
which is approximately thirty-three
percent in order to control who can set
or override test results we have created
a new permission called set override
results by default the test row has this
permission and the set result link will
be grayed out for users who do not have
this permission users with this
permission can click on the set result
link and enter or / I results for the
test
the user can select a combination of
test cases from the test list and change
the status by default the test cases
which have been executed will be
unchecked this applies to both manual
and automated test cases the reason
behind this is because typically if the
test case execution has completed it is
unlikely that the user will update the
status under circumstances such as when
in automated test cases hung due to
network issues were other unforeseen
issues the test manager or someone with
override privilege can manually set the
test run results let's go ahead and demo
these features we have just talked about
hearing otm 12-3 we have a test set cost
load test let's go ahead and create a
test run for this test set I will go
ahead and call those the windows test
run and you'll see here that after the
test run has been created there will be
a link in the run history section for
that test run we can view the different
test runs by selecting them from the
drop-down and you can see here that for
each test run the test list is displayed
along with the owner for the test case
and the status of that test case for
that particular run in this case none of
the test cases have been executed and
therefore the status is not run let's go
ahead and run a manual test case from
the test list by clicking on the green
arrow icon next to the test case
and you can see here that as we complete
the test that one resolve for each test
step the result is being saved over here
to the database this is another feature
that we will talk about in later slides
otm now has a autosave feature for
manual test run execution here we have a
blue checkmark which indicates the last
change to the test step status has been
saved a green check mark with a timer
icon indicates the autosave for the
current test step status is pending so
let's go ahead and set everything is
passed and save the result let's go
ahead and run another manual test case
but this time we will pause the run
so in order to pause the manual test
case simply click on the save rent one
you will see here that the status is
still in progress for the manual test
case to resume the run click on the
green arrow icon and continue where you
have left off
similarly for automated test cases you
can also click on the green arrow icon
to launch these test cases individually
or if you want to run the automated test
cases sequentially you can click on the
launch button and select the automated
test cases to run by default the manual
test cases will be grayed out because
they should be executed individually
outside of the tests that run window now
here we can select which automated test
case to run and since none of them have
been executed because they have the
status of not run I will go ahead and
run it all at the same time note that
the automated test cases on this list
will be executed sequentially so in
order to pause and automate a test case
execution click on the pause button that
you see in this window and what will
happen is otm will pause the test case
execution after the currently running
test case has completed since we had
three automated test cases on the list
it will finish executing the first one
and then pause the execution of the
remaining two another new feature we
having 12 3 is the progress bar
indicator this progress bar indicator
will be displayed for each test run it
will show green four paths yellow for
warning red for failed and if there were
any user defined statuses they will be
displayed in purple also in 12 dot 3
when you click on a test run link under
the run history section a pop-up window
will appear and display the test run
status for that particular run the list
of test cases will be displayed and the
ones that have been executed or are in
progress will have a link that you can
click on to view the status let's go
ahead and click on the link for a manual
test case and you will see that for each
test step
the test step result is displayed in the
result details section for an automated
test case when you click on the link it
will display the open script result
report in the result detail section
let's quickly jump back to the
presentation in 1203 the test tab right
click menu have some new additions and
changes this right click menu is
displayed when you highlight a test case
from the tree view and click on the
right mouse fun first and foremost is
the quick run menu option has now been
renamed to run tests this change was
made so that the naming convention falls
in line with the run tests that right
click menu option from the test
execution tab for new menu options were
added and they are at tests as child
which adds a new test case as a child of
the currently selected test case Multi
edit tests which allows user to select
multiple test cases by holding down the
shift or ctrl key while clicking on the
test cases and then doing a book edit
rename tests which allows user to rename
the test case without seeing the other
fields in the test case and paste this
child which pays a copy of the test case
as a child of the currently selected
test case let's go ahead and quickly
take a look at these menu options the
first menu option we will take a look at
is ADD test as child the first thing you
need to do is highlight the test folder
or test case that you want to be the
parent right-click and select add Tess's
child and then complete the fields for
the new test case
you see here that the new test case has
now been added as a child of the
selected test folder the next menu
option we will take a look at is multi
edit tests to do so hold down the shift
key and then select the test cases that
you want to book edit alternatively you
can hold down the control key to have
more control over the test cases that
you want to edit after the test cases
are highlighted right click and select
multi edit tests this is actually not a
new feature this feature has existed in
previous releases however not a lot of
users are aware of it that's why we have
placed the feature in the right-click
menu option so over here you can select
the field that you want to edit in bulk
and then update that field the next menu
option we will take a look at is renamed
test this is pretty straightforward
basically you right-click and select
rename test and a pop-up will appear for
you to rename the test case
the next menu option we will take a look
at is pace s child and this is very
straightforward also basically you
highlight the test case that you want to
copy right click and select copy or you
can click on the copy icon here from the
menu bar then you select the test case
that you want to be the parent test case
so in this example I want to paste that
test case in this test folder right
click and then select paste this child
that will paste the test case that you
have copied as a child of the
highlighted test folder so let's quickly
jump back to the presentation the
autosave feature for manual tests is new
to 12 dot 3 and we've already talked
about this earlier this was added so
users will not lose manual test results
in case they accidentally click on the
cancel button or in cases where there is
a network issue or when the user session
times out a backup copy of tests if data
is saved along the way when the run
manual test window opens changes are
saved to the database when comments or
result is updated for test step as
mentioned previously a blue checkmark
indicates the last change to the test if
status has been saved in a green
checkmark with a timer icon indicates
the autosave for the current test of
status is pending the clone project
feature has been enhanced in 1203 to
allow the otm administrator to clone an
existing project data in structure to a
new project in the database prior to 12
3 only the project structure was cloned
and data such as requirements test plans
test cases issues reports and dashboards
were not cloned in 1203 the
administrator can click on the clone
button and select the data they want to
copy please note that if there is an
association between two modules and one
of the module was not selected then the
association will be removed for example
if there is a test case linked to a
requirement and only test cases are
being copied then that association will
be removed
after cloning is completed a
confirmation window will appear and
report the number of entities being
cloned the muni clone project will
appear in the project list and user will
see the clone data in the new project
currently all data can be cloned by this
feature in cloning is only possible
within the same database schema so let's
go ahead and take a quick look at the
Cologne project feature we will go ahead
and login to the otm administrator
console after logging in go to the
project's tab select the project that
you want to clone and click on a clone
button the clone button was actually in
previous releases as well and as
mentioned prior to 12 dot 3 when a
project is cloned only the project
structure is being cloned and not the
data so the new feature in 12 dot 3 is
when you click on the clone button you
now have the opportunity to select which
project data you want to copy over to
the new project and by default all of
these options are selected except for
tests run history you can uncheck any of
these options that you wish or you can
keep them all selected if you want to
copy over all the data so here in the
project name feel you will enter the
name of the new project and then select
ok a pop-up window will appear and
display how much data was copied over to
the new project so now here in the
project list you will see the new
project that has been cloned and
everything should remain the same such
as the role the permissions of the users
of the fields if we log back into otm we
can now see the clone project and all
the data from the parent project
