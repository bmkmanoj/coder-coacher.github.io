presents working with threaded and
ranked facebook comments in facebook
threaded comments allow users to reply
directly to another fans comments and
start threaded conversations making it
easier to interact directly with
individual readers and keep relevant
conversations connected also the
original comment that receives the most
feedback is ranked as the most popular
rising to the top of the comments the
engage tool gives you various options
for working with the threading features
and in this demo will show you how to
use engage to respond to and manage
threaded and ranked facebook comments
the first step is to ask your Facebook
administrator to verify that the feature
is set up on your page in facebook go to
edit page edit settings and then click
the replies check box to allow replies
to comments on my page this feature is
not retroactive and applies only to new
posts going forward once that is set up
go to engage and find a social property
that you own let's take a look at this
post that has a lot of activity you can
take various actions on this post as
shown in this drop-down if you want to
respond to this particular comment then
click the arrow to post your reply
our reply is posted below the original
comment in chronological order at the
end of the list let's see how this looks
in facebook click view post to go
directly to their Facebook post and here
is our reply posted under the original
comment these comments are also ranked
and ordered by Facebook a post will only
rank if it has 10 comments or more and
the ranking can be affected by the
number of likes and replies to that
comment typically the comment at the top
of the list has ranked the highest
ranking is a great way to see customer
engagement but sometimes there is
important information in responses that
are ranked lower in the list we have a
feature that makes it really easy for
you to see any unread comments to a
particular Facebook post back and engage
choose your social property and then
click unread messages under the inbox
any post has unread messages is
displayed and the number of unread
messages is shown at the left of the
entry here is an unread message and the
posts that we just viewed in facebook if
I view the post now the unread message
is highlighted in a darker blue and it's
easier to find in the list because
engage automatically scrolls to the
first unread comment reply or other
activity so that you know what is new
and has not yet been read by a member of
your team one more thing if you want to
have replies enabled on your Facebook
page but still prefer to view your
comments chronologically unlike Facebook
we offer you the ability to view
messages chronologically and engage to
change your settings go to work flow and
automation and click the channels tab
find the social property you want to
modify and in the right click Edit the
dialog opens that lets you choose if you
want to view the comments and ranked or
chronological order remember that what
you set here does not change the order
on the native facebook page it only
changes the way you view this post in
the end
eh tool click save after you've made
your selection the comments will now be
listed in chronological order when you
view them and engage so that's how easy
it is to work with threaded and ranked
facebook comments using the engage tool
be sure to see our documentation and
