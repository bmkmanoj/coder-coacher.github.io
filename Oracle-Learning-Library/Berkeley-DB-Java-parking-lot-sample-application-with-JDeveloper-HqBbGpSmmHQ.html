and run the Berkeley DB draw a sample
program in the jdeveloper ide in a
previous tutorial we have already built
its necessary Berkeley DB libraries and
copy them to the sample programs
directory so let's open to a developer
the import the project now we are ready
to import and run the sample program in
jdeveloper click file open navigate to
your sample programs directory and open
the project file
we have not opened the application yet
jdeveloper we'll ask you to create a new
application give our new application a
name and click ok now we need to
configure our sample program to use
Berkeley DB libraries from the context
menu click project properties select
libraries and the classpath add jar
directory and select the two drive fails
built from Berkeley DB release package
now we need to create a run
configuration to run our sample program
click run management configurations
create a new configuration
edited now we need to set the default
run target to the parking demo class
also add the simple programs root
directory and the native library pause
now we can run the sample program
program has read successfully let's take
a quick look to the output of the sample
program the sample program simulates
five cars entering and leaving a parking
lot when each car enters the parking lot
it gets a ticket with a unique ticket ID
when it leaves the parking lot it pays
its parking fee based on how long it
stays in the parking lot before wrapping
up the tutorial i will also like to show
you how to select the EP is used to run
a sample program over the parking demo
class by default the sequel p is used
which means to use the JDBC driver for
example can change it to base to use the
basic key value API
or we can change it to DPL to use the
direct precision layer API now this
wraps up the tutorial thank you for your
time for more information on Berkeley DB
and the sample program please visit our
OT n website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
