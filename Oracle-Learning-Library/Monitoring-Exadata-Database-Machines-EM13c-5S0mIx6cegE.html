cloud control 13c demo series once
you've discovered your Exadata target
use the targets Exadata menu option to
open the Oracle Exadata database
machines page then click through on the
Exadata DBM of interest the Exadata DBM
schematic is displayed on the home page
a new feature in cloud control 13c is
the ability to display a photo realistic
view of the hardware showing both the
front and the back of the machine use
the zoom radio buttons to zoom in on
this view of the DBM hovering over the
components shows you their name for
example this switch this PDU and the
second PDU in the case of this
particular PD you the component is
outlined in red to indicate there's an
incident associated with it
clicking on it will display the details
clicking on the link to the critical
incident count will open a list of
incidents for this target clicking on an
individual incident causes the details
to be displayed in this case a phase
Hardware threshold overrun returning to
the Exadata DBM home page if we switch
back to the schematic representation we
can still hover over components to see
information about them we can also see a
software view of the Exadata database
machine by selecting the software view
tab here we see our ASM target and our
rack database which in this case is a
container database with pluggable
database using the database machine menu
we can take a look at resource
utilization for this DBM this is showing
us the CPU utilization graph with more
information displayed as we hover over
the graph we can switch to another
perspective such as memory utilization
again with more information available
when we hover over the graph also new in
cloud control 13c is the option to
perform software updates on your Exadata
database machine
quarterly full-stack updates will be
shown here where you'll be able to apply
them also new in cloud control 13 C is
the systems infrastructure plug-in that
provides you with detailed information
about your hardware components such as
your compute nodes as with the overall
database machine you can see a photo
realistic view of the hardware as well
as basic specifications in the dashlets
at the top of the page the number of
open incidents is displayed we can click
through to see more detail
returning to the components homepage
notice that hovering over the
photorealistic view displays information
about that target any component with an
active incident will be outlined in red
we can use the controls under the
dashlets to view more dashlets besides
the hardware view we can select the
logical View tab to view tabulated
information about this Database Machine
component we can see CPU details
including part numbers and locations
similarly for memory we see detailed
information about each memory module all
of this detailed information about your
hardware is provided by the systems
infrastructure plug-in from the database
machine target navigation tree we can
open the exa data storage server grid
home page here were presented with
information such as capacity either as
physical or virtual space for i/o
distribution were shown the flash i/o
service and wait times the performance
graph shows data for both flash and hard
disks the i/o activity section presents
IO utilization data from the navigation
tree we can open the home page for an
individual storage cell where we see the
same information presented for the
storage grid but at the individual cell
level from the storage server menu we
can perform administration tasks such as
managing i/o resources in this case the
disk i/o objective is automatic we could
add a plan for an individual database by
selecting the data
and entering the plan parameters
clicking update will apply the plan but
in this case we'll just remove the plan
without applying it you can access the
database Resource Management settings
from this page if you wish the workload
distribution section shows you various
metrics for both hard and flash drives
this information can help you develop
your IO resource management plans
especially the graphs depicting the top
five databases that are consuming your
resources new and enterprise manager
cloud control 13 C is the flash cache
space usage tab where you can see
current usage metrics as well as
historic metric data the historic data
can be used for determining flash cash
resource limits for example we see that
the DB MC DB database usage hasn't risen
above a thousand megabytes
therefore that'd be a reasonable limit
to set the exa data storage server
performance page displays graphs of
various metrics for both flash and hard
drives by electing to show the total
maximum cel disk limit the lower graphs
are changed to display totals instead of
maximums with the disk limits
represented by red lines the maximum cel
disk limit lines for i/o per second and
megabytes per second are per the
datasheet for this specific Exadata
configuration check the average i/o
utilization in conjunction with the
maximum cel disk limit to identify if
your workload is reaching Hardware
limits new and Cloud Control 13 see is
the flash log tab here we see our flash
storage operating at 100% efficiency
which is ideal any outliers will be
displayed in the outlier graphs the CPU
tab displays CPU utilization for this
storage server from the target
navigation panel we can navigate to the
home page for a database that's running
on our Exadata database machine in this
case the DB mcdb
container database note that from the
database administrators menu we can
navigate directly to the Exadata home
pages
if we navigate to the performance page
of a database instance and view the i/o
tab we see buttons that will display the
Exadata system health and the Exadata
system performance pages in this case
the Exadata system health button is red
indicating that there is an open
critical alert clicking through will
open the Exadata storage server system
page where we see that a disk is offline
for that reason the health overview
graph is red thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
