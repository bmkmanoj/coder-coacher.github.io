my name is angel they say with me I have
Simon Twitter we were actually in Java
evangelist at Oracle and it's a great
pleasure to be here today so extreme GUI
makeover um so I think this is kind of a
legendary talk at JavaOne it's been very
popular in the past and I'm trying to do
something a little bit different I know
because the previous one where you know
popular enough but because a lot of the
things were already done I wanted to do
something different so normally in the
past would happen is the speaker just
take a present a ah an application and
UI and just turn that UI into something
more beautiful right using Java effects
something will is stunning I wanted to
create a stunning applications from the
scratch show you something ok if I
really want to take advantage of Java
effects what are the components I want
to bring into my UI to really make
stylish great-looking UI so what I'm
trying to bring here is something a
little bit different and I hope you
enjoy um so what I'm going to do to
begin with I'm going to start with the
demos I want to show you what are we
going to be using for the talk hopefully
you don't leave after seeing the demos
but I hope you still put all of it
basically the two main points for
creating these user interfaces will be
styling them and we're going to use CSS
so we're going to talk like the basics
top tip the most important stuff for CSS
how you can create a scheme for your UI
and make it look really impressive and
then the second one I really think that
given the power of Java FEX animations
how you can use that into your UI design
how you can really have your components
dropping or having your screen moving
around a little bit so think about a
little bit of unconventional you eyes
and looking into okay how can I bring
effect how can I bring animation and if
I have conventional components how do I
make it look great using CSS so that's
pretty much a little bit of the top
the two demos that I'm going to present
were actually built by me and I actually
ended up having two approaches and I
think is I found that I mean I've been
talking to their colleagues okay which
one should I go forward and I really see
that both approaches are actually useful
for different scenarios so I actually
wanted at the end to show you okay so
this is what happened at the end you can
either do that or Buddha out duties and
these are the reason behind us so it's a
little bit from my experience what do I
think you can actually do tools if you
think about it for JavaFX we have the
scene builder to have effects scene
builder and I have to say I'm an
evangelist but I'm a developer so as you
see all the demos I represent are built
by me not by anybody here so if you
raise any critics welcome I'm the only
one to blame but what I really want to
tell you share with you guys the tools
are being really really important in the
creation of these it's like it will take
me 100 times longer to create the UI's
if I didn't have the same builder so I
really think that there is a really
powerful combination between NetBeans
and sim builder to create this type of
UI and I think it will save you a lot of
time okay so the first demo is the CD
explorer so you can see that I didn't
want to use a conventional menu item if
you want to know how to customize the
main menus you can go to last year tour
the previous year top and you can
definitely find something like that so
what I wanted to do is I'm not
conventional I think from my point of
view is very easy to navigate even
though there is no conventional you can
feel like okay there is Explorer there's
places to go there is weather and also
series to change so even though is
simplified is modern it is actually
intuitive somebody that hasn't used it
know how to navigate for this one
pretty much the whole screen the whole
application is loaded in the background
it's a big image and I just have a
viewport and I just navigate through it
and we will see more details about that
a lot of animations so changing from one
is great to another I'm going to do an
animation
things like that and I really think
technology's come along together and so
this is not the case of just using
JavaFX so for example for places we're
going to see how html5 and JavaScript
gotta play in this application so these
are the different screens once you go to
individual screens you can really see
CSS styling the components so we're
going to see how you can actually change
the components the shape of it the
coloring and stuff like that so you can
see it in the in the combo box for the
map itself so that's what we use in
html5 and JavaScript so that's pretty
much the components transparency so I
think there is something really powerful
we have effects with JavaFX so we can
see that we have reflection for the maps
we have transparency for the components
and all that is given and again setting
those on sim builder is just a matter of
clicking something or changing the
opacity when it's live art on the sim
builder so there's not much programming
really to do actually to be honest with
you when building a demo like this 90
percent of the time is coming up with
the graphics ten percent is really
putting things together with the tools
but it's more time consuming the
graphics the second demo we wanted to do
a casino application and the reason for
this demo is we wanted to have gesture
recognition so instead of using
conventional Mouse I have my friend
Simon rated who always think about crazy
stuff and there is a session at 3
o'clock that actually take you into
details about how we build the interface
so you can actually do gestures use
gestures to move around the application
so just a main menu at the bottom that's
the only one we use otherwise everything
it will be with gestures the menu are
not visible they are sliding menu so I
think this is very convenient even from
the bottom or from the side
you can hide it so just slide into menus
where they don't have it there all the
time
they're semi-transparent bars so
transparency again really powerful for
me
these animations going on so you don't
want to miss that so by bringing in a
transferring for I think you used to
appreciate the background while we are
selecting your options customize button
so you can actually create your own
bottoms again reflection is given you
can actually have sunnin as you approach
with the mouse push effect when you
select something so it is actually nice
human interaction as I say we have
gesture recognition using that we
removed and we have no russki that is
kind of a mind-reader
so again that far will be in our next
talk at 3 o clock these are the screens
um that were created for the casino
application pretty much the first one
has the menu on the left and white the
other screens do not have a menu we have
the blackjack with actually a lot of
animations going on just way too many
animations we're going to see how Java
FEX was very very handy in terms of how
do we play animation sequentially if I'm
getting the cars to the play okay once I
finish one car let's go to the next one
so a lot of animations going on really
nicely but if you need it originally I
wanted to do more conventional you ice
like the one you saw for the for the
roulette so you can see that you can
actually mix and match a nice animation
you are with a more you know come on you
I like the user you know type of the
user information or how much you want to
bet in the in the game etc so I bien I
ended up removing that part because we
wanted to play with gestures we didn't
want to type or anything like that but
that's kind of do demos so let me show
them actually in real time
okay good could it start going to start
the presentation let me crush it
I do have a back-up plan
my machine just refuses to war we still
have Simon's so
so this is the first one so again very
intuitive you can go to explore and it
just slide in you have shopping eating
you can take you can actually customize
the tabs you can go to shopping you can
go to places where you can actually
select which one so again this is
plaintiff area with html5 then you can
get these you can actually change so you
see how all the components have been
customized let's go to one by beach
that's a nice want to go so it's
actually all nice together you can
actually go and see the weather again
for the weather or this is being
customized so you actually create a
coloring for these are we're going to
see more details about that or you can
go ahead and change the city for example
go to Melbourne and then you just change
it to city and again go through so very
simple UI but I just want to get out of
the box a little bit unclear a different
and different presenting different
application and then the casino war
we didn't even have enough time to build
to put a music into it I think it would
be really great to have music into this
application so you can play for example
oh and I was playing with some own
business these things are not supposed
to be here but anyway you see the idea
of how you can actually do your beds and
have the house to deliver the card for
you you know have animations for doing
dad
I'm just just applications and last one
we just threw the lid on you know so
anyway the points that I wanted to do is
very unconventional applications that
you can do a JavaFX will be very handy
so first part using CSS to configure to
change the look and feel of your of your
application so the whole idea is really
create your custom scheme we're going to
see how to do creating your own styles
you can create your own definition or
you can override existing ones something
that comes very handy when I was
building this is the default one that is
being used in Java faith is Caspian so
what I normally do I bring in the CSS
file and just check it out if I want to
customize a component except for what
what you can actually customize and just
have that as a boyfriend it was great
for me at least for me when I was
creating this CSS in Java FEX
application is very similar to CSS in
HTML there are a few changes and I'm
actually going to point those out for
you it is based on CSS version 2.1 spec
that's the URL and again there's some
additions for the part about the current
version 3 and there are also some
specific elements just to provide some
JavaFX features so there are some even
though there are very close or vet based
on CSS for HTML just make sure that you
understand there some difference and
again the entire look and feel of your
application will change as by changing
the CSS file that you're using the style
that you're using why we're using it so
it's at mind specific is actually really
good to declare all visual effects you
really power designers you can bring you
can just have the designers create that
for you and you just use it so it's
actually a good separation between
designers and the programmers it's a
standard so everybody wanna works with
the standards and it's actually widely
adopted so how does it work so we are
going to create CSS stars and the way it
is going to work is these styles are
going to be applied in the nodes of your
scene graph so remember that in Java
affects all your UI is actually is
actually created a
in a scene graph so the way they did the
styles are application and apply to the
note of that particular scene graph
again first they are going to be applied
to the parents and then down to their
children's so it you know will have two
different things one thing is it has the
style class and also an ID and we're
going to see that you can actually
create a stars for both depending on the
style class all dependent or depending
on the ID of the component so you have
different option or some I I would work
a little bit more about that so create
your own style sheet where your defaults
or override that you for once create
your own styles and then put all that in
a CSS file and then have your
application point to it so how does it
work you have a your java effects
application so very simple application
and how the stage you have one label you
add the label to the state and you just
show it right very basic Java fix if you
want to bring your CSS files into it you
just have to get the styles once you get
the stars you add the CSS files that you
want the style they want to be used to
the see what do you and again all that
so this slide you can actually if you're
using Java Phet sim builder you don't
even need to write that slide all you
have to do is I'm going to point it out
is reference what is the CSS files that
you want to use and the code will be
generated for you it will be included
into the F XML file that it get
generated by scene builder so what
you're going to do is you're going to
define the Stars right and how do you
decide to find the stars you need to
define how you're going to apply this
tops right who is going to be changed by
these stars so this is what we call the
selector right so this is what we
actually March the we denote it is in
the
Cinque ruff so there are different
possibilities for example will you
designing you can set that label and
then this up is this define your style
this will apply to any node that has a
star class label you can up sure that
you can also do it by number and then
the name for example this will actually
reference all the nodes in the scene
graph that has an ID as a title right so
this is how you're going to apply the
styles to your nose if you define a
style that is with a Sorak it will apply
to all the nodes you can also have
States so for example you can apply a
particular style once the label is being
hovered right so you can do things like
that this is that would be apply
whenever you over on the label you can
actually hope have compound styles so
think about the checkbox also have a
label inside so how you're going to rent
there are you going to stop the label
that is inside the check box so this is
how you're actually cement the node in
your scene group where you're going
where your style is going to take place
and this is the syntax so you have the
rule you have the selector that we were
mentioning in this case the selector is
label and then you do have a silver
class that is over and all you have
inside is the definition of your stuff
so what you saying is this particular
rule will apply to anything that is
still belong so it is label type so it
comes from label it's going to apply up
phone size of 18 form family we're going
to use Arial the width of the weight of
the of the of the lines and then the
fill in color okay we're going to see
later on that we do have a gradients so
you can actually have a nice effect not
just applying colors or stuff like that
for example if you want to have a label
that has the linear gradient so this is
actually what we're going to to have in
this case from top to bottom is turning
from red to
right and then again some phones aside
correct information for that later so
and this will apply to all the labels
that you have on your app UI ok this one
when you use by default label will
overwrite will overwrite the definition
that we have four lanes so this is
overriding all the labels you might want
to keep some of the labels with the
predefined style so you can do that the
thing that you need to do is when you
create this tile just make sure you use
a different name so only the labels that
has this particular style class
associated to it will be modified okay
so one thing is overriding the default
ones or creating your newest outs so in
this one you're creating a new one and
you do have to apply so label down here
by default won't pick up my label style
because it would pick up the previous
lock it will pick up label one so the
way to added that particular style to
your label will be either through these
line where you actually get this file
class and add that result to it or also
doing them seeing builder I'm going to
show you so two different approaches so
simple there I just I just love it so if
you pay attention to the right-hand side
you have the whole session for CSS it is
aware the ample time as we actually ask
it how she did what
so this is where rather than do editing
code you can come to see really you
compute accurate I'll go to the CSS
section and here it's all cheetah you're
going to be using to all your
application okay for a particular
component for example delay then you
will go to his heart
okay so that's what you could for
example this little Israelis my late
notice also that you have asked student
employment ID so we members you also
apply either by star plus 4 by on and
you do have access to all that to send
over this is just a pretty much the same
things so here you're just starting at
age 12 you just on plus if you want this
case the dark on it and to assign
everything to your night your
application just make sure you take a
name container in this case is
uncontainable by default so just make
sure that the anchor panel level you
specify the CSS files that you're going
to be using if you want to set the
styles without having to create a CSS
file you can do so so you can actually
set the styles of you of your component
directly in your code I do not recommend
it because you do you won't be reusing
really styles among the components but
it's an option that you have if you just
want to maybe customize one or two
components there's something to you can
think of so what do we have different so
I think the most powerful things that we
have is the idea of creating new colors
from am existing ones so we can derive a
color from an existing one we're going
to see that you can have a larger so
there is a lot of function that take a
think about like a gradient and from
that gradient you're going to pick a
color between that line right is not
that you're creating a gradient is like
you create a gradient from dad for
example remember the label you created
from red to black so I created the same
and what you're doing is you're picking
a value between that and you're creating
a new color from that you know line of
colors that you have so you can actually
create new colors from existing one
gradients we have linear radial multiple
background fills so this is actually
very very useful when you are for
example is styling a button you can
actually have multiple layers of colors
so you can actually play and kind of
create the effect of having border so
highlights stuff like that and I have a
little bit more of that later on effects
again pretty powerful you have shadows
and inner shadows so this is a little
bit more information about the different
options that you have for creating for
example new colors so you can derive
from a particular color and you provide
a percentage that percentage keep go
from minus one hundred to one hundred so
going to to one hundred we just go make
the color point I'm on the positive
value it will make your color Neider
if you go all the way to the end two
hundred it will just return you white
completed and if you go to the other
side to the negative value as you go it
will get dark it all the way till you
get one hundred percent minus hundred
percent which is actually returned black
and we're going to see it's actually
very very useful when you're creating
your install one of the things that I
like I've seen it before is to define
one may call for example the screens
that I want to do are going to be kind
of blackish color so I want to open the
term of blogs and great slighted on
darker so you define one color at the
top and everybody all the definitions
that do you that you do can be actually
depending on that can be derived from
that could be a gradient for that color
so you're going to see how you can just
change my color and that will actually
generate a complete new style for your
application so it's actually really
powerful what you can do with these
functions leather I pretty much explain
it so it just interpolate between colors
so think about it like a gradient
squared but you actually get us a return
one value one code that is pick up from
that line so either zero or 100 does
depend when you step on that line the
kind of color the color that you are
actually getting you have linear
gradients and radial ones I don't want
to step too much into details of the
syntax because I'm going to show a lot
of our code that has them being used so
the first one you want to spell a
particular time so as I say it's very
important that you define for example a
mustard color in your route the route is
gonna apply to everybody right so
everybody will have access to the master
hole okay so I define you we're ready
depending of that color make it very
useful
everybody kind of that for if I change
that to red the entire interface you
change right so we will be generated and
he'll create Facebook where rather I
think it's actually waiting all beauties
to notice it when I'm playing with CSS
um what I like to do is I want to
exaggerate a little bit so I know
exactly what's happening right once I
know that everything is correct
I put an order so for example you can
see that the background is very thick
but that was the only way to know for
example that to set up our rounded
corners for your panel you need to set
both the background radius and the
border radius so if you don't take both
of them so an example if you don't put
the background radios you're going to
see how it doesn't render how I want it
that was having you know render cook
ware rounded corners right so I think
it's very useful to have things like
that just just exaggerate or use
different color so you know exactly what
is popping up Porter will and another
trick that I always do is I fill out the
border with the opposite color that I do
for the background so for example since
that the background I have
a radial gradient that is start from
light gray to darker and I use the same
color in the border but they opposite so
I start with the darker one I end up
with the light one but it doesn't come
trust completely
nicely during the whole shape right so
you'll never have like two colors that
are the same so you kind of lose the
border so I think it's a good trick you
don't have to spend a lot of time on how
to design thing just getting one color
apply to the opposite to the border and
it kind of stand up a little bit for
multiple backgrounds again this is ugly
but it's really good to show you what
it's actually happening so remember how
you can have multiple backgrounds so
this is exactly what is happening you
apply multiple backgrounds the first one
is red the second one is blue then you
apply the white one and then you apply
the green one right so what is happening
is you're actually really doing a shadow
with the first one with the red you
actually do create in an outer border
with the blue you quit in an inner
border with the white and finally you're
painting the background with the green
so you can really see what's going on
but by setting these right of course
when you want you have the colors that
you want just put it to you know normal
coloring take out all them and just have
a nice result so for example for for the
panel at the bottom of our presentations
again I have a master color block and if
you just by changing the color to red
dark dark red you have the result on the
bottom
because all the new colors that are used
in my style depend on that using the
function is either derive if you want to
have the same one or just a little bit
lighter just arrive and use a particular
value etc so again see how devoted
colors is using four colors so things
like that for example again a bit more
of of ideas here for your query you see
us at your Styles so you have my partner
exactly what do you want over there
remember we mentioned we have shadows so
you can see how we have an effect that
is the drop shadow and the values are
you're going to have so you can see here
that at the bottom your panel is using
Dallas tiles see how it's nicely has
that particular shadow background color
so again in this case we have three
colors and then one in the middle is
lighter so it kind of stand out a little
bit and then be careful with the
background radios what I did is I did
different radios for the background so
each color I'll actually have a
different radio so there are kind of a
little bit of smaller so you can really
see the the day effect so you can see
the line the white line kind of has a
space in between the border and the line
so you actually really make your
component pop up a little bit so just
mastering so what we're seeing you can
do something like that again this is all
using the black mustard color block and
just using the functions to to just
generate you can customize the labels
least everything tap top anything you
can think of with that I'm going to pass
it to some of them it's going to talk a
little bit more than okay I have a
beautiful CSS file now how do I bring
the animation sort of the things that
the whistle okay so as Angela said we
talked a little bit about some of the
other kinds of things you can do in
terms of making the UI more effective
and it's very interesting study from my
point of view to look at way things have
gone in terms of design the user
interface is over sort of like the last
few years because we've had a big swing
swing yet we were a big swing away from
doing a big swing towards more graphical
interfaces and more visually appealing
interfaces the way that I would describe
them and really that's been not about
adding two different effects
things and what we're now seeing is
somewhat are swinging away from that
back to more cleaner interfaces and
trying to avoid overuse of the kinds of
effects that there are so if you look at
something like the what used to be
called Metro but I don't know what it's
called now interface that's a much more
clean interface they've really gone away
from using a lot of shadows and using a
lot of you know visual type of effects
on the components and try to make it a
cleaner look the interface but it's
still a great deal that you can do in
terms of making visually appealing
applications using different types of
effects so so what we're looking at is
how to take advantage of the things that
you can do in terms of the facilities
that you've got in the underlying
operating system so one of the things
now is that unlike in the good old days
of sort of x11 and window managers we
now have the ability to actually say
okay I want my application to be
presented but I don't want the window
frame around it so if it's a okay make
me a nice clean interface where I don't
have the decoration of the window around
it and then we get a sort of just the
application sitting on top of desktop
and you get a cleaner look to it the
other thing with that is that by not
having the decoration of the window
manager around it
you're also not restrained in terms of
it being of rectangular interface so if
you wanted to you can make your
interface any shape you like because now
you're not sticky inside a rectangle so
that's one of the things that's an
interesting thing that you can consider
and so in terms of Java effects
basically as I hope you already know
you're using a scene graph and that
scene graph is presented on a stake so
the way that we take care of the
different aspects of that what we're
going to do is we say in terms of the
stage we initialize the style as being
transparent and so we can say okay we
can have transparent style applied to
that we can set the fill to be null so
that can be making that clean as well
and you could say okay I don't want to
have decoration on
the window and things like that and so
that's that's pretty easy in terms of
just changing the look of the app holder
itself so the other things that you can
do are to give more sort of feedback if
you like around certain elements of the
UI so things that we've done angela has
done in terms of the interface that we
designed for the casino we're is to have
things like dynamic menus rather than
having a menu stuck on the display what
happens is when you move the cursor down
to the bottom of the display or to the
side display it moves in dynamically and
then you can select something and then
it disappears again so good idea in
terms of design for that is because
you're not taking up real estate all the
time so you can limit the visibility of
your menu only to when it's actually
required and that's pretty easy in terms
of saying okay want to animate that
talked a little bit about that moment in
terms of how you move things and so on
but the other things you can do are
things like the buttons I'm thinking
carefully about what makes sense from a
user's perspective to have them
attracted to a button or understand
which button is about to be pressed so
there's things like as you move the
mouse over a particular button that
button becomes brighter so you can
change the transparency of it to make it
look more obvious in that way you can
make easier for the user of your
application to understand you know which
button they're about to press it's all
the little things in terms of trying to
help the user see what things they're
going to be using how they're going to
be using them so you've got things like
you know zoom in feature so you can
actually change the size of button so it
becomes more obvious when you push up up
change the effect on it so it becomes
obvious of that but it's being pushed
simple things like that and then the
classic reflection that we've seen so
much probably one of the biggest
contributions that Apple it made in
terms of user interfaces is the fact
that we now have a little reflection
underneath everything in our display
so again this is one of those things
where you might want to consider it is
less more now in terms of transparency
one of the great things about JavaFX is
that every component that you have in
your scene graph is a note and every
node has the set of properties
associated with it one of which is the
opacity or transparency of it and so you
can very easily say well I want this
particular component to have a certain
translucency to it we can set that value
between zero one to say zero means it's
completely invisible one means it's
completely opaque so you won't see
anything underneath it and then you can
vary that between zero one to give you a
different level of transparency and
because each node has a transparency or
opacity property associated with it that
means that you can also apply that
effect to a group of nodes at the same
time so if you've got your menu bar
which consists of a background a number
of different buttons rather than having
to go through and change the opacity of
each individual component you simply
change the opacity of the group which
contains all of those nodes and that
will automatically change all of them
together so the simple things like that
just when we're creating something like
a horizontal box layout manager we can
say okay well you're pasty of that to be
0.95 so there with a little bit of
visibility of what's underneath
similarly in terms of how you can go
about doing that you can either do it
explicitly in your code by setting a
value in the node that you're actually
doing or you can use something like the
scene builder and that becomes very easy
to set things like transparency like
reflection so example here is if you've
got a particular button and so we've got
the properties associated with that on
the right-hand side one of those you can
say the effect you want to add as a
reflection to add the reflection to your
set of effects that you're using and
then that will have a certain number of
properties associated with it as well so
you've got things like the top capacity
the bottom a pasty and and very
that's even you can change how big the
reflection is and things like that but
although that's very simple to do
through the scene builder and that will
generate for you an F XML file which
contains the information about what
you're doing in terms of your user
interface so if you don't want to go
through all the hassle of writing your
code explicitly you can use the scene
builder you can generate your F XML file
and have that generated automatically
and load it up when you want to write
similarly so this is again just to kind
of give the same programmatic idea so
we've really kind of cover that already
very much pointed going over that again
so let's talk a bit about animations
animations are very very useful in terms
of user interfaces and when we talk
about animations a lot of people
misunderstand the idea animations often
are associated with things like cartoons
where you've got something that changes
over time and it's an animation of a
cartoon so different frames give you
these sets of movement that's not really
what we're talking about in terms of
animations with JavaFX
yes you could do those types of
animations if you want to but most of
what we're talking about in terms of
animations with Java effects is
something where you're changing a
property of one of the nodes in one node
in your scene graph over time so that's
what we mean by an animations where you
are changing something over time and if
you go to the ensemble sample
demonstration application you can get
from the JavaFX website there's lots of
examples of various animations in there
so let's talk a little bit about some of
the the concepts involved in an
animation if you want to animate
something you're going to use the
timeline and what this effectively is is
the definition of a period of time in
terms of your application so you might
want to animate the change of the
opacity in a particular box you want to
change it as you move the
mouse-over but rather than having a
change instantly you want it to fade in
or fade out that requires certain amount
of time for the opacity to change now in
the old days typically what you do is
you write yourself a loop and then you
would just change the value of the
opacity in that loop maybe put a pause
in it and do things like that well you
can't really do that in JavaFX
I mean actually I'll start straight the
previous speaking trick you can do that
JavaFX but it becomes more complicated
because you have issues around factors
JavaFX like swing uses a single thread
model and if you start putting a loop in
the event
what is it affects me they dispatch
straight or the application production
say the JavaFX it ties up the redrawing
of the screen and you get all sorts of
problems because it doesn't look right
so you don't want to be doing things on
the application thread in terms of using
a loop so you need a timeline timeline
is designed to work with the application
thread in terms of not blocking
redrawing the screen and updates to the
display so you create a timeline and the
timeline is going to consist of a number
of key frames and these key frames are
where you want certain things to happen
or certain values to be at a specific
value so it should say certain
properties to have a specific value at a
particular point in time and that way
you can define as many key frames as you
want so if you would have lots of
different things changing over a period
of time you can and have lots of
different point in time and then for
each of those key frames you have one or
more key values and the key values are
the properties that you're going to
modify over the time that the timeline
is running that way you can specify okay
if I want to change the capacity here's
the starting value that I want is the
end value that I want those are your key
values you create key frame key frames
for that containing notes values and
then when you run the timeline the
timeline will vary the value that you
put into your key value between the
values that you specify and it will
handle all of the
the necessary looping if you like and
the variation in that property and then
the way that that happens can be changed
as well so you can have different
interpolators being used for how the
values change so you can use just a
straight linear interpolator where you
vary the value simply in a linear
fashion plot time against value it will
just be a straight line but you can also
use some nice effects which are easier
than ease out and what that does is it
sort of accelerates a little bit of the
beginning then it uses a linear change
in the decelerates at the end so if
you're doing some sort of moves that
often can be very useful because it
gives a nicer effect to the way things
look it's not just a straight change if
you can actually sort of start
accelerating in decelerating yet so
essentially you've got three different
things you're concerned with in terms of
animations if your timeline which is the
thing that's going to actually do the
variation of the properties you've got
your key frames which are the specific
points in time where you want things to
be true and then you've got your key
values which are the properties that
you're actually going to change so I
should really change the point size on
this it's a little bit too small and I
do apologize for that but it's actually
what we're doing here is looking how we
can move a circle from the left to the
right on the on the display so a little
looser or more to move it left to right
and what we actually want to happen is
for that to move to them from left to
right and then right to left back again
so we want it sort of bounce back and
forth we want to carry on for as long as
the application is running so what we do
is we create a circle and we set
whatever properties we want on that in
terms of lighting and color and so on
and then we need the property that is
going to represent the thing that we
want to change in this case we're
looking at the translate in the x axis
property where we translate on the x
axis so we can retrieve that from the
circle and that's a double property so
double value property the timeline is
going to use that and we're effectively
binding the property that we have to the
values are going to be
and so what we do is we create a
timeline we will call move timeline
that's going to have two key frames it
one key frame is going to be able time
zero seconds so that'll be able to start
off the timeline and that's going to
have key value which uses the exposition
which is our property about circle in
terms of translation on the x-axis and
we set that to zero so that'll be where
it starts from then we have another key
frame with a key value that uses the
same property X pause because we want to
vary the position on the x axis and
that's going to change to a value 205
and the time associated with that is
going to be a duration 4,000
milliseconds which is 4 seconds when we
run the timeline in fact before we run
the timeline we set the cycle count to
the timeline indefinite so that means it
will just continue up until the user
stops the application or the
University's thermal equilibrium
whichever happens first and then you can
also set Auto reverse to be true which
means that when you run the timeline it
gets to four seconds the value of x
pause is become 205 when it runs the
next iteration of timeline it will go
from 205 back to zero which is what we
want so we were to reverse the direction
removing it so you can set that by
setting Auto reverse and then when we
play that the timeline will actually
vary the value of x pause between zero
two hundred and five over four seconds
because it's a property of the circle
the circle will automatically be redrawn
in the correct position another example
of using a timeline and I should
increase the point size on this I do
apologize what you can also do is in
addition to having a key value
associated with your key frame you can
also say I want to have some action
happen so it's not just about changing
values it's also about saying well I
want something specific to happen that
particular time so you can define an
event handler and that will have a
method in it which is hackle and that is
what can be called at a specific point
on your timeline so very typical use of
that is that you vary the position of
your circle and at the end of the time
line you want something to happen now
with the time line
time lines asynchronous and that means
that when you call play on your time
line
it returns immediately so you can't say
okay well I'll call play and then I'll
wait until the animations finished
because the animation the timeline will
automatically return straight away so
you need somewhere knowing when the time
line is actually finished so you
typically do as you say in the launched
keyframe of my time line I'll add an
event handler so that I can then have a
method that will call something or do
something which is what I want to happen
at the end of the animation
so that's how you typically use an event
handler but you don't have to use it
that way you can put it anywhere in the
element wing the timeline itself there's
lots of possibilities that you can do
there one of the other things that we've
done in Java effects is we understand
that there are a number of typical kinds
of uses of timelines and these are
transitions so what we've done here is
to provide a set of in effect
prepackaged
timelines so you have number of
transitions that can do things like fade
so you can change the opacity you don't
have to get your pasty or a particular
object you just have the transition work
with the node itself you can do things
like a path and you can define a path on
which your known is going to move and
have a timeline transition handle that
automatically for you you can do things
like rotations scaling you can do
translations in terms of movie and all
of these are very flexible in terms of
the the various values you can specify
for them so you could say okay I passed
you to vary between you know 0.25 0.75
rather than PG 0 1 the other thing you
can do is you can put these together so
if you want to have a number of
different transitions
on your notes you can do that either in
parallel or sequentially so if you want
to have a fade and a scale at the same
time you have to transitions happening
parallel once those are finished you can
then have a translation that moves the
back somewhere else and that can happen
sequentially so it happens when the
first two running in parallel have
actually completed so you can nest them
you can do that arbitrarily you've got
complete flexibility on how you use
these and then because the the
transitions and timelines
you know transition is in effect a
subclass of timeline almost then you can
also include a timeline in with your
transitions so you could have a
transition and a timeline there's
something strange have those happen in
parallel what's that's completed you can
have another timeline happen sequential
there's lots of ways of mixing things
together this is just an example of how
we could use a translation so in this
case what I'm doing is I'm using the
translate transition builder to create a
new translation transition for my circle
I'm saying that the duration that's good
before seconds I'm specifying the start
and the end points of the x axis being
2318 timelines in definites a cycle
counts in definite auto reverse is true
so that's going to do the same thing as
I did with my timeline except I don't
have to create all the keyframes and the
key values and so I can just simply set
up the values that I won't have all that
transition and it's a lot simpler than
doing all the hard work with the
timeline just a simple example here of
how we can use a parallel transition
what we want to do is we want to have a
number of transitions happen on the same
node in this case I want to go a fade
translate rotate and scale probably a
little bit over the top of particular
component but it's an example so we have
four different translation or
transitions that are going to happen on
the same note and what we do here is we
say okay create a parallel transition
with all of those transitions involved
in it and it will run all of them at the
same time again you don't have to create
the timelines you don't have to do all
the complexities of that it happens
automatically underneath and then again
you can set cycle count and then you
just play that parallel transition how
we can use that in terms of the user
interface that actually developed for
our casino is if we want to have our
menu slide in and slide out so we move
the mouse to the edge of the screen we
want to have the menu side in when we
move the mouse away or to have a slide
out so we can create an animation where
we're doing a translation transition
we'll change the Y value so we can move
it off the edge of the screen
John reflects doesn't care where you put
things it's quite happy to put things
way off the screen if you want to less
work for Java effects so it doesn't have
to render them and then what we can do
in terms of showing a particular or
showing the menu is we set the the rate
to be 1 to indicate the rate is positive
so it will move in a particular
direction and then we play that and then
we want to move it back this is almost
like the auto reverse we set the rate to
be minus 1 to indicate that it's going
in the opposite direction and so that
will then play the same animation we
don't have to use a different timeline
use the same one but it will move the
menu bar away from the screen rather
onto the screen one of the nice things
with scene builder is that it allows you
to construct paths to be used in a
transition so if you want a path
transition and you want a fairly complex
part involved in this case we want to be
able to move car from the deck onto a
particular players spot on the table row
and having just go in a straight line we
can create some nice smooth curves to
give you that interesting look and feel
make it look like a better more costly
application and so we can use the scene
builder to do that we can actually
specify path and the scene will
calculate what necessary components are
required in terms of creating that path
so that we can then create the
transition
well okay very quickly then lots of lots
of animations involved in this so we've
got because we're going to show you some
we arrange the party so you see there's
lots of animations involved in this so I
won't go into that too much detail yeah
so these are basically the things that
I've already talked about you've got the
idea of path transition you've got the
idea of rotate transitions so as you
move a car I want to move along a
particular path to the table but then
you also need to go rotate it so it fits
in the right place for the player so
there's a part of rotation hammers sorry
path transition and a rotate transition
involved for moving a card and then
you've also got the idea of fade
transition because what we do is we have
the card in order to turn the card over
you simply you have both sides of the
car displayed at the same time and you
set the opacity of the back of the car
idle to be one so you're seeing the back
card or a zero and then you see the
front of the car you fade that in to
give the effect of it turning over and
then yeah
sequential transition that's just the
idea of how we link the different parts
together so you have the path transition
to move into the right place you've got
the rotate transition which could be a
parallel or could be at the end and then
you've got a fade transition which
happens after you move the card to the
correct place on the table so with that
one you can hand back to Angela who's
got finals that's perfect so again I'm
building this application I kind of
thought normally if you're going to have
more than one screen how do I transition
between screens and what is the best way
to do it if you think about the symbol
that how many of you have ever play with
the same builder okay oh oh wait oh okay
so a lot of you I'm impressed so for
those of you who are not very familiar
when sim builder is going to do once you
start dragging and dropping the
components it's actually going to
generate a file that is called F XML and
that file is actually used by your
application loaded by your application
and
and ER so instead of having to write
Java code to place a bottoms table to
stuff like that you can use same builder
just drag-and-drop components have the
to generate the F XML for you and all
you have to do on the Java side is load
at using our FX FX ml loader so you
actually generate the scene graph for
you using that file it's really good but
then when you end up for example
creating at the casino application is I
have multiple screens for each screen
I'm going to have F XML file and each F
F F XML file normally has a controller
that is in charge of loading dot will
actually injecting the components into
your code and they've use it so what
happened when I have multiple screens I
end up having multiple effects in our
files and multiple controllers you must
say ok it's no big deal I'll just load
everything on to your sink grab ah maybe
no very good idea maybe there are
performance issues so the bigger your
scene graph get that you're going to
have impact in your in your performance
so you don't want to load the screens
that you are not seeing so you know a
few things to start playing there and
that's how I come up with with two
different approaches so the first one is
the first application was very small I
only want to have it was original target
to be a small so I wasn't using many
resources so I thought you know what
let's play with something that is called
the viewport so this is actually as
something there is no new is being used
expecially for game development and what
you have is you have your entire screen
design and you just have a little window
that you see through it so you're only
seeing that window the good thing about
the Seaport is you can actually set up
different shapes so you can see through
stars through a square area you can
actually define your viewport and all
you have to do is you have your window
and you can actually bind the x and y
property of your window to a particular
property so but updating that property
you can actually move your window down
or up or side to side so we're using
very
important things in Java affects less
binding functionality as you bind as you
are watching a particular property as
that property change you're going to be
updated so that's all I'm doing
I have my entire screen design I have a
viewport and all I'm doing is changing
the location of all of that so it's
actually handy if you want to thinking
about big applications with a lot of
components my know very good idea right
but for this case I think it actually
worked pretty well and especially if you
have a flat sin graph is actually a good
solution again it's something well known
in game development for the second
application instead each screen has many
many components if you think about the
games it cheap if there you have for
plain is a component the cars so you
have a card decks and some casinos even
have a eight card decks at the same time
so there is a lot a lot of UI components
in one single spec screen so putting all
those in the scene graph was not very
good idea so the scene graph tried to
make it as flat as possible sim builder
is generating 1f XML file perfect
perfect per screen so this is what you
have visually so you have your scene
graph that has a route and you might
have different M component for each
screen again if you use sim builder you
have F XML file plus a controller so I
ended up kind of quick creating my own
framework for unloading unloading the
screens so what I did is all of them has
a comma background so I just left the
background there and I just have a
screen controller that actually loads on
the particular screen at a given time so
the screen controller is very simple has
an ADD screen loaded screen or unloaded
screen and all the screens that were
generated for Forex and power from same
builder actually inherit from screen
manager screen interface that I create
so just make sure the screams have a
common interface common type so they can
be just loaded
by the screen controller so by the way
anytime we move from screen to screen
just lower the screen that you need and
just download the previous one we done
I'm pretty much out of time again I just
want to briefly show you a little bit
symbol there for those of you who are
not familiar with it so one thing what
good thing about some exception right
there is when you create your
application you can actually create an
application you have different options
for JavaFX application my machine is
kind of not working properly you pretty
much are okay at the so of anyway yes oh
man oh it's time to finish so anyway I
do encourage you if you haven't tried to
see the little it is it's actually
pretty awful creating user interfaces
again most of the time of this will be
created a passion is not what are you
going to do
because rendering and communities
together with those tools is actually
crazy we don't want to thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
