major upgrade for eclipse for Eclipse
platform short introduction about myself
my name is Tom shindle I'm CEO CTO of a
small pack company located in US based
on Austria Central Europe Eclipse
committer at various Eclipse project
starting from efore which is the project
eclipse for got developed in flat for me
I which is the old feet of extreme EMF
and thought I protest at Eclipse
typically blog about all the stuff I'm
doing at eclipse at my own blog so let's
look a little bit into the history of
eclipse for that you see where we are
coming from so at Eclipse con 2008 four
years ago the Eclipse for project was
announced and by then I was in the
audience and listen to what they think
they should do in the future with
eclipse and thought i would like to be
part of it so i started contributing to
the clips for project so i was in the
audience like you are now in May 2008
Boris Bukowski an IBM employee and
myself published the first prototype to
what we thought would be a good idea for
the next Eclipse platform we set out the
rules and the stuff that eclipse for is
now based on we published not only the
intention but they also published code
so that people could try things out and
give feedback humidity in summer 2009
we've published our first tech preview
called efore dot 9 in 2010 we published
eclipse for sdk as a developer preview
and in 2011 we published eclipse for the
one sdk together with the Indigo release
and it was the first time that we
started self-hosting so we used Eclipse
to develop eclipse
and as most of you probably know in 2012
we shipped the new release train on top
of eclipse 4 so if you're now download
eclipse to know you will get eclipse
eclipse 4 plus various plugins so what
I've been the reasons that we thought we
should create a new platform or rewrite
the platform what was wrong with eclipse
feed attacks well we all use it every
day as a development environment so why
can't we stay on the same thing and go
on forever with that but I've been
various reason when I clips for a bit of
X got created there's been only a few
customers in fact the only customers we
had was GD TP de that Java development
tooling the plug-in development chillin
but when we reached the space of our CP
our customer base grow into the
thousands and we had a lot of requests
from people around the world we need
this feature we need that feature until
platform was not prepared for that the
other thing that we saw is that Eclipse
Friedrichs uses a very old programming
pattern you have statics and Singleton's
all over we have a lot of inheritance
going on in the platform we have out at
a pattern like that the lesson of
pattern and even worse we have an
inconsistent one so we have listeners
very pass around event object we have
listeners very pass on strings and the
problem with our listeners is that you
know all we have a part listener apart
listener 2 3 4 6 so the listener pattern
really has it disadvantages and the
second thing i already mentioned is that
we owned all the world's problems
whenever you had wanted to have a
feature it had to be the platform team
implementing it for you instead of
giving you the possibility to implement
it on your own so what I've been the
targets are
even the initial the first prototype
already set out those targets we wanted
to have the UI components being
completely decoupled from a clip from
the Eclipse framework so that they have
been simply poachers and you plug them
into an Eclipse platform as cui so we
wanted to remove all reach out to
statics and Singleton's we wanted to
remove the old listen approach and
switch over to a publish and subscribe
event bus system and one of the major
first things that I was very keen on was
that we should not depend on SWT to
render the UI so I want to have a
framework where I could exchange the UI
technology without losing all the
features you get from a modern platform
the first approach that I used QT for
that so I replaced as a receiver fruity
and we approach this thing using an HTML
like Dom in the background so eclipse 4
has in the background something like a
browser DOM and the only interact with
this browser demand what you see in the
UI is only a reflection of the internal
state of our Dom in the end i will show
you in examples how this is working and
how cool is that this is so to approach
all this we created a platform called
eclipse for application platform this
platform consists of the GRE osgi and
EMF EMF is the Eclipse modeling
framework we used EMF to get a
statically typed storm in the background
the Eclipse for application platform
itself has a so-called workbench model
that's the Dom in the background we have
written our own dependency injection
container to do dependency injection
this was replacement for reaching out to
statics and all the stuff and they have
a very thin service layer which provides
you the services
to interact with the dom and the
platform itself and on the other side
well it's not part of the core platform
is the rendering and the UI so all the
blue parts don't depend on a stability
at all so you can use them if any UI
technology you want to even HTML so they
really don't depend on a stability so
when we look at how the Eclipse SDK is
structured when you look at field X
there are two projects called PD and TD
T the plug-in development environment
and the Java development tooling that's
the thing you normally use as a normal
childhood developer probably you mix in
the web tip that to our web development
platform wtp but that's it in the end
the thing that we are working on is the
platform layer it provides all the
plugins and all the stuff that you can
arrange views and parts and editors and
takes care of them when you t touch them
and they move them around that's part of
platform yards the area i'm working in
and at the low level they have a key
knocks at our as our osgi container when
we compare that with 4 of X in the end p
DP DT DT and equinox are completely the
same no line in there has changed so
it's completely the same code base what
we did is that we created a platform
fork for of X and in between equinox and
the platform we put our new eclipse for
application platform you can call it RCB
to the dough when you take a closer look
even at the platform level ninety-five
percent of the bundles or osgi plugins
didn't changed at all it's only one
bundle that we have re implemented in 4
of X it's odd you i dot workbench which
has a free directs branch and 4 of X
branch and normally what all those
plugins in Eclipse to the program
against API of you I workbench so the
view part editor part all of them are
part of a for you I workbench and the
API in there hasn't changed at all so if
you have used only public API of Eclipse
everything you wrote forfeited X will
work the same unfollowed X the magic
happens in the UI workbench where we
translate calls you made you make to the
API to the new representation our
Eclipse for application platform one
bird about performance well when we
release the clips photo to be but
suddenly had 100 thousands of users or
thousands of users and we got a lot of
performance reports that in the
combination of plug in X and plug in y
we have a problem so we working on it we
really work on it and we really take
care that with Kepler you get everything
working performance and everything
better than probably in feeder decks but
we're really keen on working it and
doing a hot job really take care of that
so let's take up short look at the new
programming model of the emphasize I
said we don't want to reach out to
statics and anymore or doing inheritance
so when we look at the past infield X
this is how you structure a power in the
clips for you derived from a base class
called viewport and then you reach out
to informations like get psych at work
bench window and get the selection
service they register listener and this
approach has various problems well we
depend on the framework so we can't
easily unit test this part because we
have to bring up the complete framework
to get access to get solid workbench
window and get selection service and we
derive from that so we can't compile it
without having eclipse with us the
approach we take with eclipse photodex
for full of x is that you make your part
a simple poach
so remove that deriving from a base
class we remove breaking out to get
services and instead of that replace
that with dependency injection so simple
annotate methods and because of those
informations the framework can fill out
and inject informations you require to
get the UI up up and working and if you
look at this class you can easily unit
as this class without getting the
framework up and running because you
don't reach out to other services and
statics you get all of them injected
into your component a nice little
feature is when you look at how you get
access to preferences for example it's
the same to make this thing unit test
table you need to get up an osgi
framework simply to get access to
preferences and eclipse for all you have
to do is you write you annotate your
method you annotate your @ @ preference
annotation in there and the frameworks
figures out everything for you so
whenever the preference is changing you
get a rejected value for your poacher I
said we have problems with the listeners
and the vent system so this is how it
looked like when you get access to suit
your custom service and want to adjust
the listener in it in Filipino tax in
comparison to photodex all you to you
say in checked and then you energy add
an annotation at event object and you
have an event bus so when the event is
far is delivered or published on the
event pass you get the value ejected
once more it's matt it sounds like magic
but in the end it's very really really
cool because all the components don't
depend on having a framework running you
can simply call a method on your own the
event object is a little bit dangerous
because when you work in your eyes you
always have to sink back to the UI
thread so an event system is able to
send out event in on various frets so
what we added there is we can annotate
it with you I event object and then the
frame
takes care to sink back when it costs a
method to the UI thread for you so what
could be the future that's the present
that's what they're already in Eclipse
4022 in future but we could allow you is
that you create your PO UI using
javascript the framework itself doesn't
care whether something is implemented in
Java JavaScript groovy whatever you name
it in the end it's only the dependency
injection container that must know how
to create an instance of what do you
sent to him so in future it would be
possible if you want to do righty-o UI
or your part in Eclipse for using
javascript for example so a very cool
thing about eclipse for and that's what
I have been responsible for is the so
called application of work bench mob in
the past I'd call it the black hole
eclipse because when you configure
eclipse and it gets up you have a
channel model where you create the
so-called workmanship visor an action /
advisor which was responsible for
creating the toolbar and the menu bar
and all this stuff on the other hand you
had those plugin xml files where you did
to all the contributions using extension
points to eclipse and when the framework
you start starts up it reads all those
information and plug them in and out of
that at runtime the java model is
completely gone you don't have access to
it anymore you can't access it out of
that what gets created is so called the
scriptures so we have descriptors for
view parts ready two parts but all of
those informations are read-only you can
only read them but they can't write to
them you can't change informations in
there so it's a fixed model at run when
the framework starts up it takes all
those informations merges them and then
presents you read only informations the
present now is that eclipse for we have
a so-called application volim and you
look at this screenshot you see exactly
that's the application model of
simple eclipse for application it is
made out of a trimmed window I mean a
window main menu it has a prosthetic
perspective stack and it splits its
perspective and through using a sash
container and put there some tabs but
that's in the end at design time you
used the same model then we are using a
drunk time to render the UI and show you
what eclipse show you the UI from
eclipse and then you want to interact
with this model you simply get access to
it you have some services so they can
access at the part stack for example is
the thing that makes tabs and then you
want to remove an element from this tab
then you simply call get children that
remove similar what you would do in a
Dom in an HTML or in a browser in the
end so you get access to the background
information about the UI and operate
only on this dom information the same is
true if you want to change your label at
runtime you simply cause that label on
the element and the label is updated I
will show in a demo yeah
you bear yeah because I'm fine can find
Ellie any element in the system in the
end right we have another method where
you say which type you want to search
for but the generic one simply gives
back a so called mu ilmn and you have to
do a cost yeah so you might think what
is all this stuff good for its for the
plug-in developers do i profit from it
so the answer I can give you do that is
that what you see here are three buck
numbers at eclipse and this black number
ask for a very special feature the
feature is quite an easy one when you
close the last element in a tab folder
the tap folder should not collapse so
when I now click on a tab folder
collapses and the feature asks exactly
for that if a clue if I click on that
the tab folder should be there and still
occupy the space interesting enough is
that implementing this feature in read
of X is very hard let's do a comparison
the first two buck numbers are in the
first one vm we tried to implement the
feature and got half way nobody
recognized that it's not really working
so it got into the co-pays and then the
second part had filed a lot later that
that it is not really working and we
tried to fix it when we look at the fix
for two first two bucks we had to touch
seven classes for fixing photodex we had
to touch two classes when we look at the
lines of code we had to change its 130
and deferred infield x + 5 lines in
photodex i don't know how long it took
to
and the first buck or to introduce the
feature which is not working but I have
tried to fix the problem and it took me
three to four days to fix it and then I
thought i fixed it tested it and it
failed once more and we found out we are
unable to fix it in free dotexe in fall
of X it took me five minutes the reason
is when you look at the code I had to
change its really only five lines of
code that I had to change so what you
profit from this is that we are much
faster fixing bugs in our system because
we have to Ted touch much less classes
we are much faster than fixing and
finding problems in our code base
because of the new programming model I
really split out things very good so now
it's time to do some demonstrations
which uses the live model so when you
look at our running Eclipse we can open
a few it's called life application model
so it opens up down here this model that
we see down here that's the live model
of our running Eclipse and studs so I
can interact with this model let's try
that let's flip oh that's the wrong sesh
let's flip another one this one an
interact with the life model you see I
change the UI model and immediately DUI
gets updated so I really interact with
my application I can do even crazier
things with it I can for example switch
between perspectives let's look at the
perspectives that can switch over to the
kit repository exploring not a git
repository exploring is showing so we
can interact with the model at runtime
using this live application model editor
and it really helps you to be back here
you I when you have problems they don't
know what things are going on even can
go here and see
which control is rendered in the UI so
it shows you oh it's this sash container
or when we look here you can see okay
that's that stack on the left hand side
in the end right so we have some
debugging in there but they can also do
with this stuff is that we can execute
JavaScript code on top of it so we have
for example the package Explorer what's
the package Explorer down here we have a
console but it can execute JavaScript
and they call main object set now you
have to look at the left hand side there
is the package Explorer and if
everything is okay hello j 1 and the
execute JavaScript you see that the
labor changes we can do even crazier
things with it so we can really move
things around at runtime so let's go to
our parts deck here
the life model editor JavaScript
execution based stuff in here and now
you should see that the life application
model editor is moved at the first
position in here so execute the guy and
you see it moved at the first position
and the tab folder so they can really
interact with the mall doing structural
changes removing things adding things at
runtime and they got reflected
immediately to the UI so our loss is
possible using the application model
so the future this is another pup number
and didn't see the buck numbers get
lower and lower and lower that's the
highest rohtak box at eclipse it got
fouled you should see the date 2002 the
back got fouled and the puck asked for
split a door features so many users that
come from from VI and all on Me max know
that they can split the editor and this
is the highest vote this feature at
Eclipse bugzilla the problem is that
it's a SMS team estimated that it takes
more than a year of man work to fix the
problem and get hopefully something in
Eclipse to make it work so one year of
work so I didn't have time for one year
but I implement the feature in about a
week and this is only doable like using
eclipse Friedel x4 out photodex and now
as have split string class so i can
scroll down here and they see upside the
string class stays i can switch the
layout of it so moving things next to
each other i can switch between the
editors so and the really nice thing is
that the outline for you on the
right-hand side gets updated all the
time I do is switch so you see now I
switch and then the string gets elected
or a chump to a method let's drill down
a little bit here so did you see things
are moving around so when I switch to
the other one so the outline view gets
updated live it's really one of the
oldest features requests we had at
Eclipse implemented in one week so it's
really amazing what you can do with this
new platform yeah
really on the same file I don't know if
that but if it is that's good so the
thing is that you should take away from
this that we are able to solve problems
for you but I didn't tell you I didn't
have to change the line of code in the
clips to implement it because it's you
who can fix the bugs and the problems
this feature that we expected to take us
one year to implement and get working in
field X is fixable by you without our
interaction and that was one of our main
targets that it's not us that have to
implement all the features if you want
the feature we have to provide a
platform that you are able to implement
the feature without us doing anything
that's one of the major targets that we
had when we started working on fee today
on photodex so now I showed you the
boring stuff you can do really amazing
things with this new platform and I have
brought with me some cool demonstrations
what is possible using the technologies
we developed for eclipse for ford
eclipse sdk and the good thing is when
the Eclipse SDK uses all the stuff you
have many people testing it it's going
to be really really tested around the
world and its really a stable platform
to build your own applications on it so
what they can do with all the
acknowledges we have we can implement
interesting stuff so I showed you that
clips for application platform with the
service model and the SWT rendering this
is what eclipse SDK is using the nice
thing and Eclipse forest I can remove
all those has to be depletes and replace
them for example what I did with javafx
oh we're one too fast
so all i did was are replaced everything
that dealt with a stability and replaced
with javafx naturally all the views that
are written using activity can't be used
anymore but if you write an RCP
application where you create all your
own view parts or you eyes then it
doesn't matter that you can't use as
tivity anymore but you can use a new
modern platform named javafx let's first
look at any for RTP application you can
already do some fancy stuff with it
because we provide things like CSS
female so we have a small demonstration
application and that's a small demo
application you can flip the layout or
switch to a peck background color so you
can already do some nice and fancy
usui's using swt and CSS but you already
see that there are problems for example
table headers you can trim them the
native tool kit doesn't allow you to set
a background color on the table header
you can't do anything for example
another thing is on Windows a button you
can set a background color on it it's
there is no api food so we can't do it
in the end so the festivity you can get
to a certain level of you I that looks
nice but well beyond that you are forced
to do your own drawing or switching over
to another platform so it has it's very
very limits if
and really cool thing that I saw I don't
know how its implemented but I know
they're using eclipse for is to have an
e for our CP application running on the
web which uses vaadin as a rendering
technology so all did they ripped out st
BTW replaced everything with Vardon
richards in the end and run the thing on
the server using eclipse for on the
server in a headless mode and doing the
rendering through about in front and in
the end i only have a screen should have
read that's eclipse eclipse RCP having
something similar than java detour
running on the web in your browser using
body and eclipse for the next thing at
that's what i'm working on a lot is
eclipse for on our RGB on javafx so
we're using the eclipse for platform and
we provide pure java of Xu is we call
that the rendering concept in the clips
for its open sourced it's provided on
the EPL so you can use it for free and
there are the first commercial
applications already developed on top of
it this is our suction application looks
like and you get all the features that
you know from a rich client application
platform so let me just launch the
application
so now we have an eclipse for
application running on javafx and you
can all do to all the fancy stuff that
you can do with the videos and scaling
them you can detach the guy down here so
all the stuff that you're used to from
an RCP framework can be done using
javafx and eclipse for so all those
things are already provided they are
stable they can be used in your
commercial applications and provided for
free the problem is that well the
question was can you run eclipse for
Eclipse itself on it the problem is that
everything in Eclipse is written against
the estimate EAP is so you can't easily
get rid of all as tivity stuff you
really would have to implement all and
everything you get nowadays from a
stability so getting eclipse itself
running on it it's not possible but I'll
show in a minute how you can create your
own small IDE using the technologies we
have here so let's go on so we have
Eclipse for running with javafx instead
of swt and the next thing it's an ethics
IDE so I wrote an IDE it uses osgi and
II for runtime components at the moment
it's not using the Eclipse application
platform by the plan the users in future
it uses a leverages the so-called Chiddy
core that's the compiler the incremental
compiler to use in Eclipse it provides
you all the search and all the outer
completion functions and it doesn't
require as to ratite it doesn't care
about that stability you can even run it
in your maven builds and all the stuff
so but you can use it in your eye in my
ID Eve as a chav effects ID for editing
proposed and that's the really hard
thing to get broking in javafx is you
don't have a rich edit the component so
nothing that he can have something in
blue and
something in purple so I had to find a
way around it and what I'm using today
is I simply embed a vapp view and then I
in this that view I have an HTML page
with JavaScript that has an editor in it
the writer is used the editor i'm using
is coming from the orion project at
eclipse so it's also EPL code i can
simply embed it into my job of expert
view and make it look like an ordinary
editor in future hopefully javafx will
get a rich text control but for now i'm
simply using the web view and i have
naturally have a team of with me so here
is my small ID and you don't notice this
there is really a back view it really
looks like on the right hand side like
an ordinary javafx widget but below it
it's really ripe for you and I have
everything working so i can do system
dot out dot print rental hello j-1 save
the file run it so in the back hand
whenever a type i send all informations
to the incremental compile of eclipse it
compiles my java class and in the end i
can run it using java on my system and
it boots up and everything works so
that's amazing feature and it took me
two days to implement simply using the
technologies we developed for eclipse
for so it's really amazing what you can
do with the new platform that we created
you let's close this one
another small application I've written I
call it the F effects for free desktop
it's written on always GI Andy for
random technologies it runs normally in
full screen it allows to dynamically
install update and uninstall so-called
apps it looks like this and most more i
have a small demonstration about how
this thing is working so i have it
running here and set my eclipse i have a
small application of written so let's
make this guy smaller and make this full
screen so i have here ethics for free
and here i have a small control or
application and i can drag it from my
IDE down here and have a new application
installed into my local system and open
it flies in here and runs the small
application so their motor applications
have a small browser application down
here which opens and when I click here I
can browse to a web page and show it on
my desktop so i have a really small
system that i can use for a kia system
or something like that implementing the
technologies once more that i provided
or implemented as part of eclipse for
everything under EPL and provided for
free so i think this showcases really
how powerful the stuff that we are
developing at eclipse is so I'm ahead of
schedule but well it's everything I
wanted to show to you here are some
resources and informations about the
slides and all the stuff we're doing and
I'm open for questions any questions yep
yep so the question was does do we
provide full Eclipse for something that
allows you to better integrate maven
projects right now now there is no work
being done on the core resource level so
eclipse 4 has the same resource system
then you have infield X there is no
change in there nobody took the time and
implement something so
yeah yeah nobody took the time and spent
the money on doing work in this area so
there is no change in there everything
that that's done and eclipse is driven
by what people want and then they invest
time and money on it then it gets done
and as it doesn't get done that's all I
can say about it I'm sorry yeah okay
that the question was what we are using
to do the dependency injection we wrote
our own dependency injection container
so I don't have not part of the decision
why we are not using juice or peaberry
or spring but I guess that they have
been certain features that we wanted to
have that haven't been provided by those
a dependency injection containers so we
implemented our own its standard
compliant so it passes the test the
compliance test of the cheese are so not
all of them both there to choose that
there is Java X annotation tears chava X
in checked as a standard and the natural
we have some extensions to it so the UI
event I showed and add preference they
were not standardized that's something
that we invented for us so we have a
small bundle with all annotations in
them and you have to add that to your
project but they really only the
annotations in there no other compile
them dependencies and stuff yeah sure
