hello and welcome to this overview of
Enterprise Manager cloud control today
we're going to be focusing on something
very specific in our middleware
diagnostic features in particular a
middleware diagnostic advisor that takes
more than just pure metrics
configuration information for the entire
stack of targets from the weblogic
server down in the actual database but
also goes ahead and correlates of an
analyze minh provides actual advice to
go ahead and point you at the root cause
as opposed to go ahead and just
providing pure metrics in this case
there's 22 Diagnostics findings that
have occurred over the last week if we
go ahead and click on our fine as we can
go back to the middleware Diagnostics
dashboard within the dashboard we can
see a number of findings have occurred
represented here at different time
periods the biggest cluster Isles like
it happened here between Ron I guess 62
August seventh we could have also
navigated to the dashboard simply by
coming through our contextual menu here
and coming down through diagnostics and
glowing the middleware Diagnostics
advisor now let's go ahead and look at
some specific findings so let's go ahead
and click on the find that occur around
1am on the 7th clicking on that will go
ahead and provide us with a high level
summary of this particular finding we
can see this particular finding is
indicating a jdbc pool size is small
wait for connections is high it occurred
on mid rack global data source it
occurred six times in the previous six
hours so we have a high level summary
here in for more details we can go ahead
and click on this finding all right
before we drill down let's go ahead and
minimize or navigation bar to give us a
little more real estate and go ahead and
click on our finding so now we're in the
finding detail in this case we're
looking at our jdbc pool late finding
now we have a variety data to go ahead
and be able to go ahead and analyze the
specific finding fourth row we have our
fine and description we have a
recommendation here which is going to be
to go ahead increase the pool size we'll
come back to that in a moment in
addition we can see some load data we
don't have a tunnel load and thus we
don't have a lot of connections going on
but the connections that are going on we
can see basically specifically that
you see weight successes percent is a
sixteen percent which is somewhat high
now we also have some additional
information below we have a variety of
target some of which are up some butcher
down and get a variety see all those
application deployments oracle
management service we have our beacon
for doing synthetic test so we can see
all these different related targets that
we use to go ahead and calculate the
information we even have the
configuration changes occurred over the
last 24 hours one of these configuration
ju-just possibly could even be a culprit
but we also the data source information
right here we can see the current values
now the capacity increments only one at
the moment the maximum capacity is five
we probably want to go ahead and
increase that maybe the math and
capacity to 10 and the capacity
increment we go ahead and bring that up
to 2 maybe we might even want to bring
up the initial capacity for when the
server comes up we want to bring it up
to five as well just to ensure that
we're lowering this overall jdbc weight
successes percentage now in addition to
our JDBC pool wayfinding we have a few
other type of findings that are built in
the enterprise manager to go ahead and
provide you with advice based on pure
metrics as well as configuration data
across all tears from the hose to the
middle tier to the database one of those
is a long-running sequel call which goes
ahead and analyzes the database calls
coming from the middle tier you can dive
directly into those sessions and even go
ahead and to your sequel on the fly we
have thread lock findings we have ejb
findings and we have a variety of other
fine as that go ahead and kind of
analyze the middle tier keep you in mind
that the configuration data as well as
all the metrics both historical in real
time are stored with an enterprise
manager cloud control with that I'd like
to go ahead and wrap up the demo and
thank you once again for watching this
