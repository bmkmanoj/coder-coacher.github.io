for an application I can create a new
process starting with a blank canvas or
use one of the existing patterns
each pattern includes
sequence of flow elements that can be
modified to fit the desired workflow I
like to start by adding roles and
swimlanes to the process I add the
primary role that is responsible for
completing the activities within the
specified swimlane and add additional
swimlanes as needed
next I edit the process to fit my
workflow renaming the activities makes
them more meaningful gateways are used
to create various paths within the
process flow and can be used to define
simple decisions once I have all the
flow elements in the appropriate swim
lanes I add the sequence flows sequence
flows define the order in which the work
is performed within the process
I add names to the sequence flows so I
know how the process will flow out of
the Gateway and then set the conditions
for the sequence flows to determine the
default flow and the conditional flow
finally I specify the implementation
details for the process
I want my users to start this process by
completing a webform for the human tasks
I specify what user or role will perform
the task
what webform they are to use the action
to perform the title and task summary I
want the user to see in workspace for
this task and the due date and priority
for the task the expression editor can
be used to specify the value for the
assignee title and task summary fields
providing more flexibility with the use
of data objects and operators the data
Association editor lets me to find the
information pass between flow elements
creating a data Association for the
selected flow element involves dragging
and dropping a data object into the
input field and a payload object into
the output field since this process uses
a web form to collect information from
my users the forms data object becomes
the input this data object was
automatically created when the webform
was created a data object stores the
information used in the process this
information is assigned to the input
payload and used on the form to capture
the result of the users actions with the
form a data object is assigned as an
outcome a data Association is
automatically created when a human task
or a start event with a webform are
added to a process these data
associations are between human tasks
data associations can also be configured
to and from another processor service
invoked from a business process or to
and from a decision I save the process
and then validate the application to
ensure there are no errors thank you for
