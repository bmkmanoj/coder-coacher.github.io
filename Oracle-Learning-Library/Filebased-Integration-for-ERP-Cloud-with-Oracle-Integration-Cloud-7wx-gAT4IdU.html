from an FTP location to your ERP cloud
service Oracle integration cloud
orchestration pattern allows the
execution of business processes and
long-running activities in this
integration data from a secure FTP
server is sent to integration cloud for
orchestration then it's uploaded to ERP
cloud the data is pulled from the FTP
location by using a trigger file
mechanism integration cloud schedules
the orchestration flow for pulling a
trigger file it also has the ability to
unzip and decrypt files the file is
staged integration cloud the zip file
may contain multiple files and each file
may have multiple records because of
this before each loop is needed to
process each file and record and to
enrich or transform the data before it's
written to a new file for ERP cloud once
the new ERP file is ready it's uploaded
by the ERP cloud adapter an integration
cloud the adapter invokes the ERP import
service and specifies a callback the
data loading and processing start on the
ERP endpoint
additionally integration cloud allows
the definition of callbacks a callback
receives logs and errors encrypts them
and sends them through the FTP adapter
let's build this integration an
integration cloud the connections to the
erp and ftp endpoints are already
configured for this integration select
the orchestration option all configured
endpoints are available in the invokes
panel configure the ftp endpoint with a
file name pattern to read a trigger file
from the ftp location then define a
schema by using a CSV file that has the
same format as the trigger file the
actions panel is available to add
activities to integrations to find the
assign activity to declare the set of
variables using the expression builder
set values for each variable by using
functions for example to extract the zip
file name from a relative path to
download and stage the file
pereira lee an integration cloud
configure an ftp endpoint from the
invoke panel by using the download to
integration cloud operation specify the
input and download directories along
with the unzip option map actions are
automatically generated every time new
endpoints or stage file actions are
added to the integration in this case
the mapping sets the extracted file name
the zip file may contain multiple files
use for each actions to enable iterating
over a repeating element to read each
file from the input directory and
integration cloud configure a stage file
action to specify details like file name
and directory by using the expression
builder specify the schema format by
loading a CSV file that contains the
data structure when a file is staged in
integration cloud another for each
action is required to iterate through
each file record after each iteration
transform and enrich the data for this
add a staged file action to write each
record to a new file use the expression
builder to set the file name and output
directory all the enriched data is
appended to the existing file in this
case the schema format for the new ERP
file uses the same data structure as the
source file perform data mapping and
transformations in the map action
functions operators and XSL elements are
useful to enrich and transform the new
file for ERP once the new file is ready
configure a stage file action to write a
manifest file with the business data
details the map activity allows the
definition of the manifest content once
the new file for ERP is built configure
a stage file action to enable recipient
file before sending it to the ERP cloud
endpoint use the expression builder to
concatenate the zip file finally add the
ERP endpoint to import the data into the
financials cloud application the
operation to perform in the target
Oracle er
P application is import payable invoices
once the data loading and processing are
complete an email notification needs to
be triggered to find the callback to
retrieve more details about any failed
records to find the file references to
the ERP end point in the map action so
the ERP system processes the resist file
accordingly now configure a business
identifier this identifier enables us to
use the dashboard monitor to track the
Associated payload field in messages one
business identifier is required as the
primary business identifier but we can
define as many as 3 activate the
integration after activating the
integration the Activity Stream can be
monitored from the runtime health page
where the activity stream and
diagnostics logs are available for
download thank you for watching
