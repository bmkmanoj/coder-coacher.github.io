second of the three weekly lessons about
oracle jet let's continue from part two
what you learned about the oracle jet
data visualization components in this
part you'll be introduced to the oracle
jet components that help you to render
data collections in various ways there
are a range of components in this
category here we will focus on two that
you are most likely to use which are the
table component and the tree component
let's start by taking a look at the
table component go to the cookbook go to
the table recipe notice the most basic
table in the recipe remove some of the
data in there to make it as simple and
as short and as focused as possible and
then copy and paste the relevant code
from the JavaScript side where the data
is found and from the HTML side normally
it's best to start on the HTML side and
paste it in some like you have the view
there and you can see which parts of the
JavaScript from the recipe you actually
need to copy now you can see that we
have reference to something called a
data source which is defined in the
JavaScript side that is all we need to
copy from the JavaScript recipe paste
that into our view model and take note
that here is defined our data source
that is referenced on the HTML side this
is a read-only property and also tech
notes of a very useful utility class
from Oracle jet which will convert our
array into a table data source jet
provides a number of these utility
classes for converting data from one
format into another format include the
reference to the component go back to
the browser and notice that you now have
a table in the same way we're going to
now take a look at the tree view
component in the cookbook find the tree
view recipe Explorer on the left hand
side
all the different variations on the
basic tree view the most simple one has
its data hard-coded into the view more
likely what you want to do is access
data via a rest endpoint and then
process it via JSON there is an example
in the cookbook that shows you how to
work with JSON the JSON is hard-coded at
the end here you see that a JSON tree
datasource utility class is used which
is comparable to the table data source
that we made use of in the previous
example the JSON tree data source takes
JSON and converts it and handles it for
us so that we don't have to do the JSON
parsing ourselves back in the cookbook
copy the references to the oracle jet
components that you're making yourself
from the cookbook into the define block
in your view model as always and then go
into the view in the cookbook and copy
the edge a tree view as well as the
script below it paste it into the view
this is the standard process for
removing components from the cookbook
into your applications notice in
particular how items in the tree are
rendered by an extension of
functionality that not out makes
available also notice the read-only
property called data that is mapped to
the data property of the tree view back
in the browser notice we have now a tree
view displayed with data provided via
JSON in our view model other data
collection components to be aware of on
the data grid the list view row expander
Paigey control and indexer it's often a
bit confusing when having to choose
between using a simple table component
or a more advanced data grid component
to help with this decision the jet
developer's guide provides a table of
differences between these two components
in this part here been introduced to the
data collection components with a focus
on the table in the tree you've learned
the data collection component
a basic set of features as well as a
wide range of options that you can use
to customize them each component has
events which lets you connect the HTML
view to the business logic and
JavaScript the cookbook provides
complete recipes for each component as
well as a link to the related JavaScript
documentation in the next part you'll
learn how to connect data sources to jet
components that you have learnt about so
far for your homework for this part take
another look at the table and at the
tree as well as at the grid component
copy one or two of them from the
cookbook into an Oracle jet application
and try and configure them to fit your
specific business requirements review
the different demo pages in the cookbook
again for different examples of how
these components can be used with that
we'll wrap up the third part of the
second week of the course in Oracle jet
and we'll see you again in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
