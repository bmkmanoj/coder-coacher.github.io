of the BPM con this is a breakout
session for oracle corporation and i'd
like to welcome back our expert
presenter for this session a jake on a
director of BPM product marketing okay
welcome back to ppm cotton thanks and
glad to be back
rj for many of you might be familiar
drives Oracle's BPM technology and
solutions for customer adoption he has
15 years experience in BPM crm any ERP
application systems and prior to his
joining Oracle he was at executive at
Khanna and at progress savvy on BPM in
today's session RJ looks at one of the
more exciting new trends in BPM in his
session entitled adapted case management
delivering right customer experience
they'll take a look at how the demand
among customers for what he calls a
multi-channel experience and engagement
is actually driving some very innovative
solutions for adapted case management
with BPM just a quick reminder if you
haven't already done so you can download
a J's slides right now they're available
right under the viewing area simply
click link under that area you'll also
see that RJ and his team have brought
some terrific downloadable resources
some white papers and other product
overviews in case studies will make
those available for you during the
session as well and we like to make this
interactive where we can so to ask a
question or comment of AJ simply type
into the question box so RJ it's over to
you and tell us about it back to the
case management surance
let's go and get started so today there
is a lot of discussion around customer
experience and customer experience the
key differentiator for many
organizations today whether it is retail
it is banking telecommunication
transportation but it is also a huge
challenge for the companies to deliver
this effective and the right customer
experience so today companies offer a
wide range of products and services to
their customers and customers interact
with companies using multiple channels
whether that is emails mobile social
phone web self-service so on and so
forth to
engage with companies and to do business
so the companies need to manage and
deliver the desired experience
throughout the customer journey what I
mean by that is the customer journey
starts from the customers searching for
a product then they go ahead and start
evaluating a product or a service then
they may go into a selection phase then
there is a purchasing part to it and
then once they purchase the product they
start using their product they may need
support so customer experience is not
just at one point in time but it is
about supporting the customer throughout
their journey so with wide range of
customer demographics wide range of
customer needs many products and
services as well as the increased
interaction with the customers how can
we make sure that the customers are
getting what they want and are we
providing them with the right service at
right point in time are our employees
making the right decisions and the right
offers to the customers that right point
in time and is it even possible to
predict and design for all the
permutations and combinations of
customer types of customer issues of
customer channels of our products so
these are the kind of issues that we are
going to tackle today in this session
when we talk about adaptive case
management so are the customers being
pushed through assembly lines are we
hurting all of our customers through a
single predetermined process that
process which was built in for example a
CRM system or a sales system or a
support application and maybe that was
implemented like 10 years back or so
many times we make customers jump
through unnecessary hoops just because
of our systems cannot handle their
requests we ask unnecessary information
because that's what the application is
requiring so the problem is that these
applications do not really understand
the context of the customer the customer
need customer value or the special needs
and cannot morph according to those
needs so the workers using these
applications and trying to help the
customers are so constrained by these
rigid processes in the application that
they have to take the customer through
this one-size-fits-all experience which
first of all leads to customer
dissatisfaction
action and second thing is it also leads
to frustration of the knowledge worker
or the caseworker or the representative
themselves and any situation which kind
of falls outside these predefined
processes outside the standard rigid
processes are usually done manually we
may use emails we may use North pads we
may use Excel spreadsheet and usually
there is also a need for after the fact
data entry so this makes the whole
process really inefficient but consider
what if all your situations and the
cases that your knowledge worker that
your customer service representatives
handle are non-standard only fifteen to
twenty percent of situations are
addressed by predefined processes how
will you plan for such a process even if
you wanted to model such a process it
may not be possible because it is very
hard to predict all the situation it is
very hard to predict all the exception
it is very hard to predict and design
for all the permutation of the
combinations from starting to the end of
the process so these kind of processes
are really really hard to design as well
so what do customers want customers
today want the experience that is
contextual so do not offer me a new
phone when I'm calling to complain about
my bills they do not want to repeat the
information when they are passed from
one department to another when they're
passed from transferred from one agent
to another agent secondly customers want
companies and in turn the processes to
adapt to the customers need and not vice
versa
and third key thing is customers are
interacting on social networks they are
using multiple mobile devices and want
the customer experience to adapt to
their new earth needs they want to
engage from any device from anywhere in
the world and also want to be heard when
they share their experiences on the
social networks so what is adaptive what
does being adaptive means so before we
discuss how we can address these newer
needs of the customers and how we can
deliver this great experience and this
adaptive customer experience let us
understand what do I mean when I say
being adaptive so and
active process adapts to customer needs
it adapts to customer type is customer
and individual customer is it a
corporate customer is it a government
official is it a very very important
person VVIP account so what is the
customer type it adapts to the type of
incident it adapts to the events that
are happening while that process has
started or before that process has
started it adapts to the different
request types so adaptiveness also
requires this sense of empowerment of
knowledge workers to determine the
process steps rather than running
through the rigid application and it
allows them to handle all the
unpredictable situations that may come
while processing that particular case so
to make all this happen understanding
the context is very important so if we
take an example of process which is very
repeatable we can take an example of
credit-card enrollment you can go to a
website apply for a credit card it's a
very spread through one and done kind of
a process but compared this kind of a
process to a billing dispute or an
insurance claim process
so these kind of processes are handled
very differently because the situation's
is different because more types may be
different in cases of insurance claims
the property might be different so we
cannot really define one design of a
process to meet all the needs around
these particular cases so how can we
achieve this adaptability or this
dynamic behavior in the process how can
we enable our processes to be adaptive
and there are three key drivers of
adaptive behavior so I'm going to go
over those first of all rules driven
adaptability some of the adaptability
and the dynamic behavior in processes it
can come from business rules rules can
determine the flow in the process or the
process fragments that are part of a
particular case rules can determine the
approval hierarchy for example approvals
for claims what is the approval sequence
for loans and the whole hierarchy and
the sequence of approvals can be
determined by our rules
rules can define the work reallocation
as well as
source leveling so if there is an agent
who is working on a particular case with
a particular skill set and if that agent
is overloaded rules can kick in to
redistribute the work rules in user
interfaces can determine the dynamic
behavior or adaptiveness of the user
interfaces for example if the claim is
about an individual in a car accident
we need the certain type of information
but if the car belongs to a business and
an employee is driving it then
information required may be different so
rules can adjust that kind of
information requirement in the forms and
user interfaces next is even driven
adaptability so this is also very
interesting so human or system driven
events can affect the user interfaces it
delivered to the caseworker or it can
affect the case progression itself so
take for example if the person has
applied for a mortgage for a loan and
while his or her application is being
processed the person files for our
divorce or loses a job these are
different life events which are
happening so how these events should
affect the processing of that particular
case so you should be able to describe
how events influence a case entity or
trigger or invoke various tasks or rules
these events can be internal to your
organization or these could be external
to your process or even to your
organization so such capabilities
require very rich event correlation
given pattern detection as well as
actionable alerts using business
activity monitoring or bam capabilities
that can adjust the rules as well as
processing of the case during runtime
the third driver is user driven
adaptability now this is where the
knowledge worker takes over and makes
sure that the process or the cases
following the desired path as per the
situation or the need of the customer it
may involve adding additional approvers
or the participants to a case it may
involve creating and assigning subtasks
picking tasks from various available
tasks to decide what should happen next
so it may also mean reassignment or
rerouting of the task so here we are
providing lot of power lot of control in
hands of the knowledge worker
determine how the case should move
forward so this is all about empowerment
of the knowledge worker to serve the
customer and delivering the excellent
customer experience so they can decide
what is the type of the customer what
are their actual needs and how I should
make sure that this customer is help in
the best way possible on the other hand
this may also involve the process owner
to alter the process data rules or even
flows in bulk for multiple instances of
a case or a process for example if a
certain policy changes or a government
regulation changes you want to make bulk
changes to the process you can do that
so this can be done to the in-flight
partially completed process instances -
so now let's see what is adaptive case
management so adaptive case management
lets you manage cases like insurance
claims like non-standard loans like
benefits eligibility and fulfillment and
create individual tasks from a complex
work item it provides the knowledge
worker or the agent with flexibility to
add activities to a case instance it
lets users to alter the flow or even to
add participants in the case at runtime
so the progression of the case itself
whether it is an insurance claim or
whether it is a benefits fulfillment can
be event-driven or can be led by
knowledge worker as we discussed in
previous slides so it also requires
policy driven or rules driven governance
so that there is a check on how the
knowledge worker is actually driving the
process forward so there are still rules
and regulations to be followed and we
can ensure that those compliance needs
those the governance needs are being met
most of the time creation management
needs document routing as well as
content management so that is also a
very critical part and component of
adaptive case management so in following
slides I will review some of these
capabilities and also how Oracle BPM
suite provides and support these
capabilities by the way adaptive case
management is integral and integrated
part of Oracle medium suite itself so
it's not a separate product it is part
of Oracle beat'em suite
first of all let's take a look how a
business manager or a knowledge worker
will interact with the case so knowledge
worker has access to case we are
workspace so this case workspace will
include all the case related objects it
could include case data it could include
case documents
it may include case history and audit
trails etc and the knowledge worker or
the person owning that case may have
work on the case activities for example
review the property appraisal documents
for a particular loan and she may add
documents to it collaborate with the
workers or with other subject matter
experts to gain more input to gain more
information about a case and depending
on the context and the situation
knowledge worker may create more tasks
and may add more people to the case so
there may also be certain business rules
and policies associated with the case
that will determine what is the next
action based on a particular condition
or based on certain set of conditions or
events and we may also want to enforce
the constraints within which the
knowledge worker needs to work so that
is all driven by the business rules
component of adaptive case management
and then there is case analytics which
provides business manager with insight
into case processing and can also
recommend actions to the knowledge
worker so this can provide two for
example contextual offer to the
customers when you have a certain issue
going on with the customer your
resolving a customer case and then you
may want to offer free one-month service
the system can recommend those kind of
actions to you and even guide the
workers or the knowledge workers and the
agents on what to do next with that
particular case but should be the next
step in the process so that kind of
decision management and analytical
feedback is available to the knowledge
workers to work on a particular case
this is where users work on their cases
the knowledge workers can come to their
workspace to start working on a case
this will list all the cases that are
present in their inbox
it could be claims it could be reviews
it could be approvals it could be
appraisal so all those cases will be
listed they can select
to see the case information and then
they can pick up a case for their
processing once the knowledge worker
picks the case for example low number
452 to work on they come to this case
overview screen as you see it includes
all the information about a case and
provides a very detailed overview of
what is happening with that particular
case with that particular loan or with
that particular claim so you can monitor
the milestone how the case is
progressing how much of the case is
complete you can see all the case
stakeholders these could include other
agents other company employees or even
customers or partners which are part of
the case you can see the threads of case
activities completed or the activities
which are in progress and you can also
see the discussion threads from various
collaboration activities so you get the
full view of what is happening with that
particular case another important
feature of this case detail screen is
this activity rating unlike these
structured and repeatable processes in
adaptive case management the importance
and priority of activity can also change
from case to case and here you can do
that you can change the priority or the
importance of particular activity this
is all part of being adaptive so as I
mentioned earlier since in adaptive case
management there can be situations where
the knowledge workers need to add
activities or add more performers or
stakeholders to the case at runtime with
Oracle BPM suite they can very easily do
that they can decide what should be the
next activity so they are not bound by
the rigid predefined structured process
it is very flexible in nature you can
pick what should be the next activities
you can add more activities to the case
and also who should participate in the
case who should do that particular
activity you can determine all that in a
flexible way at runtime now rules so
rules or policies are important
component of case management so the
rules define when a task is to be
performed or removed from a case when
can you say that a milestone is
completed or what actions are required
when certain conditions are met so you
can create rules about sequence of the
activities or prerequisites of the
activities that
certain such things are required before
we can perform this activity before we
can approve this thing or before loan
can go for funding or for appraisal so
we can define or the prerequisites
before certain activities can happen
so there is a lot of flexibility but
also there is a provision to put certain
policies and rules in place so with
Oracle beat'em suite all such policies
can be defined in a very user-friendly
view and can be changed if the business
needs change so these rules adapt to the
changing policies as I earlier mentioned
the content is also a very critical
component of a case for example in the
car insurance claim kind of a case so
you may need to add pictures of the
accident you may need to add eye witness
reports you may need to add report from
a hospital or police reports and you may
have to check in and check out various
agreements or policies from the document
management system and you can do that so
Oracle bmail suite provides integration
with content management system that
allows you to include any form of
content this content may include
video it may include voice it may
include pictures that can become part of
the case and can be routed along with
the case a case may also include many
activities or what we call as guided
processes with Oracle BPM suite you can
include a guided process as part of a
case and monitor the progress of
activity via activity guides so you can
very easily track how the activities are
being performed what is the progress but
is the status of a particular activity
and you can monitor the whole case so
visibility even though there is lot of
flexibility around you are not
compromising on the visibility around
the process or the visibility around the
case which states the particular claim
is in which stage the particular loan is
so all that information is available to
you collaboration so many activities in
the case may need collaboration between
people so you should be able to search
subject matter experts VR skill search
and even be a recommendation network so
we provide capability for knowledge
workers to see what other knowledge
workers are recommending what person to
go to if
situation occurs and this kind of
network charts are available where you
can search for people based on skills
and based on recommendations and you can
pick those people and agents or workers
or experts to make them a part of the
case itself so this allows to bring
together people for collaboration but it
also keeps a record of all the
discussions and collaboration for future
reference or for traceability purposes
now let's discuss a little bit about
social aspect of it and how we can add
more social capabilities as part of
adaptive case management so customers
share a lot of information about company
about the products in the social
networks and making social channels a
part of your process a part of your case
allows you to engage with customers to
resolve their issues or even to harvest
new product ideas from social networks
our take for example a customer tweed
can kick off a case which can create a
helpdesk ticket so in this example you
see that system is listening to various
customer tweets and then taking it
through a certain sentiment analysis to
figure out whether the customer is happy
with the product whether this is a happy
tweet this is a very dissatisfied
customer and this is a really annoyed
customer and we need to tackle this
customer right away so you can either
automatically create cases or you can
pick tweets from the social network
whether it is Facebook or even from
Twitter and fix those posts and create
cases as per your needs so this is a
good way to kind of keep track of your
customer sentiment as well as make it
actionable so that you can actually do
something about it
next is adding mobile capabilities to
your case management so your customers
or even your field Service agents need
mobile support so that they can interact
with the process interact with the case
whether it's the claim or a loan no
matter where they are so mobile
applications it lets users we're using
various smart devices integrating mobile
and voice with processes it improves
customer experience as it allows them to
make a purchase or even report a problem
or accept an offer while they're on the
move
more importantly it also makes use of
mobile information
the mobile context like photos like
location or time to make contextual
decisions or recommendations to the user
so take for example a customer can file
an insurance claim for a car accident
right at the scene of accident using a
mobile application now customer can take
a pictures of the accident with their
camera phone and the mobile application
automatically fills in all the customer
data it automatically fills in location
data it ultimately fills the name and
the type of policy they have without
customer spending long hours on the
phone so it all ensures a good customer
experience during the time of need so
let me quickly go over what is in Oracle
BPM suite so Oracle offers a very
business-driven
medium suite that empowers business
users as well as the knowledge workers
to have more control of their process
more control around their business
processes as well as facilitate
collaboration between business and IT as
well as business people themselves
secondly it is a complete suite for all
flavors of the processes from human
centric processes to system centric
processes processes that are very
document heavy and from structured
processes to what we discussed today
unstructured adaptive case management
processes so it is all part of the same
suite Oracle also offers the pre-built
best practice processes and templates
for quick time to solution now these are
rebuild applications built on top of
Oracle BPM suite and we call them Oracle
process accelerators so in summary
customers demand experience that is
contextual and that is personalized
rigid or and ruptured processes do not
always deliver that right customer
experience so many times we need to
adapt to the customers needs we need to
adapt to the situations to make sure
that customer is being served in the
best way possible
adaptive case management lets you serve
the customers by empowering the
knowledge workers to manage very
unstructured and very unpredictable
processes and Oracle offers are unified
BPM case management and content
management capabilities which is crucial
for delivering the right customer
experience at the right time to the
right customers
and when required so I will end my
presentation now so here are some of the
resources where you can learn more about
Oracle BPM suite I highly encourage you
to go and look at these resources on our
website on our blogs as well as become
part of our Twitter and Facebook
community and thanks for listening today
so let me turn it back to Vance for some
question and answers I J a terrific
session and a terrific look at what I
think is gonna be a very powerful new
trend here in BPM and taking a lot of
the skills and disciplines that people
have learned over the years and turning
them from just internal process
efficiency to really reap some terrific
customer rewards so with your permission
let's go right to the questions
definitely you know one of the ones I
think it's kind of a level set question
about just overall the trends at Oracle
is seeing among its customers and
specifically the question says what
types of adaptive case management
projects are you seeing from your
existing BPM customers definitely well
so these situations or the business
conditions where people are looking for
adaptive case management are not like
really one-and-done processes so it is
not about enrolling for a new credit
card or even employee onboarding
processes which are very well defined
processes which can be designed or
defined at the design time but these are
the processes which need lot more
investigation for example insurance
claims management so we cannot really
define during the design time that what
all activities will be required for a
particular claim because we do not know
what is a situation whether there is an
injury what kind of vehicle is involved
whether there is a death in that
particular incident so we cannot
envision all the permutation and
combinations people have tried to build
these processes with standard BPM but
standard BPM gives so many constraints
to the users that it becomes really
inefficient and impossible to manage
these kind of processes which are
unpredictable in nature using the
standard BPM modeling so these kind of
investigative processes or investigative
service request claims kind of processes
or benefit eligibility processes are
very suitable for adaptive case
management
so Adapted keeps management has to be
part of the BPM suite itself so that we
can leverage the same artifacts that
have been developed for other processes
and we can use the same user interfaces
we can use similar data information
information models we can use the same
processes and even process fragments in
overall case so the case can decide
which step or which process or which
process fragment has to be invoked at
the runtime but again it needs to work
in conjunction with business process
management suite so we are reusing those
artifacts but we are providing a
flexibility at the runtime to the
knowledge worker to the edge and to make
the decision at the runtime on the other
hand we are also providing capabilities
of business rules where you can define
the constraints around which the
knowledge worker has to work so it is
not like free-for-all kind of a thing
you still have to follow policies there
are still governors and compliance needs
to be met so with rules you can actually
say that ok if this is the situation
these kind of activities can be done to
do this particular activity in that case
you must do these particular activities
and then the third aspect is around
helping in decision management so if
this call center has do need thousand
agents we do not expect all these 20,000
agents to be exports in all sorts of
issues so giving them help with
analytics giving them help with
real-time decision management by system
recommending them next actions or the
next activities we can really empower
these knowledge workers to make informed
decisions to work on a particular case
very powerful in fact let me turn now to
getting my hands dirty sort of question
which think is probably running through
the minds of many of the attendees here
it simply says I J we love the idea of
using process to better connect with
customers and meet their needs what can
I get with the Oracle process
accelerators and other features in hora
core BPM suite to get started quickly
sure so as I said that article process
accelerators these are pre-built
processes production-grade processes
which you can straightaway start using
right away or you can modify to
your needs and depending on the type of
process it may also include adaptive
case management kind of capabilities so
we have accelerators like employee
onboarding or we have accelerators like
approvals workflow or loan originations
so that is a good way to start your
project and if you have similar needs
you can just take the process
accelerator run it and see if they
actually meets your need or if you need
to modify those accelerators you can
easily do that too so it gives you a
kind of a head start and quick time the
solution to where you want to be in your
BPM project and as people look at the
tools just a quick follow-up on that is
it a configuration model do they move
things around and adjust maybe something
in a form or is it actual programming I
know it is same thing as business
process management tool will provide you
so you can use graphical modeling tool
to change the process as per your
particular need you have graphical user
interface form builders to modify the
existing forms as per your need so it is
not that much of writing the code to
modify it but you can use the same tools
which we use to design that process to
design that particular user interface to
define particular rules you can use the
same tools as an end user as a business
user as a business analyst to modify the
process to configure that process to
your needs
in Oracle people suite case is a
first-class object so you can work with
case object as you work with other
components in business process
management suite and it's very well kind
of consumes the artifacts or the
components created by BPM suite and as I
said that you can use the same tools to
kind of work with the case or work with
the well-defined structured process x1
x1 this has really been terrific object
as you might expect we've got a question
about integration after all it is
integration bill producers responsibly
eMCON and so the question here says it
seems like getting events or alerts or
even having those automatic forms that
you mentioned IJ would require some
integration with my various different
systems can you explain the role of
integration in doing adaptive case
management that's the next one question
because
dulu ensure a good customer experience I
mean
human need to kind of go to various
systems if you have a claims process or
a clearance case you may need to go to
your CRM system you may need to go to
your billing system you need to go to
your document management system and
bring in various documents or
information to process a case and well
while the case is being processed you
may need to kind of put those
information back in various systems so
integration definitely is a very key
component in adaptive case management -
and for integrating with these
underlining systems in underlining
application we always had very robust
capabilities one of the best
capabilities out there in industries and
you can integrate any kind of system and
bring information to be part of your
case whether it is content whether it is
customer data whether it is customer
analytics so you can bring all the data
back and make the decisions depending on
the information you are receiving from
the underlining systems that's terrific
that's a very terrific overview
ashay one last question talk a little
bit about some examples you've seen
about how more flexible adaptive case
management approach rather than a very
rigid BPM approach is bringing customer
benefit sure well in many cases we see
that protect for example calling into a
call center and trying to create a
dispute on your credit card bill so you
have received a credit card bill and
then you want to dispute a charge you
call them back and try to create a case
so what happens is that knowledge worker
has a capability has empowerment to make
sure that you are being addressed as a
unique entity so they are not pushing
you through a standard rigid process
which was defined like ten years back
and asking unnecessary information
what is your old address and you made
this security question and then that
agent is passing you to another
department you are repeating that
information none of that
so what agent can do is that this is the
particular situation and know everything
about the customer I know all the old
cases the customer has created I know
what card because one already has so I
have all that information and now I need
to make decision and how to help this
customer the best way I can
so there is empowerment in the hand of
knowledge worker to decide what should
be the next activity what should be the
next best action I need to do so that I
can help this customer as fast as
possible and as well as as per to their
particular needs so I'm not
unnecessarily pushing customer through
the maze of processes which have no
consequence of what the customer is
actually wanting to do so that's what we
want this knowledge worker to have that
kind of power to deliver that kind of
customer experience so it is even more
flexible than if-then because you have
two predefined if they're statements
here it is like event-driven like if
this situation has happened and that
situation has happened and these two
things have happened within two hours of
each other this is the kind of activity
you need to do so system can prompt you
with that kind of activity as well as
depending on these situations and
depending on all the artifacts that are
in front of the knowledge workers they
can make quick decisions informed
decision on what should be the next best
action to be done so it is much more
flexible very good very good and
Jennifer here is not just the knowledge
workers and efficiently get through a
case with the customer but hopefully the
big payoff here is that the response
from the knowledge worker to the
customer is more valuable to the
customer and not just expediting the
case for the company exactly exactly
yep Wow this has been terrific this is a
really powerful trend I think in BPM and
now that we know how we can get started
by using the skills we've already
learned even more powerful session
