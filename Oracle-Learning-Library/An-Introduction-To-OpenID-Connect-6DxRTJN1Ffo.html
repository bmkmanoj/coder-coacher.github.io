looked at OS and how it's used to
provide authorization in the cloud with
consent in this video we'll look at how
Open ID Connect provides an identity
layer to OA Open ID Connect is a simple
identity layer that sits on top of the
oauth 2.0 protocol it enables clients to
verify the identity of the end-user
based on the authentication performed by
an authorization server open ID Connect
also obtains basic profile information
about the end user using REST API s open
ID Connect is needed because even though
o auth provides authorization it doesn't
provide authentication with OAuth the
user authenticated and proved they were
present to the authorization server but
the sole purpose of this was to create
and grant an access token to the client
application the user didn't authenticate
directly with a client application
itself
oo-aah provides a level of pseudo
authentication it provides a grant or
license to access resources rather than
provide information about the
authentication itself to put it another
way using OAuth for authentication is
like an apartment manager giving someone
who wants to know your identity a
temporary key to your apartment the key
only implies a right to enter the
apartment for a specific length of time
it doesn't imply that the individual is
the owner
there's no identity implication at all o
of pseudo authentication also has other
limitations for example it can't provide
when where and how the authentication
actually occurred it doesn't allow
federated single sign-on either open ID
Connect can extend oh up so cloud-based
applications can get identity
information retrieve details about the
authentication event and allow federated
single sign-on
to understand how open ID Connect works
will review basic concept
such as participants identity tokens
claims and scopes and end points let's
first look at the participants the end
user is the entity for whom we are
requesting identity information in of'
2.0 this refers to the resource owner
and one of the resources they own is
their own identity the relying party is
an OAuth 2.0 client that relies on the
identity provider to authenticate users
and request claims about that user the
identity provider is an OAuth 2.0
authorization server which offers
authentication as a service it ensures
the end user is authenticated and
provides claims about the end user and
the authentication event to the relying
party so how does the identity provider
provide the relying party information
about the identity of the end user the
answer is through an identity token the
identity token is similar to an ID card
or passport it contains a number of
required attributes or claims about that
end user and also how the end user was
authenticated these claims are subject
issuing authority audience issue date
and expiration date the subject is a
unique identifier assigned to a user by
the identity provider for example a user
name the issuing authority is the
identity provider that issued the token
the audience identifies the relying
party who can use this token the issuing
and expiration date is a date and time
the token was issued and will expire
there are also a number of optional
claims that help the relying party
validate the ID token such as
authentication time which shows the time
the end user was authenticated and nonce
values which mitigate replay attacks the
token may also contain additional
requested claims about the subject such
as name an email address as with access
tokens the ID token is encoded as a JSON
web token or JWT
the claims in the token form part of the
payload like an access token the ID
token is also digitally signed using
JSON web signature to achieve integrity
and non-repudiation the header
payload and signature are combined into
a JWT and may also be encrypted with
JSON web encryption for confidentiality
open ID Connect uses claims to retrieve
information but it can also use scopes
the open ID connects specification
contains around 20 standard claims and
for standard scopes which are used to
supply the client application with
consented user details a claim is an
individual piece of information for
example a family name or email address
scopes are used to request that specific
sets of information are made available
as claim values the Open ID scope is a
mandatory scope to specify that Open ID
Connect is required in addition there
are four standard scopes predefined an
open ID connect profile email address
and phone for example the scope profile
requests access to the end users default
profile claims in the initial
authentication request the client
application can request scopes or claims
to be returned in the identity token
alternatively they can be requested
using an access token through a REST API
call to the user info endpoint the open
ID Connect identity provider has a
number of endpoints with which the end
user and client application interact
these are the authorization endpoint the
token endpoint and the user info
endpoints the authorization endpoint is
where the end user is asked to
authenticate and grant the client
application consent to access their
identity and any other required
information such as email or address
this extra information is called user
info claims once consent is given this
endpoint passes back an authorization
code this is the endpoint in which the
end user indirectly interacts with the
identity provider through a user agent
for example a browser the token endpoint
authenticates the client application
it also exchanges the authorization code
from the authorization endpoint for an
ID token an access token and optional
refresh token the user info
endpoint is an oauth 2.0 protected
resource that is used by the identity
provider to return consented user
information or claims to the client
application provided that a valid access
token is presented we review the basic
concepts of open ID connect this
included defining participants identity
tokens claims and scopes and endpoints
in the next video in this series we'll
examine these flows in detail and see
how ID tokens and user information are
exchanged thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
