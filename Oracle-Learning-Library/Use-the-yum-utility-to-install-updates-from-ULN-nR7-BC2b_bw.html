the oracle unbreakable linux network the
uln this tutorial is the third and final
video a series of three videos on the UL
in the first video demonstrated
registering a system with uln the second
video demonstrated using the UL and web
interface and this third and final video
will demonstrate use of the yum utility
to install the available updates from
you all in so after you've registered
your system with uln and subscribe to
the channels that you want to subscribe
to you can just use the yum utility to
install all the available updates the
first thing I'll do is run a repo list
and it says there the system is
receiving updates from uln and it also
shows you that the rhn plug-in is loaded
and the first time the first time you
run yum utility it will go through take
a few seconds to build the repositories
and then list the repositories or the
channels that you have subscribed to
you
so you can see here three repositories
or three channels that we've subscribed
to the latest UK channel the latest
Oracle Linux 7 channel and then we
subscribed we went into the to the uln
web interface and subscribed to the
add-on channel you can run yum update
it'll go out and pull all the updates
that are available from those three
channels and again it says the system is
receiving updates from Yulin it'll come
up and build a transaction summary and
this this takes a few seconds based upon
how many packages are available to be
updated and also new packages that need
to be restored and it also resolves all
the dependencies yum does that it'll
eventually come up here and give you a
transaction summary and for this example
there are three new packages that are
available from uln on those three
channels for my system and there's 156
packages that are update they have
updates available and your options are
yes to go ahead and install all of these
or to just d4 download only and/or for
no to abort and I'm just going to hit no
is it does take a while to apply all
these updates
this concludes the demonstration of the
use of the yum utility to install
available updates from uln as a reminder
the Yulin is accessible from HTTP colon
slash slash Linux oracle.com yolan user
documentation is available from the docs
done oracle.com page shown on the slide
thank you for taking the time to watch
these video tutorials on Oracle's
unbreakable Linux Network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
