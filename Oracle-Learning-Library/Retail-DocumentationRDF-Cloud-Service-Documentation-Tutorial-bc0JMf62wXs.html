documentation series this tutorial
features the user guide overview for
retail demand forecasting and the RDF
cloud service today's already of cloud
service documentation topics include new
item handling historical demand
forecasting core process which includes
confidence intervals and data pooling
best forecast method selection an
exception management also known as
alerts let's get started by clicking the
retail demand forecasting cloud service
link on the Oracle Retail documentation
homepage the documentation is organized
by release each area has base releases
and then patch releases cloud service is
listed on the top the on-premise retail
demand forecasting application follows
we are focusing on the Ardea of cloud
service 16.0 release and specifically
the most common questions asked of our
team of developers by you our customers
we hope to show you where to access
answers so that you can use our
documentation to its fullest potential
the user guide provides valuable
information and can answer many of the
common questions our team has asked we
will start with our first topic new item
handling retailers are faced with how to
handle new items in the store almost
every week these items need to be
replenished so they require a forecast
however without sales there is no
forecast for that new item rdf has
several ways of generating forecasts for
these new items that do not have
historical sales to find some answers
let's go look at the user guide to learn
more about substitute methods they
include methods that involve copying
sales and copying forecasts these
methods require a like item in order to
be forecasted by rdf and assigning like
items is a manual time consuming and
potentially inaccurate process another
option which does not require a like
item is base rate of sales to learn more
about base rate of sales let's go to the
new item basic parameters view the final
substitute method in this table provides
a better way of creating a forecast if a
base rate of sales can be calculated or
interfaced for the new items
RTF will automatically take this
information and use
to generate a robust forecast that
includes trends and seasonality this
process is automatic pre-processing
corrects historical data prior to
forecast generation when history does
not represent general demand patterns
the result is a more accurate
representation of the historical demand
which is what would have sold under
ideal conditions a common question is
when I pre process the history I have
several options what method should I use
and for what purpose
the user guide provides a great starting
point to fully understand the concepts
necessary to accomplish historical
demand preparation the historical demand
preparation module contains the
reference links to the workbooks you
will use as you can see by clicking a
link you are immediately transported to
the pre-processing administration task
it describes common uses and when it
runs and why for the cloud service
workflow you can learn that it is most
often implemented in batch you still
control the measure algorithm and number
of periods next we can go view the
details around the pre-processing
methods here you can see that the
appendix is a valuable source to help
you understand which pre-processing
methods to use and when some commonly
used methods include lost sales standard
exponential smoothing and why it is so
commonly used by clicking on the link
you are taken immediately to this topic
here you can see that lost sales
standard exponential smoothing will
correct the periods that are indicated
by you as being out of stock it is
generally used to process long time
ranges another commonly used method is
standard exponential smoothing the two
main uses include the removal of spikes
such as water sales before a big storm
in addition an item can be heavily
promoted one year and you want to get a
baseline picture of that item so you can
remove all the promotional lifts for
that item to get a better representation
of baseline demand for that year finally
we will learn about the standard medium
some items can be considered noisy
standard median can process that choppy
line into a smooth line for our
customers who prefer their forecasts to
have a smoother look we continue with a
discussion on confidence intervals the
user guide contains the RDF cloud
service statistical forecasting
processes specifically we can look at
the information for time series or
statistical forecasting methods
included is the importance of confidence
intervals the time series methods used
to generate forecasts and how the best
forecasting method is selected from a
list of candidate models what are
confidence intervals confidence
intervals are measure of how much
confidence you have in a generated
forecast we look at the standard
deviation of the historical demand for
example in a flat historical demand you
can be more confident that what you're
generating will occur in the upcoming
selling season for that item if the
historical demand for an item that sells
a lot some weeks and other weeks little
to none your confidence will be less for
that generated forecast based on that
items pattern for historical demand low
confidence in the forecast is translated
into high confidence intervals these
confidence intervals may affect
replenishment if too high you may build
up too much inventory during the selling
season for example to deal with this we
offer several ways to control the
magnitude of the confidence intervals
you can learn more by reading the
information about the forecast
administration task and the guide it
provides you the necessary information
to help control these confidence
intervals the forecast administration
module also includes information about
the final level parameters view advanced
settings it also contains valuable
information about the interval cap lower
and upper ratios our next topic deals
with data pooling it was introduced in
version 15 it allows the estimation of
causal events at an aggregate level in
the guide you can learn about causal
parameter settings and more specifically
the next run date topic in addition the
causal run mode section provides
additional valuable information because
you are at this aggregate level you will
benefit from a large pool of data in
this case a best practice suggestion is
not to run the causal estimation very
often for instance the estimation
generation task would run monthly rather
than weekly we continue with our next
topic how do we select the best
forecasting method you have some choices
on how to proceed you can either select
a specific forecasting method from a
list of available choices or you can
choose automatic exponential smoothing
auto Li s runs a battery of methods and
they compete to produce a winner that
winner is selected by balancing the
forecast
error against the complexity of the
method that was used to produce that
forecast to see this exact formula look
in our guide and learn more about the
Bayesian information criterion you will
also see how the auto es flowchart helps
you to understand the auto es process we
continue this documentation tutorial
with the next topic exception management
also known as alerts RDF produces a lot
of forecast data this data needs to be
approved before it is sent to downstream
systems reviewing it is impossible due
to the magnitude of the data set
rdf uses business rules implemented as
alerts that will filter out the values
that need to be reviewed the user guide
lists the alerts to assist you with your
daily forecasting tasks let's explore a
few of these alerts we start with the
forecast versus recent sales alert this
alert compares the level of the recent
sales and the level of the forecast one
would expect them to be similar but if
not this alert notifies you the
discrepancy that needs attention next is
the current forecast versus last
approved forecast alert this alert
compares previous forecasts to the most
recently generated forecast one would
expect these forecasts to be similar
from week to week if not this alert
notifies you that the item forecasts
need attention we continue with the
forecast versus last year's sales alert
the most reliable forecasts are
generated from data that has a
repeatable pattern year-over-year
however this is not always the case a
change in business strategy merchandise
reclassifications and new items can all
lead to changing selling patterns over
time to detect possible changes in
selling patterns the following alert
will compare the last year's sales
volume with the forecasted sales volume
if they are different by an adjustable
percent the alert is triggered the last
alert features the causal peaks alert
retailers use promotions to drive demand
this is a complex process to determine
the impact sometimes the forecasts can
come in on the high side this alert
catches those peaks in the forecast and
lets you the user review those Peaks in
order to prepare replenishment for that
promotion our last best practices
deals with promotional forecasting our
solution specialists recommend running
the causal forecasting at the week level
versus the day level if the causal
forecast is needed at the day level set
the causal calculation intersection to
the week level and the solution will
automatically spread the weekly forecast
to the day's level for more information
see the user guide to learn more about
causal forecasting at the daily level
here you can even see how the daily
causal forecast process executes this
