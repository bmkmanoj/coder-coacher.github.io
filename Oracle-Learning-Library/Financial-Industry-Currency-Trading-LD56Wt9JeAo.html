services customer related demonstration
showing streaming insight into real time
foreign exchange currency monitoring and
enabling instantaneous currency trading
investors can trade almost any currency
in the world anyone individuals
countries and corporations may trade in
the Forex if they have enough money to
get started and I was shoot enough to
make more money at it how you can make
money in the Forex is a speculative
process you are betting that the value
of one currency will increase relative
to another and with the latest streaming
analytics technologies the possibilities
are unlimited on the amount of
profitable trading that can be executed
with continuous patent determination and
automated intelligence let's kick off
things by logging into the product
stream Explorer to link and take a look
at our configuration system settings for
thus mark Kafka and the analytics
components
now for this application we have some
foundational artifacts that can be
utilized we have the live streaming
source of Forex currency events and the
various connections and database table
references needed for this application
they will go ahead and build the
solution application providing a name
useful description tanks for searching
artifacts later in the catalog and we
will select the initial based streaming
Forex source pressing the Save button
initiates the creation of a spark
streaming application that will receive
the event messages and display on the
canvas in the live output stream section
you
the value is displayed being the
currency symbol currency name and
associated current price
now let's create a new query pipeline
stage to cleanse the data by selecting
only our interest in the dollar currency
quotes that contain a price value
the use of a query filter achieves this
goal
you
now we want to see currency fluctuations
within specific boundaries over a
defined 60-second time period in this
case we are looking for a deviation of
0.01% for this we use a pattern stage
provide a name volatility description
and select the integrated fluctuation
pattern
specifically if the next rate for the
same set of currencies is up or down by
0.01 percent within the time interval we
want to see that in the live output
screen
we will now create a new query stage so
we can calculate the net gain or loss
and accumulate it over a continuously
flowing one-hour period
this is done by grouping by the symbol
the US dollar and specifying the sum of
the fluctuation percent which can be a
positive or negative amount
you
let's rename the livestream columns for
better breathability and use the
expression builder with a custom
function to find out the other
associated currency in a new column
you
another query stage is created now to
provide more detail of the currency from
your previously created database table
reference we join the stream with a
table using source correlations and the
new information is again reflected in
the live output stream
you
to help us better understand the
fluctuations of the net gains and losses
of the dollar against these other
currencies we can now introduce
visualizations for example a real-time
operational bar chart instantly showing
the information needed
you
in addition we can add a current
timestamp to our live output stream so
that we can now show an implement a
temporal line chart to also plot another
visual perspective of the dollar
movements
you
finally now armed with this analysis of
the dollar in real time we will define
and configure a target
you
this target will immediately send the
results to be collected by an automated
or manual trading platform
you
let's wrap up by looking at our spa
console information to review the status
of our created and running application
both in its draft state
and once again after
vacation has been successfully published
so there we have it a complete
end-to-end foreign exchange currency
monitoring application built not in
weeks or days but in minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
