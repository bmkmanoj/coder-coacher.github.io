Oracle servers important for complete
service procedures and prerequisites see
your service manual links to
documentation are provided at the end of
this video
procedure overview the troubleshoot and
resolve server hardware faults act
immediately when the system notifies you
that a fault has occurred isolate and
identify the fault and prepare the
server for service using Oracle ILOM
follow ESD protection procedures and
adhere to serviceability requirements
before replacing the part replace the
part following the procedures in the
service manual prepare the server for
operation when the server has a hardware
problem the system alerts you by logging
and error in the system event log and
lighting the service action required
indicator troubleshoot the problem
immediately to isolate the location of
the fault login to Oracle ILOM
and check the status of the server
subsystems and the status section of the
summary screen the status section
provides the current state of all the
server subsystems in this example the
status section shows that the memory
subsystem needs service to identify the
faulty part click the subsystem name in
this example dim D 8 on processor p0 has
an uncorrectable error and needs to be
replaced the open problem section of
Oracle ILOM contains additional
information such as the time that the
fault happened it also has a link to a
knowledgebase article where you can get
even more information now that you have
found the part you can fix the problem
prepare the server for service for cold
service power off the server to standby
power mode in the actions section of the
summary screen click power state turn
off use Oracle ILOM
to turn on the server's locator
indicator the locator indicator helps
you find the server it can now go to the
server to replace the part
once at the server create an esd-safe
workspace use a wrist strap and adhere
to component serviceability requirements
for cold service remove the AC power
cables to locate the fall key part and
the server use component designation
information or use the system font
remind test circuit the fault remind
test circuits use indicator LEDs to help
you locate the part remove the part and
install a good one when you are done
prepare the server for operation and
power the server to standby power mode
some parts such as dims need to have
their faults cleared in the system apply
full power to the server
check that the fault is cleared using
Oracle ILOM conclusion the troubleshoot
and resolve server Hardware faults act
immediately when the system notifies you
that a fault has occurred isolate and
identify the fault and prepare the
server for service using Oracle ILOM
follow ESD protection procedures and
adhere to serviceability requirements
before replacing the part replace the
part following the procedures in the
service manual prepare the server for
operation important for complete service
procedures see your service manual on
Doc's oracle.com the procedures in this
video applied to servers with Oracle
ILOM 3.1 and later for details see
