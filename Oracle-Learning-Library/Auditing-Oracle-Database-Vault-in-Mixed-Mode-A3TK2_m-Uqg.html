for oracle server technologies in this
video we will show you the tasks listed
on this slide to audit oracle database
vault in mixed mode in this video i'll
show you how to audit oracle database
worldly in mixed mode this video is
based on the assumption that the
database vault is configured and enabled
in an oracle database released for our
fun 02 or later and that unified
auditing is not yet configured when you
install a new database and configure it
to use database world then by default it
uses a mixed mode environment that is a
mixture of unified auditing and pre
migrated auditing if you have upgraded
from previous release then database
vault uses the auditing that was
available with that release or
configuration changes made to database
world I mandatorily audited including
actions of unprivileged users who
attempt to modify database world
policies in a mixed mode environment you
can create audit policies by using the
database world ap is the DBMS ma CA the
MPL sequel package or the database vault
pages in cloud control the audit records
are written to database vaults audit
trail which is told in devices audit
trails dollar you can query the sub
views the DV source TV dollar
configuration audit and the DV dollar
enforcement audit for these audit
records to see how big your audit trail
is in mixed mode you can count the roles
in devices audit underscore trailer
dollar and as you see we have nine here
let's look at the configuration audit
subview the output shows you some sample
records in the first year row you
see that the database board was enabled
then that the HR application rearm was
created an object was added then the
realm was updated it was changed from
regular to mandatory next another rearm
was created an object edit and that way
on was deleted all of these activities
were done in a previous video the diva
doll enforcement audit view provides
audit information when users violate
Crocodylus world policies here in a non
unified audit environment violations of
the Oracle database world components are
audited and recorded both of these rows
show that the HR schemer user was trying
to select rows from the employees table
that is secured by a mandatory rearm and
it has a return code 1031 insufficient
privileges to purge the audit trail the
security administrator must have the DV
ordered cleaner parole which is new with
Oracle Database 12c logged in with sis
DBA privileges you can see that select
and detailed privileges are given with
this role for the audit underscore
trailer dollar table use the delete
command to clean the audit trail we just
looked at some examples how to audit
oracle database volte in mixed mode
these steps are listed again on the
slide the next step is to enable unified
auditing and there are multiple training
possibilities for that there are Oracle
university courses self studies product
documentation one of the simplest ways
is to use the Oracle Learning Library
oil L which has an auditing with unified
audit obe thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
