welcome in this demonstration you will
see how to use in a price manager Cloud
Control 12c to monitor Fusion
Applications vacation managing pack Ford
Fusion Applications provides
comprehensive monitoring and management
functionalities for fusion applications
it provides you functionalities in three
major categories discovered in
monitoring performance diagnostics and
lexical automation we are going to look
at the discovery in monitoring aspect of
application running back specifically we
will be look near the fusions in
discovery system monitoring topology
visibility and service for management
application running back for fiction
applications suppose monitoring of two
different categories of target types as
fusion applications and fishing little
world as part of the fusion applications
we suffered fishing instance monitoring
station product family fishing product
cluster jetty applications fishing GT
application and seasoned repository and
these are the target types are
introduced in the cloud controlled
release it also supports monitoring our
fusion middleware and the host target
type like a vision will form the mine
server so our infrastructure ESN host
the discovery process of application
online pack discovers all these
artifacts and start bro its
out-of-the-box monitoring for these
instances this slide shows the
relationship between the various target
instances or target tiles discovered by
the discovery process this fusion
instance is a target type or target
instance created by the discovery
process which contains the fission
products family and this fission product
family contains one or more efficient
products which are provided by diffusion
jetty applications to running on a
weblogic server on a host so by
capturing all this relationship advice
manager provides easy way to navigate
and diagnose the performance problem and
identify the root cause in a more
comprehensive way so what you see here
is interface manager Cloud Control 12c
release of fusion applications page so
this page can be accessed by going to
targets and fusion applications so when
you first install Enterprise Manager
this
page will be empty the first the
prerequisite is you to go and click on
the add fish in instance and configure
the fish instant have to be monitored
database manager so clicking on the add
fish an instance takes you to lizard
which prompts you to enter some
information like administer holes
username password unique and different
and the agent that will be used for
discovery so providing this information
and clicking on next we'll go and
discover all the products families
deployed in splitting remand and also it
allows you to choose and start
monitoring some other target types of
target instances actually so this
discovery process discuss all the
products armley is the products and all
dental infection middleware artifacts so
they see here this is the result of a
discovery which discovered one fish
instance and five product families the
etf product family common CRM set up
product families so this page provides
high level overview of various product
families like incident what a different
critical and warning instant what a
different config changes happened in
particular and ramen and also what are
the path is applied in the past seven
days so it's an administrator you can go
to their homepage of the fish in
instance to view the aggregate
information for the complete deployment
so the summary region of this fish
instance page home page shows the
high-level roll up information about the
monitoring and diagnostics and the
underlying database to which the
efficient application is configured to
so this shows what are different
incidents and the deeper missing and
target innocent like for example doesn't
fishermen lure specific instance shows
up here and also show the configuration
changes to happen in the past 24 hours
and also supported which columns so by
looking at this page the idea is that we
provide the high-level information about
the complete deployment in a new top
down manner so the number target
somebody shows the information about the
various products families so the health
of each product family can be identified
by just looking at this particular table
the top long-running job request page
table shows the information about Vee
various ESL jobs running in this
particular environment as you know
Fusion Applications uses yes a job
heavily for running some batch requests
actually so it's important to monitor
the health of user jobs always so this
region provides the health of video
here's a jobs running in this particular
in ramen so we provide a bunch of
out-of-the-box report as part of the
fiction instance to access them good
efficient instance click on monitoring
and a good a system performance page
which provides high-level information
aboard the various underlying artifacts
of these fish instance as you see here
this page provides information about
server performance from the product
family perspective and the host
perspective and there's a different
timeline legged day to 15 minutes are
all information actually and especially
for example if we expand this a specific
product family it provides information
about cpu usage TP stage the active
session in Turkish passing time and the
bottom of this page shows information
about the various hosts on which this
particular fusion engines running so it
should them CPU resources H all things
from the air at the high level actually
and then you can go to the routing
topology viewer which provides the
complete visibility into what's going on
at runtime in the fish instance level so
what you see here is the routing
topology viewer this particular instance
there are only two domains the common
domain and the CRM divine each domain
has bunch of application to your
application the course setup or CRM
common I have contact management app so
all these applications are talking to
the database via the MDS so by looking
at this you can immediately know which
application is talking to which database
where which MDS actually so it also
provides various view by operations like
grew by host lube and middleware our
group I products actually each of the
target types what I mentioned before
will contain a home page actually will
show home page unification technology
common CRM product family
product everything has a home page of
its lon so go to the products family of
crm CRM product family the reference I
choose all the products which are part
of their product family in all the
fusion applications and all the
underlying fishermen were targets here
on domain that means server weblogic
server stuff actually an item side shows
information about the application
infrastructure into database and
monitoring information fish applications
the KP indicator and also the topology
it also provides the hilar information
aboard with ESL jobs specifics are
unexpectedly for CRM and also the soya
instances sure policy RM deployment
actually so the idea here is that this
home pages provide the aggregate
information about what's going on in
that that particular product family so
likewise there's a home page for each of
the different target type like a fish
cluster application product home page
admin server blood server are the sower
composites actually by going to the home
page you can get a high-low information
about what's going on and also what the
incident happened everything can be
visualized from those home pages
actually thanks for watching this
