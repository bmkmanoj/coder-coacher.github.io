in this demo we'll take a look at some
of the
in the Oracle Enterprise Manager so a
man's impact Enterprise Edition will
start on the home page for the sole
infrastructure on this page we see a
summary of the metrics for this
particular Sowa infrastructure we see a
summary of performance for the service
engines we see a summary of throughput
and we also see a summary of the
deployed composite within the soá--
infra here I can also see the
configuration associated with this
particular soul infrastructure I can
start by looking at the last collected
configuration and see the configuration
that is currently deployed to this
particular server I can see any of the
Associated configurations to the so
infrastructure and I can see the
configuration values for the different
parts of the Sowa infrastructure itself
using this information I can also
perform additional configuration
functions like looking at the
configuration dependence topology or
doing configuration searches comparisons
snapshots or look at the overall history
of the configuration files
returning to the Sola infrastructure
home page I can continue on and drill
down I could drill down to one of the
service engines or drill down into a
deployed composite I'm going to go into
this order booking composite and we are
here now on the order booking composites
home page on this home page I can see a
summary of the throughput messages and
errors per minute across this so a
composite the services and references on
the so composite and metrics for the
components within the sole composite for
the individual people mediator human
workflow and decision service components
I can also go to the topology for this
particular so a composite
the topology will show me the wiring
between the different components in this
so a composite and I can go into
individual components like this order
processor people process and then get
further performance details about the
execution of this people I can actually
even drill down in the context of people
to individual activities within the
people process within most of our
middleware targets we also now have an
integrated Fusion Middleware log viewer
in this case from the order booking
composite again I can head over into
view log messages which allows me to do
a search and view of the Fusion
Middleware diagnostic logs here I'm
looking at the most recent one our I'll
add in notification level message and do
a search this brings up then all of the
notification level log messages
associated with this particular
composite the order booking composite if
I see a particular log message of
interest like for instance this JMS
message producer log message i can then
see the details of this log message
formatted out in this bottom pane here
in the message details the ec ID is a
link that then allows me to perform a
broadened search across the logs for
this particular execution context ID so
if I found a particular log message of
interest I could then search for other
log messages related to this particular
invocation this then brings me into a
new view that has the correlated log
search coming back to the solo
infrastructure home page we also have a
new feature called dehydration store
performance this page gives us select
database metrics specifically for the
tables tables
and schemas for the so a dehydration
store this allows a so administrator to
get a quick overview of the growth rate
of their dehydration store as well as
key performance metrics to enable them
to triage issues before passing them off
to a database team this concludes the
demo of the Oracle Enterprise Manager so
a management pack Enterprise Edition
