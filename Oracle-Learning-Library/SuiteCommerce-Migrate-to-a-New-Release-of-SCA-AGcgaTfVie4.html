migrate your Suite commerce advanced
site from one release to another as part
of this process we're going to review
the release notes to see what the new
release includes installed a new bundle
download the new source code migrate
custom modules to the new source code
update the new District JSON file to
include the custom modules test locally
deployed to NetSuite and finally link
the new release of FCA to the domain the
first thing to do before updating to a
new release of SCA is to read the
release notes to see what is included in
the new release and you can find the
release notes in the suite commerce
developers portal in the developers
portal click documentation and then
scroll down and click release notes
click suite commerce advanced release
notes and then select the notes for the
release this topic tells me what to
expect in this release including new
features and enhancements and it also
gives me the bundle ID associated with
the release make a note the bundle ID
because you'll need it to install the
bundle now that we know the specifics of
the new release the next step is to
install the bundle and to install a
bundle go to customization suite bundle
or search and install bundles the
easiest way is to enter the bundle ID
and click search you can also search by
keyword but that returns any bundle that
matches the keyword using the bundle ID
insures that you get to correct bundle
click the bundle name and this takes you
to the bundle details click the install
button then review the terms and click I
agree after you agree to the terms you
can review the bundle installation and
then click the install bundle button
this takes you to the installed bundles
page
interior you can monitor the status of
the installation click the refresh
button to update the status and here I
see that my installation is complete
after the installation finishes the next
step is to download the source files and
set them up in your local environment
you can find the source files in the
file cabinet they're located in the
underscore sources folder within the SSP
Applications file system here you find a
zip archive for diversion of SDA click
the download link to download the file
to your computer next I need to extract
the source files from the zip file and
add them to my local development
environment then in the root of my
source files folder I need to install
additional files required by the
developer tools and I do this by running
the npm install and the gulp commands in
the root of my new source folder since
those steps are straightforward and
documented in the SCA developer guide I
will omit them from this demonstration
now I need to migrate my custom modules
to the new local source files and the
first step in that process is to copy
the extensions directory from the
modules directory of my current MCA
release to the modules directory of the
new SCA release now let's look at both
projects in the editor indoor diff
against the distro json files from both
releases this helps me identify the
difference between the two releases so
if I look here I see that the entry for
the old releases pink the new release is
green and the things that didn't change
are white at a cursory glance we see
that many of the SCA modules have
changed this is readily apparent by
comparing the version numbers here's an
example if we look at the account module
for the new release of SCA we see that
it has a larger version number than the
previous release of SDA this is also an
important consideration when it comes
time to add your custom modules to the
new release of SCA one of my custom
modules is an override of the home page
template file if I look at the NS
package.json file for my custom mod
I see that it overrides the homepage
template for the home module two point
zero point two that the new release of
SCA uses home module two point one point
zero so it's part of adding this custom
module to the new SCA release I also
have to change the custom module to
override the template in the new version
of the home module so in the new version
of my custom module I change the
override to look at the newer version of
the home module to do this I need to
change the version number in the paths
from two point zero point two to two
point one point zero one other custom
module is a CSS cascade to change the
appearance of my site theme and I don't
need to make any changes to this custom
module because it is not module version
specific now I need to add the entries
from my custom modules to the distro
JSON file in the new source files and
let me caution you it's important that
you update the new District JSON file
with your entries instead of replacing
it with the old file because as you saw
Nord if the new file is quite different
from the old file first I'll add both
custom modules to the top of the modules
list at the beginning of the file next I
need to add my three am module to the
dependencies array for task config SAS
applications shopping and I can look at
the current district on file to see
exactly how I have it set up now I'll
search the file for 3 a.m. to jump to
that area of the file I see here that I
split the base a Styles module into two
parts with the 3a and mudge while
loading between main variables and main
atoms I need to find the same section in
the new district JSON file can make the
same change I'll copy the entire basis
styled sections from the older version
of the file and replace that section in
the newer version of the file so I've
copied the code to my clipboard and I'll
go to the new district on file and I'll
search for base SAS die
to locate that section of the file and
I'm just going to highlight and replace
with the code that I need to load my
module and that should do it
so now I want to test my custom modules
on the local server
I run the gulp local command to start
the local server then I load my site and
I see immediately that I am indeed
running a new release of SCA I also see
by the dark colored theme that my CSS
cascade is being used and I can tell by
the look at the home page that it is
using my template override now any
server-side changes aren't going to show
up on the local server you have to
deploy to NetSuite to see those after
you finish testing locally then you'll
want to deploy to a development domain
or to a sandbox account and test it
again after you finish testing on your
development domain or in your sandbox
account then you deploy to the
development SSD application in your
NetSuite account after all the testing
is done you need to deploy the
development ssp application to your site
and NetSuite go to setup suite commerce
advanced SSP applications find the
development ssp app and click the View
link
and click the link to side button and
choose your site from the site drop-down
list click the Save button and that
deploys the SSP up to your site finally
I go to my site and I confirm the
changes I see that it's running the
newest release of SCA I see my 3 a.m.
thing and I see that it is using my
template override it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
