actions you can perform in Oracle
process cloud service workspace
applications can be started from the
home page or the start application page
to submit an application request enter
the form details
and upload an additional document as an
attachment the request can be saved and
completed later or submitted for
processing the request is then routed
based on how the process is implemented
track submitted requests using the
process tracking page this started by me
filter displays all requests that are
still open for application request
approvers all assigned tasks are
displayed on the work on tasks page use
the search field to locate specific
tests the search criteria must be based
on task descriptions enter whole or
partial words in the search string
tasks can be sorted and organized based
on sort options such as due date
application or priority they can also be
filtered using any of the predefined
filters
Rob you'e tasks detail to see the
previous approvers when the task was
created and even changed its priority
adding comments and attachment to a task
is a great way to communicate with users
who will see it next
approving or rejecting a task moves it
to the next activity defined in the
process and tasks that require the same
action can be approved or rejected
together in a batch in the event a task
needs to be routed to someone else for
approval it can be reassigned to another
user
