Enterprise Manager cloud control
overview today we'll be focusing on the
new diagnostic snapshot feature which is
one of our middleware diagnostic
features now to begin with we'll start
on a WebLogic server page and we'll go
ahead and actually drill down to the JVM
now within our JVM we can see a
multitude of different information first
OE of a summary some of the optimization
levels are max our minimum heat memory
we can see the version and the make of
the actual JVM we have the overall
thread state below and we can see
there's a number of blocks in addition
we can see some of the active threads
here in our graph let's now go ahead and
drill down on our performance
Diagnostics via the link up here where
we can get some more detailed and
filtered information now here in the
performance Diagnostics page we can see
the active thread State CPU utilization
heap utilization some metrics on the
garbage collection as well and we also
have a lot of different filter options
we can filter on the method the database
of thread the state we have the ISA as
well and here even the request name of
course and below that we have a bunch of
different information right now we're
looking at all the different
informations coming from the actual JVM
itself so our top requests are tot
methods top sequel and the top deep DB
wait events as well so we can see what's
going on in the database we can see that
crossed here correlation and the overall
top databases as well as far as how much
time that JVM or pool of jaebeum's are
spending in each area
let's go also take a look at what's
going on in the actual threads himself
we'll go ahead and scroll back up and
we'll go ahead and click on the actual
threads tab to go ahead and drill into
those states we're now on the threads
tab we can see a time period here that
we could go ahead and just with this bar
all connected down to the actual metrics
beneath we can see that thread state
transition what's going on in each one
of the actual threads mousing over we
can go ahead and actually see the state
of each one of those it's because we can
see some network weights below that if
we go down we do some database weights
as well
the time period notice that we can
access both real time in historical here
and if we look down we can see the
metric by active state as well so
each one of the threads how long they've
been in each one of the states kind of
the breakdown from that perspective the
methods right now we don't have any
actual front-end requests coming through
but if we did they basically go ahead
and break through so we just see
basically none kind of a breakdown we
don't see the top ESA's as well which is
used to go ahead and track transactions
room Fusion Middleware now at this point
we could go ahead we can drill down into
each of these threads if we wanted to we
could find out a lot more information to
them we could actually cross here back
to the database but let's say for the
sake of this particular demonstration we
want to capture this data refer to it
later perhaps as an inverse situation
where we need to go ahead and capture
the data because we're going to restart
our servers very soon we want to be able
to analyze it later to figure out the
root cause but we can't have it impact
our system which we need to get up
immediately
other possibilities want to capture this
information want to share with Oracle
support or maybe we want to share with
our colleagues are using another
Enterprise Manager they want to go ahead
import or export that data so a lot of
different mechanisms to do that in order
to go ahead and drill to the next date
we'll go ahead we'll scroll up a little
side here for a moment and we can go
ahead and actually create a diagnostic
snapshot so clicking on our button will
bring us over to the diagnostic snapshot
wizard within the wizard we've gone
ahead and we've automatically captured a
bunch of information we've captured the
name of this automatically just called
it JBM Diagnostics collection gives a
date/time stamp we have a description
and we have the duration which we could
go ahead and easily change for instance
maybe I want to go ahead I want to
change this to just go ahead and
represent the last hour which I'll go
ahead and I'll do in addition I can go
ahead and add additional target data
just by simply going in a clicking add
here now I can add a bunch of different
targets if I want to what I'm going to
do in this case is go ahead filter by
Oracle WebLogic server
and I'll go ahead and I'll also search
for a specific name I'll go ahead I'll
select the one that I want you can see
we have three different choices and I'll
include this in my snapshot okay now
those that's been selected we have both
one WebLogic server and we have a JVM
now already captured two different types
of Diagnostics information we're going
to capture the Oracle Diagnostics
logging and we're going to capture the
JVM data that we saw earlier capture for
the previous tower and both information
will be packaged nicely within a
snapshot that I can go ahead and refer
to import/export but I want to go ahead
and utilize that so let's go ahead and
actually kick it off by going in and
clicking the okay button okay we've now
gone ahead and we've kicked off the log
we can see it go ahead and actually
collecting the information so let's go
ahead and collecting both our ODL
information or Oracle Diagnostics
locking and it's also go ahead and
collecting our JVM information just wait
to go ahead and completes here now that
it's complete we can go ahead and close
our dialog box bring us back to our list
of diagnostic snapshots that have been
taken thus far here we have the
capability to go ahead and we can import
we can export so if we go ahead and
click on the one that we want to add it
just created most recently we have the
capability at this point to come in and
analyze it which we'll go ahead and do
here now within the analyse we have to
keep a better look at both the ODI logs
the overall Diagnostics locking as well
as the jvm data all packaged together
once again it be imported into an
Enterprise Manager can be exported as
well and we have the ability to go ahead
and look at additional information just
by going and clicking on these the more
details on the JVM side which will bring
us into the information we looked at
earlier we'd be able to see it as part
of the snapshot but we also can go ahead
and jump into our Oracle diagnostics
logs let's go ahead and click there real
quickly to go in to finalize our demo so
now we're going into our Oracle
Diagnostics logging by the
my Fuhrer we can look at all the various
information in here we're able to go
ahead and filter it very easily just by
going it unchecking unknown trace and
notification and we can see both
notification logs as well as warning
coming from our log files here we're
able to go ahead and search on those to
eliminate them we'll bring them just
down to the actual warnings this case
this is no actual incident or actual
errors in here and we have our time
period with that I'd like to go ahead
and conclude our overview of the
diagnostic snapshot feature in the new
version of Oracle Enterprise Manager and
I'd like to thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
