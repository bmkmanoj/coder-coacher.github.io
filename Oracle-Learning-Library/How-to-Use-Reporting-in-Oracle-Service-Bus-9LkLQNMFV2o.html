curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I will show you how
to use reporting an Oracle service bus
you can extract information from each
message in the service bus and view it
as a report in the service bus console
the information is captured by the JMS
reporting provider that is included with
the service bus these reports are useful
to track messages or for regulatory
auditing to enable message reporting you
first create a report action in the
message flow for the proxy service then
in the report action you specify the
information that you want to extract
from the message you enter the X query
expression to identify the variable or
message payload you want to extract the
information from then you create one or
more search Keys that identify the
actual data you want to extract in this
demonstration we'll create a report when
credit cards are used that shows the
validation status of the card so let's
get started here we are in the oracle
service bus console and project explorer
and first we'll create a new session to
keep track of our changes in this proxy
services folder there's a credit card
validation proxy servers will edit the
message flow for this proxy service by
clicking this edit message flow icon and
here we'll edit this route node and
first let's deselect this use inbound
operation for outbound because we don't
want to use the same operation for both
you can see this routes to the
validation for CC business servers and
we want to invoke the execute operation
now under
bond sections we want to add an action
and we'll select reporting report
because we actually want to create a
report now we'll click this expression
link and in the X query expression
editor we'll just enter the body
variable as we want to extract
information for the report from the
message body and we'll save now we need
to add a key to identify the actual data
we want to show in the report keys are
also convenient ways to identify
messages and you can configure more than
one if you wish let's give the key a
name and for the value we'll click this
XPath to create an XPath expression in
the XPath expression editor we want the
credit card status so let's select it
from the variable structures and it's
part of the message body so we'll select
the structure body let's expand the
response and we'll select credit card
status so now you see the XPath down in
the property inspector let's copy and
paste that into the XPath text area and
we'll save now we'll enter the variable
which is body for the message body note
that you can capture information not
only from the body of the message but
also from any other variable associated
with the message such as header or
inbound variables so that's it now we'll
save everything and will activate the
session and the change Center we'll
enter a description and then submit the
changes now let's run a test and make
sure the report is generated we'll
return to the proxy services folder and
bring up the test console for the credit
card validation proxy server
and first let's enter valid credit card
number and we'll execute it the response
document does indicate a valid credit
card let's go back and we'll do one more
test using an invalid credit card number
and we'll execute it and this time we
correctly see invalid so let's close the
test console now to view reports we go
to operations and under reporting we
click this message reports link and here
we see the reports which show that the
credit card status the key that we
entered earlier is valid at the first
test and invalid in the second test if
we click on one of these links we can
get more information about the message
details so that's it for configuring
reporting and Oracle service bus thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
