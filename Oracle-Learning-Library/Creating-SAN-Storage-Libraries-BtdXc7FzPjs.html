logging in to your virtualization server
as the root user run the stms boot
command to verify that solaris io
multipathing is enabled on the server
the fact that the device names are
listed here confirms that it is enabled
if it wasn't you would get the air MPX
io is not enabled from here on in work
an OP Center to create to san storage
libraries in this example I'm using
fibre channel luns so I'll select static
block storage to create the libraries
use the noose and storage library action
to open the create new sand storage
library wizard named the first library
something like San OV m SS you can also
give it a description if you like in
this panel associate the library with
your virtualization server
in this panel select one or more luns to
assign to the library lastly review the
summary to make sure everything looks
good and then let the job run create the
second sand storage library for the zone
name the library something like sand
zones and give it a description if you
like follow the same steps as before
associating the library to your
virtualization server select one or more
luns to be assigned to the library
review the summary and run the job under
static block storage in the libraries
pane select each library and verify that
its state is okay and that it's assigned
to the virtualization server
you should also view the libraries tab
for the virtualization server and make
sure that the libraries are listed in
the Associated libraries table you now
have to sand storage libraries to use
for your layered virtual environment i'm
