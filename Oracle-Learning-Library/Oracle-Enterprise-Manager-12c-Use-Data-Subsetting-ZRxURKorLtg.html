Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series these demo assumes you
already discover the application
relationships of your data using
application data models and you now want
to create a smaller sized representation
of your database to provide realistic
production data available to application
developers for accurate application
testing while reducing their storage
costs the demo uses the pre created
application data model to create an
application that a subset definition and
use it to generate the subset okay so we
now need to create the subset definition
you go to Enterprise menu quality
management and then data subset
definition on that page you need to
create it so you click create and you
need to specify multiple things first of
all the name you can provide a
description and then the application
data model you want to use and we
already created this one so we click OK
here and the last thing is the source
database so we select the database on
which we want to create this definition
and there it is so click select here and
then we can click continue and now we
need to specify the credentials to be
able to connect and submit the job so
right now it's in scheduled mode so
let's go and refresh the page until it
is successful there you go now the
definition has been created successfully
and we need to define the subset so you
select the definition and click edit
then you need to connect using a
credential to your target database and
select the schemas of interest so here
HR NLE for example and now you need to
define the rules to specify the subset
so you need to click create
then select an application in this case
HR and for this example we're gonna
select a table just one table employees
in this case and we will define the wear
clothes for the rows we want to keep and
the workload is pretty simple department
ID koala bind variable that we need to
define notice that we have here the
include related rows selected for
ancestors and descendants Abel's now you
can click OK and as you can see we still
need to define the value for the
parameters for the bind variables we
created so you go to room parameters
this is where you define them and click
on create so here you repeat the name of
the variable you give it a value and
click OK now let's have a look at the
space estimation so you can extend your
definition and look at the results on
the value schemas for example Oh II n HR
and you can clearly see here that three
tables are impacted locations employees
and Department for the HR schema so now
click return ok let's have a look at the
current set of data connecting directly
to the database itself and running some
sequels like counting the numbers of
employees and look at the grouping by
department so this is the current
situation right now now we need to
generate the subset itself so go back to
the definition and click on actions and
then select generate subset here you
need to specify what you want to do and
in this case we want to directly delete
the data from the database so we need to
specify a credential to connect and
define a value for the bind variable we
defined and then click continue last
thing is to specify a directory where to
generate the script before it
executed so here we select data from
directory we now validate the fact that
it's not a production database and click
continue
now we specify the host credentials to
run the job and click Submit it's
scheduled let's refresh the page until
it is successful and now let's have a
look at the impact on the data it
themselves so you connect to the
database look at the employees and look
at the grouping by Department and you
can clearly see the difference this is
basically the end of this demonstration
