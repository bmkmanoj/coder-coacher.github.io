for Oracle server technologies in this
video we'll show the tasks listed on
this slide before you configure database
vault be sure that you understand the
implication of this action for example
by default the soos user will no longer
be able to unlock users like the DB SNMP
user that needs to be unlocked for the
graphic interface in cloud control so
may I recommend to first read the
product documentation what to expect
after you enable Oracle database vault
to configure database world login to
sequel + SSD BA and create to users sec
admins and account
admins and grant them the create session
then we also unlock the HR schema
account with this command we are
configuring database world and we are
establishing the sec admin user as the
database world owner into the accounts
admin yes the database vault account
user manager if your site has only one
DV owner user and this user lost his or
her password you cannot disable Oracle
database world so as a best practice you
should grant the DV owner and DV account
manager roles to new or existing user
accounts and use the database world
owner and Account Manager accounts that
you just created here when you
registered with the Oracle database
vault as a backup account not for
regular usage only users who have been
granted the DV owner and the Viet Minh
row can use the devices DBMS Mac admin
packages and procedures so here we are
in a billing the database world s the
sec admin user after an abling or
disabling database war you should
restart the database you see with this
statement that although you just enabled
Oracle database world the parameter
value is still set to false
so now let's restart executing the same
query again you see now the parameter
value is set to true you just saw how
simple it was to perform the steps to
configure and enable database world but
you should really understand what it
means in your system environment so
please read the documentation go to
training or ensure otherwise that this
protection works precisely the way you
wish it and needed for your organization
