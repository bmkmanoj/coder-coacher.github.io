hi this is Aloka from Oracle primavera
today we will see how to create and use
an action items query tab in the meeting
minutes business process in Primavera
unifier you can use credit ABS in line
item and cost business processes that
have a detail form a credit tab is a
mini business process log within a
referenced business process form and
displays only those records that satisfy
query parameters such as specific
statuses for example you may want to
view the details of all action items
generated by a meeting minutes a record
you may also want to add another action
item to accommodate a scope change even
after the meeting minutes record is
closed at the outset let's take a look
at the action items business process log
there are 15 records in all assigned to
different users some have an open status
a few are closed and there is one
dominated record now let's compare this
log to an action items query tab in a
meeting minutes business process begin
by navigating to you designer change
status to draft click query items query
tabs click new select action items whose
query tab you want to create in meeting
minutes in the query tab definition
window complete the name and description
fields in the reference picker list
select meeting number this is the
meeting minutes business process picker
in the action items upper form and we
are going to now use it to filter
records in the query tab next we will
design the item logs the total number of
taps that you can have is 8 which
includes the query tabs click the query
tab to set your condition click Add
in the data elements list select status
select constant
and click okay you can configure query
tab options in uh perform properties
just like you do for detail forms when
you select the query tab the only option
available is to hide the current tab
complete the business process and deploy
the form click OK
return to your project and navigate to
the meeting minutes log you can view
query tabs in new records as well as in
existing records the query tab behaves
just like the action items log except
that it displays
records based on the query condition all
these records reference the current
meeting minutes record the log column
structure is exactly like the action
items log you can create a new record
you can copy an existing record you can
use find to search for an existing
record if you are a task assignee you
can even continue to route the record
from the tab finally a word about
creating a new business process with
query tabs query tabs are not seen in
the creation step they appear only after
being sent to the next step in workflow
business processes or when you save or
reopen after clicking finish editing in
non workflow business processes

tabs in a referenced business process if
