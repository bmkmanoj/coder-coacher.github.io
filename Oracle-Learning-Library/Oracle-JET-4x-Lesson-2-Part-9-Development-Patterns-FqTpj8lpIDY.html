second of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle yet in this part you'll learn how
to put the pieces together from the
previous parts in the context of
development patterns development
patterns are ways in which applications
can be structured for specific purposes
jett contains a number of different
starter templates and design concepts to
help you organize the sections in an
application these initial page layouts
are often referred to as apt shells and
jet provides these app shell style
starters for both hybrid mobile
development and web application
development the hybrid mobile
application development pattern
demonstrates how to create headers
footers and navigation components for
hybrid mobile applications created with
jet the mobile starter templates nav
drawer and nav bar use these patterns
and are available from the Oracle jet
website the web application pattern
helps you in giving you ideas for
creating headers navigation components
and footers that relate to web
applications created with jet once you
have implemented an app shell design the
next step is to design the layout and
behavior of the content on the various
pages of your application jet provides
responsive page content patterns that
focus on columns layouts and of canvas
components which incorporate responsive
design for various device sizes in this
part you've been introduced to
development patterns that you're likely
to want to explore when structuring and
designing your jet applications for your
homework for this part create a new web
application using one of the web starter
templates use one of the responsive
content patterns to design an initial
layout from one of the pages in your
application and again thank you for
participating in the oracle jet course
and see you in the final part of the
second lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
