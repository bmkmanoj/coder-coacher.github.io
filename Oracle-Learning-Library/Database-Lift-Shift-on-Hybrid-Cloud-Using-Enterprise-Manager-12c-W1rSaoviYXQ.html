welcome to Enterprise Manager
I'll see video series in this video
series you will learn how to close a
pluggable database J container database
on Oracle cloud and also how a pluggable
database or an Oracle cloud can be close
to an on-premise target database server
this is a new feature in enterprise
manager release 1205 the hybrid cloud
agent and the databases on oracle ground
have to be discovered here you will see
two databases one is a container
database or CEO and on oracle cloud and
another database sales cdb on an
on-premise data base both databases are
continued in a base and they are based
on version toila no to now let's review
the initial setup when i click on expand
all you will see we continue database on
oracle cloud has three pluggable
databases and and on the on-premise
target database server it has one
pluggable database now let us see how to
clone a pluggable database on from an
on-premise target to club here i am
going to right-click on sales underscore
frog which is an on-premise like of a
database and i'm going to click on
oracle database and cloning now you will
see a new option or clone to oracle
cloud when i click on loan to oracle
cloud you will see that the database
credential and the host credentials on
the on-premise database target or set by
default
and you will also notice that on the
cloud the database credential proper
credentials are set at the minimum the
user need to provide the pluggable
database credentials administrator
credentials and the source and the
destination credentials in case they are
not set and you can click on close this
is a very simple way of creating a cone
now let's review the advanced option so
when you click on advanced button we see
the display name so the display name is
something which we can specify and this
will appear in the enterprise manager
the advanced option gives you using user
to choose multiple option i am going to
specify the credentials the database
host credentials on auto club as other
credentials are set by default and i am
going to click on Next button now you
have the option to define a location or
directory where the pluggable database
data files will be created or the cloud
so I'm going to accept default here and
under advanced configuration you can
define the storage limits and specify
that miscellaneous items I'm going to
accept the fourth and I'm going to click
on next when creating a pluggable
database on overcame a user may want to
apply masking definition that will
protect sensitive data during the
cloning process
so the pluggable database created an
order for the data will be massed so
user has the option to specify the post
and sequence grip as part of the cloning
process I am going to click on next user
has an option to schedule the deployment
immediately or at a later point in time
would accept default here again and I'm
going to click on next now let's review
the source and the destination so here I
am happy with her with a source and the
destination details and I'm going to
click on close the cloning process will
take about 10 minutes so while the
cloning is going on now let's review the
pluggable database that was created
earlier so I'm going to click on a
pluggable database I created yesterday
and I am going to review the details so
here i created a pluggable database on
the Oracle cloud from from an on-premise
pluggable database you will notice two
things one we have a new or call the
Oracle cloud so which means this
particular pluggable database is running
on oracle cloud the other thing you will
notice is this pluggable database can be
administered and monitored just like any
other on from this database so you can
monitor the performance of the database
you can set the parameters etc these are
powerful and new features of the
enterprise manager to 105 days which
allows you to monitor
I hype a pluggable database on a
database on Oracle cloud just like any
other day that is now let us see how to
clone a pluggable database from Oracle
cloud to on-premise Here I am going to
choose sales dev which is a pluggable
database on Oracle cloud I'm going to
right click on sales dev and oracle
database cloning and now you will see a
new option called clone from Oracle
cloud I am going to click on clone from
Oracle cloud when i click on kron from
Oracle cloud you will see the source of
the destination details so if you review
the source and destination it looks Li
the same like the clone to Oracle cloud
so the interface is very similar and if
you click on clone button to specify the
the pdb admin credentials and V and the
source and the destination credentials
but go the pluggable database will be
created on on-premise from Oracle cloud
since we already reviewed clone to
Oracle cloud and when I click on cancel
button you can also move egg oracle
database to the Oracle cloud this
concludes the video series on the hybrid
cloud management and you feature in the
enterprise manager trollin 050 nice
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
