ebusiness weight integrated server
gateway i'm ray coyote principal product
manager for integrated server gateway
and other integration related products
from a business week today we will see
how to publish PL sequel api as rest
servers this tutorial is intended for
architects developers and implementers
who are working on integration of
e-business weight application it can
also be referred by mobile application
developers who are working on developing
custom mobile applications on top of a
business weight there are few
prerequisites you are expected to be
familiar with web services terminology
and the relevant a business weight
application and if you're planning to
refer this tutorial for hands-on
experience in sure to have your
e-business weight released well too for
instance
configured for rest services for that
you would have to refer my Oracle
support node 1 3 1 106 8.1 the objective
of this tutorial is to see or learn have
to deploy Oracle e-business suite PL
sequel API as a rest service and then
test it we will consider the sample use
keys of create employee in a business
wait and here are the high-level steps
first I'll search for relevant API in
integration repository then I will
deploy that PL sequel API as rest
service and create grants for it then
invoke the servers and finally verify
that the employee record is created in a
business way here we go 1/2 Oracle
e-business wait release 12 - for
instance it has integrated so while
Gateway configured for rest services a
logon S aside mint who has access to
integrated Sawad gateway
in the homepage and navigate to
integrated solar gateway
responsibilities
click on integration repository click on
search button we will search by business
entity employ
here are the list of API is belonging to
business entity employ the last one is
of my interest I'll click on employee
name this is the interface detail page
for the API and as you can see it's an
Oracle seeded public API you can scroll
down
to see the list of methods and API
navigate to rest webserver stop
note that here's this admin user is also
playing the role of integration
administrator and that's why you see the
administration tab on top and in rest
Web Services tab you can perform the
actions that are very specific to rest
services
from this tab you can provide service
alias select a method start doing more
to publish as read servers and then
deployed either through
fly as the alias name select create
employ
click deploy
I get the confirmation message on top of
the page and now we have the PL sequel
API deployed as a rest service on click
of a button
so both endpoints and XS DS are
accessible from the bottle and by
default for PL sequel API only the post
HTTP method is supported
click on View data link here is the
bottle
now we'll navigate to grants tab
the groins that I've defined here are
common for both soup and rest services
and select Crete and ply and click
create grant if more than one methods
are selected they are listed here you
can create grant for a specific user
group of users or all users I want to
give access to a group of users having
the responsibility a Chairman's manager
so it's for the responsibility
curate this unselected
click read crank to see the walk now we
get back to respect service top viral
and the excess tea
here is a sample payload for the servos
as shown in this Jason payload we have
rest header and input parameters
I'll make use of advance restclient in
Chrome browser to test the service
it's a post method provide resource URL
from the bottle
add HTTP arrows from basic
authentication
constructed for a charman's user
similarly add other headers except the
response in Jason as well
and paste the sample payload in the
payload area
it's end
here is the Jayson response
it has written my number along with
other details for the record now I will
verify the employ record in a business
way log in as the Chairman's user
navigate to
u.s. support Chairman's manager
responsibility click on people
internment inform
coin for the employer car
imply number written by the services to
404 int right here
and fine and here it is so the employee
record is created in a business weight
application I hope you found this
