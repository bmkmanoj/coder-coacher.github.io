you'll remember that we are looking for
ways to get more connected with social
developers and to build a social
developer community one of the things
that we're doing over the next week is
running a hack where you can use some
interesting technology that we've built
to integrate some social functionality
into one of your applications there are
two bits of technology that are
available to you to do that one is
something that the Oracle developer
social web has created called the social
link API and I'm going to invite august
i'll try and get the last name correct
here detlefsen is that right ok I got it
right excellent to join to join me to
present a little bit about the social
link API that we've created then we'll
get a presentation about another really
interesting tool called da leak or the
hack will be going on all week you can
go to facebook.com forward slash Oracle
social developer where you can submit
your ideas all the way at the bottom is
to submit your entries rather for the
applications you've built we'll look at
those in one week from today and the
winner will be profiled in java magazine
so with that thanks for being here and
August great
next one yep so yeah I'm here to talk
about the Oracle social link Java API
here's a big giant disclaimer that
everybody has to have so you know we've
been all talking about social media and
the enterprise and we've been talking
about social media in the enterprise all
day here and we know that it's important
to connect listen to your customers
communicate with your employees build
new ideas on the fly with other people
around and of course advertise which is
the first implementation what's the next
big thing maybe we'll see it this week
here at javaone hopefully so what's the
problem why haven't we done this all
already why isn't every single
application out there communicating with
Facebook and tweeting and everything we
all know why we want to use social media
when should we use social media that's
up to you know the business people to
deal with i'm here to talk about how the
real problem at least from a developer's
perspective is that every different
social media site uses a different set
of AP is you know there's the Twitter
API the LinkedIn API Facebook Graph API
each one has different endpoints
parameters different permissions returns
different things that will return XML
some of them return JSON they all have
underlying technologies that they use
like Oh auth rest etc it could take
weeks just a familiar memorize yourself
with each individual one the solution I
think at least is to standardize each
though each one of these things has a
different API and different terminology
think you know tweet versus post vs
you know your friends versus your
followers versus your connections
ninety-nine percent of what they do is
the same people connect with other
people people share ideas so why
shouldn't we standardize the interface
to do the same things we want to create
a standard set of interfaces to
authenticate to these networks to
publish content and to retrieve content
back from the network that you can then
do something with so that's why we
created Oracle social link it's a
standardized interface for all those
same things it's extensible and open
source and we're hoping that the
developers here at the conference will
take it and download start using on
their projects and then also help
contribute and build it out and build
more stuff onto it so now we'll get a
little bit deeper into the code of what
it is the primary interface of it is the
I social network interface and the goal
is to encapsulate interactions with a
social network in a standardized way so
it has methods like for setting the
username and the password and setting
the api user name for the apps that
you're going to interact with it has an
authenticate method which is which can
be made to be completely headless so
that you don't have to have a user pop
up a screen and type in their name and
password every time the application
wants to authenticate and it has methods
for publishing and returning messages
back from a particular API messages
being status updates or tweets or
whatever you want to call them and this
is of course as to start there's many
more things that could be done so an
abstract implementation of that is the
OAuth social network this is a
implementation for social networks that
use OAuth as their authentication scheme
so Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google+ it
provides extra methods to set the OAuth
scope set callbacks so that if you do
want to provide people with
authentication where the screen pops up
what site does it redirect to after they
authenticating it gets the request token
and the verifier and connects to those
servers and authenticates so here's an
example of an implementation for Twitter
or no can you guys see that so all you
have to do to make it work is over I the
verifier method to fetch the twitter
login page then the code will actually
scrape through that login page find the
inputs for username and password and set
their values then find the authorize
button and click it and then in the
return scrape out the code which is the
verifier that needs to be sent with
future requests for open off and if you
want to see the full code for doing that
it's in the slide notes which you can
download or you can download the source
code so the social class then is built
to act on multiple networks at once so
you build a list of networks that
implement the I social network interface
you put them into the social class and
then you can call the off method which
authorizes you to all of those networks
you can call the publish method which
publishes your string out to your
Facebook page and your Twitter page and
your LinkedIn page all at once and you
can also iterate through those networks
and pull down information about each one
so this is Java one we have to have a
hello world app how do we put it all
together well first we create our
networks here's a Facebook network set
the username and password of a live
human user set the api user name and
password of your facebook application
call back and scope which is the
parameters that that define what
permissions you have on the Facebook
network then you create the social
instance you pass in your list your
java.util.list of networks to
instantiate social you authenticate all
your users call social dot off pretty
simple on and then to publish your
measured message to all your networks
you just do social dot publish it
returns a list of response objects which
you can then iterate through to get a
message from each one so this is you
know the ID of the post that you just
published or possibly an error message
or if the network hasn't been built out
to support posting messages to it yet
some kind of error and then here's how
you would retrieve messages from from a
network you just do Network get messages
it gives you back the list of most
recent messages on each one you can then
iterate through each of those
automatically it parses all of the
different formats of messages via a JSON
XML whatever for each particular
implementation into a very simple
message object and then you can call get
author get title get they created etc to
find out more information about each of
those particular messages so we've taken
all these complex interactions dealing
with different technologies and
terminologies and now condense it into a
few simple Java API calls and iterating
through a Java collection super simple
this should make it really easy for job
developers to add social media
capabilities to their applications and
hopefully bring about some new ways of
interacting with social media that
haven't been thought of yet
anybody getting any ideas so far hope so
so we want people to contribute to this
there's a lot of things still to be done
we want to add the ability to publish
media like photos or or videos anything
else to directly to social networks we
want to add more social networks Google+
or or cut or anything it can all be done
by extending the I social network
interface and we want to do better and
more detailed search results so LinkedIn
in particular has like 15 different xml
formats so hopefully you know get a
little bit more detail about each one of
those so I encourage you all to get
involved during the project team on
java.net / project / social link submit
ideas for applications and hack together
some applications this week maybe you
could win a prize post comments
questions we happy to answer any of them
thank you very much I'm August detlefsen
if you have any questions yes go ahead
it's more like beta we just released it
yesterday so you could be the first one
to use it in production really it should
be live I'll bet it hasn't been
published yet then I'll find out and get
it published ASAP if it's not already
yes so that's a vendor supported version
of the same idea yes probably we're
watching it today right absolutely great
so any other questions we also have
presentation on da week or so give us
just one second to swap some Peters
thanks August we'll get him a microphone
you could just yank that
you
you
they all look the same
ok
so hi my name is Stan Belinda I'll do my
name is stan van olinda i'm from belgium
work for a localized fee hace IT
solutions and we've been doing quite
some work with dolly core and its body
core is actually a belgian project
because the core committers are
currently all Belgians and that
definitely has to change so if people
are willing to commit you're very
welcome we're building something nice
and steadily but slowly getting there so
the idea of da dÃ©cor is to really
extend java ee 6 to breathe in let's say
in a one-liner dolly core social is the
spring social for java ee actually so
Java e6 has a tremendous set riches of
api's they'd like some very important
aspects for building social applications
such as users contents groups and
permissions and that's actually actually
what da dÃ©cor ads so building a social
app without a clear notion of what a
user is and why the user has on content
and can do is very difficult so
therefore dolly core adds a set of JP JP
a entity beans in order to store all
user related data in the database dolly
core social damn builds on that layer
and extends that in order to integrate
with the different social networks and
currently we have support for facebook
twitter linkedin and google+ so in the
core of our framework there is the
concept of groups users permissions and
contents as depicted here on the diagram
and we built on top of CDI and egb 31 in
order to make all those let's say app
actions available to your application on
groups user permissions and contents
dolly core social has already explained
just adds an extra layer on that mainly
extending a user with
set of online accounts so a user for
example me can have a broad array of
online accounts that are done linked to
the necessary information to get access
to LinkedIn Twitter and other social
networks freeing you as a developer from
maintaining the difficult or related
stuff such as the refresh tokens making
sure that you get an access token to
access the particular API etc etc that's
all handled properly by Dolly core
social what happens under the hood is
rather complex but completely abstracted
away in an elegant way by dolly core
social so what you see here on the
diagram is a web client or a Java a
fixed client accessing a particular
social network what actually happens is
that the web client will access a
particular jax-rs Jersey backed rest
resource that time will handle the
complete or authentication ping-pong
with the social network making sure that
the end in the end there is a new user
created in the database if the user is
not yet in the database connection to
its credentials is properly stored in a
separate object and the Refresh token
and access token is also accessible for
further use when you call the actual API
and all this ping pong is ready you get
a call back to your application so that
you can register a separate handler for
making sure that you eventually call
your actual business logic and I'll show
you that in a minute in the code in
order to so get access to the social
features of dolly core social there is a
dalek or social handler actually does
just jax-rs endpoint that has mainly
three methods so connect in order to
connect to a social network and create a
new user connect with an existing uid
adding this particular social network
connection to an existing user and there
is also the possibility of course to the
ND couple and disconnect to user front
of a particular social network from a
developer perspective we also have an eg
be available it's a stateless session
bean dolly core social beam that can be
injected in your own code using CDI at
at inject annotation for example and
we'll get give you access to for example
the friends of a user the stream update
or post a message search for companies
or jobs in linkedin etc etc the dalek or
social egb is really let's say your
entry point in order to access the data
on the social network the rest all the
authentication has been handled for you
in a proper way let me just show you
what that then gives in code sorry about
that so this is just a very small demo
that I wrote this morning actually that
integrates with the three different
social networks and what I can do here
is I can just say I want to connect or
authenticate in this example via Twitter
Google+ or LinkedIn I'll of course get
redirect to to Twitter I'll have to sign
in and eventually I I'm signed in a new
user is created in the database Stefan
Linda with my profile picture and I can
then access the friends so that's
actually my my followers the reason why
it isn't displaying anything is not
because there is a bug in the framework
because I just reached my 150 request an
hour limit apparently a couple of
minutes ago so therefore there is no
list of of people i'm following what is
then it is in code just to give you an
example in order to bootstrap dolly core
social you have to do some things mainly
just adding
dolly core social to your maven poem as
a dependency so just add it as a
dependency in your project and that and
we'll bring in a set of extra
dependencies mainly social itself egb
and set of jersey and alt specific
dependencies next thing you have to do
and that's all just set up code it's
making sure that there is a
persistence.xml available in your
project and this persistence.xml just
list all the entities that are stored
using an entity manager using JPA in the
database you can then of course easily
extend the model with your own subtypes
with your own entities if required but
it has to be done so you just list your
different entities that that are needed
and that's actually mainly it and then
you can start developing the main thing
that you have to write is a handler so
in order to authenticate using a
particular social network let me just
open the GSP for you
you have to construct a particular URL
and URL easier listed so I'm just
invoking a get request on the Dalek or
social indicated I want to connect for
example using Twitter and I register my
application and pile endpoint in the
callback parameter so meaning that
eventually when all the Nifty
ping-ponging to get access to a network
has done I'll eventually get a redirect
to this rest demo call back end point
the rest dem i'll call back end points
is nothing more than just a jersey end
point and that's in this case
implemented here so you can see this is
listening on the part / demo and then /
call back we'll handle the actual call
back so what I'm now doing here is I
doing some verification to see whether
actually the request is a correct
request and that's also the part of the
classical or ping-pong game and I'm you
using the user being provided by da
dÃ©cor I'm accessing the actual or I'm
requesting the actual user so that's a
user object and I'm storing this user
object in the session so that i know
that i'm at this user this particular
usually stanville in in this case has a
session with the application then i
return a new viewable the profile yes
pay that will show me all the profile
information of that particular user of
course when I display a JSP a JSP also
have to display the model so I'll have
to build up a model that's accessible to
the GSP in my example so of course you
can plug in whatever rendering framework
that you would like in the end is just
CDI nagb that we're using but of course
I have to give the profile JSP d
appropriate model objects and that is
done here in my method build profile
model so in my example for my profile
and eat of course the user it's
accounts and its friends so this means
friends in facebook followers in in
twitter and currently there is no
google+ implementation because there is
no official api to access that
information in google+ for the moment in
order to get that information i can just
inject the dolly social beam so this is
just a call to get all the friends of a
particular user I just access the dolly
social Dalek or social being and invoke
the gate friends method that then will
eventually return me the list of friends
when this model is complete I'll just
get a redirect to the profile JSP and
the profile GSP is of course also not
really that specific it's just handling
displaying iterating over the over the
different social networks just that this
is just plain plain business logic
rights so in the end in order to use
dolly sorts course social I only have to
register a handler register a callback
and I get bootstrapped I off all the
information available to access the
social networks so this is the link to
the java.net project so it's been around
for quite some time now in order to get
bootstrapped please take loot at take a
look at a simple connect example it will
give you a variation on the demo that I
just gave it gives you all the
information to get started quickly and
recently with this dolly core and our
eco social is already used in production
set of sites in Belgian with a lot of
social integration recently there is a
new election in Belgian for let's say
the local the local level and we
launched the site using dolly core
social and just to give you an example
on the true put we got on the first
launch day is we had a particular moment
in time after the the news it was one of
the headline
announcements in the news because the
television station actually is a
supporter of the platform we had 11,000
concurrent active users on the site and
almost 500 requests per seconds coming
in on that you do that you jus two large
ec2 instances only having i think
approximately nine to ten percent cpu
usage so just by using the real rest
centric approach you can really scale
out pretty well yes glassfish so we're
running on glassfish because we like
lost fish not because we have a
dependency on it of course you can just
deploy on whatever java e6 runtime that
you would would you like we only need to
get profile indeed you know great well
thank you for presenting on dolly core
and I hope folks in this room and other
folks who find out about the hackathon
just through our social developer page
which is facebook.com forward slash
Oracle social developer will play with
this over the next week and submit some
interesting projects for us so thanks
very much thank you for having us
alright thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
