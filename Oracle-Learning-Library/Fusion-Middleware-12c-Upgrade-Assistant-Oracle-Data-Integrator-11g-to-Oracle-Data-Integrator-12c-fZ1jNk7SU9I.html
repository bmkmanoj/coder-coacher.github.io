a demonstration of running the Fusion
Middleware 12c upgrade assistance what
we're going to be doing is upgrading ODI
version 11.10 evan and we'll be
upgrading it to ODI version 12 1.2.12 of
doing an upgrade before we get into the
upgrade itself let me show you what
we've got on this system under uo1
under app I have Oracle and underneath
Oracle I've got middleware and under
middleware I've got ODI 11g then under
uo1 app 12c I have another Oracle
another middleware and then I've got ODI
12c then underneath downloads I have the
patches that are required in order for
the upgrade to happen so these are the
the downloads of the actual software
itself so ODI 11g comes in two pieces
two halfs quite big and then you need to
get a separate copy of RC you for 11g
the database that we're using as my
sequel 5.6 so there it is that expands
to this my sequel 5 6 1 of 2 and 2 of 2
expands to disc 1 in disk to the RC you
expands to RC you home so the 11g was
fully installed and it was running on
the database which happens to be
underneath the same uo1
app Oracle so the app Oracle home
contains the aura inventory contains the
or inventory for the 11g and underneath
that there's the inventory then
underneath 12c there's a different
inventory so it has to be a different
Oracle home so you see here we have the
different inventory under this different
Oracle home as I mentioned the patches
has to be installed
so let's real quick look at the patches
that we've got if I did an OPA list
inventory you'll notice that I have the
Java JDK specified out here if you're
using a 64-bit JDK you need to specify
it using using this particular set of
options if you aren't using a 64k 64-bit
JDK then you don't need to say that so
we're gonna go ahead and list the
patches that we have in question and the
patches are required you must must
install the patches if you're going to
do the upgrade so the Oh patch is
version 13.1 these are the patches that
fix the user
I'm sorry fix the upgrade assistant
itself and then these are the generic
patches that take you up to 12.1 2.0.1
so if we go into the OD I upgrade then
what we're going to do is run UA and
we'll look at what that looks like so as
I mentioned the schemas are currently on
the database the Oracle database which
happens to be a 12.1 database
welcome to the Upgrade Assistant we're
going to upgrade the schemas there are
no web lots of components on the
previous 11g in the installation that I
put in because I decided to make the
agent stand alone so we say next we're
just simply going to upgrade ODI itself
nothing else so I'll select ODI itself
and this just verifies that we've
already done everything we need to do
prior to starting the database connect
string is localhost 1521 Oracle
this is DBA there password it knew that
dev ODI repo is the only one out there
so there's no other choices and then we
have the option of upgrading everything
or not I don't know why you wouldn't
upgrade everything supervisor has named
supervisor
so you save this key write it down
somewhere post it in a in a text file
you may need it later and that's it
that's the whole thing this no this is
what it's going to do including a
printout of the upgrade key so here you
see it's upgrading the master repository
from oh one two oh two it actually takes
longer than you see here but I squeezed
out a lot of the waiting time it has
been at this point for about a minute
now you notice the terminology change
from interface to mapping
and that's it we've completed the next
it says it's all done close it up then
to actually run all of this you notice
that we have 11 G here and 12 C here
they're both installed it was necessary
that both of them were stopped during
the upgrade so now we launch 12 C
connector repository it's migrating
login information to the wallet the 11g
file will be removed and so this is a
one-way thing you can't backup select
yes if you want to keep if you want to
remove the old wallet no if you want to
keep the old wallet
so we'll say yes or more secure this is
actually building the wallet it
remembered this from before
and in comes the information from our
repositories so we see that we have the
sample tables project interfaces have
turned into mappings and here we have a
bunch of mappings we have a bunch of
procedures and we should have a bunch of
packages as well so those are all good
if we look at our models we see that we
have the my sequel tables which are the
targets and the oracle sample databases
which are the sources and just to verify
that they actually work we should be
able to view data and that all works
perfectly and if I want to execute a
mapping just to make sure that works we
can let's run the package
the package will truncate the existing
my sequel HR tables data stores and then
load regions departments and employees
and so we're ready to run that run that
package started pop over to operator all
executions it even migrated the previous
ones from before so we see June 25th
that's today it was successful it
truncated everything and loaded it so
the migration was completed and
successful thank you for watching this
