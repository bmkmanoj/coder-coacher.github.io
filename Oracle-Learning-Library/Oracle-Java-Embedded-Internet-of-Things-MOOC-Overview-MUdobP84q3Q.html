online course developed Java ME embedded
applications using a Raspberry Pi my
name is Tom Megan I am a curriculum
developer and one of your instructors
for this course in a few weeks I will be
joined by a group of creative and really
smart folks from the Java evangelist
team in this course our goal is to teach
you how to use your Java programming
skills to create some fun and
interactive applications using a
Raspberry Pi and Ja ME embedded 8 I'm
sure you're wondering what is Java ME
embedded not too long ago people used
computers that lived in air-conditioned
and data centers with the advent of a
personal computer they began to see
computers as a desktop device today
nearly every person on the planet owns a
smartphone and suddenly the computer is
a mobile device still today the data
generated by computers is a result of
human to human interactions a human uses
a device to read the data in another
device but with the advent of smaller
and smarter electronic devices
possibilities open up to allow devices
to talk to one another and share data
and use that data to make decisions
imagine that you're driving in your car
when the car detects that your tire has
a slow leak and is losing pressure using
a wireless internet connection the car
determines that there's a service
station two miles ahead and that that
service station carries a replacement
tire contacting the service station it
also determines that there is no
appointments or no wait time to get a
replacement
then the car simply guides you directly
to the service station to get the
replacement this is an example of the
internet-of-things
car reads a tire pressure sensor common
in late model cars and uses the data to
determine a rate of change in the tire
pressure using a GPS device the car
determines its current location using a
cellular network the car sends an SMS
message to the nearest service station
to determine that the station has a
replacement tire and the estimated
service time in our scenario there are
farmers who grow crops harvest their
crops and place them in containers that
are shipped to a distribution center
they have been getting reports that some
of the shipments arrive at the
distribution center spoiled and they
would like to track the number of times
that these shipping containers are
accessed the temperature in the
container and where the container
traveled on its way to the distribution
center in this course we are going to
focus on the ability of an embedded
device to collect analyze and share
information you will use the raspberry
pi and electronic components to create
an embedded device that collects
information from a shipping container
using a Raspberry Pi and several
electronic sensors you will create an
embedded application that reads a switch
reads temperature and location and
stores these readings and prompted by a
client application the embedded device
will send the stored data to the client
to be displayed in some meaningful way
this may seem like a daunting task but
by the end of 5 weeks we will help you
complete this project just a note about
who this course is for because we wanted
to get you started as quickly as
possible this first course is designed
for someone who has some experience with
Java standard edition Java SE this is
not an entry-level course we won't be
spending much time teaching your Java
programming so we can concentrate on
writing Java ME embedded
Asians and working with the electronics
so if you have a couple of years of
programming a job and are interested in
creating your own embedded applications
we are looking forward to seeing you in
class
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
