hello my name is Mazen RR today I'll be
talking about a powerful testing
framework Oracle flow builder manual
testing has always been time-consuming
especially when there is code update or
effects manual testing can be a major
problem if it has to run over and over
many times companies are forced to disco
or cut down on testing to meet deadlines
the automation would be a great solution
for this problem but it is not easy to
find technical resources to automate
your manual test flows not to mention
that when the application changes
through an upgrade or an enhancement
these automated test scripts might have
to be thrown away and you have to create
new ones Oracle application testing
suite or ODEs offers few testing
solutions we have Oracle functional
testing suite Oracle load testing suite
and orc of this manager today we will
focus on functional testing Oracle
functional testing suite supports
functional and regression testing it
also offers web and Oracle application
testing accelerators and a powerful
testing framework called Oracle flow
builder so what is Oracle flow builder
it's a keyword driven framework that
will allow you to create test flows in
three stages stages first let's talk
about keywords keywords are the
different user actions such as click set
text there are 66 keywords available to
perform these different actions when you
sequence these keywords to perform a
specific transactions then you have a
component for example creating a sales
order Heather is a component creating a
sales order line is another component
and so on each component is a set of
keywords that are grouped or sequence
together to perform a transaction
these components can be saved and used
repeatedly in different flows also if
you find yourself using a set of
components frequently for example
creating a sales order header and
creating sales order line those are used
frequently you can just group them into
a component set and save them to be used
in different flows once you have your
components and component sets defined
all you need to do is assemble them
together to create an automated business
flow data can be uploaded via Excel
we'll talk about that later now let's
start take a look at Oracle flow builder
in pictures first you have the different
keywords lined up in a specific sequence
second you create different components
depending on the sequence four
components that are frequently is
together you create component sets
finally you can assemble the components
and component sets to create the test
flow and generate your test scripts with
Oracle functional test suite you get the
open the open script with a traditional
record and play and you get advanced
scripts for Oracle applications Oracle
flow builder will also be included as
part of the functional test suite Oracle
flow builder is data independent since
we upload data to the flow using Excel
we can use different sets of data with
with the same flow also it's easy
maintenance when when the application
changes you do not have to throw away
your automated test scripts if you have
a new form or page all we have to do is
create new components to support that
form or page and you can use them to
create flows
Oracle flow builder has a great UI you
can create a flow by dragging and
dropping components to create your flow
non-technical people should not find it
difficult to use to reduce your testing
efforts and get you ready to test you
also get a pre-built
ABS test content you get over 2,000
components that are available for you to
attempt to assemble your flows
you also get over 200 flows that are
already created and available for you to
run all you need to do is create your
own flows with the available components
and add your data for customization you
can create your own components and add
them to your library of components to
use and to use them in different flows
they the EBS quality assurance team has
been using flow builder for over a year
and a half now and they were able to
reduce automation time by sixty percent
but the library of 2000 plus components
and over 200 flows that are that you get
with flow builder is across ABS
applications
now let's watch a demo that takes you
through the creation of an automated
sales order test flow here we're logging
into flow builder application you get
into the home page we click on a
component section you can search for
your components by browsing as you can
see on the left side and we're gonna
look for create sales order components
so if you go to the create sales order
on the left side here you browse and you
find the create sales order header
create sales order line and so on you
can also search by entering keywords and
hit the search button and you can get
the same results on either side that's
how you how is it is to find their
components for flows it's the same way
you can either search for the flows via
keywords or you can browse for your
flows now let's go ahead and look at the
order management flows in fact we're
gonna create a flow so let's create a
flow to create sales order we enter the
name of the flow create sales order
there will be a checker built in to make
sure that you don't overwrite other
flows and then you select the flow type
will select certification flow you enter
any tag zoom unit you want and a
description for others to read now you
have the beginning of your or the start
of your flow started now let's get the
components and this is our library of
components here on the left so let's
start by going to the generic components
like prompt URL to get to the
application login to Oh F these two
components will get you and now let's go
and get a component set to create sales
order again we go back to our library we
look for the component sets to create
sales order and it's right there create
cells or their component set if you open
up that component set you would see that
it creates a header and it creates a
line so we can either do it component by
component or group
set to use over and over now if I want
to book that sales order I go back to
the library search into my components
under or the management of course on the
same product and get the book sales
order now I have a sales order that's
created and booked all one I to do is
close up the application to clean up to
have a clean flow now we close all forms
and exit application for data you can
either enter your data by component so
you right click and do enter data and in
it your data for that component login
information you save or the better way
is to right click on a owner flow and
generate download the Excel spreadsheet
and that gives you the template for your
data you can enter data in here and use
different set of data anytime you need
if you want to take a look at the code
that's being generated right click at
the flow name and you can see the actual
code within that flow if you're
interested to look you don't need to do
that but if you're interested you can do
that if you want to see what the flow
does if you can see the test plan you
can just download your test plan and you
can get it in either HTML format or a
Word document
and this is your test plan with the
front page control document control
table of content the outlet test outline
and also you can get the detailed
step-by-step script the demo if you have
any questions please feel free to
contact me masa Navarre at Oracle comm
or you can email Shrikant question at
Oracle comm thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
