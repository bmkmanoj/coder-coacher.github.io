changing a data preparation process that
passes data to one of CBS's match
processes for duplicate identification
purposes so we're not going to look at
changing data interfaces or web services
at all this time we're just looking at
looking at changing a process now the
particular example we're going to work
with concerns an American zip code so
usually if if it's available c.d.s we'll
use as much of the zip code as it can it
will use both the primary part of the
zip code and the secondary part so if
you know American zip code you'll know
that the primary zip code usually has
five characters in it and the secondary
zip code has four and usually CVS will
use both of those but what we want to do
in this example is to adapt the c.d.s
process or one of the CVS processes so
that only the primary zip code only the
first five digits are sent to the match
processor for duplicate identification
purposes so what we want to do is to
make a change to one of the data
preparation purposes processes to alter
some of the data that's going into a
match processor and we're going to take
as our example the real time entity
match service so we use that as our
example you can see that is running in
the server console here on the current
tasks view you can see it's running now
so let's go to the web service tester
and let's just investigate a little bit
about how it works so we haven't made
any changes yet so I've called the
entity match services and I've actually
input data for a couple of records that
we can try matching together so let's
have a look at them here's the first
record and I'll just walk you through
the data I've put in named entity name
that is Oracle Corporation and then
further down address 1 2 3 - Oh evil NCI
drive City Fullerton at Benares CA
California country USA but note the
postal code the ZIP code in other words
so in that field we've got 9 to
three 1-4 904 that is the primary and
the secondary elements of the zip code
the first five characters being the
primary elements and the second and the
last four characters being the secondary
element of the zip code so in record one
we have both the primary and the
secondary zip code now record two I
moved down to that now it's actually got
exactly the same information in it in
every field
that's populated so again named Oracle
Corporation address two three - OH
Valencia Drive Fullerton for the city CA
for the urban area USA for the country
and exactly the same zip in the postal
code field nine eight two three one
that's for a nine two eight three one -
for 904 so in both the records we're
going to try and match together we've
got exactly the same zip code and both
the primary and the secondary elements
of the zip code are there right let's go
to the top and let's hit Send
and we should see the results on the
right here when we hit Send we'll hit
send now and let's see what matching
does well we find a very very strong
match match got 100 now in CTS match
scores are on a scale between 0 and 100
so this is as strong as a match as you
can get in CVS and look at the rule it's
matched on full name exact and address
and if you went to have a look at that
rule in the match processor you'd see
the address needs to be exactly the same
which it is of course including the two
zip codes alright let's make a change to
one of the records in the first record
and the first record only here let's
take out let's remove the secondary
element of the zip code for 904 that's
gone now we've just got the first five
characters the primary zip code nine two
eight three one in the second record
we'll leave that exactly as it is so the
secondary record will retain both the
primary and secondary elements of the
zip code so we now have just the primary
ZIP code in the first record and the
primary and secondary elements of the
ZIP code in the second record okay let's
go back to the top let's hit Send
and let's see what change that makes to
the match results so you can see now
he's still matched but we've got a
slightly weaker match match score 93 so
the the strength of the match has gone
down a little bit and the match rule
we're matching against is also different
as we'd expect this time it's full name
exact premise no sub premise postal code
starts with because not all of the
postal code is the same the start is the
same the first five characters are but
one of the records has a secondary zip
code as well as the primary zip code the
other one doesn't
so the matches is different because of
taking out that secondary zip code in
one of the records now you could make an
argument that in fact you don't want
much to work that way if a record has
the secondary zip code missing but the
primary zip code and the other details
aren't the same it should still be the
strongest match we can get you could
make that argument and so what we're
going to do on that basis is we're going
to look at how we could change the data
going in to match so that the secondary
element of the zip code if it's present
is discarded as far as matching is
concerned and matching only takes the
primary element of the zip code into
account so let's look how we can do this
so what we want to do is to change the
way that postal codes or zip codes if
you like are prepared before they're
sent so the real-time entity match
prices up now how should we go about
doing that well let's start by looking
at the real-time entity match job I
often find that jobs are the best
starting points when we want to
investigate how c.d.s works so let's
find that here we are in the in the jobs
node in the project browser within
director and there's the real time
entity match job let's just double click
it to open it on the canvas there we go
and here we can see all of the processes
within the job now now the proper
process is denoted by
three yellow balls joined together so if
I just move down you can see quite near
the bottom of the job
there's the match entity process where
the matching actually happens but if I
go further up you can see further up you
know quite near the beginning of the
process that process chain is
standardized address so that's where the
addresses are prepared for real time
entity matching in this process so let's
open that process to have a look at it
we'll right-click and we'll choose open
and that process will open on the canvas
and you can see the second processor in
that standardized address process is
called standardized postal code so this
is where the postal codes are
standardized and if we right-click that
we can open it because it's a composite
processor and we can see all the
processes that make it up and here there
are here they are so we can add some
more logic here we could customize this
composite processor in order to strip
out the secondary element of the postal
code of the zip code if you were there
we could do that that would be an option
or we could add another processor in to
the standardized address process perhaps
directly after the standardized postal
code processor again to strip out the
secondary members of the zip code that
might be a bit more visible and easier
to spot in terms of anyone else looking
at what we've done but actually we
should be rather cautious before we
start making changes to this process and
the reason is that we should just give
some thought to where else in c.d.s may
this process be used because it might
not just be used in the real time entity
match job so how would we find out well
let's find the process it's called
standardized address let's find it in
the process note here and in the project
browser and there it is standardized
address and to find out where else in
CGS it's used we can create a dependency
filter so let's right click onto the
standardized address process and we've
got a dependency filter option and the
option we want
items using selected items so what other
bits of CD s use this standardized adesh
Address process that's what we're
looking at here let's let's click there
and you can see the the dependency
filter is now on and
further you can see that all of these
jobs and there's quite a lot of them
pass that dependency filter so in other
words all of these jobs that we can see
here use that standardized Address
process not just real-time entity
matching but all of these let's just
have a look at one example let's go to
this batch address cluster job at the
top here and we'll open it on the canvas
and it's got quite a few phases and if
we just go to the bottom phase called
address cluster here you can see the
standardized addressed processes used in
that job so it will actually be used in
all of these jobs now therefore if we
make a change to that process it will
affect the way that all of these jobs
work now does that matter well in order
to answer that answer that question
you'd have to do a lot of investigation
maybe you want to change the way that
your postal codes are prepared
throughout the whole of CES but you know
that could have unforeseen consequences
perhaps so maybe a safer option would be
instead of just changing this
standardized address process
why don't we instead take a copy of it
and then change the copy we can call it
something different call it standardized
address customized or something like
that and then just within that batch
entity match job let's replace the
generic standardized address process
with our customized copy and then we can
be fairly sure that that will only
affect that one job and not any of the
others
so we'll go forward in that manner so
let's begin there is the standardized
address process there let's just right
click let's copy it we can take off a
dependency filter now just click on
print on the process node and then paste
in the copy and it will say you can't
have two the same name or that's fine
we'll call this tailored oops I can
spell it
tailored standardized address okay so
what we've now got we just look in the
project browser near the bottom of the
process I guess there that's our copy of
the standardized address process with a
different name and we can now make a
change to that and then insert that into
the batch sorry the real-time entity
match job so next we'll look at what
sort of change we need to make so how do
we go about changing this tailored
version of the standardized address
process well first of all we should do
some investigation and you can probably
guess that the the area as we mentioned
where this that the postal codes get
standardized is is in this composite
processor called standardized postal
codes so really we should open that and
we should try and get a sense for what
it's doing and have a good look through
its logic I won't do that just now
just for sake of brevity okay what I'm
actually gonna do is just run some data
through this process to see what it does
and we'll look particularly at the
postal code now if I run the process as
it is it'll air out why
well the reader is reading from a data
interface called combined data
preparation the writer is writing to the
same data interface and that age for
interfaces remember adjust attribute
templates they need to be mapped to real
sources or targets of data and if I have
a look at the run preferences of this
process and set that to read that there
is no mapping and the same for the
writer no mapping is selected so what
we're gonna do is just create a little
web service with one input and one
output to look at the postal code only
and then a mapping for that web service
to this data interface and then we'll
run it again so let's just go down to
the web services node here and we'll
create a new web service and as I said
we'll just put in a single attribute for
input which we'll call postal code there
we go
and a single attribute for output to I
would call that one standardized
postal code here we are and we'll call
this web server just test us so it's
only going to look at the postal code
we're not interested in the rest of the
address now let's go up to the data
interfaces node and find our combined
data preparation data interface that our
process uses let's right-click it and
let's choose mappings and we'll just
create a new mapping against real time
for our little tester web service so
this one's for inputs to tester in and
we'll map the Moke the postal code from
our tester web service to the postal
code attribute in our data interface
there we go and we call this tester in
so that's our input mapping I'm a need
one for output as well so you can see
the results so again choose real time
let's again choose tester this time data
out and this time we want to map not the
postal code not this field but if we go
further down you'll notice there is a
field called postal code standardized
and that holds the output of this
process we want to map that and they
call this mapping tester out so we've
got two new mappings for the data
interface let's go into the run
preferences of the process now and hit
the reader and let's choose our tester
in mapping hit the writer and let's
select our tester out mapping so that's
mat we can now run the process that
should run happily having done that we
can go to the launchpad and let's fire
up the webservice
tester and what we want to see let's
just select the c.d.s project first of
all and our little tester web service
and we'll get the service now what we
want to get an idea for is what happens
to postal codes as they go through this
standardized process before we make any
changes so what we'll do is we'll put in
a sort of a test 1 2 3 4 5 5 digits like
the first five digits the
the primary element of a zip code - nine
eight seven six four digits the last
four digits of the zip code the
secondary element of the zip code so we
just send that and it may take a little
while to come back with a result because
I'm working in a rather underpowered
virtual machine and you can see whilst
this symbol here is going around it's
still thinking but let's see it's come
back with the result now and what I want
you to notice is that what this has done
is stripped out the - so the process and
we're going to assume it's that
standardized postal code processor take
my word for any of these you could you
could test that if you want to be let's
just say it is the process already
strips out the - so we don't have to
worry about this - whatever we do
doesn't have to take that into account
we just want to take off the last four
digits here and end up with the first
five digits which is the primary element
of the zip code
okay so let's bear that in mind now
let's go back to direct him and let's
just stop this web service we just
stopped it as quickly as possible
because we don't look at the results and
what we're going to do then is we're
gonna add another processor directly
after the standardized postal code
processor here and if we do that there
it'll just be very visual anyone that
comes along to look at it will get a
good sense very quickly what we've done
I think we'll keep it simple now let's
just make some room so we'll shift all
of these processes up a little bit over
here look there we go don't worry too
much about being ultra tidy just now we
could tidy this up later shift them all
across like that okay now we got some
room and we'll delete this link and
we're going to put our processor in
between these two now
what process that could be used to take
out the last four digits of that a zip
code well there's a few possibilities
one more be trim characters here another
one would be regex replace but the one
that we're going to use
just to keep things really easy is going
to be called pattern transform so let's
bring that onto the canvas and this will
just transform the postal code based
upon patterns okay let's hook it up now
actually before I do we look at the
standardized postal code processor and
note it takes in the postal code it adds
a new field called postal code dot
standardized so that's the field that
we'll want to bring in that should be
the input for our path and transform
processor so let's find that pallid
field there it is at the bottom there
it's the one we want to transform let's
go to options now this pattern transform
processor expects some reference data
and actually I've already created it so
I've cheated a little bit and it's
called secondary zip strip here it is
so let's hook that up and we'll just
take a quick look at that reference data
actually let's go to the reference data
note yeah and let's just find it it's
just a little bit further down I think
they're in its secondary zip strip so
there's a pattern and there's a Maps
pattern this is the lookup column this
is the return column it's looking for
nine numbers the way that we represent
numbers in a pattern is with ends so
there are nine ends there if you K if
you count them up it's looking for a
pattern with nine numbers primary zip
code five numbers secondary zip code
four numbers the dash gets taken out so
it's looking for those nine numbers if
it finds them it's going to return just
the first five numbers so in their mat
pattern we've got five ends okay so it
should strip out the last four numbers
it finds anything other than nine
numbers it won't do anything okay so if
for example there was a UK postcode
which would not consist of nine numbers
it would be start with two letters for
example then it would just ignore it so
she can't exactly expect an
american-style zip but without the dash
let's take the output from that pattern
transform processor let's pass it on to
the next
in the train in the chain so we're just
inserting it really okay
last thing we want to do is that let's
just take a look at the writer here data
preparation interface and that's writing
out to the data interface which we know
is now mapped to our little test a web
service and what that web service is
getting if you remember is the postal
code standardized field here so what's
actually being written to that postal
close standardized field let's find out
and there we go what's being written is
postal code dot standardized now that
was the output from the postal code
standardized composite processor
remember and if I just go down have a
quick look in the available attributes
on the left and we look at the added
once there is postal code dot
standardized and it has two versions
postal code dot standards which is the
one that's being output and postal code
dot standardized dot pattern transform
which is the version of that attribute
after we've done our pattern
transformation now obviously we we want
to output the version after we've
transferred the pattern and we've
stripped out the last four digits so
actually what we're going to do is get
rid of that postal go dot standardized
attribute for writing let's do that so
now the postal code standardized field
in the data interface is not mapped to
let's put in postal code dot
standardized dot pattern transform there
we are and let's map it up to our postal
code standardized field in the data
interface so that's now nicely met okay
we'll just save that and having made
those changes we'll run it again there
we go so it's now running let's go back
to our web service tester in fact I
think we'll just come out of the web
service tester and back into it
because it may confuse it because I'm
not sure actually I've made that change
the data interface but anyway let's not
worry about that too much
oops gone to the wrong place let's try
again web service test up there we go
better right let's call our edq CVS
project again and let's select our
little tester web service and we'll get
it again there we go
and let's see what happens now so I'm
gonna try a similar test one two three
four five so five numeric characters
like the start the primary element is it
code - nine eight seven six last four
characters numeric like the secondary
element the zip code let's hit Send
again first time we do this it may take
a while to to actually come back with
the result but it's done it now and you
can see it strips out the last four
characters so it's done what we we hoped
it would do so if it finds an
american-style zip code with primary and
secondary elements it just returns the
primary element okay now just to make
the point if I put in a british postal
code like that obviously a different
format we haven't got the pattern that
we've set in our reference data as the
lookup and you can see it does nothing
to it okay
just leaves it alone so it's only if it
finds an american-style zip code that
it's going to actually strip it out i'm
not saying this is the only way to do
this or even necessarily the best way
that may well be more foolproof ways but
i'm just trying to show you how we would
go about adapting a CVS service and you
can figure out the best way to do it
yourself okay alright so having done
that let's stop that process running now
let's just remind ourselves of what
we've done what we've actually done so
far is taking a copy of the standardized
address process and call it tailored
standards address and changed it and put
in another processor what we do next is
we go into the job the
entity real-time entity match job and we
swap out the old copy of the process for
our new tailored copy and then we'll
test that as well
so we'll do that bit next okay so let's
look at how we're going to change the
job now real time entity match in fact
what I'm suggest is we don't chase this
job at all we in fact take a copy of it
and we create a paste it into the jobs
and we create a copy which we'll call
tailored real-time entity match my
thinking here really is that if we come
to let's say upgrade or something like
that it might be a lot easier if we can
easily see what changes we've made so
rather than just having a change within
a job with the same name that's actually
create a job with a different name so
there's our tale of real some entity
match job and within that tailored
version of the job let's now delete the
standard standardized end address
process from it and let's replace it
over here in the tool pallet look we can
see the the list of process let's
replace it with our tailored
standardized address process there we go
we'll just pull that over a bit and
we'll cook it up so there we are we're
just simply inserting that in the same
place as the the non tailored version of
the of the process was but within our
tailored version of the job so let's
close that now to run that job we run it
from another process actually called
real time start off and that does some
preparation of various things that
matching these before it then in this
last phase we have a quick look at that
starts the various real time matching
services including real time entity
match here so again what I'm going to do
is rather than than just change that I
could just change it but I shall I'll do
the same again I'm gonna copy it and I'm
going to paste it in and
change its name so we're gonna have our
own version of it and we call it
tailored tailored realtime startled okay
so let's open up our tailored real-time
startle job there we go let's go to the
last phase and we hit configure so these
are just triggers that start various
jobs and we want to take out this real
time entity match trigger here which is
after real time entity cluster and we
want to put in a trigger to start the
real time the tailored version of that
real time entity match job there we go
and we should we'll make sure it's in
the right place so it needs to to move
up so that it's after sorry let's find
that real time entity cluster so that's
it it's in the right place all right so
there's our real time entity match
tailored version of the job they're
started by that trigger within this
tailored version of real time start all
let's save that and we'll close it down
and what we'll do now is go into the
server console let's find that tailored
real time startle and let's run it okay
so that will start to run now I'll take
a little while to do the preparation
steps before it actually runs real time
entity match so I'll come back to you in
a minute when it's all running and then
we'll test it using the web service
tester okay so real time start all has
started all of the real-time service is
now including real time entity match
there we go just there so we can go off
to the web service tester and we can see
if our changes have worked so let's go
to the web service tester and remember
what we were trying to achieve we're
trying to make sure the
whether or not the secondary zip code
was present didn't matter as long as the
primary zip code is there the first five
digits
what what's in the secondary part
whether it whether there's nothing there
or something there or whether there's
differences between the two records it
shouldn't make any difference to the to
the resolve matching so what I've done
is I've entered exactly the same data
into the entity match service here in
the web service tester as we did for our
initial test at the beginning so in
record one here at the top I've got
Oracle Corporation as the entity name
and address one two three - Oh evil ends
here drive and city Fullerton admin area
CA California country USA and in record
one we've got the primary and the
secondary zip code look nine two eight
three one - four 904 in record - exactly
the same details candidate ID is
obviously different but otherwise Oracle
Corporation is the name - three - Oh II
volunteer drive as the address one
Fullerton CA USA the only difference
apart from the candidate number is the
postal code the zip code which only has
the primary ZIP code in it nine two
eight three one now when we tested this
right at the beginning we found that the
the match score was 93 wasn't it and it
was a meet weaker max score than if we
had the primary and secondary parts of
the zip code also matching let's send it
now and it's white for the writ to come
back it's come back already
and if you look now match score 100 and
we're matching on full name exact and
address and the address is exactly the
same it thinks okay so what we've
managed to do then by making that change
is effectively to get the entity match
service to ignore the real-time version
of it anyway to ignore the secondary
part of the zip code whether or not I
have the secondary part of the zip code
in my records doesn't matter
as
the primary part of the zip code is the
same the secondary zip code it doesn't
make any difference if I just put the
the secondary part in the second record
as well just to show you it won't make
any difference I'll put that in for nine
zero four so you know the records are
now exactly the same apart from the
candidate number which always must be
different anyway yeah that's just an
internal thing and you can see we've got
the same result so it's now ignoring the
secondary elements of the zip code
