system that it's a pretty okay
interesting argument and I explain you
how Java allow us to make a new
development new features on such kind of
products this product has been designed
in collaboration bin window bar window
bar is one of the I think into you know
one of the most popular brands for the
dispensing guns they are very popular
for dispensing food for liquor and food
dispensing and they are based in
California and it's very interesting to
go through what does the potential
market or the of such kind of products
food and service and hospitality
industries of huge industry some numbers
are 23 billion dollars of revenues for
seventy thousand points or business so
it can include hotels resorts
restaurants nightclubs whatever we have
some numbers so we have what we call
bars so is the twenty-four percent
taverns cocktail and lounges nightclubs
disco etc how many point of business
okay there are in the United States this
is the only in the United States and the
revenues so it's a huge market and this
market has to deal with some problems
when they dispensing alcohol
so what is our liquid dispensing system
a liquid dispensing system is a provide
a solution to increase the return of
investment recording and controlling
liquor sport eliminating over-pouring
making dispensing fast and easy for
bartenders and giving two managers the
control of the process so what's going
on so why it's now it's time to innovate
in this field in the most of that liquid
dispensing system that are right now
nowadays in the market are built on a
very conservative and old-fashioned
technologies and artifacts most of them
are based on wire guns they can manage
only a limited number of brands so
bottled in the bar they are the very
basic and limited business logic into
their embedded system the hover most of
the time is tailored is dedicated
hardware so there's no standards so you
are slave and start with one vendor and
if you want to move to another you have
to change everything as well the
software technology they implement are
very old think about an ms-dos
applications already present today in
some products they cost around probably
$5,000 $10,000 it depends on how you use
the place but this is the kind of
technology that the owner or the manager
has to deal with and most there is no
standard if you want to make some kind
of integration there is no way to do
that so if the vendor your vendor
produced this kind of additional
hardware you can
match and expand the system if not you
have to change completely the problem
some examples all right just to be so
give you a some visual feedback we have
some real devices so there is a
dispensing unit for example here and
then you have some kind of control and I
expected in the background to have a
room like that where oh yes we're all
the battle are and you know from and the
every liquor okay dispense over you know
streamlines I know what the right word
to use to the final dispenser that is in
front of the bartender so we have a such
we have a hidden area where all the
bottles are stored this is a more
classic more classical design so we have
this is the liquid dispensing so is the
hardware the ham bad at Al Gore and we
have a gun so we we have the same
architectures as here so we have
somewhere we we have the beverage and we
dispensed from one gap this is another
example this is a wire system you can't
so is a wired spout you put a spell on a
bottle and you control very simply okay
the process to three modern interface
and this is another example okay
probably is a little bit dark but it's
very simple to this one okay it's very
popular here so you have only one
dispensing unit without software okay
and dedicated LCD to interact with the
operations so what is cloud flow cloud
flow is an innovative of Wi-Fi base
liquid dispensing system for the next
generation of the smart bars so we could
we talk about smart cities Smart is
everything is marked was a bar cannot be
smart
this is the way so a cloud flow so it's
a the cloud flow on you know the goal is
to be a standard offer to customers a
standard way to deal with such kind of
requirements so we implement a free
scale I'm x28 arm SOC so we design a
board around this SOC we use wireless
spouts and beer flow meters so we are
able to manage bottles and you know beer
coming from you know the big can then
you have probably stored somewhere we
use java SE 7 embedded with a headless
version so we don't have we don't need
any LCD okay the system is a headless
system we have an internally be right
now we are using video we're going to be
from oracle so is a full oracle okay
system we can manage cereal cereal POS
communication featuring nine different
legacy protocols for front of the house
operation okay today each liquid
dispensing system in the market as
limited POS protocols available so how
many vendors are present for POS system
probably 20 25 30 and they implement a
different protocol each as a different
protocol but have nine protocols that
most of all they implement so with these
those nine protocols recover I think
that a TI ninety percent of the POS on
market we implement a web-based
management interface based on a
lightweight java application server so
we manage the business logic and the
presentation in a very you know well
known way everyone deal with routers or
stuff like that
this is the same is the same way how to
manage user interface we can manage
standard rest and stateful application
interfaces that enables for example and
we see later in a slide to enable
advanced it back of the house operations
or cloud integration with 30 buddy
services why not we can gather this kind
of data and do some kind of business
intelligence for example the value of
dull of the beverage for activities I
think it's a very huge business if you
can if you can manage or if you can say
in which period of the ear people
consumes different kinds of alcohol is a
high you know value information and
finally we provide a Java reporting
software so basic some very very simple
templates to help the user to have a
very quick reporting activities
so this is the unit what we call the
cloud flow unit so if it looks like a
router all right but ah the system you
use the RF communications so it's a on
the RF band for Europe and United States
so it's very simple if you think about
the old system that I show you and can
be placed wherever is a nice looking and
you know is based on a very modern way
to design embedded hard work
so how God flow have the business okay
how we make money with blood flow we
provide real-time sales we ensure
product consistency with quick and
precise dispensing and this is a very
critical a very critical action okay a
critical feature it's very important for
owners and managers every drink poor is
accounted and is accounted controlling
the costs because so I'm I know exactly
what I'm consuming from my inventory
liquorland your inventory can't r CQ so
i think the situation is under control
basically so i can cut the liquor for
changes because I then waste this is the
point I don't waste and everything is
perfectly controlled by the system and
more I can expand the my point of
business okay wireless because I as we
see the system is so simple that i can
expand adding simply adding devices on
the field
how cloud flow make the manager just
saving money for example a one-fourth on
our homes of over poor on a shot
increase the cost by twenty-five percent
this is a standard data is a pain for
every manager we can compare what has
been sold with what as being poor right
now is rational so we can count up is we
can integrate cloud flow with 30 party
POS as I told you before ah it is very
important that is a bad news for the
bartender with eliminates giveaways and
teeth you know how many bartenders to
your lab to having higher tips say okay
take a drink more or i can give you a
little bit more and it's very easy to
maintenance okay why java my company
comes from 15 years of java development
so we are very happy to use the same
technology we use for web application or
thick application now into the embedded
so we can reuse many themes of our code
and so we can prototype in very fast we
can reuse the code we previously used
now java SE 7 is absolutely production
ready so it's a standard i can integrate
different kind of frameworks and
platform i can use many DVD technology I
have a huge numbers of library and
products to make reports to manage
restful or rest communications stateful
communication is a secure because okay I
use that circulates and
for making the business logic and we
decide to use GWT to manage a
good-looking web interface so it's a
like a small dream to have all this
stuff right now on an embedded device
okay I give you some definition right
now just to be more clear in the next
slides so field devices are what what we
call Phil devices are wireless pouts and
wireless beer flow monitors what we
could see a few is the cloud flow unit
is the box that you saw before then we
have a pc that can be used as a that
data aggregator from one or more cfu
because if i add a huge place probably i
need to cover many different area using
more than one CF view ok the bi a bar a
bar is a logical collection of field
devices so I I have a one point of
business that is the physical place
where drinks are sold and I can ok a
group and numbers of wireless pals will
be flow and create what I call a bar so
I can have many bars inside that point
of business ok what is the point of sale
a point of sale is uh you know what we
call the POS so it's the terminal of the
operations where the I have my received
from the bartender
we have the cash register so the point
of sale is a you know something that is
very most like a computer system right
now so I want to separate what is a
point of sale okay because it's a little
bit confusing and what is an electronic
cash register this is something a little
bit more all style okay more 80 and
finally I want to define what is the NLU
the end of you it's a number it's an
identification code for every beverage
of any every brand I mean every brain or
better each side of a liquor of a brain
okay that is a number that I my cloud
flow unit communicates transfer to the
cash register to say this item cost two
dollars so is an identification number
so how it works we have wireless sports
and wireless beer monitor so I can
simply put this pout on a bottle and I
put this pier monitor where the beer
flow comes ok so it counts how many
pools of a flowing fluid ok is passing
through this device
then totally wireless I communicate what
is this what is going on so what how
many okay did these kind of spouts are
managed four sizes so before dispensing
I can select one of four sizes and make
it simply the action like that obviously
I can have for each brand for sizes so I
I can help a small vodka medium vodka
bigger vodka very big water is
everything can be configured so you can
decide what is the size of the liquor
the volume of the fluid you want to
dispense for each size then we
communicate with the cloud flow unit and
wait to em then we can do many things so
we can export for example it's a very
simple action but you know bartenders or
managers in this case this kind of
business they are pretty conservative so
they want or can I have a USB and export
in some kind of format all my dispensing
data yes okay you can export in a simple
CSV format is a text format and if you
want to import it into Excel or whatever
that's okay then I can't communicate the
NLU number to a cash register or a
point-of-sale system we manage nine
different protocols so we can cover here
a lot of different vendors micros info
genesis Aloha casio samsung
and this is typically a serial
communication we can export for example
in the reporting tool that we provide we
can export the data to make a scheduled
report every two hours maybe whatever I
can come it is up to the user in the
same time because of the you know here
we have 32 gig of SD as the MSD car
storage capability so I have a circular
buffering way to store the data so when
the space is ok i have no more spaces on
the on the card I need to finalize
somewhere else everything I collected if
not ok i will start to delete the oldest
one so is up to the manager try to
figure out sometimes to make some kind
of transfer data transfer from the unit
to a pc for example and have and gather
a story and collect a story if you know
to your story on your story is out to
the user and then with the same
technology because here i can make for
example restful services I can provide
those kind of you know data even to a 30
party cloud platform to bring those kind
of information it makes some kind of
work
so wireless and some kind of logic over
there in you know with different kind of
use cases I told you before that I want
to expand my I expand my point of
business okay I need only to increment
the number of files or the number of
beer for and to configure the system in
a way to manage new devices but it's
very I can assure you is very simple so
what are the goals or cloud flow track
the quantity of poured liquors track the
quantity of the poor dears manage
Branson price so I inside the the DB
right in the pan embedded DB I have all
the price all the sizes all the brands I
have everything I need to finalize the
data are finalized into the DB is a
serious it's okay it's a it's a Berkeley
DB so it's not such kind of you know de
just for a temporary data storage know
the only things that you have to remind
to remember is to okay you have 32 gig
we can manage price list happy hours we
can manage up to 15 different price
lists so I can decide from 1pm to 3pm to
make up a certain price list and then
change from okay I want to make an IP
hour for two hours or three hours I
change and other priceless so I can
schedule up to 15 different
translationally okay I am there are
communication standard communication
with POS system I can export data or in
a very simple format on am at USB pen
USB Drive or in honor
application or in the web okay just 24
definition front of the Owls operation
for a bar is something that happens in
front of the customer so I mean I pour a
drink cloud flow send the NLU number to
the POS I pre to the read receipt and I
give to the castle and get the cash this
is the front of the house operations
back of the house is something is a new
concept in the bars and in the you know
in the food industry during the 90s a
bars wants to control even Tori reports
accounting you know completely
integrated with a waitress and waiter
that has portable devices so back of the
house is like something that is in the
back and that control of the life cycle
of a point of business so we can manage
inventory records accounting so it's
more like you know a b2b application the
point is that now modern system like
micros info genesis they said they sell
as the name it as POS something that is
very complex they are really computer
system so you have a Windows Server
terminals internet connections and you
have a softer very you know okay
expensive but it's a full feature
software you can control everything even
the cloud micros if you buy the higher
um you know the there is a kind of
licenses so if you buy the most
expensive product they have they provide
you the cloud platform if you have many
point of business like I'm McDonald's I
have thousands thousands and I using the
same POS and I want my managers for
example the country managers or the
state managers to look at different
point of business and see how the how
things are going
they provide you the cloud platform
integrated with a POS they sell you so
everything is moving ok but every one of
these vendors are completely you know if
you buy micros you would be a micro sky
for the rest of your life this is the
concept so back of the house integrator
is something that is very important for
us to manage so a simple scenarios like
that spouse beer flow wireless
communication serial communication to
the cash register for front of the house
operation I store all my dispensing data
in the unit and then i can make reports
every day from a local pc using up basic
java application they thing is not the
application itself because the point is
that the service is that the cloud flow
units provide our standard services web
services okay or yes socket connection
if we are we need to be stable more
complex scenario for example for a
casino in a fourth floor different for
could be a many see a few many
point-of-sale many spouts and many beer
flow we have a switch we can have a back
of the house a POS and for example the
idea was to we don't need to provide I
mean be integrated with such kind of
system could be very difficult so what
our idea is to provide to the big binder
simple API based on web services for
example I want my cross to take
dispensing data and put inside their
system many of those system make reports
make everything
so I have not I don't need to reinvent
the wheel anonymous's I have only to be
integrated we need to communicate to
share not to make the same things again
so my point is that if those system back
of the health system are so complex so
expensive so everything you do the job I
provide you what t is my value
proposition dispensing data and
obviously if you have some business
intelligence or product and you want to
make some kind of data mining with with
the same services rest services that I
using a local network I can send the
same information to a remote a remote
service okay basic basically there are
four different actors the barman the
bartender the service operator who
install the system the bar manager and
eventually an enterprise manager so it's
nothing everything is very simple so we
have basically in the in the same slide
here I introduce the actor so the
bartenders is simply pouring he be
simple poor liquors or or beers in the
front of the house operation that the
bar manager is managing the reports
every day or eventually the Bekaa of the
operation and the enterprise manager
take care about what's going on in a big
area
okay so um this is a basic idea of of a
mic isn't my idea of of a product as
like a product as to be so I have the
hardware I have the femur an operating
system a framework and finally an
application and services so in the end
the present in the keynote before the
freescale guy say okay we have hardware
software and services and this is
exactly the model we want to follow when
we think about the product so we have
harder the imax 28 single board computer
we have a linux kernel we have a linux
operating system we have java SE 7 GWT a
server container a berkeley DB we use
the native communication from C++ and
Java for manage the all the messages
coming from the spouse is a message
queue technology very simple and finally
I have the application so my web
application on the device that manage
all the business logic and all the user
actions for configure and to manage the
data on that cloud flow system and
finally I can have the rest services to
make you remember this light to make
something in this area it's not
mandatory you want to use the product
locally do that you want to use some
cloud 30 party product do that okay just
a quick look of a board the board is a
general this is the new design that SI
14 that is the our partner for the
hardware they design based on the IMX 28
so they produce on imax 28 single board
computer and disease this was the chance
to redesign and have a second generation
i am x 28 a single board computer but
you know with many other features
so for example we have a ZB expansion
module we don't use on Clyde flow but
it's ready or sorry we have on spi our
sport we have a eat to see out sports
okay we have the obviously the where is
that okay here the eight six eight and
nine for the for Europe and 9 15 minutes
radio communication for United States so
it's the for the wireless we use for the
wireless pouts but in many home gateway
we use these kind of signals for alarms
microsd to ethernet ports one rs-232 19
ports so everything is a standard unit
you know this is a single board computer
for a general purpose we use for cloud
flow but is basically i'm very cheap
embedded based on MX 28 these are the
features so 128 megawatt around 12 8
mega of nand memory where we have the
operating system USB client and host to
ethernet to a you know low transceivers
for 8 6 8 and 9 15 minutes low-power
wireless applications serial port
okay we have some three general purpose
tactics which e to see zigbee power
supply a buzzer anna anna liam lion
battery yeah because if something goes
on something goes bad with the with the
power of the bar we can shut down the
system and finalize the data safety okay
quit so we have the chance to a plug-in
optional modules like Wi-Fi Bluetooth or
out you called it and amplifying so it's
a pluggable board it's a very nice board
this is the world we have some delays on
the ship on the shipment so probably I
will receive today and tomorrow in the
Oracle booth we you have the chance to
see the body fuel so this is the board
this is the product okay the two antenna
and the box this is only to show you
that the application is you know a
standard java application inside 12 for
this is inside cloud for inside the box
what is running inside the embedded
device we have a web application so
servlet container and presentation layer
using GWT we have an operator okay we
have the DB as a berkeley DB an
operating system that is linux we have
this layer that is a the java native
interface layer to make the connection
between the low-level inter-process
communication to manage the spouts you
know a data coming from wireless and so
manage these kind of message queue and
ex you know a
have a message handler that can take all
those information and write on a DB for
example so we have web technology native
technology java standard technology ok
here we manage some operating system
configuration like the network gateways
and stuff like that an NTP server
because if we have one of more cloud
flow unit we need to be synchronized the
same time same hour so same time zones
and everything so we have some OS
configuration that has to be managed as
you know standard unit configuration so
finally this is a possible very quick
and very safe from a developer
standpoint with Java embedded you can
use cutie you can use different kind of
frameworks but basically we needed to
rewrite the code in a different stand in
the different languages okay here we can
use most of our library and our
expertise to speed up a prototype in
four months four months so why Java is a
turnkey for technology for cloud flow so
developers are focused on the
application layer only so when the
hardware company provides me the piece
of iron I'm on track I'm perfect I can
start work I have a high level of using
Java I have a high level of abstraction
and so I can produce a quality a design
a very good design and a very high
quality on the
code if I design good I code good as
well security fast prototyping
modularity new features can be easily
integrated if I want to change something
or add a new feature Java give me a
chance to do that very quick I have a
consolidated development tools so i can
use my NetBeans or eclipse to for making
embedded stuff I I run J unit I have
many different kind of tools for testing
and validating many proprietary solution
was were present on in the past but
right now we could use the same open
source or whatever things we use for you
know web or desktop application and
obviously a multi-platform development
for example if you need a client to make
reports can run on linux windows I don't
care about the operating system of the
host PC why don't we improve the cloud
flow business so scalability I can uh
you know improve the value of the Get
Rid that with many je je e based product
already cloud-ready they are ready I
mean I do not to make other work so
integration 30 parties can easy
integrate their product user platform a
multi-platform technology think about
micros if I say a up if cloud floats
start to be a successful product and
Mike restaura Genesis wants to use my
data for de POS back of the house system
I simply say okay I have a couple of web
services call it and you will have my
product list my price lists my schedules
my costs and you can do whatever so you
can expand your side but what they act
right now actually they don't manage
such kind of data okay everything is on
the you know the the orders or the
action performed by the bartenders or
waitress but nothing regarding what is
poured on the bar then we have
unification so embedded desktop
enterprise with the same core technology
this is a incredible things and
standardization so one platform for
different domains this is a key point in
my opinion this is one of the keyboard
so if you have any question I hope to I
gave you an idea of what the product
what kind of product we developed I
think that distributors are excited i er
excited about them they're waiting for a
product like that because it's very easy
to sell it's very easy to install is
basically an offer basic functionalities
or for he for a person that offer our
manager that is more close to complex
system it can deal with with them as
well so the use cases I have to be
honest during the development we're not
so easy to identify because people from
wunderbar they are very you know
conservative as well because they sell
you know the dispensing for a beverage
or you know the things like ketchup or
mayonnaise so they have to be very tough
system very you know solid reliable
but now the market is changing the
requirements are changing so they are
very proactive to look at what is what
can be done to be updated and try to be
innovators on a field that believe me
it's very difficult to you know to
manage innovation in a place like you
know growing in a bar in Texas in the
middle of the desert and try to sell a
cloud for easy a I don't need a cloud
phone but probably if you say okay but
do you know how much money do you waste
when son you have you know some moment
in your way you have a lot of customers
and you something that I think the older
he doesn't think that he's lost he's
losing money many times you don't know
but now the perception is different you
have numbers and say oh wow I waste 10
gallons of vodka for what what are they
now probably as possible to some kind of
thing
shower
yes yes we tried three different
technologies we tried hypersonic ask you
a light and berkeley DB berkeley DB for
you know from a developer standpoint is
a api-based DB so it's very easy to uh
to develop with but in the same time i
saw the last benchmark test we have a
footprint very low memory we have a very
few memory footprint so we need to be
fast but a little bit angel so berkeley
DB if you don't have a persistent engine
in the middle that give you a an
object-oriented way to deal with the
database berkeley DB as the interface
absolutely as an interface absolutely
amazing to manage an object-oriented DB
without persistent engine in the middle
so database application persistent
engine we have no memory for managed
like things like hibernate it's too much
so we need a database with strong api
very simple and strong api and very fast
so this is why we use berkeley DB and
the license is you can deal with oracle
never a good price for the license
differentiation super space today he
up it's a good question this um well the
perception of the final customer about
Java or not java it's not it is
transparent they didn't the Java is
effective on the final price so if you
spend less resources to develop the
product and maintain the product the
price is lower and the price in this
kind of market has to be competitive if
you have a killer price you have a
killer application you know what so we
have new features yes these features are
possible with Java yes but many in I
think that in the in the 2013 when the
product will be lunch will be lunch I
think that may the use case the basic
use cases is ok I want my database in
the as in my USB pen so the funnest
customer will not taken advantage of all
that new features ok ecosystem that
cloud flow is providing but the price is
probably one third of the competitors
so this is but now now the Java is at a
point for the final price and even
freescale we have a fool you know single
board computing platform for an
incredible price so this is the i think
that probably in when we have the second
version or we develop other staff
probably in one year the market who that
could be more you know open to new kind
of innovation and so start to use okay i
have iperion or i have paint ow I want
to make some kind of reach strange
reports but I think that only the market
we decided
why this
laws
yes no we know yeah we know we know and
so we control if you if you finish the
