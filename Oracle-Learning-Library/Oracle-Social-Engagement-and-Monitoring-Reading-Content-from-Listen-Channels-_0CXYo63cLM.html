social engagement and monitoring if
you've already watched Cindy's video
navigating social messages with the
Oracle social engagement tool then
you've seen how to use engaged to
navigate channels customized topic
channels from listened and seen how all
these channels integrate additional
social properties into a gauge this
video will show you how to read and take
action on these channel messages
here we are and engage to begin click on
one of your listen and analyze channels
under the filter column remember that in
addition to Facebook and Twitter
messages these channels also include
sources from Google+ YouTube RSS feeds
new sites consumer reports and message
boards by clicking here and expanding
the channel type drop-down menu you're
able to filter messages by source like
Google+ for example you can disable
filtering by clicking the all channel
types option or by clicking here and
collapsing the channel types drop-down
you can click any message to open it by
clicking the gear icon you have the
option to assign archive or send the
message to your right now or Siebel
account for further action however you
cannot hide delete or reply to these
posts because you don't own the social
properties found in a listen channel
instead you can click the view post
option and be taken to the native page
of the post and depending on the privacy
settings of the post you may be able to
take action from here twitter is the
exception along with certain facebook
messages with the correct privacy
settings if you open a twitter post from
within a listen channel you can reply to
it directly from engage
as well as retweet or retweet with a
comment when you take action use this
drop-down to select which twitter
account you are replying from this is
useful if you have more than one Twitter
account and of course you can still
assign archive or send to your right now
or see blackout so that's how easy it is
to read content from your listen
channels in social engagement and
muttering if you'd like more information
our documentation can be found here or
if you'd like to see more demos you can
find those at our Learning Library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
