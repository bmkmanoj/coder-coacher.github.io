infrastructure compute hi what can you
tell me about the Oracle cloud
infrastructure compute services using
the Oracle cloud infrastructure compute
you can provision and manage compute
hosts these manage compute hosts are
called instances after you launch an
instance you can access it securely from
your computer restart it attach and
detach volumes and terminate it when
you're done with it
can you please tell me about instances
what are the characteristics an instance
is defined by its machine image and
shape a machine image is a virtual hard
disk that has a specific operating
system installed a shape defines the
number of CPUs RAM disk resources and
network resources available to an
instance what type of compute services
does Oracle offer Oracle has to compute
offerings that promise high-performance
elasticity and security
bare-metal instances and virtual machine
instances
bare-metal instances provide you
complete control of the physical host
bare-metal machine these are fully
isolated single tenant environments were
the only workload that's running is your
workload there are two main reasons to
use bare metal instances a bare metal
instance is ideal for workloads that
require uncompromising performance of
bare metal servers without any overhead
of virtualization from the hypervisor it
is also ideal for applications that
demand stringent compliance and
regulatory requirements
I've heard that bare metal servers offer
choice regarding operating systems is
that right
yes it offers a wide variety of
pre-configured images as well as the
option to bring your own custom image it
is ideal for both legacy and modern
workloads
is the bare-metal instance equipped to
handle all workloads from web
applications to big data
yes of course you can customize the
bare-metal instance to suit specific
functions standard instances can be used
for a wide variety of high performance
and compute intensive workloads such as
web servers batch processing and
distributed analytics high i/o instances
are configured with twelve point eight
terabytes of local nvme storage and are
ideal for applications that require tens
or hundreds of thousands of low latency
iOS such as no SQL databases clustered
data bases and OLTP systems
dents io instances are configured with
28.8 terabytes of local nvme storage and
are ideal for extreme transactional
workloads that work on large datasets
and require low latency and high
throughput such as big data and high
performance compute or HPC applications
alternately if you need a certain amount
of compute resource to run a workload
but you don't want to buy dedicated
machines for that you can use a virtual
machine
does a VM come in different shapes yes
there are two VM shapes standard and
dents io a shape defines the number of
Oracle compute units or o CPUs and the
amount of RAM available for a VM each VM
shape has a different number of
processor cores amount of memory and
disk configuration so you can easily
select a size that matches the needs of
your application
standard VM compute shapes are great for
general-purpose workloads providing a
balanced of course memory and network
resources dense IO VM compute shapes are
backed by nvme SSDs and are better
suited for resource intensive workloads
such as large databases and big data
applications like apache spark and
Hadoop
when you select a shape for your VM
consider the nature of applications that
you'll deploy on the VM the number of
users that you expect to use the
applications and how you expect the load
to scale in the future remember to also
factor in the CPU and memory resources
that will be consumed by the operating
system running on the VM
I now have a fairly good idea about bare
metal as well as virtual machines and I
think I'm ready to start with an
instance how do I go about it
you can create a single instance using
the Oracle cloud infrastructure
web console you need an administrator
account in order to be able to create
and manage instances for access control
you can generate and assign an SSH key
pair and add your instance to a security
list
how much CPU and memory can I assign to
an instance the number of CPUs and RAM
allocated to an instance are determined
by the shape that you select while
creating the instance do I have the
option of using custom images yes you
can bring your own image to the platform
and use it to launch instances what can
I install on the Oracle cloud
infrastructure compute instances you can
deploy any application Oracle or
third-party that supported on the
operating system included in the machine
image that you use to create the
instance subject to the licensing and
support terms of the vendor of that
application and now let me show you how
to create a compute instance you will
need an administrator account in order
to create configure and launch your
instance
login to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
portal on the Oracle cloud web console
choose compute and within that instances
click the launch instance button on the
instances page note that you can create
an instance only within a predefined
compartment you will need to create a
new compartment or choose from
compartments that you have created
earlier the compartment is a way of
collecting related cloud resources so it
helps with the governance of your
overall cloud account
enter the name for the instance and
select from the options in each field
Oracle bare-metal cloud services is
hosted in regions and availability
domains a region is a localized
geographic area and an availability
domain is one or more data centers
located within a region
this is the operating system you want
installed on the instance
you can choose from the various Oracle
Linux or Windows options
you can also choose a custom image if
you have already created one
a custom image is one that you have
customized with your applications or
configurations from the provided image
or the image that you have brought to
the platform here we will pick a
pre-configured OS image
shape types that start with the VM our
virtual machines shape types that begin
with BM our bare metal instances these
are entire servers without a hypervisor
installed that are vended to a customer
the vcn is a software-defined version of
your traditional on-premise network in
the cloud it includes subnets root
tables and gateways in which your
instances run you will need to have
created a compartment and a vcn within
it before you create the instance
subnets are subdivisions within a vcn
subnets act as a unit of configuration
within the vcn
you can enter the IP DNS and SSH key
details as may be applicable the public
IP address is selected by default you
have the option of entering a private IP
address - you have the option of using a
previously generated SSH key from your
local machine you can now launch your
instance
after a brief provisioning window you
will see that your bare metal instance
is up and running upon clicking the
instance you can view all its details
from this page you can stop reboot or
even terminate the instance as required
to learn more please go to the Oracle
cloud infrastructure portal you can sign
up for a free trial and get started
right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
