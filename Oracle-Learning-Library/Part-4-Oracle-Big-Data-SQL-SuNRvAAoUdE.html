today we will close out a whole series
about Big Data sequel and ah it's going
to be fourth webinar for of big data
sicko today I pick up security topics
and thanks thank you guys for your
attention and feel free to give us on
feedback what you wanna know for
regarding the big day testicle we are
going to repeat this series and it would
be really great if you could her um
particular topic which is interesting
for you today i'll talk about security
so and it became a habit alkyl group
seminars i will start with quick
reminder
and so first of all I want to make sure
that everybody in the center dictated
sequel doesn't bring company on the
storm layer under search player just
read data from you know either nautical
databases or HFS a do file system and
then proceeded on the processing Claire
so and if it could be staying on the
same line with two such as MapReduce
park in column cloud research and cetera
so it's cool cross-linked engine and we
done bring something on the third star
on the database level conserve to you
have to tie new type of the external
table which you have to define and this
external table will link you to the HDFS
you explain that on the HDFS you do have
some high stable which called somehow
and then you will query Oracle external
table on oracle database which will be a
push 10 on the website so what's going
to happen when you open the database
security detail like the code blue
plastic all developer political
developer taught and run the query just
to jump to the name node and have met a
serve and define a file location state
structure defined click and then on the
Oracle database you do cleaning kit
internal steps you connect mentioned
Sonic and run can on the head upside
Iran smart and on the every every data
node which installed big date ethical
then ship spec only on the filtered data
on the date which
to which match with your conditions and
then do final processing on the database
side you could apply pills equal you
could do drawn with database tables ah
so you could do some security stuff and
we will talk about a lot think in my
list today so and let you a dick not
note and how it looks like you do have
data node you do have some big data
scotter which apparently has to stop
processes smart can retrieve blanc from
exadata and external table services
which with any type of the data confirm
it into some structure transformed it
into oracle format so you could read csv
file on HDFS party file on HTS esposa
file on HDFS Oracle obstacle database
MongoDB database you read some split
which means piece of the data are for
simplicity let's think about this like
about HDFS box and then confirm it into
oracle format and pass it on the smart
scan then smartcam it's exactly as this
piece match with Exadata satellite and
take the data you do filtering and then
rest of the data you ship toward the
Oracle database so and what about
security what do you have for security
with quick data sequel first of all you
have to keep in mind then whenever you
work with big data security could use
Oracle bi MicroStrategy tableau whatever
you want any to you connect the Oracle
database you connect to the Oracle
database and then work with a new pastor
through the Oracle database and you
could have all Hadoop security features
such
as a kerberos sentry hdfs encryption
they can rest encryption so you could
use all the features and the keyboard
that for your application it doesn't
impact our your application because
you're working through the Oracle
database so if we are talking about
security it's like a golden rule for
this
I become an able cover it's like step
number one metreon which you have to
accomplish or protect your cluster so
and oracle database have to have a
Kerberos ticket and in conversion you
working on the house on oracle user and
in future versions we will hence it and
you will be able to choose to link
different Oracle users with different
car birth users today it's Oracle so
you're working on behalf of and as soon
as you get Kerberos ticket to Oracle you
find you could work with HDFS but the
great great music especially for
database hope that you used to you could
continue rock like you used for exam
grant tables now you know it's quite
boring slide I even don't know what to
put here I think many of you who was
administering oracle database know what
is brand so what is roll its standard
Oracle a gradual weakening and also you
could use more interesting and more
advanced features like Oracle data
reduction and these feature allow you to
redic redux data on the fly without any
transformation so for example you have
found a table which contains very
sensitive information like credit card
numbers somebody like somebody from
financial department have to see through
credit card numbers somebody like Cole
center employee have to see only last
four digits
and you could store data in into oracle
or into head do you could still data in
original format so i mean who credit
card numbers and for some certain clip
of user show on the plus for digital so
and i know that you could not you don't
have something clear or like this with
hadoop as far as i know Hadoop ecosystem
doesn't have to which allow you to do
data reduction on the fly for example if
you want to implement it you could you
could do the conniving so in other words
transform your source data and duplicate
it in tokenized format and allow
restrict users get access only on
restricted data set so in other words
are you store in two times more data let
me show you a quick example whole debt
reduction and how you could use it so
for example I have some customer table
which stores information about my
customers and it has email let's
consider email like sensitive data so
and I initially a query data over the
table which does have any security
policy and I get full in our like Lisa
those helping at tal dot CP
so then I create policy is quite easy
the good news about data reduction that
it has tons of creepy
stupid hoe stick out for example email
it's quiet communicate and I just reuse
existing policy rather than write my own
external or regular expression but the
good news that if you need you could
write your own result expression of this
data so as soon as the email use case
it's quite common and quite popular it
takes only two political packages to run
to take on the two political packages to
apply those policies on my table after
this eye cream I data and observes that
in fact I he tied my uh my email so but
I store data in single in the single
copy so i don't do to placate
are they turning on single copy so
another one great news if I will need to
do John for them with this mask data
with some other masks or uh next data by
hidden column I could do this and I will
have right results with this chain so
and second tasty features is is virtual
private databases which allow you to
show part of the table depend on the
user who create this data so we could
have single table and different user
could create and depend on who are you
you could show either full table or a
small piece of the table or some sorting
partition also let me give you example
let's imagine we have worldwide company
which has customers all around the world
and we have mark who are working in
Sweden and he has to see only Swedish
customer at the same point of time we do
have Hassan who works in the echo and
have to see on a Mexican customer and we
have one big table with all list of all
our customers which have to be available
for all super users virtual private
database will help me to do but will
help me to implement this use case so I
don't show your full list of the
political packages ah so it's a bit more
complicated to rather than data
reduction but it's still easy and after
use to fill secure packages what you
could observe you connect like a mark so
so strength mark welcome one connect and
select
everything from this table and we could
find that mark could query on the
Swedish customer and it's about 33,000
then affair connect to the database and
query the data and has they could
observe on the Mexican Mexican customs I
would like to pay your attention on
tagged that
we don't put any where predicate it was
done automatically Rep predicate have
been added automatically and mark could
even don't guess that some other
information is exists in this table so
and for example if some super user will
connect he could find all the data like
I connect like pjs big data sequel and I
could see users from Slovakia from
Greece from Costa Rica from everywhere I
also would like to pay attention that
you are working with our HDFS data with
or no sequel database data so you could
query nose tickle data or dupe data and
apply these database policy so these
information this is free table which
contains this information is on the HDFS
and so the same for data reduction when
you whenever you create data in my
previous example the stator is actually
query data from HDFS as well you could
store data internal sequel databases so
and the more most important and most
advantage piece of these features that
you don't need to do something with HDFS
data we just create policy on the
database side and here we go you have
all functionality such as virtual
private database could give you such as
data reduction could give you so more
information you could find on the block
ball or into the documentation and
they have any question now somebody has
any questions okay you know what I would
like to say that it always scare me when
nobody has questions it means either
everything is clear or nothing is clear
I'm any game let's not scare you then
this is making a bit under the one that
get it as forgive the raspy voice here
but them so I yeah the features that you
covered were more the traditional
security component I for the database
itself it's just it it would be working
transparently for any employment of big
data sequel is what you're saying right
that's correct yeah I was wondering is
there any additional stuff I on the
Hadoop side where you guys is that
integration with say you know century or
Ranger or you know things like that or
is it more just you know separate and
you can figure that separately and the
access pass determined security model
well Big Data sequel will respect enter
and you could define some Central's and
big data khalil respective but only one
thing that right now right today picked
a testicle work on the house on oracle
database and so we going to change this
within maybe bjs 3.2 made it later so
and since this version will go to
mapping which allowed to use centeroo in
more flexible way ah like example i
could login into database like scott and
i will be armed i will be John user on
HDFS I could login into database like
our Oracle and I will be HDFS user on
HDFS and then I could use to like entry
like Kerber improve power but right
today I would say we do recommend we do
recommend to to follow oracle oracle
security recommendations which is
relevant for relational database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
