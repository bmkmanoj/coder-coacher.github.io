how to import a batch of user accounts
into the current identity domain the
first thing you'll need to do is create
a CSV file that includes the required
data for each user account to create a
CSV file you can use Microsoft Excel
Google spreadsheet notepad or text pad
or it could be output from one of your
applications that can export existing
user data into a CSV file format your
CSV file must have this specific format
the first column must be first name
second column this last name followed by
email and the fourth column is user
login the user login is the unique name
that a user enters when signing in to a
service if you leave the user login
field blank the system will use the
value you entered for the email address
so for the sake of time let's paste in
some user information that I created
previously let me expand this column
width for you as you can see for some
users I left user login blank and for
other users I actually specified a value
we'll compare how the system handles
that later in this video the next
crucial step is to save your file in the
appropriate format so we are going to do
a save as other formats enter a name for
the file in the save as type field
be sure to select CSV and click Save
okay so now you have your CSV file save
next you will use the my services
application to import the CSV file sign
in to my services application be sure to
specify the correct identity domain for
which you are importing user accounts no
you must have the identity domain
administrator role to create or import
user accounts
after the my services application opens
select security to open the security
page click import and then click browse
to locate and select the CSV file that
you just edited click import again a
message indicates that your import
request has been submitted for
processing in this background job is
finished you will receive an email with
the results of the import okay so here
is a sample user loading completed email
notification that you receive from the
application let's review the email total
number of seven records were processed
and of the seven six process
successfully and were uploaded and one
fail here it tells you the details of
that failure J Fallon and SN L comma org
cannot be created because the email
address is not valid notice that there
is a comma here instead of a dot I did
that intentionally to point out how to
review for errors okay so now let's
return to the security page in the my
services application in the search field
let's enter SN L as a search criteria
and then click search to find the user
accounts we just imported and here we go
there's one two three four five six
records as the email stated Jimmy Fallon
is one that is missing you'll notice
also that where I entered a value in the
user login field in the CSV file those
users have custom usernames so T Fey
Fletch and Amy Poe for instance
otherwise the usernames defaulted to the
email address given so at this point you
would go back and fix any errors because
only one user account was not imported
correctly you would probably use the add
option instead of the import option to
create a single user account other than
that you're all set you have now
successfully imported your user accounts
to the current identity domain
okay so let's review what have you
accomplished so far
you created a CSV file that contained
the data for a user accounts and
imported the CSV file using the my
services application you received email
confirmation of the import and you
reviewed the email for any import errors
of course if there are errors you can
either correct the errors in the CSV
file and then re-import the file or you
can add the user accounts manually your
next steps will be to assign roles to
your users and then provide your users
with the URL to access your Oracle cloud
service users received an email with
their signing credentials username
temporary password and identity domain
when the user account was created after
you give your users the appropriate URLs
they can sign in change your temporary
password and begin to use your Oracle
cloud service for more information see
trial and paid subscriptions for Oracle
cloud services in the documentation
