management or skim is a lightweight
protocol and rest slash JSON based
standard designed to manage identities
in heterogeneous applications and
services skim promotes interoperability
because you can use a common set of REST
API requests for creating searching
modifying or deleting identities
such as users or groups on any service
compliant with the standard so how do
skim requests work let's say you want to
create an entity called user with a few
details such as first name last name and
an email in the identity management
system using skin the skin standard
defines the HTTP method protocol host
server resource URL headers and the
message body in JSON format the JSON
body contains the schema definition
along with attributes and values for the
request to create a user let's make a
post request and send to the slash users
endpoint in the identity management
system with required post headers the
JSON request payload contains details
about the new user the identity
management system returns the HTTP
response code to 0 1 to confirm that the
user was created it also returns a JSON
output about the user containing the
user ID the ID can be used in future
requests as referenced to manage this
user entry the skin standard supports
other operations or HTTP verbs using
different URL endpoints that are
compatible with the rest architecture
style the skin standard also defines
other features such as attribute filters
and search criteria that can be used to
filter search requests for example you
can make a get request and send to the
slash groups endpoint to search for
groups with required get headers in the
identity management system it returns a
JSON response with the names of all
groups you can make a get request and
send to the slash group's endpoint to
search for the marketing group with
required get
in the identity management system it
returns a JSON response with the name of
the marketing group you can make a get
request and send us a slash groups
endpoint to search for groups that start
with mark along with their members with
required get headers in the identity
management system it returns a JSON
response with the name of all groups
that start with mark along with their
members a portable and lightweight ref
slash JSON based standard that can
manage identities and heterogeneous
systems that's skin to learn more about
cloud standards such as rest slash JSON
