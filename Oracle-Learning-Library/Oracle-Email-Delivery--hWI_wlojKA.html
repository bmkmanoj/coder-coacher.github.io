configuring the email delivery service
is easy from the Oracle cloud
infrastructure console create a new user
under which you will generate SMTP
credentials the group associated with
this new user should have permissions to
use email delivery in the settings for
the new user choose SMTP credentials or
generate the SMTP credentials choose
email delivery in the console app create
one or more approved senders the from
address setup email authentication like
the sender policy framework or SPF let
me explain both approved senders and SPF
an approved sender is a resource that
enables email delivery to send emails
with a matching from address these are
the email addresses that will appear in
the from line of the email and your
compartment will be configured to allow
emails to be sent on behalf of these
approved senders approved senders are
associated with a compartment and only
exist in the region in which they were
configured email delivery will be
available in all regions
SPF stands for sender policy framework
mailbox providers and ISPs check SPF to
ensure email delivery is authorized to
send emails on behalf of your domain
to set up SPF you must include a DNS
text record on the domain used by your
approved sender if other senders are
also intended to be authorized they can
also be added by additional include
statements or by designating the IP
directly the approved senders page
within the Oracle cloud infrastructure
console provides validation of SPF for
each of your approved senders
what are the deliverability features of
the service
email delivery provides a reliable
service through a system that is
compliant with industry best practices
the platform is managed by Oracle cloud
infrastructures email deliverability
team that reviews key deliverability
metrics to ensure the best sending
reputation possible
the following items are provided to you
when you send email using the email
delivery service mailbox provider unique
SMTP configurations suppression lists
bounce collection use your complaint
collection email authentication
standards like SPF deliverability
performance
the SMTP configurations have been set
through industry relations and years of
tuning across global mailbox providers
to optimize inbox placement in speed of
delivery
a suppression list is a list of email
addresses which is used by email senders
to suppress future email messages to
those email addresses the suppression
list currently includes spam complaints
hard bounces repetitive soft bounces
manual entries and lists unsubscribe
requests the suppression list is
accessible from your email delivery
console as well as within the API SDK
and CLI bounced emails are collected and
categorized appropriately as per their
corresponding bounce codes
any recipient address deemed to be
permanently undeliverable that is hard
bounces are put on the customer
suppression list
hi hard bounce rate or ratio of hard
bounces to messages sent occurs when its
sender attempts to send a message to
recipient addresses that do not exist
the mailbox provider will return a hard
bounce code to the sender
hard bounces are a good indication of
list quality and should be below 2%
repeated attempts to send two addresses
on the suppression list will not be
delivered by the email delivery service
and such occurrences are recorded in the
suppression list
this service includes user complaint
collection users complaints are
collected and processed via mailbox
provider complaint feedback loops the
setup of these complaint feedback loops
is fully automated within email delivery
when users spam complaints are collected
the user is added to the suppression
list to protect the customer sending
reputation
