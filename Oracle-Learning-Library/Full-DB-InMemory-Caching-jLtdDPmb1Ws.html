work for Oracle server technologies this
is the first of two demonstrations about
in-memory caching new features
introduced in Oracle database 12 one oh
two this one illustrates the full
database in-memory caching feature
enabling an entire database to be cached
in memory when the database size is
smaller than the buffer cache size
caching and running a database from
memory leads to huge performance
benefits two modes can be used full
database caching this is the implicit
default and automatic mode in which an
internal calculation determines if the
database can be fully cached for an
instance no cache lobs are not cached in
full database caching but in forest full
database caching mode the second one
even no cache loves are cached
neither full database cache nor forest
full of database caching pre fetches
data into memory workload has to access
the data first for them to be cached it
considers the entire databases eligible
to be completely cached in the buffer
cache first step before setting the
database enforce full database caching
is to calculate the sum of all data
files including the system tablespace -
the C Sox tablespace to verify that the
buffer cache is large enough to cache
all the data the current size of the
data on disk is 1.2 gigabyte the current
buffer cache size is five hundred and
fifty megabytes we can easily understand
that 80 percent of the buffer cache is
more than unser ficient to load the data
from disk so
increase the buffer cache size because
automatic shared memory match management
is used increased the SGI target to 2
gigabytes restart the instance in the
mounted mode to alter the database to
the forest full database caching mode
open the database and verify the forest
full of DB caching color new property
value Envy dollar database view verify
that the buffer cache is now large
enough to be able to load the data from
disk 80% of the buffer cache is now
sufficient to load the data from disk I
execute queries on all application
tables and dictionary tables I then
check the physical reads cache
statistics and calculate the buffer
cache hit ratio which is excellent
after re executing the same queries I
observed that the physical reads cache
remains stable all data is in the buffer
cache and the buffer cache hit ratio
remains excellent regularly verify that
the hit ratio remains stable if the hit
ratio decreases then check if the disk
data has not increased in this case
reconsider the buffer cache size this is
the end of the demonstration and thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
