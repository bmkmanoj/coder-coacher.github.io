going to look at the toad tab group from
Java flight recorder as you can see here
I already have a flight recording loaded
and I'm going to let's go ahead and dive
in here to the various tabs on the for
the code tab group so the first one here
we have the overview tab and that shows
us basically the the main focus of this
group is to show you where your program
spends the most time running so in this
case the first table here shows us which
packages have the most activity we can
see here that that Java util has the
most and then down below on the table
below we can see what classes have the
most activity so in this case hashmap
seems to be taking the most time
followed by concurrent locks abstract
cutes synchronizer so let's look at some
of the other tabs show us if I click on
the hot methods tab this shows me which
methods had the most activity during the
recording and one thing always to keep
in mind is your sample count to make
sure this is a pretty low sample count
so I don't know how big a conclusions we
could draw from that but anyway if I go
ahead and I click on that method then
down below here I can get a stack trace
both for predecessor method calls so if
I click this I can expand the subtree
I'm right-clicking that span subtree
then I can see a stack trace of calls
prior to the call above and in addition
if you see here in this other sub tab I
have the same thing for succeeding calls
I could do the same thing expand the sub
tree and see what gets called after the
method that's highlighted above so very
useful information
to look and see what's going on with
your application so the next tab here we
is the call tree and that once again
shows us the same sort of thing where
the most time your program spent running
but as focused mainly it basically
allows you to look at the stack trace
the complete stack trace for a
particular method so in this case the
repaint manager run method is being
called the most and if I right click
that and expand the subtree this may
take a second because this is a pretty
big sub tree we can see where what's
being called in in this particular
method tree let's see there's a lot of
detail there and you can see there a
percentage of times spent so pretty cool
stuff you get detailed information about
all your methods what's going on who's
calling what so we have the call tree
the men so let's look at exceptions next
and this just shows any exceptions or
errors you might have had so you can
drill down into those so for example
here I have there's an overview there
and it shows that I have 57 exceptions
and I'm going to go ahead and click on
the exceptions tab and see what the
exceptions were and I can see what
thread called them no such field
exception so I go ahead and click on
that and then once again down here I'll
see a stack trace that I can once again
expand and get a complete list of method
calls for that stack trace ok and then
errors there so we just have the one
class there for errors alright then
finally we have compilations and class
loading and those are basically just
counts of
the number of compilations that occur
then here I'm just showing the class
loading one where it shows the number of
classes loaded or unloaded during your
recording so that's basically it for the
code tab group
