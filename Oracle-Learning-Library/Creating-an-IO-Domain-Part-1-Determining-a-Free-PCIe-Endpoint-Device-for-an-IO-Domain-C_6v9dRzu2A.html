developer for Oracle I'm going to show
you how to identify a free PCIe endpoint
device for an i/o domain in Oracle
Enterprise Manager up Center first let's
begin by looking at the i/o resources on
the t2 ao1 virtualization server
on the Isle resources tab up Center list
buses and PCIe endpoint devices on this
particular virtualization server there
are two buses PCI one and PCI zero there
are also two Ethernet devices MB Net
Zero and PCIe one we want to determine
which of these Ethernet devices we can
use for our i/o domain in a terminal
window log in as the root user and then
use the ldm list i/o command to view the
list of io resources on the server this
is another way that you can view the
endpoint devices and busses on your
server notice that neither of the buses
has IO virtualization enabled yet
determine the PCIe endpoint device
that's used by the control domains boot
disk you want to make sure that you
don't remove this device from its bus
enter D F slash to determine the pool
name that contains the boot disk the
results indicate that the pool is named
our pool enter the command Z pool status
our pool to determine the name of the
boot disk in the pool the results show
that the boot disk is named C 40 0 d 0s0
the control domain boots from this
internal disk next use the LS command to
find the device path for the boot disk
the results show the path of the boot
disk now let's return to ops Center and
identify the PCIe endpoint device that
has that same path
set the scuzzy device named MB sash ba
has that path therefore you can't detach
this device for your IO domain return to
the terminal window to perform your next
job which is to determine the end point
device that contains the network
interface used by the control domain
enter the command ifconfig - a the
results show that the net 0 network
interface is plumbed with the management
network 192.168.1.0 phys command to find
the physical device name for net 0
the results show that the physical
device is named NX GE 0 now use the LS
command to find the path for the NX g e
0 device now that you've identified the
path return to ops Center and identify
the PCIe endpoint device that has that
path
the device is Mb NetZero which is
attached to the pci one bus therefore
you can't detach the mb NetZero device
now that you've determined which devices
you can't detach for the i/o domain you
can conclude that the only pci endpoint
device that's available for an i/o
domain is the PCIe one either net device
which is attached to bus PCI zero and
that concludes the demo for how to
identify a free PCIe endpoint device for
an i/o domain thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
