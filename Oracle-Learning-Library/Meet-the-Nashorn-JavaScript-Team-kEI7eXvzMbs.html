ahead and get started meet the JCP
executive committee candidates we have
some slides prepared that will walk you
through the process of the elections
this year and i do want to save some
time for questions and answers with the
candidates as well as some time to
discuss what format we might use in the
future for these types of events because
we don't have a lot of participants here
so save a little time for brainstorming
on what we might do in future years to
give the community a chance to meet the
candidates but yeah also make the best
use of everybody's time so what I'm
going to do is hand it over to the
candidates to start and then we'll go
ahead and walk through the slides about
the election process and I'll just go
down the table here we'll start with
Scott Jamison from HP you can just
introduce yourself and give a you know
five minutes your qualification first
we're doing your slides and explain
what's going on okay I can do that
actually that was yeah I don't want to
work her straight please okay all right
since when sony okas gonna walk through
these slides here i'll introduce Nyako
hell motto she works in the program
office and she'll walk through the
slides here yes yeah okay so I'm just
start there start right here
ok hello everybody my name is now a CO
and as Heather said I work in the JCP
I'm program management office as a
program manager I am actually in charge
of running the elections this year so if
you have any questions feel free to
contact me at now co at JCP org that's
na ok Oh at JCP torg and the members
that we have running for the merged
executive committee so far a Centurion
wireless credit suisse fujitsu limited
here that Packard London java community
moral code jack and also tons every turn
around it's not a member yet but will be
soon right yeah ok did I miss anybody
those are the nomination that I've
received so far I just want to make sure
that i miss anybody ok so here are some
election details the members are
eligible to vote or the JCS PA to
primary contact contacts and they have
received the messages with instructions
for nominating and the login credentials
via email last week on Friday so if you
didn't receive it please let me know
instead of you should have received at
night by now the nomination process and
the material supported on JCP torg
basically we need to contact information
the biography for the photograph
qualification statement and optionally a
position paper in a PDF format the
following is the 2012 ec election
schedule of the nominations period for
two elected seats that started on sep
tember 28th that's last friday and it
goes for two weeks so it closes on
october eleventh so we must receive
other nominations with valid tcp
membership by october eleventh putting
them in order for the nomination to be
valid and following the on sixteenth of
october we're going to send out the
ballot via email and this is for both
ratify and elected seats and election is
going to go from October sixteenth to
the 29th of October and we will publish
the results on October thirtieth on our
website
JCB torg and the new members will take
the office on october 13th and again
this is what emerged to ec okay yeah so
on for da JCP document process document
to a point nine or the executive
committee members will run and rerun for
the election next year so all the terms
with this year we want will be one year
so what that said before we go into the
Q&amp;amp;A we should go ahead and start with
you is that ok sure I don't pop too much
good afternoon everyone my name is Scott
jameson and i represent hewlett-packard
on the ec and we are proud to once again
be a ratified candidate for the upcoming
elections I hope all of you are I've
heard of HP hewlett-packard we're
certainly one of the largest suppliers
of general-purpose job in the world I
mean we ship it on all of our computing
platforms from laptop notebook PCs to
high-end servers across the board in a
variety of architectures and os
environments and I don't know what the
exact numbers are but they're probably
in that tens of millions if not hundreds
of millions of Java's system shipped
each year so we're certainly won a huge
supplier of Java we've been a member of
the JCP since its inception if not
before we certainly were part of the
process that actually created the JCP
back in the late 90s and have been an
active participant on the executive
committee basically since the
formalization of the JCP as we know it
today I'm proud to have been HP's
represented for the last I think it's
going on 11 years or so it's a or more
hits I didn't realize this was a career
when I joined a read
be back in two thousand one but it's
turned out that way our activities in
the JCP have varied over the years in
the early 2000s we thought we were going
to be you know a major j2ee supplier
with app servers and things we had some
acquisitions and we were actually fairly
active or tried to be fairly active in
that timeframe due to large company
dynamics changes in strategy what have
you you know that strategy certainly
changed but over the years we've been
active participants in I think as many
as 30 or 40 jrs we've led a handful yeah
I wish we could have been more active in
certain things in the past but you know
in a lot of ways we're a supplier of you
know the standard offerings and we like
to leverage what everyone brings to the
party and what the community basically
provides a to Java through the JCP now
in terms of what we're looking for in
the JCP for those of you that there last
night at our session on JCP next i
talked about some of things that are
important to us and things that i
personally will continue to work for if
re-elected re ratified whatever the
right term is on the ec and that's
making sure that the ec is a place where
the community can operate and
contributed an open transparent manner
with a minimum of risk and the maximum
of surety as to what the results will be
I if you contribute something expecting
a certain product or emerge and be able
to use that yes it's certainly
everything we're trying to do to make
sure that's the case and there's no
surprises down down the road if you will
at the end of the processes here and so
we've been very active in the various
JCP dot next and all the previous
incarnations of such we revised the
processes in the past striving for a
more open more transparent more
inclusive java community process a
standardization effort for java
and you know we want to continue to work
towards that and with that I you know
certainly hope we have your support in
the elections upcoming I think we'll
have some chances for Q&amp;amp;A later today in
this session and i'll be at the party
tonight and so if you have any questions
there feel free to grab me thank you
very much good afternoon everybody my
name is Susana check and I represent
credit suisse so we again got
renominated as ratified member and we're
very happy to to be able to continue on
that so credit suisse as you know is
some is a bank but basically we are an
IT shop and be very much relate on on
the java programming language and we got
originally elected pick as a customer
right so credit suisse was actually the
first customer and also the first bank
in the chase JCP executive committee
would we bring in there is really the
point of view of a user of all the
technology right so we use that you're
another provider of Java technology and
as a user we really have interest in in
open standards in standards that can be
implemented by any kind of vendor or
open source community or whatsoever so
for us really it's important to have
open specifications and as much
implementations as possible because very
customer that's attract attractive to be
able to choose from different
implementations so but we are not only a
user we also want to to shape the
language and that's what really good in
Karen in Credit Suisse because we can
allow our employees to actually
participate in Jay srs and to have them
in there you are doing the working time
to reserve some of the time to
contribute actively right so we have so
we have connected so far in in several
chase ours for example in
ESF that has been active for what green
of lake since 2004 we had a real
employee contributing that more recently
we've also worked with with the batch
specification that's very important for
us because we have a lot of batch
processing going on first of course all
on the mainframe but it's moving all to
Java so very interested in that we are
active also a specification leads for
example in the currency API so that's
all what we do and that's really the
point that we try to make a movie cannot
participate in all of the jrs because we
have a very specific set of know how but
we try to participate there as well and
give time to employees to participate in
there so what I think is very important
in what I want you to contribute when
when we get actually reelected is to
have these open standards that can be
implemented by by everybody to have a
variety of implementations and also to
make it very easy to to participate so
for individual members or user groups to
participate easily in in in the jsr s
what I also liked you to encourage more
is to get universities and students
involved because I mean I have a kind of
an academic book kind of I have an
academic background so was studying at
ETH and did a PhD there and so i'm
actually fluent in bytecode I think
that's one of the good things of Java
right so it has the bytecode behind
which is again a very nice specification
if the debtor gets provider with foreign
tearful so and I really like the jrs
that actually also come from from from
universities right ugly or mike lawrence
that have the
have good influence and I really like to
get these people more involved okay so
i'll be around all seen that we are
later on of course and also since the
party if you have more questions then
i'll be happy to answer those thank you
hello i'm ben evans and i represent the
london java community we've held our
seat for about 18 months now and it's
kind of an interesting story how we how
we actually came to have this seat we we
came clickers as a user group that
wanted to get more engaged we've been
quite vocal about the need for
additional reform and transparency
within the JCP and someone said to us
well don't you think you ought to run in
that case so we ran and we got elected
so then we found ourselves in the
position of needing to think about what
role a usergroup can or should play
within the EC it's it's great that so
many of our corporate colleagues are
interested in openness and transparency
in in the health of the community I
think it's a testament to the strength
of the committee that people are so
enlightened but for a for a user group
we have this this nice feature that we
have no direct commercial interests so
we can focus purely on the needs and
then the general good of the user
community and so we've got we've tried
to run programs to to help and enhance
that be that the docs jess our program
or the doctor OpenJDK and that's really
focused around trying to get developer
activity and developers involved in the
process of standards because one of the
things that we know is that standards
bodies and standards processes on that
interesting or exciting to use as always
and trying to get early stage
involvement from developers and getting
active feedback an early stage active
feedback is absolutely vital and I think
in the last 18 months that we've seen a
lot of progress in the JCP I think you
we are we are a long way further along
the road
than we were I mean we still have a ways
to go but we were a long way further on
the road from where we were 18 months
ago and I I would very much like the
opportunity you know I think we've we've
you know we've shown that developers can
be brought into the circle and
participation can be grown I'm very much
like the opportunity for us to continue
that work one of the great things about
London community is it's actually quite
large so with with 3,000 plus developers
you know that we have access to and an
active user base in you know approaching
a thousand that's a lot of talent that
can be brought to bear that means
there's a lot of people that can be you
know with with a bit of encouragement
and a bit of support provided by Central
Committee you know you can you can find
people to do all sorts of things and
that's that's one of the advantages that
I think the on-the-job community has I
think we're just at the beginning of a
quite an interesting journey I know
there's a lot to do in terms of the the
refactoring of the JSP I and dealing
with the IP flows is going to be
interesting but I think I think we're up
for the challenge and you know we'd
certainly really like the opportunity to
to see if we can continue to help out
here thanks
I are you doing hi my name is Jenna
Cavanaugh i'm the founder and CEO of
zero turn around as your turn around if
you don't know we didn't predict tivity
tools for developers and operations our
flagship product is called durable and
it helps developers to basically have a
much faster feedback cycle on the right
code and I guess for me so my personal
background is academical partially I
guess I finishing my doctorate business
have a company the software developers I
used to do a long time software
development so kind of a variety of
backgrounds you know I as far as I
understood like one something that could
come here much his hand in in handy at
the JCP he sees that I have a lot of
legal experience which I'm not sure is a
great thing but you know just happened
and really for me this elimination it's
kind of an experiment this experiment it
began about a year ago where for reasons
i known i joined the java ee 7 expert
group and my thinking at that point was
that and it's us that there is a lot of
very interesting changes going in this
in the IT world cloud is one of them big
data is one of them just generally the
reform of operations is one of them
which is very interesting for me so and
zero turn around as a company is very
much the forefront of these things we
heavily involved cloud we heavily
involved with the operation
methodologies and one like my hope was
that by joining the expert group I would
be able to help let's say protect the
especially my thought was protect the
interests of the operations because like
my view is right now there's you know at
least on the expert group there's a lot
of guys representing development there
was almost no but representing
operations and today I guess I my
understanding is that maybe that wasn't
quite the right forum and my hope that
EC is a much better forum to help shape
the future of Java help shade the
standards and by the way also hopefully
make sure that the standards are not too
premature which historically has been a
problem with with the Java standards and
you know for starters I was the one who
was vocally very vocally against doing
the PS standardization in the java ee 7
because i believe that the cloud is not
at the stage where it can be
standardized and any standard would be
premature which in the end you know it
had to be postponed for the exactly the
same reasons so honestly you know i
don't know what my contribution could be
because i haven't participated at this
level yet but i think i could contribute
and it could be useful and interesting
you know my name is mike de Nicola and
I'm with fujitsu fujitsu has been
involved with Java since its inception I
can recall in 1996 heading a development
group here in San Jose that we
transitioned our application programs
over to Java so that we didn't have to
maintain separate pc and an apple
applications which was a great savings
in land power and particularly at that
time Apple wasn't what it is today there
was some serious question as to whether
happeh would continue to exist in 1996
at any rate fujitsu has been a very
active in the community and has been a
member of the executive committee since
its inception I have been a member of
the executive committee since 2001 and
along with with Scott and Steve wolf
from IBM I think we're the longest three
members that are still maybe Don
Deutsche to Don Deutsche from Oracle
right before of us have been around we
all worked on and help develop JSP a 2
which was a stepping stone as we said at
that time it took a couple of years to
revise the JSP a license we felt it was
a major step in the right direction but
simply a step in that direction we're
now all of us working on JC j sr 358 and
looking at taking the next step in terms
of modification of the JSP a back in
when we came out with JSP a 2 at
required significant changes to the JCP
process we came out with JCP too and of
course the executive committee is the
expert group for the jsr s that deal
with the process and as a result of that
of course I've been a participant a
member of the EC and a member of the
expert groups therefore for for all of
the JCP changes that have occurred a 21
22 23 24 25 dude at six to seven now 28
okay 99 oh okay the that includes jsr
355 which which was the ASR which merges
the the two he sees into a single entity
which is recognition of the fact that
that java there's one java for everyone
and and that at one time the emmy java
was a subset or an afterthought if you
will from the java SE ee that's no
longer the case it's a it the to javas
really have to get in sync with each
other across the board and across the
industry at any rate we have an
excellent record we meeting fujitsu and
myself in terms of attendance at ec
meetings and being and participating in
ad hoc committees have actually chaired
a couple of the ad hoc committees myself
and i thank you all for electing me as
the JCP member of the year last year
thank
hi everybody so bother luery so I'm the
jug leader from Morocco so first of all
I mean the idea about joining the gcp
and working on GSR I was really
inspiring I mean by our friends you know
the london java community and to java so
I was I felt really proud seeing Java is
a group joining the gcp and we have
adopted the adopt GSR program by I mean
me and the other cool either we joined
some GS ours like observer and we have
joined some GSS as experts group like
CDI and GS F and so on and I was really
inspired I was really I mean impressed
by the experience on joining the gcp
especially I was in the initial express
group for the Java social with I mean
with Werner and Antoine you know I said
all the process to submit I mean GSR you
should have a reference implementation
and so on and what's I mean give me that
gcp is very very important that when the
GSR was rejected and they have rhythm in
the comment i was really convinced
that's yeah it's it should be rejected
you know so i was really impressed by
that and also the idea in in morocco we
we work them in hardly to improv improve
the developer picture in our country
like because it's it has been I mean
offshoring platform all people don't
want to be a developer so they feel
ashame it to be a developer so we work
it hard early i mean when adopting the
GSR program so developer can be proud by
working and joining our jug's so they
felt like you know like contributor in
the technology and not like the
consuming the technology one other point
is like i don't know if there is some
guy from from Africa joining the gcp or
not gcpc but you know I want to show
like who moroccan guys can we do and
African guys can
in the gcp in in general and improvement
rising the Java and Java EE word but
that's all thanks so we have about 15
minutes left anybody have a questions
for the candidates just to remind
everyone will also have a meet the EC
candidates phone call so you can save
your questions for that time which is
October 18 @ 9 30 pacific time and
patrick has a question representation
raises the question of whether we have
the right mix of representatives on you
see recently again said as we recognize
and over balanced in terms of creators
of the technology and didn't have enough
representational uses a technique which
if I wanted to redo it also called sex
we now
but I want to ask you to jump in do you
think we have to let down so their
groups constituencies that are not
represented and should
and if so how might we go about oh god I
stopped okay so um I think the issue of
academics is is a particularly
interesting one because I mean that the
first things notice of course they are
represented at the at the EJ another
specting level I mean if you if you look
at respective level you know the two
most obvious examples are learned from
the University of Washington and ugly
and and I know there are several other
academics who have run speculates
including one of the more interesting
recent ones was the constraint
programming which which was written by
people who sort of straddled the
academic and industry boundary and so
that's a great example of where the
process is actually working if you look
inside the expert groups even although
some of the magic inside things like
JSON a 292 in the lambdas Jess are you
know that those expert groups have
strong representation flew from from
very good academics so I think you the
question is is where as the right right
participation level for them I mean if
it's a ec level great but certainly as
the EEG member inspecting level you know
i would say that we're not too far off
and certainly it's one of the things
that as the ljc we've been very strong
on is nosing out talent in universities
and bringing them into the process in
whatever form be the contributor or
hopefully a full individual member so i
think we don't think we're doing okay
but can we do better sure i think we
probably can just to add to that first
of all let me start by saying i have the
tremendous admiration respect for Doug
Lee and I suspect that I've caused him
to roll his eyes more his tenure on the
JCP ec than ever before in his life and
most of us did doug is he wants to deal
with the technology he knows the
technology he contributes tremendously
to it and when us I think we were
accused of being policy or procedures
walks yesterday afternoon and we got in
that mode it drove Doug nuts
and so I think the danger of having you
know an academic there especially
someone that's strong in the the Java
ecosystem it can really bring something
as a spec Lee that's a member of an
expert group is the things we deal with
on the executive committee are not going
to be of interest or or they may be a
I'll say academic interest but that's
not the case it and but a lot of cases
probably going to be more frustrating
than anything else to them so I think
you know we need to make sure that you
know if we do want to look at different
classes members that we set the right
expectations and that's my only caution
there that this when we're dealing with
governance or process issues or things
someone that really wants to deal with
you know some nitty-gritty of technical
issues is going to be you know bored out
of his mind at best and like I said you
know I've had many great conversations
with Doug he actually was probably more
accepting of the sorts of things we
dealt with then probably most academics
would have been but I think we still
frustrated the hell out of them I mean I
mean as far as i know i mean professors
and academics are really subject matter
experts right so somebody in who does
programming languages would not
necessarily be interested in in
processes and defining ways on how to
follow processes and so on but I think
as a mix it certainly is good but i
think it probably is hard to find
somebody who wants to do process work
right but i think to have it as a mix
that's certainly good I mean I was I was
just thinking before when when I heard
all of the introductions and also of a
recent easy meeting in Prague we are
very heterogeneous and actually are
somehow a good mix because we bring in
very different opinions yeah which is I
think also sometimes hard to discuss
because we don't have background but i
think the variety is really good so to
get in more variety that certainly
valuable
no just a something else was just
occurred to me off the backboard Susie
said this concept that we've been we've
been sort of kicking around about term
sheets and the idea of getting when
we're talking about things which are
complex process objects to get to a term
sheet quickly it seems to me that that's
actually a good way that we can we can
leverage the differences that we have
across the across the sea okay good
question i think we have one more from
john
clearance importance of technology
governance know that often when people
cannot be deceived most people or not
new people a very surprised
how much is the technical politics
yeah that's true surprised Mike dinicola
in a rate I I just wanted to add the
fact that it's very important to us on
the ec2 if we're looking to improve the
process and I think back when I came on
board and and it was you know we we
talked about how long did it take to to
complete a JSR you know and we were
talking you know 34 years you know type
of thing even recently we've spent a lot
of time saying well there are a lot of
what we're now calling dormant we
created this category called dormant j
srs because they were j srs that just
were sitting there okay and not being a
not being addressed nothing happening
for years and and so what we what we've
tried to focus a lot on in the ec is to
improve the process to first off try to
get the process so that it sits we can
initiate a JSR and develop it and get it
released in a time frame that it's still
appropriate okay in this industry today
I mean technology moves so fast if it
takes you three years they get something
out you know you've missed the boat it's
a 30 shift I mean that so so the one of
the areas that I always found Doug Lee
particularly helpful in and I find when
I have the ever I have the opportunity
to talk with spec weeds is to is to
understand from their viewpoint okay
whether what were the changes that we're
making are improving the process from
the reality standpoint or whether it's
simply making it more difficult for them
to get their job done I'd like I think
it's something witty remark John yeah so
I was surprised because somehow I
envision people like two years ago we
would kind of discuss the different
chase are
and have more technical discussions but
then it's really process and governance
work right and I think it's really
important I think probably we could we
could do something to to make that more
publish that well I don't know how to
have to say now but to make it people
more aware that really the governance is
really important that's what I also see
when it's my working in Credit Suisse to
have governance to have around well not
only around projects around around
products it's very important because
this is in the end what ensures the
quality right so there's also the idea
of having that kind of architecture
review board for Jas RS which goes into
the same directions some people say and
probably partially I mean is it sir it's
a valid point it's more more work more
more blowed if you want around it but
then in the end it is it's the
governance that that helps to ensure
quality and to drive things forward and
I agree we should probably do something
something on that to make people more
aware of that importance ok I think
Martin had a question
kind of pig that you're going to require
to support a long-term
the years on whether
so including yeah well I mean the main
reason why i didn't candidate as an
individual I could eat for the expert
group is because that the fact that was
an individual in the expert group in
meant I couldn't draw on the you know
not in connect not inconsiderable
resources of my company and definitely
as we as we going to go in like it's the
company that goes in with me as may be
the primary I'm a representative at
least initially but it's definitely our
collective experience that we bringing
to the table for us I mean we we have
many good idea from our members because
as I told you the fact that's working on
gcp and working on GSR make our jack
growing very faster and we have I mean
some many members like the other their
phd some some guys I mean from some
leading company like my company who are
I mean the leading company on fragrant
Prince traces recognition and so on
there is nothing in java space to to to
deal with this kind of stuff and I have
got this i mean this idea how to to
introduced this kind of stuff in inside
java you know because my company you
know they worked with surplus plus and
this three last year's the change
everything to java and the the judge
does you know it's little bit slow
little bit performance because for
real-time application it's not very
appropriate so do you have asked me how
we can help i'm in java to introduced
this kind of things to talk with
materials like for you know for face
recognition finger prints pirates all
the stuff you know related to security
also
and there is something that we have
already worked for like for caching
there was no specification that it's
very very new you know so for cash log
in there is no its new there is I mean
there's a lot of things that all people
work with but you we didn't find I mean
some some stoned ours to shape with so
this is this is the idea but we haven't
been many skills who joins us and was
very motivated to work on improving job
at all okay thank you thanks to the
candidates and for your great questions
we will have the call to meet all of the
candidates on October eighteenth and
we'll also be posting the qualification
statements of all of the candidates on
JCP org once the nominations periods
closes which is on the 11th of October
next week I didn't want to take just the
last five minutes here to get some
thoughts and feedback on the format for
next year so next year we will be having
all of the executive committee members
stand for re-election it's great that
you all are here we don't have a huge
turnout though and so we have this meet
the candidates opportunity to meet
executive community members we also have
the public ec meeting that we like to
have a Java one so curious to hear what
people think about what we might do next
year to address the attendance Martine
right Thank You month anyway we should
have it maybe every developer conference
technotrekker says that simple I can
schedule paper they help me help
candidates on Sunday
hmm one of the things that they talk
about like sharks and rosemary
the Jeff user group leaders get our
pictures and BIOS that show like
breakfast I think it might be worthwhile
to get the folks that are actually
running for positions get bio brief
statement etc and flash those up in
between sessions things like that so
people can see but it means at the base
spend as much time getting up next year
to be everything we throw allowed you
can do okay mark that's good keynote to
meet all the candidates since we will
have everyone right
so you're not interesting that's right
finish part of the community keynote
that's great great yeah okay nish
you know all the candidates
mm-hmm that would be nice we are a
little bit constrained by the process
document itself but that's job one is
actually earlier next year PS that's
Sharon actually actually the candidates
no sign up for general we have the
speakers were flashing all speakers
communities have something at something
that's over there that says all JCP
gratifying elected all
yes good good yes yeah I know they are
interested in meeting with all the
executive committee members so their
plan on coming to the party tonight so
executive committee members should look
out for java magazine yes mark another
comment went to bottom with two batters
the right body when it took a piece yes
right John I have 6 30 yes right I agree
the infusion lounge which it's a run
illustrate just take that don't use
acronyms right
mm-hmm I think that JCP itself the whole
process needs to be more emphasized in
the keynotes since it is such a critical
part of Java and this is Java one which
is Java right there's also you might
mention here's some Oh invitations yes I
just in case you don't know about this
go ahead well yeah I think to your
feedback in the surveys and requesting
more JCP content in the keynotes would
be helpful because that's something I do
every year since 2000 is try to get the
JCP in the keynotes any help you can
give it yeah there's usually something
yeah but making it a key segment would
take community support so I support that
and Oh Mike was saying what
Thursday mmhmm yeah mm-hmm sure yeah
okay mom is full of gesso push the pony
only five minutes five minutes for that
yeah Stefan yeah uh-huh yes um Patrick
would love to be there yeah we actually
right we talked about it I suggested it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
