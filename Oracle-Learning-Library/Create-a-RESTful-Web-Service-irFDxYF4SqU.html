restful web service with your Oracle
database cloud service from the Oracle
database cloud service homepage you can
create a restful service just select
sequel workshop restful services from
the restful services home page click the
Create button to start the process of
grading your restful service fill out
the details of your restful service
module restful service modules like an
organizational unit that is used to
group related resource templates
together in this case a customer order
service module designate your URI path
next you'll designate your resource
template path in this sample I'm going
to designate the URI resource template
path as customer order info
next you'll designate or select a
resource handler in this case I'm going
to use to get handler I'm going to leave
the source typist query in the source
box i'm going to enter the sequel code
that will return the information from my
research in this case select star from
demo orders i'm also going to leave the
format as json you have a selection of
JSON or CSV click the create module
button to save your module next click on
the get resource handler scroll down to
the bottom of the page you'll find
there's a test button click on the test
button to test your restful service you
see the results returned in JSON format
when you test your service you'll find
in the URL path your URI path identifier
so it's not in the frame i'm going to go
ahead and copy and paste that and i'll
paste that here in the sourcebook so you
get an idea you're going to use that
when you're ready to consume your
restful web service
now i'm going to create another resource
template that will allow me to look for
custom order specified by the order ID
so i'll enter in my new uri template
path name in this case it's customer
order by ID i included parameter by d
changing query type to query by one row
and i'm making this not a require secure
access handler i enter in my sequel
statement in this case select star from
demo orders where order ID equals bind
variable which in this case i'm going to
set to the parameter ID i'll click
create that process successfully then
lastly I'll test by clicking the set
bind variables button I'll go ahead and
enter order ID value in this case the
value I'll use to for order ID and I'll
click test and success or return order
ID number two for me and excluded all
the other orders and that's it that's
all you need to do to create your
restful web services with Oracle
database cloud service and then you can
test them using the same application
will show you how to consume a restful
web service later in another video
