at the intersection of major technology
trends including mobile cloud big data
and analytics IOT connects everyday
objects to each other and to the
Internet Oracle Internet of Things cloud
service simplifies IOT so you can
rapidly assimilate IOT into your digital
strategy and create innovative services
with less risk key to a successful IOT
strategy is integration with your
existing applications and processes
Oracle IOT cloud service makes
integration easy and efficient REST API
is provide full access to all I o T
cloud service data and functions from
enterprise applications and processes
and drive the integration with connected
devices so the devices can securely
access the IOT cloud service managing
and analyzing the enormous amount of
real-time data generated by all these
connected devices demands a
multi-faceted yet robust IOT solution
real-time analysis tools let you
correlate aggregate and filter incoming
data streams while built-in integrations
allow for automatic synchronization of
data streams with Oracle business
intelligence cloud service Oracle IOT
cloud service enables secure and
reliable bi-directional communication so
IOT devices can communicate and exchange
data with both directly and indirectly
connected devices and the cloud all
devices are assigned a unique digital
identity to establish trust
relationships among devices and
applications authentication and
authorization are enforced for
end-to-end communications security to
ensure proof of origin of data cross
protocol functionality lets you directly
address any device from the IOT cloud
service regardless of network protocol
and firewall restrictions
it's reliable with guaranteed delivery
of messages over unreliable networks and
to and from intermittently awake or
connected devices Oracle Internet of
Things cloud service intelligent
