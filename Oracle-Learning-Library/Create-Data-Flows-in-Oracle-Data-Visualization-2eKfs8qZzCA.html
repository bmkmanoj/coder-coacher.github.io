define data source transformations and
create an enriched output data set to
use and reports let me show you how
begin by creating a data flow and
selecting the first data source this
data source is an excel file already
uploaded to the system and contains
order transaction details such as sales
and product name you can preview the
data as you build the data flow to see
the data transformations add a step in
the data flow to pull in data from an
additional data source this data source
contains order details such as order
date postal code and region since both
data sources contain the same column
which is City it's automatically used
for the join you can perform equals and
left or right joins in data flows
preview the join results continue
building the data flow by adding a step
to remove the columns you won't need to
use in reports use the ctrl key to
select multiple columns and then review
the results next add a step to create a
column based on the existing customer
name column that only includes customer
first names build the expression to
create the new column validate the
expression make sure to apply your
changes before you continue it looks
good so far keep going by adding a step
to rename the customer segment column to
better meet your business needs and then
preview the step add the final step to
save the data name the data flow and
save it for use later in reports run the
data flow data is retrieved from the
data sources all transformations are
applied and the resulting data set is
stored in the system go ahead and test
the data flow in a data visualization to
make sure it creates the results you
expect use the ctrl key to select
multiple data elements and drag them to
the canvas in this video I showed you
how to create data flows to define data
source transformations and create an
enriched output data set for use in
reports</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
