incorporated whenever Bob closes a deal
he expects it to be picked up instantly
by the order processing team this
ensures faster processing of his
customer order and happy customers Bob
also expects the customer account to be
created automatically when creating an
order for a new customer to make this a
reality vision Incorporated needs to
automate their sales process so that
when Bob closes a deal in their CRM
system oracle salescloud
an order will be created automatically
in their ERP application JD Edwards
Enterprise one what if Bob closes a deal
with a new customer and this new
customer record doesn't exist in JD
Edwards in this case he needs to first
check whether the closed opportunity is
from an existing customer if not a new
customer record needs to be created in
JD Edwards based on the information Bob
entered in the sales cloud after that
order creation can proceed vision
Incorporated is chosen Oracle
integration cloud service or ICS as
their integration platform in ICS with
the orchestration pattern you can build
this integration rapidly and without any
coding let me show you how the
connections to Oracle sales cloud and JD
Edwards Enterprise 1 have been
configured James the integration
designer at vision Incorporated starts
creating an integration using the
orchestration pattern there are other
patterns available such as data mapping
publish to ICS and more James sees an
empty canvas with a start node where he
can drag the trigger to define the
starting point the triggers section
shows the available connections James is
configured because the integration needs
to be triggered when the opportunity is
closed in sales cloud James adds the
Oracle sales cloud connection to the
starting node he enters a name selects
the opportunity business object and sets
the operation the next step is to check
whether the customer exists in JD
Edwards James invokes the jde connection
he selects the get customer operation to
retrieve customer information and
figures the necessary data mapping with
this information James moves on to
verify whether the customer exists the
orchestration editor provides a list of
actions he can perform here
James adds the switch action to define
routing he can use the zoom in and zoom
out icon to easily resize the
integration by default ICS provides two
branches but you can add more based on
your needs here two branches are enough
James configures the default branch if
the entity ID is null which means the
customer doesn't exist then invoke the
JD Edwards connection to create the
customer james configures the jde
adapter selects the process customer
operation and then configures the
necessary data mapping if the customer
exists James can directly use the entity
ID and he doesn't need to modify the
otherwise branch now James can create
the order in JD Edwards the jde
connection is invoked again this time
James chooses the process sales order
operation to create a sales order in the
jde application after completing the
data mappings James moves on to
configure the tracking identifier to
ensure end end visibility at run time
the integration is now complete James
hasn't written a single line of BPL code
or XSLT all the necessary integration
artifacts were generated behind the
scenes he can use the zoom to fit icon
to check the entire integration and
select multiple elements and move them
together using the multiple select icon
james activates the flow in one click
messages can now flow seamlessly between
oracle salescloud and JD edwards which
means that when bob closes an
opportunity order processing will start
instantly now when Bob calls James to
ask about an order James can easily use
this monitoring console to identify
issues or check status of flows in real
time and get back to Bob immediately
sales teams at vision incorporated are
happier and so are their customers for
