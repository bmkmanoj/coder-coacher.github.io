curriculum developer with server
technologies curriculum development in
this demonstration I will show you how
to create and use a restful web service
with an XML response the example that we
will be using is Google geocoding which
is the process of converting addresses
into geographic coordinates like
latitude and longitude which you can
then use to place markers on a map the
Google geocoding API provides a direct
way to access a geo coder via an HTTP
request an apex application has already
been created
we will define the restful web service
and then create a report and form using
the apex web services wizard the first
thing you need to do is click on shared
components then under logic select web
services references you're going to
create one so click create you want to
select the rest option and then click
Next here is where you're going to give
it a name go ahead and type in Google
geo coder as the name for the URL you're
going to specify the URL for Maps Google
API s that is shown here and then you
specify a proxy server and click Next
we're going to enter in some rest input
parameters the first one we're going to
add is address and the second one we're
going to add is sensor these two input
parameters are required for this web
service and then we put in the XPath
which is geometry location and specify
some parameters for longitude and
latitude
and then click create your web service
has been created at this point you're
ready to create the form and report on
the web service so you're going to click
that option and you're going to select
the service that you just created in
this case Google geo coder and click
Next you're going to accept the default
and then click Next here's where your
input parameters are specified you click
Next and then select the check box for
both of the output parameters to be
specified in the report and then click
create
now you're ready to run the page go
ahead and enter in your username and
password and click login here's where
you're going to enter in an address so
in this case we'll just put in a city
San Francisco and put the sensor of
false and then click Submit the
longitude and latitude are listed you
can then change it to another city will
do Madison Wisconsin and then click
Submit and notice how the longitude and
latitude values have changed you have
just seen how to create and use a
restful web service with an XML response
