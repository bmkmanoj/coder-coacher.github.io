Replacing a Storage Drive
Important
The complete service procedure for this task is
available in the server Service Manual.
See the link at the end of this video.
Procedure Overview
To replace a storage drive in the Sun Server X4-8
Identify the storage drive using Oracle ILOM.
Prepare the server for service,
following ESD requirements.
Remove the storage drive.
Install a replacement drive.
And configure the drive as necessary.
To identify the fault, 
check the Oracle ILOM Open Problems list.
The Open Problems list provides information
about the storage drive error and its location.
Before going to the server, use Oracle ILOM to 
turn on the server's Locator indicator.
The Locator indicator helps you find the server.
Storage drives are hot-service components.
You do not need to remove power from the 
system.
After identifying the faulty drive,
take the drive offline using the OS.
When at the server,
turn off the Locator indicator.
Create an ESD-safe work space,
and use a wrist strap to service the drive.
The drives are located at the back of the server.
To find the failed drive,
look for the amber Service Required indicator.
To remove the drive, press the release handle 
button on the front of the drive.
Rotate the handle to its fully-open position and 
pull the drive out of the slot.
If replacing the drive with a different type of drive,
go the Service Manual for slot population rules.
Open the drive handle of the new storage drive or 
filler panel.
Align the drive handle with the vacant slot,
so that the open handle is on the right.
Insert the drive until it's flush with the front of the 
SMOD.
Rotate the handle to its closed position.
Configure the drive as necessary.
Configure the drive as necessary.
