four short videos about the sample otbi
dashboards and reports that I've posted
on customer connect my name is Caroline
gladwyn and I work as a solution
consultant in the Oracle UK HCM team in
this third video we'll be having a look
at updating some of the dashboard
prompts and how they work across
multiple subject areas we'll also be
looking at how some of the metrics are
filtered and how to add some conditions
to the time-based reports before
finishing by taking a look at some case
statements and the use of bins to
display the data in the way that is
required so the first thing we're going
to look at in this third video is how we
can use prompts in different scenarios
so the first use case we're going to
look at is a situation where all of our
reports on the dashboard are built using
the same subject area but I want to
update which fields are available to me
within that dashboard prompt and have
have the reports reflect that so the use
case I'm going to use is my absence
management summary page because all of
these reports are built on the absent
subject area what I'd like to do is I'd
like to have the option on the
selections to be able to pick a
particular manager and see which
absences relate to that particular
manager so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to update first of all the
dashboard prompt to give the end user
that extra field and have it available
for them to select from so a little bit
like we saw in the previous video I'm
going to go and edit the dashboard you
can see in the left hand column here is
my absence prompt so again I'm going to
come in and edit this you'll remember
that before what we were doing was
updating their default absence types
this time we're actually going to add an
extra field to the prompt so I'm going
to click on the plus sign above the list
of fields and choose to include a new
column prompt the field I want to pick
is from the worker folder so let me open
that up within that you can see you've
got hundreds of different items to
choose from but the one I want to choose
is the manager name so I'll highlight
that item
and click on ok it then asks me for some
additional information such as what
operator I want to use in the condition
what the user is going to have the
choice of selecting from and also what
the defaults need to be I'm going to
leave it as the standard setup apart
from the fact that I'm going to limit
the values by all the prompts which I
talked about in the previous video I'm
going to click on OK and you'll notice
down here at the bottom of the screen
that the manager name is now available
in the prompt towards the bottom there
if I wanted to bring it up I simply have
to highlight it and use these arrows on
the right-hand side but I'm happy to
have it as that as the final item so I'm
just going to click on save so what I've
done now is I've made available the
manager name as a field for my end users
to be able to select when wanting to
filter the reports the second part is
that I need to update the condition on
all of those reports to reflect the fact
that that field might be selected so if
I go back to the catalog you'll remember
that in the very first video when I was
looking at the structure of the content
that I talked about the fact that we had
a subject area contents folder which
included all of the conditions and
filters that are available to the
reports you can see here that there's a
workforce management absence real-time
folder and within that is the filter
that applies to all of the reports on
the abscence dashboard so let me go and
edit that and make that same change as
I've just made to the dashboard prompt
so here we can see the fields that are
currently in the prompt and all I need
to do again is work open the worker
folder scroll down and find the manager
name the same field that I just selected
and then double click on it and say that
that value is prompted in the report
that then links this particular filter
to the dashboard prompt and ensures that
all of the reports will be updated when
I make a selection from that particular
field so I've now done the two steps
that I need to to update the dashboard
prompt and have all the reports
recognize that so let's go and have a
look at that in action if I come back
and have a
at my absence dashboard you'll notice
now that the dashboard prompt on the
left hand side has the manager name
available to me now when I do the drop
down list you can see here all of the
managers that are available in the
different areas relating to the
particular absence types I've currently
got selected so you can see an awful lot
of names here available to me to choose
if I was to change the absence type and
only have the progressed UK absence type
selected so I'll deselect the sick and
the sick UK what you'll find is not only
will the dashboards update but also the
manager names now available to me will
be a much shorter list because this
reflects the ones that are available
within 'progress UK and if I now for
example just want to see the absence
relating to Cassandra Dale's team I can
choose her as a selection and it will
then update the information and just
show the information for her particular
team so that's one very quick technique
in a situation where you have all of the
reports linked to the same subject area
to be able to add an additional field to
the dashboard prompt and have all the
reports relating to it the second use
case we're going to look at is where for
example on my performance tab here I
have reports that are based on different
subject areas but the items that I want
to prompt those reports on are common
across both subject areas now you may
have noticed when you're building
reports that you only have filters
available to you that relate to the
subject area that the report knows about
so if for example I go to the
performance status metrics report which
is displayed up here on the top of the
dashboard because this report is based
on the performance document status
subject area within that report I can
bring in the filter that is based on
that particular subject area so if I
show you this filter definition you can
see that it has
the eight columns that reflect the same
columns that are in the dashboard prompt
that are displayed to the end-user now
as long as I create a prompt which has
these same eight columns against each
subject area that I want the reports to
run against then the Oracle bi platform
is clever enough to know that business
unit within performance document status
is the same for example as business unit
in the performance rating distribution
subject area and therefore although I'm
making my selections in the dashboard
based on only one subject area it will
cascade those selections across all of
the reports that are included in the
page so let me just explain and show you
that a little bit more detail so here we
were looking at the performance status
metrics report with this particular
filter if I now go to the calibration
report which is displayed on that same
dashboard page but is based on a
different subject area when I come into
this report and have a look at the
criteria tab then it has a different
filter name on it but when I go and view
that filter it has exactly the same
eight common columns included in that
filter and these columns are the same as
those ones in the dashboard prompt so
what that means is that this report will
be updated each time you make a
selection on the dashboard page if I go
back to the catalog you'll see that
actually the performance reports are
based on a number of different subject
areas and that's why when we come back
to the subject area contents folder you
can see a number of different filters
around document status and rating
distribution and rating real time and
performance task status and all of these
have those same eight columns defined in
them so here for example is the filter
on the performance task status that's
how we get a page such as this
performance tabs one to work and reflect
a single set of selections that the end
user makes
so if for example I'm back in the
dashboard as an end user and I want to
just choose all of the performance
documents to do with 2015 I make my
selection here and it then passes that
information across to all of the
different reports that are available to
be updated so hopefully that explains
how you can create a single dashboard
page with reports from multiple subject
areas but all prompted by a single
dashboard prompt using column columns
common columns that all of the reports
understand so let's move on now to our
third use case for prompts and that's
the situation where we want to have
multiple reports on the same page those
reports come from different subject
areas but they are no longer prompted on
what we would call the standard columns
instead they want to be prompted on
something that's specific to only one of
those subject areas so how can we cater
for that so the example I'm going to use
for this particular scenario is the
organization tab this has reports based
on the worker assignment subject area
but it also has reports based on the
worker assignment event subject area and
the worker assignment event subject area
doesn't know about all of the items that
are included in this dashboard prompt on
the left-hand side now there are two
ways round this particular scenario and
I'm only going to show you one of these
to date the other way is to actually
create all of these reports again as
cross subject area reports and there's a
great video on customer connect by
Julien challenger that explains how to
do that the technique I'm going to show
you is to use a link report based on the
person ID so let me explain a bit more
about how this works if I go and open up
my linked report it's called the head
count person ID report all that this
report does is based on their worker
assignment folder as it brings back a
list of person ID that match whatever
the current select
are in the dashboard prompt that is then
used as a reference to limit the data
that's returned in the reports that are
based on the worker assignment event
real-time because every subject area
knows about the person ID so we can see
here this report is just bringing me
back a list of person ID if I now go
back and open up the lever summary
report then you can see how it's all
linked together so the lever summary
report is displayed down here on the
dashboard and if I choose edit we'll see
that on the criteria tab I no longer
point to a standard condition linked to
the dashboard page but instead I linked
to that person ID which in turn links to
the dashboard page so here we can see my
work force levers is bringing back any
person that is equal to a person ID in
that link report and this technique can
be used to in effect link reports from
any subject area where the dashboard
prompt is using some items which aren't
included in all of the different subject
areas and that's where this example
differs from the one that we looked at
in performance where we were using
common items across all of the different
filters so that ends a fairly detailed
section on different approaches to using
dashboard prompts what we're going to
move on to now is having a look at some
different types of filtering that you
can include in your reports and one of
the examples is right here in this
leaders summary report so here we're
starting to look at how we can filter
time-based information you could
obviously just do simple filters based
on the calendar year or the quarter but
often you have the requirement to make
the reports a bit more flexible and this
is an example here where I'm looking for
the date of all the events that are
happening but I'm only bringing back
those ones which are at a date that's
greater than exactly two years ago and
I'm using this time stamp add function
to calculate the date two years ago now
I'm not going to explain this in full
detail today but if you go to my OTD i
hints and
posting on customer connect there is a
full document explaining how to use the
timestamp calculations not just for this
type of report but also for calculating
things like people's age or people's
lengths of service so I'd recommend that
you get familiar with this function as
it's a very very valuable one to use in
many different styles of reports now
another technique that can be very
useful is filtering metrics by filtering
a metric you're not actually applying a
condition to the whole report you're
only affecting that particular column of
data so let me show you an example to
explain this if I go back to the absence
dashboard then we can see across the top
of the absence dashboard that we have
these metrics here for leave duration by
days and hours so let's have a look at
how those metrics are set up if I edit
the dashboard I can open up those
particular reports
once I've opened the report I can go to
the criteria tab the metrics are called
here called leave duration days and
leave duration hours so if I go and have
a look at the formulas behind these
particular metrics we can see an example
of filtering a column within the report
so just to be clear what this is doing
is it's only bringing me back the leave
duration where the unit of measure of
that lead duration in my case is days or
the other item obviously looks for hours
now how do we set this up well if I just
delete that formula at the moment I can
go through and show you how that's done
so if I pick the assignment absences and
choose to include the leave duration
that will give me the basic duration but
I only want to bring it back for those
particular units of measures so the way
that I do that is by utilizing the unit
of measure item which is in the
assignment absence details folder you
can see it here down here at the bottom
if I want to filter my metric by that
particular value all I have to do is
highlight it and click on the filter
option and then identify and locate the
item that I want to filter based on so
in my case it was unit of measure and I
double click on that and then pick the
value that I want to filter based on so
in my case it was days when I click OK
the BI platform builds the formula that
I need for me and this is now going to
only return the lead duration where the
absence type is in days for its unit of
measure this kind of filtering can be
used in a number of different reports
and it does have the benefit that it
doesn't filter the entire report so that
different lines can be filtered in
different ways so I mentioned a couple
of times in the videos so far about case
statements and I wanted to just focus
briefly on a couple of examples of where
I've use case statements in this content
so if I navigate to the Succession
funnel report that we looked at a little
bit earlier on this is a good example of
the use of a case statement so if you
remember the report was showing me the
succession pipeline and I'm
in that it was color-coded compared to a
target so the obvious question is where
does the target come from and what I've
done within this report is I've defined
a case statement to specify that target
so if I go back to the criteria tab and
have a look at the candidate target and
edit the formula then what you can see
here is that I've built up a case
statement that basically looks at the
candidate readiness and then specifies a
number of candidates that I would expect
to have for a position at that level of
readiness obviously you can make this
more complex by building a more complex
case statement but this shows you the
principle of how to use a case statement
you check for a particular value and
then you put the result that you want to
deliver into the report based on that
particular value so for one to two years
readiness I'm saying that I want four
candidates for three to four years I'm
saying I want five candidates and where
there's no readiness available I want
six candidates the else at the end is in
effect the bucket value that gets
delivered if none of the other
conditions are met so that's a great
example of a case statement and we also
saw some earlier where we were looking
at things like the skills reports in one
of the earlier videos so hopefully that
example of using case statements has
helped you understand where and how you
might use these in the reports and
dashboards that you'll be building for
your organizations that brings to an end
this third video which has looked in
quite a lot of detail at how to set up
your dashboard prompts and conditions
for the different use cases that we
talked about so where we're able to
define all of our reports on a single
subject area and just link that into a
single dashboard prompt or where we have
more complex situations where we're
using multiple subject areas and we need
to be able to link a number of reports
together using the different techniques
discussed we then finished by having a
quick look at filtering metrics applying
time-based conditions and also looking
at some case statements so you're now
ready to move on to the fourth video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
