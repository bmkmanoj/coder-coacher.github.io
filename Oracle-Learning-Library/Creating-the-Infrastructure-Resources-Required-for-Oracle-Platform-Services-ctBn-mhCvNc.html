on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure--uch as
Oracle Database Cloud Service or Oracle
Java Cloud Service--you need to create
these resources to support those
services:
A compartment;
a virtual cloud network
Permission for your platform
services to use the virtual cloud network;
an object storage bucket;
a Swift password;
and, in some cases an API signing key.
Using my Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure credentials, I'll sign in
to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
dashboard.
Let's start by creating the compartment.
Working from the Oracle
cloud infrastructure console
I'll first ensure that I've selected the correct region,
then I'll create the compartment.
I'll enter a name and a short
description making note of the name as I
know I'll need it later in this procedure.
Now, I'll create the virtual cloud
network,
which I'll refer to as the VCN.
The compartment I created, &quot;myPaaScompartment&quot;,
appears in the  &quot;Create in Compartment&quot; field.
I'll give my VCN a name and ensure that it's created along
with its related resources.
I want to be sure to note the name of each subnet I plan to use
for the Oracle PaaS instances.
And I'll create my Virtual Cloud Network.
Next, I want to grant
permission for my platform services to
use the VC and I just created.
I'll grant permission from the policies tab,
first selecting the root compartment for my tenancy
and then start the policy creation process by clicking Create Policy.
I'll enter a name and description,
then I'll specify the definition of the
verbs and resources I want the policy to
use. In this case, I want the policy to
reflect future changes to the
definitions of these verbs and resources,
so I want to keep the policy current.
Now, I'll enter the policy statements I want
to use...
...one per line.
If you are creating these policies, you'd replace &quot;myPaaScompartment&quot;
with the name of the compartment you created
and then enter the remainder of each policy statement exactly as shown here
and create the policy.
Next I'll add an object storage bucket
where I can store backups and
other artifacts for the JCS instance
I'll create later.
I'll start the creation process, ensuring that I'm creating the bucket in the right
compartment.
I'll give the bucket a name and here, too, I want to make note
of this name as I'll need it when I create my PaaS services.
Because I also plan to
create a Database service, I'll need to
create another bucket for its artifacts.
Now, I'll generate the Swift password.
A Swift password allows an Oracle platform
service to authenticate with the Oracle
cloud Infrastructure object storage service .
It's created for the user who
created the bucket all I need to do here
is enter a description for the password
and generate the password.
I'll want to copy and store the password because I know
I'll need it later.
Some services--such as Oracle Big Data Cloud Service--require,
in addition to the prerequisites demonstrated here,
that an API signing key be generated before their users
can start provisioning platform service
instances.
For more information on this process see the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure document
&quot;How to Generate an API Signing Key&quot;.
Thank you for viewing &quot;Creating Infrastructure Resources Required for Oracle Platform Services&quot;
With these resources in place, we can now provision any Oracle PaaS service
such as Oracle Database Cloud Service or Oracle Java Cloud Service.
In this demonstration,
we'll next create a Database Cloud Service deployment.
