t-shirts, and you want to create a bot that
can accept orders from customers.
The shirts you sell come in a limited selection
of colors, so the bot itself will be relatively
simplistic.
Let's take a look at what the bot will do.
The customer enters some text we call “an
utterance” text that the bot uses to extract
the customer's intent.
In this case, the customer wants to buy some
shirts.
The bot responds with a list of available
colors, drawn from an entity.
After the customer specifies the color, size,
and quantity, the bot asks for confirmation
of the order, and then gives pickup instructions.
Let’s see how to build this bot.
On the bots home page, click New Bot to create
a new bot, and name it TshirtOrderTaker.
Click Intent to add the first intent.
Let's first add the one we think will be most
commonly used, the BuyShirt intent.
Then add sample utterances.
These are the phrases that make up the bot's
training corpus, a list of phrases related
to the Intent, buying tshirts.
Only 10 or so are needed to get started.
Later you’ll do some testing to see if the
ones you've chosen make a good set of samples.
An important part of the intent definition
is the list of entities.
Entities are like variable types.
They’re used in the analysis of the text
input.
There are two types of entities: predefined
entities that are built into the bot designer,
and custom entities that you create.
You can create custom entities as you add
them, or you can create them first in the
entity designer, and then add them to the
intent definitions later.
Let’s go to the Entity design page to create
the Color and the Size entities.
Both will be of type value list, so that the
bot can display a list of available options
to your customers.
Click Entity, enter the name “Color”,
and click Value to add the values for the
list.
Because customers can also type in their selection
(as opposed to just tapping on the one they want)
add some synonyms so the bot can understand
typos and spelling errors.
When you're done creating the color and size
entities,
go back to the Intent design page to add the entities to the BuyShirt intent.
Adding the entities to the intent is optional,
but if you do add them, the bot will be able
to recognize the entities if they appear in
the customer's input.
Now it's time to train the bot.
Click Train.
This might take a few minutes, but after training,
the bot can understand phrases that are not
part of the training corpus.
Let's see how the bot processes intents.
Try a phrase that's not in the training corpus,
such as &quot;I need a few red shirts&quot;.
You can see that the bot has picked out a
value for the Color entity, which will be
useful later when we design the dialog flow.
Let’s add a few more intents.
Add the GoodBye, Greeting, and ReturnShirt
intents the same way that you added the BuyShirt intent.
These intents have no entities associated
with them.
Don't forget to train the bot again after
adding the new intents.
Now we’ll work on the dialog flow, which
is the model for the user-bot exchange.
You define dialog flows using OBotML, OMCe’s
YAML-based language.
The bot is essentially a finite state machine.
You must define both the states that the bot
can be in, and the rules for switching from
one state to another.
We won’t show how to build the dialog flow
from scratch.
Instead, here’s the complete flow, step-by-step.
First is a bit of metadata, then the context
section where we declare the variables that
we'll use in the flow.
Each variable declaration has a name and a
type.
Here we have the variable color of type Color.
We defined the Color type earlier; it's an
entity.
The others are all entity types too.
Note that variables can also have primitive
types, such as integer and string, but we
don't need any such types in this bot.
We also define a variable called input, of
type nlpresult.
This variable holds the NLP engine's results.
Then we have an optional error state to handle
internal bot errors.
Next, we have a list of states.
We've called the first state 'User Intent'.
The purpose of this state is to route the
flow to the next state based on what the customer
typed into the bot.
If the customer wants to buy a shirt, the
bot goes to the Detect Shirt Color state.
When in the Detect Shirt Color state, the
bot looks for a color entity in the customer's
input, and if found, assigns it to the color
variable.
Then it looks for a shirt size entity, and
then, a quantity.
After looking for the entities, the bot goes
through the Get Color, Get Size, and Get Quantity
states, automatically skipping those for which
it already has a value.
Finally, after all the order details are known,
the bot enters the Confirm Order state where
it waits for a yes or no response from the
customer, and saves it in the confirm variable.
When it gets the response, the bot compares
the confirm value to the string &quot;Yes&quot;, and
if equal, completes the transaction.
You've seen how to create a simple customer
service bot that does nothing but take tshirt orders.
To make it more useful, you could, for example,
add the ability to take blue jean orders.
You'd do that by adding another intent, one
that allows the bot to know when the customer
wants jeans instead of shirts.
But for real usefulness, like providing the
customer with an order number, you need to
give the bot the ability to contact an API
to get that number, which you can learn in
the next video in the series.
