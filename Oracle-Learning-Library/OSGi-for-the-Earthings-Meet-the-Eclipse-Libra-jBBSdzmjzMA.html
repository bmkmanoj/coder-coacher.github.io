talk this is Murat I'm actually I'm not
all interested in I'm not my all my it's
always J is not all my daily job I do
from java ee to mobile and also I'm the
GDG leader of Istanbul besides I'm an
eclipse committer and working on the
eclipse zebra project also try to be a
conference speaker this talk was also on
last year java one actually there are
few less people so wonder if that means
or SJ is getting less popular or if the
session is late so by the way how many
of you are really using osgi on
databases cool so most probably you
might be more experience with the most
of the tools than me because i'm most
difficult focused on the eclipse
projects and mostly bruh i used to know
most of the tools when we first started
started the project but you might be
better with the modern tools so the
problem it was GI is it's just different
for the regular developers so when
someone jumps into the oyster world he
or she needs to be really spent some
time to understand osgi nature what's
good with OS j is it it's really good to
build muddler ups and since jigsaw is
left for Joe a nine
there's no real other way to build more
modular apps the OS japi is are quite
okay I mean it has been solid that
they've been around for so long and the
osgi container does most of the job
which you expect from such a runtime so
what I was Jack containers actually they
are the runtimes for osgi eps they
convert from symbian to enterprise some
popular ones are equinox which may be
more all of you are using tanks eclipse
Felix not the fish and actually they're
quite many there is also a new concept
Hawaii is a good candidate for osgi apps
because when compared to SGI joey is
really hard wired and it's not very
dynamic you need to restart with every
deploy the isolation is not really as
flexible as osgi so actual enterprise
osgi looks pretty interesting because
it's a those Jap programming model is
proven it's based on the standards it's
dynamic modular manageable so it's it's
it it really fits the enterprise world
and it supports the persistence
transactions it's good for distributed
programming and
you can do such distributed applications
and while building such applications you
can use a different OS jack containers I
think this one was from a pitcher Felix
this was the first demo which we I think
it was eclipsed cone we took some sample
applications but run some part of the
application which was the server part on
the UH pitcher Felix and move to the
client to the equinox so it really looks
for a good candidate for enterprise
enterprise applications so if everything
is good what's the problem it was Jack
why it's not that much popular well the
bad part is there are too many but still
not enough to if you used those tools
B&amp;amp;E bundler packs concierge they each
day each introduce their own way their
own nature and they have different
philosophies the cytoscape frameworks
are all so complicated they they are
they're tricky and you need to know how
to launch or configure each because they
there is a different from each other so
what's ugly widows jay is the
development is more complex it's not the
plane shower anymore so you can just put
a Java developer to Deutsche a verte and
expect the same productivity there are
many new concepts like bundles actuators
manifests and the class loading system
is totally different beside those each
tool
at its own behavior and complexity
different containers expect different
packaging and configuration some are
actually the slightest from Alex beloved
I think it was the earth jack conference
so ski not actually dislike 30 feet me
if it's me it's the five levels of osgi
when you first start with the or pink
osgi you start with the denial part this
won't work it was written by IBM right I
don't use eclipse I I just use netbeans
or IntelliJ so why will I use osgi was
jay is too complex then the anger part
comes my application only rounds if the
services starting disorder why does my
application work on equinox but not
Felix you come find find an answer it
take overflow or the internet then the
bargaining part why can't this bundle
see this class why am i getting the
class not found exception and goes on
then comes the depression part how do I
know that GD bc driver why doesn't my
custom log4j local doesn't work why do i
have to write manifest then you accept
nature of osgi and you start
understanding how bundles really work
how you can build services with dynamic
services and use remote services for
distributed systems you amazed with how
you can dynamic the upgrade the running
code and you started evangelize and
tweets and gives the talks about osgi
so actually the poor is the developer
because he needs to learn osgi way he
needs to learn the tools containers and
face the learning curve but actually
this problem is something we used to
have if you had me in developing web
applications like beginning of 2000 you
may remember each server has its own
configuration its own way to start
publish and run so before that you need
to develop your application to that
specifically to that server but with the
web tools platform and active server
adapters there is an abstraction with
the web projects and the servers so
suddenly we start building applications
without thinking of the servers which
they are going to run on so really they
need to reinvent the wheel for osgi
can't we just use the Baptist platform
and the way it uses to run projects on
servers with the Eclipse runtime and
probably Virgo and this became the
active sleeper a project you can
download there's a website for eclipse
in libra on the Eclipse website it's an
incubation but it was on the general
release it creates the wtp platform
which most of you are already familiar
for years PD and we'll go what's in
Libra to scope
is actually most of the frameworks and
most of the standards parts are not
included e abs are not included okay
this blueprint is included just a typo
most of most of the frameworks are
supported we're gorgeou mean I areas
Felix equinox and you can build Hawaii
apps web apps can use jpa use decorative
services and with general release
actually I this talk was on last year's
chihuahua and that time the tool set was
smaller with the general release we had
a bunch of new functionality we have the
osgi bundle facets which can just turn a
standard project into an osgi deployable
project and we have war products we have
the osgi frameworks adapters mostly
completed as I told you before it's
mostly adapted from the wtp adapters so
it's just like the web projects you just
right click and run on an osgi container
just like running on a tomcat or any
other web server we have the lunch
configurations a currently we support
physics equinox and nap der fish but I
can show you the coat and actually
writing an adapter will just take few
minutes the null official aptor was
written during a demo while we were with
a French team I believe but by that time
we had only adapters for physics and
equinox the guy who was using the nobler
fish showed me the configuration file
and
way knobler fish works and I just wrote
the adapter in like few minutes so the
adaptive framework is quite easy to
adapt to new runtimes it supports Gemini
which is quite nice you can just turn
web applications into ohi products or
you can run your osgi bundles as web
applications will go tools not yet
portrait in general is also there is the
framework editor the server console
bundle overview and dependency graphs
which I'll show you in the demo the
bundle projects are actually if we are
just interested in Eclipse and Eclipse
plugins you may already know Eclipse
just add some faces to the projects to
understand their natures for example a
web project just have the web faces so
Eclipse just knows this project can be
deployed on web servers so we just
follow that path now osgi bundles or
projects have the moisture bundle facade
so when you just click a web project you
can deploy it on a osgi container also
because there is a facet upcoming tools
can add their own behavior
we have the framework adapters as I
mentioned before we currently support
equinox Felix and other fish also with
the general release a full integration
with Gemini and jetty Kane we also have
some integration which areas if this
graph this screenshot may became may
seem very familiar it's just like the
server runtimes you can just add a new
osgi runtime and define an osgi runtime
instance from that run time so you can
just download an equinox or Felix but
just create few instances over that over
that installation bundle over wheels are
new you can check the bundles with given
with that framework and runtime a bundle
dependency view is also just released
with to generalize this may look
familiar with the maven plugin it used
to have such graph wheels as i remember
right actually it's based on the same
stuff gef and EMF so we can just use the
same views to show you the dependency
graphs since now we have the server
console shells we can just use this
shell to control the osgi framework
there's the integration with the bundle
repositories
virgo resolves two bundles from OB arts
also there are more product I don't know
if any of you are familiar last year we
had at them demo which was working but
now at least it's more stable more
product are actually bundles which are
which are packaged into war files which
are which can run by its own you don't
need any other osj container or any
other file everything is included in the
war so you can just get a plane Tomcat
installation and install your war file
on the server so more products can just
pack it your or existing bundle into a
war file which is pretty nice there are
few demos on the Eclipse IDE eclipse.org
/ libera i will show you some of the
demos I'll I won't just do them from
stretch but if any of you are interested
in more details we can check let me
okay actually this is my work space
which I built libera so these are the
projects as you can see there are some
projects related picture bundles related
to the platforms like equinox Felix
knopfler fish we had some poor journals
but not yet in the release yet so first
let me show you something from stretch
by the way you can just download the lib
record from eclipse repository and try
whatever you want
okay so
um
I'm sure you remember server runtime
environment it's just like installing a
new Tomcats instance you just choose
which osgi runtime osgi a container you
want the nice thing is you can just
download and install the list latest
version if you don't have it on on your
local drive and let me it should be on
my finder is not working
okay this at least libera is not failing
it's my quest well let me show you from
this one you just point your
installation and if the pet is not right
each adapter knows how to check if the
installation is right so it won't just
accept if the instance is not right so
configuring a new container is not
different than the server's you just
create a new one and if you have an
available bundled project it will be on
the available list which can be deployed
on the server so let me switch the demo
workspace
okay here i have two bundles actually
they don't too much it's just one
counter and let me show you the source
code the pink bundle of pinks the
counter and the counter just prints the
message i have several runtimes here as
you can see when i deploy the pink
bundle the counter bundle also comes as
a dependency from pink bundle so it's
just like a war file with the package
dependencies you can add any remove
other bundles actually the counter
bundle is here but since it's a separate
project you can still edit let's run
this one I don't don't worry about this
one I was just trying to new lump the
JDK and just messed up with my java home
the fedex runtime is running
my bundles are deployed you can just use
the standard comments
so it's not just really very different
than the servers and web projects okay
let me show you some other
okay this one actually this is a web
project but if you check the project
phases are there is also the osgi bundle
face it so now eclipsed libera knows
that they can be deployed as a bundle to
the container and this is a dynamic web
application and to create something like
that we can just
let me call it test projects test web oh
okay test projects
all I need to do is I direct osgi bundle
from here or choose the osgi web
application bundle next actually finish
so now you can see the money manifest is
ready with the dependencies and you can
just add a JSP file
let's call it index
and let's say
ok
let me remove one of the projects and
deploy mine instead
and run the server
our context is test application your
test projects and
yeah and you can just change something
ah
wrong wrong
it's just dynamically updated and you
can just add a servlet here and continue
building your application so my last
demo will be the war product which is
actually more fun
ok
okay this is my last demo what I have
here is actually a bonder bundle which
is an actuator but the activator
activates the HTML HTTP service and
registers the Charlotte and the HTML
page my servlet is just standard java
servlets and as you can see there is
dissolve just playing code sorry not
this one when I start the container
I should just reinstall the JDK
I think this one belongs to this hello
yeah and hello world HTML is the HTML
file he'll here let's make it java one
sample
go and we can use the servlet from this
one it's just a basic service again you
can just change it dynamically
ok it doesn't change dynamically well it
says republish so okay you need to
restart the runtime
it should be passed
by the way you can always use the
moisture council oh sorry wrong one you
can see the deployed bundles and you can
always double click the runtime and
exceed most of the views here are a new
and keen with the general release you
can see the modules in salt this is the
target platform there are 13 plugins
bundles which are deployed with this
platform so any a bundle deployed on
this run time will be available to use
those and we should we can see some
graph here there is also a console here
let me show you from the running one you
can just execute the comments here and
get the results so actually it's I'm
pretty down so if you have any questions
I'm
epic to answer
yep
sorry
from 22 latest version all versions are
supported also equinox from till the
latest version each version is supported
very
by the way if a particular version is
not supported just being me and I can
fix that it's quite easy because usually
most of the configuration stuff is
pretty much the same with the versions
so from version to version you don't
need to change much on the adapters it's
same with the tomcat adapter too usually
you don't change much so versioning is
not a real problem but if the plug-in is
the adapter is checking something like
the file size or something then with the
version change ascends then you may fail
the adapter will not accept a higher
version but usually we don't check such
stuff so it won't be a problem you can
even use the lower versions around
higher version adapter
arm
well it will be best with Juno you can
use one version back but jenna is the
real supported one actually there's a
there's a branch for indigo and you know
but Jenelle will be the safer ground
so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
