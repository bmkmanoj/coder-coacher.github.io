I'm going to first introduce a number of
people so I'd like to introduce bertran
belts are and our probably pronounced
his name totally wrongly so I apologize
and Gary Collins as well here so so and
this is going to be a joint arm and
Oracle presentation I will start as the
arm representative i'm andras loss and
i'm basically going to sort of talk
about sort of some road map pieces of
information and all and all of this just
really sort of an overview but a lot of
a lot of things have happened in the
last 12 months so I we sort of did this
talk this is probably a recap on the
talk we did last javaone and we just
sort of added new numbers and new pieces
because we've got new technology out but
some of the exciting stuff is that you
know we've now got full jdk on arm
released we have a c2 jet released on
arm and we have full Java 7 on arms so
basically we've gone from sort of what
what you would call a sort of tier 2
sort of Java player to really becoming a
first class citizen in the Java world so
so and I'm going to sort of hopefully
with this sort of star presentation
explain why because it's all about
numbers and where arm is going so so
hopefully that that part of the
presentation will explain that Bertrand
and Gary Collins will will will talk
about sort of more about the details and
demos and technology and pieces like
that so okay so first this is the
standard disclaimer I'm going to quickly
go over that so I'm going to sort of
talk about the sort of arm processor
roadmap some key features for the
embedded market will talk about sort of
the architecture in a bit more detail
and go over sort of some of the
interesting pieces that are coming out
of our so first sort of this is my idea
of marketing I like looking at numbers I
don't like the sort of you know pictures
and things like that this look at the
raw numbers of what what's happening in
the arm space so in basically in 2009
arm shipped about 4 billion chips so
that's individual chips that had arm
technology in them 2010 we had six
billion units shipped last year we we
just went under just under eight billion
units shipped so that's individual
pieces of a silicon coming out with arm
based technology so from a Java point of
view you know these are opportunities
they're basically compute engines that
can run Java technology on top where
your applications can run on top of the
JVM and all the rest so so you look at
them as opportunities and that's sort of
growing is quite a substantial number of
silicon doing that so the numbers of
process is shipped I think it's more
nearer probably 35 billion now but it's
definitely over 30 billion units out in
the world doing something it's either
controlling fridges or their phones or
you know whatever the embedded system
out there they cover so processor
licenses we have about 850 processor
licenses and that means we've licensed
our processor IP technology 850 plus x
two different people so whether it's a
very small processor or a much more
feature-rich processor with license
those out into the semiconductor
industry and semiconductor partners we
have around 290 plus semiconductor
partners and what does that mean well
there's probably in the low 300 number
is the total semiconductor industry so
we have licensed the majority of the
semiconductor industry and it's probably
easier to count who hasn't then who has
at this time so maybe I'll change that
that number at some point is to be on
the minor side so I'm process technology
you know or our world is all about
manufacturing producing devices
producing new edge devices you're doing
some of these sort of cheaper devices so
we have a broad range of process
technology so at the one end we've got
20 nanometer sort of technology we
showed a cortex a15 which is one of our
latest processes running in a
20 nanometers and then you've got 250
nanometers that sort of your
microcontrollers used to sort of measure
sort of power consumption and things
like that so you've so you have a sort
of cheaper end process technology or
manufacturing technology so that your
chips can be in other places and the
other important piece is right at the
end which is the connected community
members so arm really is a produces an
important piece of IP but really it's
the ecosystem that really builds arm out
into the into the marketplace and you
know instead of being a vertical player
we're very much through a piece of IP
out there and you've got ed a company's
you've got a higher operating system
companies you've got all the sort of
hardware semiconductor industry also
supporting and so in many ways to me
this is one of the most important slides
from an opportunity and a Java point of
view because they're Java can be used in
all sorts of different frameworks at
different parts of this system so it's
not just the embedded world is also eda
tools is also also infrastructure tools
all of these types of things so in there
okay so a bit of terminology I repeated
this last year but it's very important
to understand what what arm is talking
about so though we really have three
bits of major terminology so so there's
an architecture a process of micro
architecture and a processor hard macro
implementation when we talk about
architecture so we near the word
architecture arm v6 arm v5 arm v7 you're
talking about an architecture and
architectures are really software
contracts these are the the the
guarantee that the processor will
support these types of features like the
add instruction or or subtract on all of
these these are this is basically the
sort of design document of water what an
ARM processor should implement and
actually from a software point of view a
low-level software point of view the
architecture documents really the
important one the processor
microarchitecture is the sort of
pipelines as how you design a processor
so it implements an architecture but
it's the pipeline's is how you develop
the store
is this how you decide on how much power
is going to be taken the designers of
the microarchitecture have to sort of
design a processor basically and then
you've got the processor hard macro
implementation which is really a micro
architecture which has been laid out
into silicon so you've actually got it
you can manufacture it you can build it
so so there are three different types of
terminology an arm actually licenses all
three so you will have architectural
implementations which could be different
to an ARM processor but they'll
implement the arm instruction set or you
can have our own arm processors which
are the processor microarchitecture site
so you've got things like the cortex a15
and then you've got the hard my the
processor hard macro implementations so
that's sort of you're going to companies
like TSMC which are a manufacturing
plant which actually can build processes
so so from a software point of view even
though you have the same name of
processor or the same architecture that
can have very different characteristics
in performance that's really the major
important thing from a Java point of
view so a cortex a15 may not be the same
as a cortex 850 because they may decide
to do many different things many
different ways of manufacturing and
producing that product so the ARM
architecture sort of evolution so the
reason i'm going to show you this is to
show why why we add things why we do
things so in 1995 we have architecture
v4 which is quite old now but we
introduced a an instruction set called
thumb and the really the main driver for
that was that 16-bit memory was the
important piece 32-bit memory was
expensive 16-bit memory was sort of the
lower cost easier to get hold of and so
we developed an instruction set which
took advantage of being efficient on
16-bit memory so that was in 1995 in
1998 we introduced DSP media sort of
extensions and that was really the
movement to voice over IP so a lot of
companies wanted to build voice over IP
systems but didn't want to necessarily
have separate DSPs and expel
have extra pieces of hardware so we sort
of brought that into the processor so
that we could do voice over IP we kept
the thumb instruction set that kept
moving forward and so we had her arm bb5
we introduced in two thousand it's hard
to see but a technology called Giselle
because Java became important right so
so we had a Java was important for
phones and so the interpreter loop was
actually quite big and there's all about
cutting costs trying to reduce size
trying to increase code density so we
implemented a sort of way of actually
executing the simple java bytecodes
directly in the hardware so you reduce
that sort of interpreter loop but all
driven by sort of n customer
requirements so 2003 it really to me the
arm v6 architecture is the real stepping
stone between old and new worlds so
basically the old world was very much
about small things about you know trying
to do microcontrollers very much in that
small world arm v6 in 2003 is the
stepping stone where we move to a
different gear as a company we introduce
trustzone which was a is a sort of
security type environment where
basically you can think of it as the
33rd bit of an address line controlling
security so you can either have it on or
off and you can have access to different
secure elements we introduced NP
multiprocessing so this is really our
first SMP type world where we sort of
implemented the ability to have multiple
cores coherent in in in in a sort of
complex we introduce thumb tube which
was really trying to take the advantages
of the thumb world with code density and
II adding arm instructions which allowed
more flexibility and sort of better
performance and all of these other
things and so we sort of combined that
inner into an instruction set um two and
then a floating-point floating-point
started to become a real standard in the
arm v6 world and we had vfp v2 as a sort
of just second generation and four and
we introduced of simdi brick
starting to multimedia started to come
back up and we needed to have more
support first of doing multiple data
single single instruction type work so
and then if you go on to 2004 we
introduced arm v7 a we have to split the
architecture because we were starting to
support microcontrollers and and
high-end sort of application processes
and so we actually split the
architecture into three sort of variants
a RM a for application processes are for
real-time sort of hard real-time type
activities and m4 microcontroller and
I'm just going to focus on the 8th style
once and you know we introduced advanced
simdi which is more the traditional 128
bit so wyd simply because again
multimedia was the main driving force to
to actually extend the architecture and
that was 2004 going into a lot more
details on our arm v7 a you know so it's
a 32-bit architecture 32-bit virtual
addressing a physical addressing sports
SMP 124 cause trust own security
standard arm and thumb one and two
instruction sets neon and vfp sort of a
standard and l1 d cache coherency so
this list can go on and on and on right
sir but this is sort of some sort of
overview of what that is and that was
2004 2010 we sort of started adding some
extensions so this extensions to the
architecture what we tend to do is add
the extensions in an existing
architecture and then it gets folded in
to be a standard in the next
architecture coming along so we tend to
sort of add things so we added full
virtualization 40 bit physical
addressing that means you can sort of
address sort of one terabyte of range of
memory so instead of limited to the
32-bit size we expanded that we
implemented a hypervisor State two
levels of page table translation so we
basically implemented a full
virtualization system in the processor
so we're so the next generation
processes you see coming out of our
we'll all have full virtualization
capability whether companies choose to
use it as a their decision but it's
going to have it in hard way 2011 which
was last year actually we had to present
I had to present in Java one last year
before we announced this actually some
other questions in this event last year
was you know when you're announcing
64-bit so I had the uncomfortable bit of
saying that I you know I don't know but
I can now say it's released so we we
sort of brought everything on we've
moved to arm v8 all the tech / sort of
features of 32-bit world is moved across
to the v8 architecture and then we've
added a 64-bit architecture 64 bit wide
registers 32-bit instructions 30
registers and so basically we've sort of
added dense the sort of new generation
forearm is all on the 64-bit side and if
you want more details on that is it you
know there's quite a lot of details on
our website if you want to see that so
microarchitecture so I've gone through
the architecture side microarchitecture
side we've got current which is the arm
bb7 a and so we have really three in
that in that area you've got cortex a9
cortex a8 and cortex a5 cortex a8 is the
last you p processor traditional you p
single processor IP that we're going to
produce we're going where all of our
next generation all going to be SMP
we've got two styles got the blue and
the green basically green colored
processor which cortex a5 is to do with
high efficiencies to do with shorten
pipelines much more energy efficient
application processes the blue are much
more trying to take that performance to
another level while keeping under a
certain power budget so slightly
different emphasis you have a dotted
line between the a9 and the a5 that
represents the fact that you can run
code on the a9 and you can technically
move that operating system with very
little changes to the a5 so so it's a
sort of connection there's a connection
with keeping absolute compatibility
between the two processes and that's
important for the next stage so here we
are to what we're going to be seeing in
the next couple of years we announced
big dot little which is our concept
where we join two different types of
performance characteristic processes and
we combine them together and we've got
the a 15 and the a7 basically because
it's a joined-up line connecting them
you can actually move an operating
system on the fly from from an a 15 to
an a seven or an a7 back to an a 15
depending on workload requirements so
you're basically having dynamic
movements between two different
characteristics of processes so you can
take it from difference and if you've
got frequency and voltage you basically
with the high process with the high end
processor you can have that type of
range with a low end processor you've
got this lower type of range and
basically with these two little two
different types of processes you can
decide to have a connection between way
which processor you want to run the
workload on depending on you know
battery battery requirements performance
requirements you know and urgency and
all of these other requirements so so
basically that's that's our big dog
little there with a 15 and a 7 so I'm
going to finally wrap up and talk about
the age 15 there's lots of details you
can can read them I'm not going to go
down all of them but they basically
include all the sort of arm v7 a
extensions like virtualization act
setting to one terabyte of data
trustzone all of these sort of real
features and what you're seeing really
with this processor is a lot of new
technology Balam is bringing in with
instruction level parallelism and and
really sort of concentrating on the
performance side as well and this is
allowing arm to start moving further
apart so we've got at the low end we've
got microcontrollers there really are
sort of dealing with sensors and things
like that and at the high end you're
starting to see arm sort of moving into
the server world with these types of
technologies like the 815 because it has
the sort of performance and all of those
pieces so so really you're seeing arm
sort of expanding the range of
applications that can be developed with
and Java can run on both the server side
and and the census I do that as well so
at that I'm going to pass on to Bertrand
who's going to cover more of the Java
side of the wall
sanks on roof just what is important to
know first is that even if on to say
that I'm b5 initially was for
microprocessor you can learn that I see
embedded on arm v5 but what will you
will be able to do that event of the
binary was compiled for md5 we will
dynamically detect without an arm fistic
on the seven on the add extra feature to
get more performance out of it so the
main drawback of md5 was both
synchronization on the access of
pointers to loaded with an axe aesthetic
fear something like that just with um v6
you will get all the benefits of the el
direction is 2x instruction to get
better synchronization primitive whose
are key to java if you go to md5 the
main benefits in addition to the move
team move w instruction which avoids you
need to own their literal pools which
are bit complex on next programming a
bit other for the low-level arm
programmers it's also benefits about
memory buyers and memory plus a for
multiprocessor story which are way more
efficient in arm v7 and are easier to
use this hour estoy slide thus we
started very early initially with just
embedded version of java running on arms
that was the CDC on CL DC configuration
which were really what we call Jeremy
that was very early in 2001 and then we
notice that a lot of good embedded
customer were interesting the full
feature of java SE and 12 them and their
arm devices as we started to work on
what is called Java Sea embedded and
that will be the main purpose of this
talk because we started that with the
one word for two version in 2007 and
then we the timber we were able for just
we skipped Java five and we were able to
deliver six but we're a bit late with
respect what was done on on the entire
process own spot processor on one of the
big news for 7 is that we were able to
deliver the arm darshan
sank with interns pack version just we
are improving our corporation with a
Java C team to try to get you to best
benefits of Java Sea on arm as soon as
possible we also deliver this year for
the first time that I see there isn't on
arm without the ability world that's
important for some people that's really
the first thing our proposed willies you
can use know that you have big arm
server which can be used as desktop
machine several machines you have the
same licensing demo I will come back to
that later but it was quite interesting
for people wanting to use a raytheon arm
just like I said before we were since
last year on sync with Intel inspired
every reason thus we deliver a full
feature of Java 7 on arm that includes
for instance in vogue dynamic also new
language enhancements all the data API
you will get with jela 7 or the support
for multiprocessor on addition to that
that would just be a poor to arm will
sort some specific work to make survey
zmbt better suited to embedded system
just we have a lot of walks ball around
reducing both the static footprint of
the vm the binary size and also the
memories that will be dynamically
consumed we also have some improvement
to reduce the power consumption removing
some sweat that will be very painful
painful on some devices forcing you to
consume power continuously on one of the
big news this year was the release of
records of a midi treat 7 dot OS no
bundle with a vm you can also get a lot
of oracle out where to be able both to
stir that are locally efficiently using
java DB but also have all the stuff
necessary to discuss with the cloud and
Sons of that towser's you have jay-z and
you also have some of a grizzly stuff if
you want to know more about that the
radio station and its which might be
interesting for you so serve asiana ama
this what we just released with seven
new six was the first general-purpose
released will sorry general purpose line
binaries just studied before what it
means is that no if you you have the
same license in terms of this binary as
for the author's other platforms park on
Intel but I will not go into the detail
of their licensing but basically what is
important in general purpose the snow
you can have the JDK not just a JRE you
have a real GD k which we can run
beagleboard one about westbury is a lot
of the coolster that is coming on now
part of this improvement for a bit of
support of java SE on arm was to work on
service ability to improve the debugging
experience on also to continue working
on the server compiler that was
delivered last year to prototype and i
will come back to that the next slides
what is important to know that we work
closely with arm to be sure you can get
a good experience with gel on arm as I
said C to the server compiler it's no
longer experimental we know support it
just for people who are not familiar
with a jit technology in Java we have to
compile our client compiler called see
one on a server compiler called C 2 C 1
is mainly for a quick stuffed up shot
application on does not do a lot of
optimization it's quite simple c 2 is a
more complex compiler trying to reach
the best performance we can get on the
vm on this arm is the only platform on
the only embedded platform for which we
support c2 we don't do yet for instance
on powerpc this it has things like
improve locking mechanism to reduce I
guess I before the cost of
synchronization what we noticed when we
switch to c 2 is that we were able to
see some performance gain from 22 from
19 to forty percent which is quite
important in the other world so a bit
more details on client on server the
cycle like i said before the client vm
is more for desktop green short
application but if you have a cell vm
and want to run long application or if
you have a big nifty credit application
you are you will be more interesting in
the cellar of the m's us with the c2
compiler but what is new
so not really knew it started one or two
years ago is what we call the tiered
compilation it's a way to mix both
client and server compiler to get the
best out of the vm as basically you will
start the application using the client
compiler which compiled quite fast but
doesn't get you very good god and in the
long term the code will be improving you
will go to see to as this is the goal we
still have work to do until compilation
to make it safe tuning we saw in some
cases some performance degradation with
steel computations that's why it's not
turn on by default we have a lot of
projects won't work to do with on arm to
further improve them per the performance
and also the usability of the vm we have
some arm v7 specific announcement don't
see too i will not go into the detail
what one thing is important to know that
c2 compiler is only supported for arm v7
we don't support it for arm v6 or arm v5
but we continue to improve it we are
also working on supporting the upload a
bi which means for those who are not
familiar there are different ways to
call proceeded on different systems on
when you use the upload API you can use
a floating point register to pass wedges
to pass arguments and it can be more way
more efficient for instance for
graphical internship applications on
some operating systems know are moving
from soft float on arm which was a
general use case a few years ago they
are starting more nor to move to add
float so it's well working on delivering
out for binaries so that you can use
Java with upload API on these systems we
are also starting to take advantages of
the same two codes that was introduced I
feel numb v6 but we do not really use it
before we will not change it to generate
some to code but we would like to
compile the vm with some too because the
code size of the vm itself will be way
smaller the podcast can also be improved
by that owns it can both improve silent
in some cases improve
put for stuff that you don't use very
often as I said before we are also
working on kill compilation we started
to experiment garbage first garbage
collector on this is still on
experiments the garbage first collectors
were really targeted at big Apes thus
you have to know whether it will be
fitted for service imbd don't to work on
the tuning to get it right I'm also
starting to look at 64-bit support but
what is important with java SE embedded
is that not only will you get all the
benefits of what we do an arm you will
also get all the benefit of what is done
on the java SE side to improve the vm
just for instance we hope to improve
startup time by different mechanism
startup time is also a big topic for the
for that I see one of the things who are
considering is for instance the use of
compile podcast which is a way to keep
the code to use it on a ladder run
without having to recompile it some form
of weight of time compiler which are
also other projects going on a one in
startup time we are also continuing to
improve the footprint both the size of
the binary on the memory that is
dynamically consumed I don't know
whether you saw the presentation of the
key dorchester day from Bob Valdez but
he gave the new numbers that that was
doing when we have currently on the one
we are targeting we were hoping to make
very fast progress by leveraging the
jigsaw steps that were supposed to come
with divide but that was delivered to
nine but we are still the seven if we
are not able to immediately go to jig
saw what we were able to do with the
rising to come to a compromise on to
have something we will be able to use
bathroom modularity to add some way to
reduce a binary Silas that's in fact
part of what we call CDC on AC
convergence we have in fact a lot of new
ideas of people coming from the CDC vm
seeing which ideas i can add to the java
SE vm to further improve it for Java Sea
embedded and this is a talk that will be
given by Bob round eight if you want
more information on modularity on what
we are doing to reduce binary sizes in
addition to that we are also
reporting we are also working on
embedded ethics in fact the demos you
will be able to see on the playgrounds
there are some demos about FX running on
top of an um embedded board on you also
have civil war token that you are
interested in that part but basically is
a graphics tag from Java ethics can be
way more efficient than said less than
sorry autumn swing just boasting time of
binary size and in term of memory
dynamically consumed this before going
to the demonstrations that will be made
by kerry collins i just want to tell you
that we are very early in the conference
as you have time enough to go see a lot
of different stuff if you are thirsty
eaters if you go at the playground you
will see some demonstration about Java
Sea embedded both showing javafx on
number 37 plus you will you can learn
more mobile data there is also a lot of
other stones you can go to to see Emily
device my finger lot of them will show
you our devices in addition to that this
year for the first time there is a
special part of rather one called Java
on bday that Jarrah wonders on we did
into the other one it's mainly on
Wednesday on Tuesday most of the session
about java SE embedded will be on that
part of the java one conference but i
did you start at least for today if you
want you have if you are really
interested in july samba did the two
things related to jealousy embedded
today both the tutorial on the on some
lab so switch tutorial is really i think
just next door and the unsub labs well
you have time to see why it is so i will
know switch to the demonstration by gary
collins on letting introduce the
demonstration we're going to Mike
I can just sit so before it before i get
into the the demo part of the
demonstration basically you know what
just a quick question across the
audience how many here actually develop
on ARM processors or using embedded java
Wow quite a bit of hands how many here
actually what develop on a raspberry pi
or have heard about a raspberry pi cool
yeah it's a quite a compelling little
platform developing on this little bored
here it's a Raspberry Pi it's an arm v6
broadcom chip 256 meg it's a great
little development kit $35 if
proof-of-concept device if you have an
applications already on intel processor
or some other kind of a processor to
actually just go try it out on an arm
device it's actually pretty compelling
product $35 is v6 base but it at least
can get you in the door and playing
around and then try all the devices as
you scale up your application so what
I'm actually here is going to talk about
is I'm going to be running a demo on the
arm beasts an RV 7 system it's a cortex
a9 dual-core well quad core basis dual
cortex a9 chips on it running linares 10
dot 10 using our just released jdk 7 you
six linux gtk forearm we've had a lot of
people in the community of asking for a
jdk actually having so they can be
actually to develop on the platform and
deploy on the platform whereas most
embedded fashion people to actually
develop on a x86 box and deploy to their
device or the edge device so we're going
to be showing here today is how do
benchmark running the pterosaur
benchmark on on top of Hadoop so I'm
going to kind of
bring the window
so on this screen here is basically just
the pterosaur benchmark actually running
it takes a long time to actually
generate data so i started this about an
hour about 45 minutes ago so it's going
through a second iteration run right now
of doing a MapReduce of the pterosaur
benchmark pterosaur benchmark is
actually a pretty cool benchmark for for
kind of like benchmarking so to speak
your cluster setup and so you can
basically compare yourself against other
deployments of an arm cluster system
using the Hadoop it with the pterosaur
benchmark so this is just a quickie run
of actually running a live data over
here on the left side is actually a
bunch of jobs actually running if you
notice there's a lot of dash server runs
in here this is an ARM Cortex you know
887 system running and it's running a
lot of tasks so over in this window here
is basically where it started if you see
the first blue line on the top right
window where it says memory um being
used was just a ganglia process which is
the this view of what we're looking at
is actually a data being captured from
Hadoop and displayed in a meaningful
fashion here it's basically the first
blip is about five minutes was ganglia
just running because they wanted to see
when gangly have stopped and then Hadoop
started so the next flip up was where
Hadoop was actually running in its
memory utilization is happening and then
the next one right around 10 35 or so is
when Hadoop kicked in and actually
starting to actually do the MapReduce of
the memory it this is basically the node
that we're running on it's an imx6 and
this all this data is actually being run
on the system and at the same time
actually showing it through the ganglia
setup so it's just a bunch of different
data points in here there's a JVM
section in here
talking about the garbage collections
Mary being used down here so you can see
the GC times and Millie's you can
actually see the non heap committed and
just a bunch of other results in
threading and the helmet how much time
you spend waiting and such that's about
it on the the demo it's just more of a
point of you know I went from this small
device which is just a single core to
actually another device not too much
different except for this one has a SATA
disk and the quad-core chip is right
here with the memory so it's a pre scale
imx6 board that's about it so pitron
songs go oh yeah
this it's time for the Q&amp;amp;A session is
where ample time for that what about our
product line of java embedded if you're
interested feel free to a sufficient
now I think you saw the disclaimer /
it's a sudden that entitled to give
indeed for that but we are working
actively on that as one of our top
priority
any other questions
I didn't hear the question sorry
program
servation abilities we fully compliant
with services as you will get all the
FBI java zombie deeds that you will get
on Gervase we have both of full-fledged
features supporting the graphic API if
you want but we have also at last
version of Java embedded if you are not
interested in the order graphic stuff
but we do deliver the full-fledged
version if you want to on the long-term
we also intend to work on delivering
full-fledged version with also in
delivering a version with just a VFX
that is sufficient for you RPI which
will be smaller size as a full-fledged
graphical stuck on still delivering
Atlas version but we'll be trying to
form or modularity being able to deploy
what you really need
it was a question
twirl in the morning people are still
jet lag for this coming from four hands
over sized part and you can always ask
us aria could you speak louder please is
asking eliminating the operating systems
that we have enough plants or such at
least not in our room there were a lot
of shall always project in the past I'm
not aware of any project at least within
our groups on my projects where I maybe
even or even inside Oracle in the labs
are not sure but that's not highest
priority we often even if people run
java programs they won't still be able
to use some magic button if you go to
otherwise i'd i've been a lot of project
one that which are not really easy
because people want to transition slowly
from the native code to jela and if you
could otherwise you have to do
everything on java at once this that's
one of the reason my opinion which
otherwise was not a big success before
it may come but not for mochi
thus we deliver binaries for linux we
also i think deliver binaries for
Windows Embedded and then it's possible
to go to the spot contractor to go to
the engineering support to get
additional ports which are done using
Oracle just we always about going on for
particular customers but there is a
binaries you can get into download size
of for linux
sorry
ok could you spit load up is
the Java Sea embedded is not yet
delivered on Android these are some
constituent on on the wage system with
respect to the way you can deliver
application and deploy them and we have
not cheated well then off
and your question
I think that for on droid we made of CDC
available I'm not sure off on droid
there may be some special flavor of the
JVM but low on java any device is
already available and devices like
android an oasis like envoy but not
judge Ric on buddy if you go to the demo
grounds there's a lot of hedge devices
for micro devices and scaling up so you
should be able to see a lot of
demonstrations of different types of
deployments
that was like correct understand its own
no digits come from service in general
you have these two Jet's inside the I'm
sorry inside the internals back support
that's what we usually call yourself out
the mm the client VN but more and more
with the altar powerful desktop we know
of we do actually use the seller William
which is automatically started but we
are working both I see embedded on
jealousy and improving shield
complication to will benefit from the
fact that we have to compile of
technologies which can work together to
improve the experience on both improve
startup time on long-term support yeah
correct when I stated it just worked
from home currently for salvation
believers it was an endurance part but
for salvation BD we only supported for
the ARM version of Java embedded we
don't support it for powerpc intercept
understand you use case I mean if you
use dash server and you're running a
desktop app that might not be advisable
where's hadoo it makes use of the server
vm and that's what I'm actually running
here and that's the JDK version that i
mentioned actually has server and client
in it
and here's a question
and we're about all week so if you have
other questions and you see us yeah just
ask songs everyone for attending and if
you want to ask private kitchen don't
hesitate and comment aqueous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
