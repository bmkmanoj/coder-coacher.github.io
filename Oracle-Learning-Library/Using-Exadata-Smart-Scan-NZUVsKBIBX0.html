entitled using exadata smart scan my
name is Peter few SEC and I will be your
tour guide for this demonstration the
first part of this demonstration will
examine various Exadata smart scan
statistics and measures that can be
observed within Oracle database we'll
start off by connecting to the database
and we'll set the environment up so that
we can see the execution plan for our
sequel statement we can see timing
information now we'll execute a query
that will use smart scan so here you can
see the results for the query note the
elapsed time was a little over six
seconds smart scan is indicated for this
query by the table access storage full
operation you can also see that the
where clause predicate cussed valid
equals a can be evaluated by exadata
next we'll examine some statistics
associated with the current session
because the earlier query on the
customers table was the only query that
conducted real IO during this session we
can safely assume that the statistics
relate to that query the statistics show
that approximately 288 megabytes of i/o
was performed to scan the customers
table and that all the i/o was eligible
for smart scan the statistics further
show that smart scan returned less than
two megabytes of data back to the
database server or in other words smart
scan reduced the amount of i/o
transported to the database server by
more than 99% compared with what would
have been required using non Exadata
storage next we'll examine the cell
weight events associated with the
current session note that there's only
one cell weight event listed that's cell
smart table scan
note also that the amount of time
associated with that weight event
accounts for nearly all of the execution
time for the query that we ran earlier
this is quite normal for a query that
uses smart scan so examining these
statistics and weight events associated
with the query we ran earlier indicates
that the query did make efficient use of
Exadata smart scan just as the query
execution plan suggested in the next
part of this demonstration we'll
consider a scenario where the query
execution plan indicates the use of
smart scan but the statistics and weight
events
suggest something more in the second
terminal window we'll establish another
sequel plus session and in the second
session we'll execute an update
statement which updates almost half of
the records in the customers table now
the update is completed but we'll leave
the transaction in this second terminal
window uncommitted for now back in the
first terminal session we'll reconnect
the database to establish a fresh
database session as the SH user next
will re-execute the sequel query from
before this time when the query executes
you'll notice that the query execution
plan indicates the use of smart scan
notice also that the execution time has
increased substantially compared with
before the execution times gone from
roughly six seconds to over 27 seconds
let's take another look at these
statistics and weight events to see
what's happening looking at these
statistics we see that this time the
same amount of i/o was eligible for
smart scan however substantially more
data was returned by smart scan that
numbers gone from less than two
megabytes to over 116 megabytes and
likewise the amount of data transport
across the interconnect has gone from
less than two megabytes to more than 145
megabytes
when we take a look at the weight events
we again see a very different picture
compared with last time this time a
significant amount of time is associated
with the cell single block physical read
weight event this is because the
uncommitted update transaction has
forced a substantial number of reads to
be transferred to the traditional buffer
cache read consistency path notice also
where most of the time is being spent
this time 21 point six seconds is
associated with the Cell single block
physical read weight event that's the
majority of the little more than 27
seconds that the entire query took to
execute so clearly the efficiency and
performance of smart scan was
compromised by the pending transaction
in the second part of this demonstration
we'll look at a couple of different ways
that you can monitor the cell weight
events when parallel query is used so
once again we'll login via sequel plus
and set up our session and this time
we'll configure it so that parallel
query is forced then we'll Reax acute
the same sequel query that we've been
using throughout the demonstration this
time the query execution plan shows the
use of parallel query and it also shows
the use of smart scan looking at these
statistics we see essentially the same
numbers that we saw right at the
beginning of the demonstration when
smart scan was working efficiently when
we look at the weight events we see
there are none associated with the
current session so what happened well
because parallel query was used the
query i/o was performed by parallel
execution servers the associated weight
events are then connected with those
parallel server
not the current session note that this
behavior is symptomatic of parallel
query and is not exadata specific so
when parallel query is used the weight
events must be observed differently one
way to examine the weight events is to
use a different set of statistics this
query shows the cell weight events
across the entire database instance so
if you execute this query
look at the weight events then execute
whatever operation you're interested in
monitoring re execute the instance level
cell wait events query and then compare
the before statistics with the after
statistics in order to isolate the
weights for the operation in between
using system level weight event
statistics is a simple way to monitor
parallel query weight events as long as
you're the only user on the system and
you do not want to monitor concurrent
operations often this is not the case so
in the final part of this demonstration
we'll look at another method using trace
files which can be used to isolate the
weight events associated with a specific
parallel query operation regardless of
concurrency while I've been talking
we've executed a query to determine the
default trace file for the current
session we need to take note of this
because the directory path leading up to
the trace file will also be the default
location for other trace files next we
can use the DBMS session set identifier
procedure to set a client identifier in
this case pq1
for the current session the client
identifier will help to locate trace
information associated with the current
session and any parallel query servers
that perform work on behalf of the
current session finally we can use the
DBMS monitor dot client ID trace enable
procedure
to start recording trace information for
the pq1
client identifier notice that weights
equal true is specified to ensure that
weight information is recorded in the
trace files after tracing is enabled you
can execute whatever operations you wish
to monitor in this case we'll just reax
acute the same query as before when
you're finished you can stop the trace
by executing DBMS monitor client ID
trace disabled now to see the weight
events it's a relatively simple matter
of finding the appropriate trace file
firstly we need to change into the
directory where the trace files are
located then we can use the grep command
to find trace files that contain the
client identifier PQ one that we set up
earlier during the database session in
this case you can see that three trace
files have been discovered the first one
on the list is associated with our
sequel plus session while the last two
are associated with parallel query
slaves that performed work in our behalf
finally when we examine one of the
parallel query server trace files we can
see that it contains the cell smart
table scan wait events that are
associated with our parallel query that
concludes the demonstration thanks for
