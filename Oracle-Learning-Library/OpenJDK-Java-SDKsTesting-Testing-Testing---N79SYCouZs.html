say I'll run okay we're going to talk
are resisting up JD gate we're in oracle
mrs. main Shrek thank you we're all
ready for putting my tune to first
napkin and I'm going to tell very very
little bit of how it is cheating here
because of the time limitation and I
should start should start with that
thank you for coming this late you know
there is a party going on right now
right anyway wherever pretty big a
quality organization and this is quality
organization spread across the wardroom
go west to east from san francisco to be
gene most people be in san francisc
sonic park most people been in santa
clara and separately work where i'm from
myself and a bunch of smart people ok
testing testing jdk I going to talk a
little bit about the development
milestones for GD k 8 especially in
india in the view of what it means for
us poor quality more than actual
development milestones so there are m 12
m 54 be driven milestones what we do in
it we run our promotional testing which
help explain later where it is it takes
a week with 22 actually to run all this
on the support of the platforms which is
selected for execution then there is the
result development developers preview
upcoming events feature complete coming
shortly after feature complete test
feature complete is coming which is more
des de vitesse competitor
complete more or less except of course
there could be bak speaks later and have
taught just the test later as well then
the Developer Preview Developer Preview
we testing intensively you know there
could be bark the amount of testing
where is he cute nad is significantly
more than for promotion basting right
actually when when I started talking
about the milestone is the most
important milestone is this development
is the most part of laundry that's
developing much this institution so
bye-bye the test test development
complete most of the box which are now
platform dependent which are not
intermittent failures are likely to be
fine found already made and then oldest
run starts this is a long process takes
six seven eight weeks aware execute all
the tests and also for different
configurations it's called ATR of this
trunk then we hit the zero background
it's like there's razor cut fries and
boxed getting fixed fixed fixed and for
deferred right and then we should be
zero value and start bouncing on this
day whether that's the zero Bachman and
after death after some time is ready to
be released this is a oracle release
multimodel very different from what we
use to heaven Thunder this what we have
okay and then the final release
candidate to issue of course retest
thoroughly as thorough as we possibly
can right running down so the kind of
stuff we do first of all there is a
regression to see you guys know about it
it's an open-source aside
k tests there is a comparable number of
tests in close relation to see right we
are working on it and i'll be talking
about it later and then there are
functional tissue it's four separate
parts of GDK we have the streets say
security say hey WTS peace and that for
every part there are some times q
different this is unfortunately with
different setup and different data
structure and different harnesses image
do we work in aliens but no the area to
all together some hundreds of thousands
of tests when I'm counting tests are
racial counting unit is so this is a
piece of source which could have a
status fail or vice right it's the
minimum the many more such peace it
could be a director is a few files could
be filed to be method within Jail file
depending on the test or misuse so
that's the hundreds of thousands of this
then of course we use conformance we use
it like performance testing and of
course we use it for a functional
testing this bunch of bunch of
functionalities exercise with cheesy
carriages on the natural then we have
performance tests hundreds of test cases
micro benchmarks then of course the
important point is when it did this
development we're playing a guessing as
to how the GD kale going to be used
right we're using a spec we're using our
brain smart people remember and trying
to guess how it's going to be used
however well we do our job we want to
provide that it is indeed used the way
we test it for the real usage doesn't
find any parts so what you can do here
we can take real
products which we do such as Big Ups of
these 1 120 hours to the mistake for few
weeks where happening for two weeks on
five heavy load some j2ee publications
just to see that it really lives right
that long way is dumped at weblogic and
we use clients implications as well from
letting g3 applications netbeans a cliff
sorry probably one of the biggest out of
the known by latest applications right
now their client applications with John
accessibility are going to the depth
j-11 n with which stands for l10n and i
18 n together right everybody knows what
that is I contract localization and
internationalization and this is
globalization different countries we
have team in japan why wasn't that of
his like I don't know anyhow anyhow we
have a team in japan who helps us with
their bi-directional buddhism there
remain 0 deaths and a tomato paste we do
have some penalties for a client now I
was going to promise to explain
different levels of this time understand
I it's our happiness anyway so this is
one of the possible are schemers of how
it is done it is done differently for
different components when the needs of
the components of the kinds of the test
Suites and the number of this in nightly
pizza which stands for pre integration
testing or which is software acceptance
testing it may or may not have all these
steps and the Rose can go different
actually sometimes because for update
releases it's like totally different but
the concept here is that we do two
levels to the prison levels of testing
the reintegration test when this is what
a software sickness testing this they
are stable so there are other it goes on
it down to the products problem we
rarely see any problems with this then
we do the full testing there will be
some problem system test code so we file
box be so that way fix them for
integration or nightly is executed
nightly short so you will fit it in few
hours shut this cycle and it goes for
and over again until we good now right
of course we don't do it manually
that'll be crazy so actually what we
have is an j2ee application where we
plan our execution we create like a test
suite across the platforms etc close the
browsers or you know windows look and
fields of these of death whatever
depending on the component and there
isn't send to the execution engine Flynn
so we click it goes out they are finds
itself machine right thank you post
results to the result original base
after some time in welcomes him just
going see what's going on right it's not
for free it's a homegrown stuff all the
way through we use different harnesses
who is we write the JT application which
I was talking about we write the
recently
former we are developers developers who
is testing because the true way today's
Java is the right code in job naturally
for us development is not too expensive
as will be four different artistic team
of some other for the product of some
other kind so some numbers 10 already
and so Knightly pretty shirt is acutely
done a few platforms sometimes just one
platform sometimes rotating
pre-integration tasting a little bit
bigger when needed right sort yet bieber
executed differently like i said
component per component differently in
different times different place in the
integration schema then promotion comes
it takes a week or two right number of
this significantly more almost
everything some tests take more than one
with two runs when we may exclude some
stuff out of it we're rotating platforms
always because that would be crazy to
panic on all the platforms every time
and then the AGR which takes six to
eight weeks right we ran all the
combinations such as all the supported
browsers on every supported platforms
but this is this is a lot and that is it
with that i pass to Paul Buddhist
difference d
thank you I'm not going to add them to
pull because we're doing the hora for
style presentation which is to have lots
of speakers so I just kidding
and a book of thing
yes but
doesn't want to that
that will do is good enough definitely
oh oh gee
thank you sir
just down in it so those who don't know
zovem my name is both ways and I'm the
assurance test lead for java rate so
when we when i get spilled from java
bills from oracle they have already been
thoroughly tested so we I BM build on
that testing so that when we do deliver
a quality vm it's it is sufficient
quality so we in terms of the testing
that we do we have hundreds and products
available that I've been products that
we test on and there we provide to our
customers and so essentially the Java
that we test goes into all these IBM
products the tests that we've run are
going to do and go into in a second but
we do 10 tens of thousands of tests we
also look at the tests are available and
open source community in particular I'll
just bring out a few we retest staff
actually I do so we do run directly
tests on that because we want to make
sure that when IBM delivers a Java to
enjoy it to our customers that is going
to work with an Apache Hadoop and also
we we run our various tests on the
various scripting languages that are the
moment because description languages
have their own tests which we download
and run those on IBM Java the aim here
is to is to effectively cover the the
whole of the Java API in the testing
that we do is listed here my team
concentrates on system test there so the
more complicated scenarios associated
with quality assurance this is the type
of testing that we do it's it's it's
good big we've so I'm just call out a
few we won the Derby test suites across
all the platforms IBM sports we weave
when I 02 came into Java 7 we wrote to
test week to test an arrow to
specifically with this morning
that AI x and z we needed to make sure
that it works on agency in IBM platforms
now this is the pop the problem we have
is that if you look at what our
customers are using to how our customers
are using Java they have huge heaps they
are running many thousand up to
thousands of threads making machines
terms of cause we IVM offer for garbage
collectors so they need to be thoroughly
tested so when you add all that up
that's a massive combination of
different types of tests and I have here
some some lovely numbers so here we vet
silly wants you because of the test
cycle that we have we and we end up
having by running the holder to build
budget of tests on every build where we
have many test machines and many
platforms on those test machines when
you'll be added or effectively events on
to be millions of tests and the problem
is in all of those / air pass so how do
you how do we work out of those that
didn't pass how many there's a defect
and so on what we ended up doing is that
we've we have similar to what sure I was
talking about an automatic system and in
order to get all testing that we do we
have a we effectively are rolling
testing 24 by 7 i'm speeding up a bit so
we could go a bit more time so the way
that the testing is done is that we we
have an assembler system suit oracle in
terms of the tests are all over on
automatically 24 by 7 and results are
collected and the affair user analyzed
defects are raised and defects fixed and
so on so it's it is an automated system
if the you look at the global machine
pool I'm here we have 100 machines as it
in there running tests all the time so
openjdk activities so this is this is
great our Oracle an IBM thoroughly touch
java the problem we have is that the
tests that we have typically can't we
don't know can't be consumed by the
community and so the the challenge we
have is that's given the fact that the
numbers of tests are available is small
we we want to be able to never want to
be able to write more tests so asking
you to help us what we want what we need
to be able to define a set of standard
test standards to use we need to
identify some frameworks so it have any
agreement in which framework we want to
use and the even though so if once we've
done that we still need to understand
which areas the openjdk actually needing
tests so we were actually concentrating
on the right type of there in the right
api's and then once and then once we
have the tests where are we going to put
these tests that's that's an important
question that we need to answer the
third party test Suites is what we know
IBM run there's Java out there there are
tests out there why aren't we as a
community will in these and Jose Jose a
daily thing or whatever because is that
they are there we should be used then we
use the test or do that and then once a
test run we need to be able to report
the results in an open way so that
everyone can see the results this slide
here really just talks about what we
consider to be a decent test I turned
the yak name first fast independent
reputable more transparent we are
talking here about
Union tests the the main the domain
knowledge needs to be kept to a minimum
and and it has to be well documented so
what we want to do is do is have an
agreement in the community of what
defines a test the third party
application tests I've talked about this
and also I won't really go into much
detail here they do points about these
testers they tend to come with a
friendly license so you can download
them and run the tests they they within
the testing the we've done they have
helped find some some bugs with
intestine that we've done and it is a
java that we can use to throw out the
and openjdk if it's appropriate to do so
so in summary of IBM and oracle test
java and we do deliver a core very
quality build to to customers but the
tests can't be communicated can't beat
you contributed so we need a way of
engaging with the community to help us
him Elvis all visible so yep well
so yeah unfortunately slides yeah of
course besides that I think given though
we're making this very dynamic I think
it would just be worth touching us and
the pool talked about very quickly so
you saw we've got our recruiters was
testing I've emphasis and it's all great
fantastic we have billions and trillions
of testing large quantity but we can't
contribute them you're going to say
Wi-Fi can contribute them right and
they've made the main reason is is that
the Providence of the tests right so if
you're a developer and you're
contributing code this real focus on
whether the code that you're
contributing is yours to contribute when
you're a tester what you're trying to do
is enough workout you're trying to make
sure that you that you're preventing
regressions so the types of tests that
use and when they come from maybe
customer related they leave very
specific so it gets very hard for you to
say I've got some I've got a test I want
to contribute because it may be
something you can use internally but
generally they're also equal to it so
when we would start ins exercise both
companies were looking hard about
whether we can contribute the test cases
and believe me we've tried very hard to
figure out whether we could actually
take all this wonderful stuff we're
going to give it to open to any K and
the simple answer is we can't do that
right so i think it's worth pointing out
this isn't us saying of God do this this
is we worked hard it's not possible yeah
Providence
team
with the pedigree
okay so yes and that may be because
specifically we know we can't contribute
it in other cases we going we're not
sure yeah yeah yeah and and got it and
the third thing exit to be honest is
also the fact that some of these test
cases are very implementation-specific
so this whole sets of reasons that say
let's not say that we don't have some
that we can't contribute but if you look
at the number test compared to the whole
it's actually very small yeah so I'm
talking to both of us yeah yeah yeah
yeah okay so you've got some more tests
okay right let's just see whether we can
drag the theology yes remaining a bit I
am just the compound sorry Chris
come on so that would force was doing
was getting the mic first video there is
four o'clock Java and lock works just
the same as the same platform for us as
everything else
I'm afraid I can't answer of it how do
businesses this is a man so we we do
have some portion of slides of how you
can help right I will not stop here we
do have an instructions our rather
asking you to do is the way you develop
your test what guidelines to follow
right no platform specific stuff be
careful with resources there are
hundreds of tests because you live in
the same vm forcibly right shared vm pls
and multiple execution on the same
machine ever seen this at the same time
talk to us basically in a nutshell talk
to us if anything on documentation
whatever right and this is the portion
which i wanted to talk about you guys
probably heard about the open open GTG
scorecard and there are some items
related to test different testing on it
we are taking them we are working on
them right we're gonna what step by step
we can ofcourse fix the pages no problem
about them and test execution that is
what the stuff which we execute we're
going to publish test results in numbers
and also be numbers of testing system we
work on open sourcing some tests remove
a test from closed part of progression
history to open part of regression test
suit as i speak right and from
functional test suites to open party
figuration issues as well i would not
comment on the speed of this activity
but we are doing it
right now so performance data called
courage yes we have the numbers I'm not
able to give you anything but we will be
publishing them also right male easy to
build to create to address this far as
I'm concerned JT rich may not be the
friend list this harness but friendly
enough as harnesses go honestly it could
be wild but digital age is ok but if you
don't help him let's stop right and we
are thinking about supporting some other
as pharmacists right now and we already
have internal limitations for support I
will live in my name from ah like I said
we are moving testing two of the three K
and now I'm done and how we can take
questions right thank you
it wasn't very clear we do again look
around again I don't mind we've got all
night okay yes sir sorry again for the
beginning which was a bit confused and
as you can see we this is IBM Oracle
together working hard to try and solve
this problem we need your help and okay
so it's a small gathering but there's no
reason why you can't go out and say you
saw IV embark on oracle working very
hard to try and solve a test problem
which you may not been aware of maybe
the sea he thought it wasn't a problem
here's a problem I would dedicate needs
a test week and it's a big problem that
least resolved is going to take time and
we've looked harder how we could do it
how would you kick start it we have some
ideas but we need input from you guys
and so you know please take the message
out there if you have people who maybe
you have some quality engineers or you
know quality engineers who come on how
white some test cases we are looking for
that we we have some ideas on what makes
a good test case we have some ideas on
what might be air is a test but to be
honest given where we starting if you
have some ideas on things that you
should be better you know golfer right
test case a particular area we know that
it's going to it contributor it's not
gonna we're not gonna say no okay so
thank you so any questions
oh sorry they're hiring yes yeah
well thank you very much for your time
and I suspect there's still free beer
downstairs saying thank you very much
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
