Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series once under management by
Enterprise Manager configuration
information is automatically collected
and stored in the Enterprise Manager
repository to see the configuration
information are to browse it you can go
to the configuration last collective
menu here you will see the configuration
instance browser which includes you know
the high-level information about the
target like in this case the database
the version and its or Oklahoma path as
well as detailed information that you
would expect like initialization
parameters and system global area users
can take action on the configuration
directly from this menu which includes
the ability to save this latest
information for use later in comparisons
so I can name this something like
baseline err and submit that job and
this configuration and start entirety
will be saved in enterprise managers
repository Enterprise Manager 12 offers
a number of analysis capabilities to the
DBA including database change analysis
drift analysis and dependency and impact
analysis and one way to do dependency
and impact analysis is by using the
topology viewer and the topology viewer
is essentially going to present in a
graphical way the targets and
automatically discovered relationship
between those targets and I can use this
for dependency and impact analysis so in
this scenario let's say that I was
interested in doing some making some
changes to the configuration for the
listener that was being that it that was
being used by this database that I
started with here
but I I can see in this case that this
one database is being exposed by this
listener but I'm wondering what other
components could be impacted by taking
this listener offline so in order to see
that I can simply right-click on this
listener and go to its topology and by
default this is going to show me the
topology in a in the users view which
basically is saying the listener uses
this Oracle home and is hosted by this
host by changing uses - used by I can
see what other components are dependent
upon this listener and I can see here
that in addition to the original
database that is being exposed by this
listener there are two other database
instances and database systems which are
dependent upon that listener just one
quick example of how you can use the
topology viewer in a dependency and
impact analysis drift analysis is
essentially the ability for users to
compare configuration between targets
and systems including saved baselines
and gold standards and they can do this
in a one-to-one or one-to-many format in
Enterprise Manager twelve users have
additional capabilities to control the
configuration comparison to allow them
to the results to show only the
comparison differences that are
important to them
so in this example we're going to
compare this database to another
database instance so I chose
configuration compare and I'll choose
just one other database to compare this
against as I go through the wizard at
this point I'm given the option to pick
a comparison template and a comparison
template gives the users the ability to
control the results of the comparison
how the comparison is actually performed
in this case the default
Oracle provided database instance
it has configuration already done in it
particularly for ignoring known
differences that would autumn which
would be are known to be different
across installations so for things like
startup time and hostname perhaps and
creation date are known to be different
so there's no sense showing them in the
comparison results users can create
their own templates by making a copy of
the oracle provided or start from
scratch there's more that the config
template does but we'll just keep it
focused on that the other thing that
they can also do is choose which
properties they wish to be notified on
if I schedule this job as a regular job
to be executed on a regular basis I can
choose only those properties that I wish
to be notified should they be different
so I'll go ahead and submit this job and
then we'll take a look and see what the
results are ok here we can see that the
results do have some differences so
let's take a look so here you can see
that essentially the configurations are
grouped together as they were in the
instance browser and you can see which
categories have differences and which
ones do not I'm going to check this show
ignore differences because we'll be able
to see what the results would have been
without the comparison template employed
ok so you can see here that in even in
the target properties that things like
listener machine name and Oracle home
path and the ports would automatically
be ignored including things like the
database SID which definitely is going
to be different across installations
there are things that were not ignored
you know things that would be in the
initialization parameters as well as in
the system global area and again these
can be customized by the end user should
they not wish to see differences here
and if we look again at something like
users you know it's probably expected
that you know created an expiry date and
the user ID may be different so those
things would be ignored as well so we're
essentially finding the needle in the
haystack
which up until now would be extremely
difficult to do and again I can do this
for saved versions of the configuration
as well as an entire system comprised of
numerous components this is the end of
the demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
