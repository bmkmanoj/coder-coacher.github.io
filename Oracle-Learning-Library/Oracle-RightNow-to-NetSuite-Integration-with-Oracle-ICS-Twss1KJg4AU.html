RightNow and NetSuite applications do
you need to synchronize data between
your Oracle RightNow and NetSuite
instances Oracle integration cloud
service or ICS enables you to integrate
Oracle RightNow and NetSuite to
synchronize data like accounts and
organizations Bob needs to synchronize
account creation so that every time an
organization is created in Oracle
RightNow an account also gets created in
NetSuite to complete disintegration Bob
completes several tasks in ICS he
creates the source and target
connections creates the integration
performs the data mapping and saves and
activates the integration here Bob
creates the integration between Oracle
RightNow and NetSuite by using Oracle
integration cloud service on the home
page
Bob can establish the source and target
connections required for his integration
and create his integration by using his
configured connections Bob creates the
Oracle RightNow connection by using the
right now adapter as bob provides the
connection name the identifier is
automatically generated based on that
name after the right now connection is
created bob configures the connection
properties to the Oracle RightNow
endpoint to do this he uses a wisdom
file that contains the endpoint details
since it's password protected he also
sets the credentials for the RightNow
connection on the connections page Bob
creates another connection this time he
uses the NetSuite adaptor just as before
the identifier is automatically
generated based on the connection name
after the NetSuite connection is created
bob configures the connection properties
to the endpoint by using a wisdom file
that contains the NetSuite endpoint
details
the NetSuite endpoint is
password-protected so he adds the
required credentials the account and
role settings for this specific endpoint
once the connection is configured in ICS
Bob tests the connectivity and verifies
that it's successful otherwise he won't
be able to use this connection in his
integration the NetSuite connection is
now marked as configured on the home
page Bob continues with the creation of
the integration between the Oracle
RightNow and NetSuite connections he
builds a new integration to create an
account in NetSuite when an organization
has created an Oracle RightNow Bob
creates a one-to-one integration to
synchronize the account creation the
integration canvas is displayed with all
the available fully configured
connections Bob configures the
integration by setting the NetSuite
connection as the integration target he
provides meaningful information for the
endpoint reference Bob selects the
target operation and the business object
on which to perform the operation in the
NetSuite application on the summary page
he verifies that his selections are
correct before completing the target
endpoint configuration the NetSuite
connection appears as the target on the
integration canvas now bob continues
with the integration by configuring the
Oracle RightNow connection as the source
he provides the endpoint reference and a
meaningful description Bob selects the
business object on which to perform the
operation in the Oracle RightNow
application on the summary page he
verifies that his selections are correct
before completing the source and point
configuration the integration canvas
appears with the configured source and
target connections now bob needs to map
the data that will be exchanged between
the source and target connections Oracle
integration cloud service offers a
number of ways to map the data exchanged
between these connections Bob creates
his own mapping he only needs to copy
across the organization lookup name in
Oracle RightNow so that the request is
sent with the correct account name to
NetSuite
once the data mapping is complete the
integration is ready to be activated
when Bob activates the integration he
has the option to enable detailed
tracing when developing and debugging
the integration between Oracle RightNow
and NetSuite is now active any changes
to the organization in Oracle RightNow
are automatically reflected in Bob's
NetSuite instance for more information
