is forcing IT to be much more nimble and
respond to needs much more rapidly at
the same time the cost efficiency and
green IT mandates are placing more
demands on i.t to reduce server
footprint and cut down on space and
cooling costs these are the issues that
force this global company to seek out a
virtualization strategy that spanned
both x86 and SPARC they required a
strong solution that could bridge the
gap between all the virtualization
technologies so they are invested in
across their data center they found that
solution by leveraging Oracle VM and
Oracle Enterprise Manager let's explore
some of the features that help them
achieve that success what they liked
first of all is that the Oracle
Enterprise Manager ops center offers a
self-service interface for both ovm x86
and Solaris zone virtualization
technologies here we'll explore ovm x86
ops center achieves network isolation
between tenants on clouds
here we see that this particular account
application farm has a user Wilson key
has been issued out a virtual network
and eight network IP addresses
he's been allocated storage CPU and
memory he has a list of his virtual
servers
he has lifecycle control over them
virtual server templates he can shut
down all of his servers he can create
new volumes take snapshots upload server
templates create additional v nets based
on his IP address allocations let's
create a virtual server very simply
he'll name his virtual machine select a
high availability support select a VM
template then a virtual server type
small medium or large
he'll select a network he'll then choose
either DHCP or a static IP address if
you choose a static IP address one will
be selected for him based on his
alligator IPs he'll then upload a public
key this public key will be used to
access his virtual machine through an
infrastructure has a service API and
command line and there's his virtual
machine embedded within this virtual
machine is an instance of Siebel this is
the power of Oracle VM templates this
user has multiple ways to interact with
his environment he also has a fully
extensive command-line interface but may
be self-service isn't the method of his
choice maybe he'd rather attaches
virtual machines at time of server
provisioning using the up Center
deployment plans he can quickly create
virtual machine templates and call these
during OS server provisioning tasks he
has equal coverage of both ovm xa6 and
ovm for SPARC here we see a no VM for
SPARC template creating a virtual
machine leveraging the control domain
after we create the guest based on CPU
memory and MT use we pair that guest
template to an OS provisioning template
that OS provisioning could be a far
based captured based on Solaris or it
can be a bare-metal jump starter or
automated install op Center marries the
construction of the virtual machine to
the provisioning of
guessed by combining these two together
it offers an embedded payload ops center
does not do this alone it leverages the
power of a VM manager for x86 it can
discover OVA managers across the data
center it can bring them together and
input their environment into the ops
center environment you can work directly
in ovn manager and then discover that
work within ops center or you can just
stand up your own VM manager and allow
op center to input information into it
here we see we have one ova manager in
the environment it has 2 hypervisors and
some virtual machines a storage and
networking ops center combines its
knowledge of the full data center with
that of ovm manager and ovm spark here
we can see the relationship between
service processors and hardware
information 2 hypervisors to guess 2
operating systems you have full fault
coverage of all Hardware faults with an
OP Center hair were examining the
hypervisor this particular hypervisor
has several virtual machines running on
it we have a number of tasks that we can
perform on the virtual machines such as
editing their allocated resources based
on the runtime of the virtual machine
there's a variety of different
configurations that you can change op
Center also provides analytics of guests
usage here we can quickly see in charts
the top CPU and top memory consumers we
can look at all guests and see what
their CPU and memory usage is compared
to one another we can look at history of
the Box compare hypervisors today to
their performance yesterday as we switch
off the hypervisor and go to the
operating system level there's further
information available just like kono vm
x86 ovm spark offers the same insight
here we see El Dom's
and the same history is available
now let's jump into server pools here we
have a box with 8 gigs of ram this
happens to be a spark hypervisor we
would like to move a guess that has 10
gigs of ram will have to first edit the
allocated Ram
and now we can move it to the other
member of the server pool will simply
kick the live migration job off by
selecting the guest in the target and
we'll click Next
now our Siebel virtual machine will move
to the other member of the pool and
exactly the same way we can do live
migration operations with ovm x86 we can
clone save as template shutdown suspend
reboot
let's investigate a live migration here
we select our other member of the server
pool and we migrate will notice the
Siebel instance will travel north to the
partnering server
there's quite a bit of automated policy
available from OPM manager for x86 op
center exposes these policies here in
this interface we can use placement
policies and auto balancing policies
placement policies are placed virtual
machine on a virtual server with the
lowest relative load or examine the
power consumption and find the best
possible mix there's also utilization
goals available for servers in the same
way ovie enforce part server pools have
policies as well these policies are in
line with the ovm x86 here we see we can
place a virtual server on the box with
the lowest relative load we can place it
on the one with the lowest amount of
allocated CPU and memory resources left
or place it on the one that would
minimize the overall power consumption
there are also utilization goals and
auto balancing now that we understand
server pools let's investigate how a
server pool can drive a virtual data
center or cloud here we see two virtual
data centers one is made out of Oracle
Solaris 11 zones and the other ovm
server for x86 as we expand the quality
and test virtual data center will notice
it is made up of networks dorage sever
pools and accounts op center will
combine multiple server pools if you
choose to place multiple ones in the
virtual data center it'll then place a
math algorithm above the server pool and
find the best match to the policy of
choice here we see an account called
application form the application form
has three virtual machines running in it
it's being powered by a server pool made
up of 2 hypervisors but this virtual
data center or cloud is running low on
virtual CPUs let's explore what we can
do about that ops center understands how
to bare metal OS provision hypervisors
across the data center here we will
leverage a complex deployment plan that
marries multiple steps together in the
same plan using its discovery mechanism
ops center discovered new equipment we
will then provision out the new
equipment with our deployment plan we
simply supply an IP address
range and network subnet
next we choose the Oviatt manager we'd
like to mate
these hypervisors two as they boot up we
also have the ability to select a server
pool remembering a server pool is
connected to a virtual data center or
cloud and the virtual data centers have
accounts those account allocated CPU
memory and storage resources by
selecting the server pool at time of
provisioning we ensure that these
resources end up in the right hands
after server provisioning we go back to
the account and the virtual data center
and we find that our virtual CPUs have
increased by quite a bit
Oracle VM and Enterprise Manager OP
Center combined to offer this global
company a competitive advantage in their
market this solution can take them
wherever their application needs to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
