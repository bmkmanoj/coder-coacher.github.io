applications using a web browser through
the cloud portal in this video we'll
look at getting started with the cloud
and using the cloud portal to access
your applications to begin using the
cloud administrators in your
organization set up your user accounts
and grant you access to cloud
applications when this process is
complete you'll receive an email with
your username and a temporary password
follow the instructions to reset your
password you will also set up challenge
questions which will be used if you have
a problem with your password and need to
reset it after completing these steps
log into the clouds portal in the portal
tiles are present for cloud applications
you can launch an application you've
been granted access to by clicking its
icon or the first link within its tile
the applications are web-based launching
one opens a new browser tab with an
active session for that application
Primavera p6 has some additional
application links if you are using p6
team member this is also a web-based
application and will launch in a new
browser tab the p6 professional client
is not web-based if you need to use this
application your first option is to
click the link to install it follow the
instructions to perform a click once
installation this installs and
configures the clients on your local
workstation note that the database where
p6 data is stored is still located on a
cloud server your second option is to
access the clients through Primavera
virtual desktop this allows you to run
p6 professional using a remote
connection to a server where it is
installed negating the need to install
it locally
both Primavera p6 and Primavera unifier
have links for web services instructions
web services is an advanced integration
tool used for purposes such as
programming the import and export of
data between cloud applications and
other systems
if you require access to web services
notes of the link in the instructions is
not active and you must copy and paste
it into a browser window we'll wrap up
by quickly looking at the additional
links at the bottom of the page
Primavera gateway is another integration
tool with a simple user interface for
integrating cloud applications there is
a link to configure settings for
Primavera analytics the cloud
administration application is used for
managing cloud users while the users are
actually stored in the Oracle Identity
Manager there is a link to documentation
on administering the cloud and its
applications the Oracle business
intelligence products offer solutions
for analytics and reporting thank you
