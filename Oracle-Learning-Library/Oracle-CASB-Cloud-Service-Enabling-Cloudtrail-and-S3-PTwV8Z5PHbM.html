cloud service to monitor your Amazon Web
Services account there are two services
that must be enabled cloud trail and s3
enabling these services allows your
Identity and Access Management account
to read the AWS service itself it also
enables the account to read the cloud
trail logs in your s3 bucket first log
into your AWS console to enable cloud
trail and check the policy settings on
your s3 bucket
start by selecting services from the
menu
and the management tools choose cloud
trail
you'll see an AWS cloud trail screen
once selected you're taken to the cloud
rail service
here you give the service a name of your
choice notice by default it's enabled
for all regions and is capturing all
events choose whether to put your cloud
trail logs into an existing s3 bucket or
a new one for an existing s3 bucket
select no then enter the name of the s3
bucket if you want to use a log file
prefix to change the default location of
the cloud trail logs enter the prefix
under advanced instead of storing logs
in Amazon s3 bucket name AWS logs
account number it will insert the prefix
after the bucket name to create a new s3
bucket select yes give the book it a
name and choose create to create the
cloud trail and the s3 bucket this will
take you to the cloud trail service this
is the screen you would see if you
already had cloud trail enabled and
selected trails in the left hand menu
you'll see the cloud trail you just
created and the name of the s3 bucket is
piping its logs to choosing the cloud
trail name will take you into the
configurations page where you can
validate the settings of the cloud trail
here you can edit the configurations
disable cloud trail or delete it
the next step is to validate the policy
on the s3 bucket select services from
the menu and under storage select s3
select the bucket name and you'll see
four tabs across the top
by choosing permissions you get to the
Bukit policy under bucket policy you'll
see the policy in JSON format that was
automatically created by the cloud trail
service on your s3 bucket if you use an
existing s3 bucket ensure that the
policy has the gets buckets ACL for
cloud trail policy and s3 put objects
for cloud trail policy included reading
the policy you'll see that it entitles
the cloud trail service to get to the
bucket access control list but more
importantly puts objects into the bucket
these permissions allow cloud trail to
store the log data it generates into
your s3 service congratulations you've
enabled cloud trail cloud trail is
piping its logs to an s3 bucket on your
Amazon Web Services account
