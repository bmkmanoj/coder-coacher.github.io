testing suite training series this is a
video recording for open script for a
load testing advanced training session
which covers how you can troubleshoot
your load testing script in open script
my name is utakata cotton I'm a great
product manager of the application
testing suite products when you record a
load testing script on your application
with open script and when you play back
the script the script tries to execute
the HTTP commands that were captured
during the recording the application
returns responses based on your request
and that is how open script sign
literature to user transaction however
your script may fail and will show the
error message and that error message
typically says
fail to solve variable if you're not
familiar with the open script automation
concept and the script debugging methods
you will then wonder what are the next
steps to make this script run this
session tries to clear your questions
regarding these scripting errors when
you see in load testing script
executions we all go through the details
on how open script communicate with the
application and also see the
step-by-step examples how you can
resolve these scripting problems here is
today's agenda in this video recording
will cover the basics in the load
testing script debugging first we will
talk about the load testing automation
concepts in open script then discuss
what are the correlations in many cases
of failure in a correlation is a cause
of the script failure we'll also cover
what are the solve variables and what
are the fail to solve problems and how
to approach those problems and lastly
we'll take a look at examples in the
real script a sample script used in this
video training can be downloaded from
the Oracle Learning Library
please see the link in this slide to
access our video series here I would
like to review some of the load testing
automation concept this slide shows how
users communicated with the application
there are two diagrams in upper side and
lower side of the screen the upper side
stays functional testing in lower side
is load testing they are basically the
same diagram an upper right corner you
see open script icon asking where do I
fit below open script is an automated
testing tool so it should replace some
of the manual process but that would be
different between the functional and
load the answer is for the functional
testing script open script replaces the
user actions and communicate with the
browser so when you record a functional
testing script you will see a lot of GUI
commands that replace the user actions
in the browser will do the rest of the
work at the playback so the functional
testing is a GUI level automation on the
other hand load testing script open
script replace the browser and
communicate directly with the
application because load scripts does
not talk to the browser but speak to the
applications web server it requires a
different protocol the web server
understands there is HTTP so when you
take a look at the load script it has a
series of HTTP commands instead of GUI
commands so while functional testing
automates the transaction in a GUI level
low testing automates a transaction in
HTTP protocol level this is a big
difference between the functional
testing script and load testing script
so compared to the functional testing
script load testing script is lighter
and scalable apparently because it does
not need to carry a browser and what
that allows you to do is that you can
bring the script to the oracle load
testing and run any number of a
concurrent virtual users while
minimizing the number of test machines
you need for load test so that was at
the playback this diagram shows how open
script captures the HTTP traffic during
the recording
when you start the recording open script
enables the proxy recorder and the
monitors HTTP traffic between the
plotter and application just like
Wireshark or filters to then transform
the capture the HTTP traffic to API
command and write the commands down to
the script so let's say you recorded a
load testing script in open script and
this is the script I'm going to click a
Java code it tough to see the Java
commands for this script you see that
HTTP requests that were captured at the
recording and were transformed into Java
commands and written down to the script
the first command I have here is the get
statement and the second is the post
statement and others are all get
statements in this script they're only
fear requests but in the real production
script you have many of these gates and
post commands the question is what do
these commands actually mean
as we just saw in the script the HTTP
traffic that were captured at the
recording are written down to the script
and each command has the form of HTTP
dot method and when you play back the
script open script execute these
commands one by one until it gets to the
end of the script if you take a closer
look to the script you'll see some of
the methods have HTTP GET and some of
them are HTTP POST we will talk about
those more in the next five se the
diagram in the left side of the screen
is a script you recorded the first
command is the get and the second
command is the post the gate commands
send all parameters in plaintext in the
form of the query string in URL so the
values are visible in the browser's
address bar and it is now secure method
to send confidential information
it is also restricted in size on the
other hand the post request send all the
parameters in the message body and it is
more secure and not restricted in size
so generally speaking the confidential
information are usually sent using post
method let's see the original HTTP
requests that are captured by often
script the first example is the get
request please see the string after the
question mark he has a parameters in the
name value pair format this is the clear
string when you request this page in a
browser this query string is going to
show up in the browser's address bar
apparently now secure as user can
actually see the parameter the second
example is a post request the parameters
are shown in the message body and now in
the URL open script captured these HTTP
traffic during the recording and the
purses them out and writes down to the
script in a format of HTTP dot method
from this slide we will talk about the
session ID the left side diagram
shows the scripts that open script
captured during the recording but if you
play back this script it will fail why
this is because in body session ID is
used the parameter requested ID in the
post method is dynamic and it changes
every time that the user logs into the
application because the body of the
request ID at record time is a
hard-coded in the script at the playback
opens wit will send the request ID which
is no longer valid and that made the
script fail but what is the session ID
why do we need such an ID and why are
they a dynamic and we'll dig into more
in the next slides let's talk about a
little bit about HTTP HTTP is a
stateless protocol and does not provide
any way of storing the user data between
the requests please take a look at the
diagram in this slide let's say this is
an application that does not have a
session ID in the upper side diagram a
user theory sends the page request to
the web server the web server returns
the page then web server forgets about
the Larry completely the lower side
diagram there is since the page requests
again to the web server the web server
returns the page but it does not relate
the request to another request their
image previously web server will just
treat them as new requests however this
makes creating a business with
application almost impossible for
example any shopping site as in a song
comm will need to keep track the page
request a user made so that it can track
the state of the shopping cart and that
is why the business application need to
manage a session ID session ID allows
the application to maintain information
after each of the site visitors and this
is typically used to identify the user
logged into the application so let's see
an application example that has a
session ID the diagram in this slide
unlike the previous slide
when Larry sends a request web server is
going to send back a session ID to Larry
and when Larry sends a new request
within the same session he sends a
session ID that was previously given by
the application along with the request
that is how the application identifies
the user and how I can understand which
request belongs to which user so what is
a session ID session ID is a piece of
data that is exchanged between the
applications web server and the browser
and this is usually an alphanumeric
Polly session ID is typically used to
identify a user log on to the
application for a particular duration of
his or her visit and this means that
every time a user log in a different
session ID is given even that is the
same user so the session ID is a given
per session done by the person today you
log in to the application in the gutter
session ID abc123
but next time you log in the session ID
can be XYZ four five six so the session
ID is something like a boarding pass
when you are traveling with multiple
connection flight it identifies you and
ensures you can navigate to the
destination you want to go how does a
webpage path session ID to the web
server that is commonly in the URL in
the cookie or in the HTML page please
see the first example session ID is
appended to the URL as a part of the
query string so the value after the
question mark is a session ID in this
example it is the body of starting with
783 0 7 the second example is to use
session ID in a cookie cookie is a file
that stored in a client machines hard
disk usually in the temporary internet
folder browser sends back the cookie to
the application to keep the state and
the third example is the HTML
this case the value is stored in a
source content particularly input type
hidden' filled in the HTML page and will
be submitted by the post command for all
three methods open script tries to
handle the session ID automatically at
recording and he also allows you to
configure them manually after the
recording okay so now we are back to the
script that we saw previously as discuss
this script will fail at the playback
because of the embodied session ID this
particular session ID was recorded at
the script creation and written down to
the script as a part of the post request
the problem is that the body is obsolete
and hard-coded to the script as we just
learn that session ID can change every
time you start a new session if you try
to use the original session ID that you
used three days ago the application will
reject your request because a session ID
is no longer about it that is why this
script will fail at the playback browser
can handle this dynamic session ID
automatically but at the open script
playback there is no browser so now the
question is how does open script handle
the session ID in fact the open script
will do a little bit more work at the
recording when you record the script
this is much closer to what it actually
looks like please see the difference
between the previous slide you see an
extra command written down to the script
in the first navigation there is an
additional command HTTP solver XPath
this is a variable the open script
stores the session ID what this command
does is to extract the data from the
HTML page in the stores that value into
a variable so that it can use the Impala
at a later in the script in this case
the session ID is extracted from HTML
source and stored in the variable the
variable name is
input request I T the variable is past
the subsequent navigations and used in a
post data parameter this is the
correlation that we are going to talk
about today so what are the correlations
open script uses variables to pass
dynamic data between the navigations
there are three cases that correlations
take place first is ant recording when
you record the script open script has a
built-in feature to order correlate the
session data second is after the
recording you can manually correlate the
dynamic values in the existing script
and the third is the next time recording
you can add your custom correlation
rules to the correlation library and use
your custom correlation library in the
next time you do the recording this way
the custom variables you created will be
applied to the future recordings here is
another code example with the
correlations in this example there are
two HTTP requests get and post at the
first get request you see four solve
Express commands that extract value from
the HTML source please take a look at
the second command if you play back this
script
the second solve X bestman extracted
value T a four six nine from a login
object and stores into a variable the
variable name is input zero the value is
passed to the post request and replaces
the original recorded value at runtime
so at the playback the low game value
will be captured dynamically and applied
to the parameter later in the script
this slice takes a closer look into a
solve XPath command as discussed earlier
so the XPath command stores a value into
a variable please take a look at this
example solve express command has four
arguments the first argument is the
variable name the name
the variable in this case it is input
underscore zero the second argument is
Express which specify the location of
the source the third argument ta for
nine six in this case this is a recorded
value which is optional and typically
used for the informational purposes the
first argument is a result index you can
specify an index value in case multiple
values are expected to return from the
variable extraction the default is zero
meaning the first result will be used in
the middle of the slide you see a source
example this is where the body is going
to be extracted the source has input
object which has three attributes ie
named hand body ID equals login name
equals to login and body equals to 200
the sole backspace command in the top of
this page runs against this source and
will first tries to find an input object
there has an attribute name equals to
log in there is the condition of this
variable when he finds that object then
he extract the value of the attribute
value from that object and stores it
into the variable which is the input
underscore 0 it may be a little
confusing here because the attribute
name in this example is actually also
value so it's a value of the attribute
value but if you want to extract the
value of href attribute then Yosi href
after the @ sign if you are a sequel
user it may be easier for you to think
that this logic is like select value the
value from input where name value e
costs login we have discussed a solve X
path variable command but there is not
only command open script has for the
string extraction mainly we have two
types of string extraction method XPath
and regular expressions there are two
examples in this
the first one is the expert variable we
just discussed the second example is the
regular expression that searches the
string directly from the source using
the regular expression syntax so when
these two example commands are executed
against the sample HTML source below
both commands will return the body login
they make the same result just with a
different method there are other string
extraction methods as in JavaScript
variable but XPath in reg X are the main
variables that you'll see often in terms
of the script troubleshooting ok so we
have a basic understanding on how open
script passes the session IDs to the web
server at the recording open script
automatically detects dynamic values and
it creates variables as resolve XPath or
so by regular expression variables and
at the playback open script extract
dynamic values from the source stores
them into a variable and the uses add to
subsequent navigations for the
substitution unfortunately this is not
always the case open scripted tries to
automate this process as much as it can
but time to time he fails to extract the
correct value out from the source and
your script playback may fail because of
that when that happens you may see an
error message fail to solve variable in
the result view this is typically the
first problem you see when you started
to work with the load testing script in
Bolton script let's think why this
happens there are mainly two reasons
when you see this error the first case
case a occurs when the application
returned the expected contents
however the regular expression or the
XPath that defined the variable could
not locate a string in the playback
contents that is a case a case B occurs
when the application returns a totally
different page this includes an error
page that indicates a server
or page not found and the because of
server returned the different page the
contents of the page is also different
from the recording and therefore the
variable could not find the expected
string from the playback contents so
when you seen an error message failed to
solve variable depends on the symptoms
the root cause of the problem may be
different we will take a closer look at
the case a in case a the correct page
was returned but open script could not
find a string from the playback contents
this is the case that the page returned
from the server is the correct page but
it is slightly different from the
recording this often occurs when the
contents are dynamic for example
purchase order application the
frequently updated sales information may
show different contents every time the
script is playing back so if your script
is recorded against this type of
application they you may see fail to
solve errors because the contents are
different from the recording although
from your perspective it is the same
page this symptom is also seen often
when the databank feature was used to
parameterize a login user at the
playback many application has user
defined contents for example user a and
the user V may have different privilege
and displays a different number of menu
items in the page after logging if the
variable was created against these menu
items then script runs with user a that
may fail with a user P this can result
in a variable not found error another
case is when the string includes a
dynamic text in the regular expression
or the XPath variable created by open
script let's see the example in the next
slide the HTTP solve XPath command in
this screen is taken up from the script
that recorded the actual customers
application in this application the
content is very dynamic in one of the
object in HTML content an attribute
dynamically changes its name
every time the script is iterated first
iteration is in 81 the second iteration
is m82 third is ma t3 and goes up to the
M 89 and comes backed with ami 81 in the
start all over again at the recording
this parameter name was now
automatically correlated by open script
therefore the script playback failed
every time after the first iteration
because a script was not sending the
body parameter name within the request
this is a very complex application
because an example is a bit complicated
let's see this in a simplified example
because we already learned how to read
the soul expands very vocal man we
should be able to tell what happens when
this command is executed first this
command will look for an input object
that has a name attribute equals to Ma
t1 then he extract the value of a Bali
attribute from the object in stores into
a variable the variable name is wave
input mea t1 the body of the pool
attribute is Mencia matthew however at
the second iteration application changes
its contents and the name value pair of
this object is no longer in m81 it is
n82
therefore the XPath condition will now
be satisfied in the playback will fail
the last example is when a change was
made in application by the department
and the content originally had was
modified it is often seen in application
that is still under the moment say you
have a recorded script and playback the
scripts the next day the original
content that was present when you
recorded the script may not be present
at the playback time because it was
removed or modified it object
information by the department this is
also the case you may see that failed to
solve errors at the playback any of the
examples we discussed in this slide the
root problem is likely the solve command
that is shown in the error message so if
you see the fail to solve variable error
but you see the correct page is
returning from the server then you may
want to take a closer look at the error
message and find the variable name which
is causing the failure and investigate
why the variable is failing so let's see
the example you are recording a book
selling web application that shows a
recommendation for your purchase in this
example the open script assumed the
value 0 4 7 0 5 5 s 304 is dynamic and
therefore created a sole expert variable
for this value and you have parameter as
a login user in your script and at the
playback a different user is going to
log on to the application application
returns a different recommendation for a
different user and your script is failed
with a fail to solve variable error
because open script could not find a
link object defined by the solve
variable from the contents return from
the server so this is the case a the
application returns different contents
for different users and if open script
created a solve variable against those
user defined contents script play that
may fail because the contents expected
may not exist when different user
i D was used in the script the next case
case fee is when you see the fail to
solve error when the application
returned a totally different page and
because of that expected the string does
not exist in the playback contents this
is more the case you see in the real
life the possible causes of this error
or whether the application is down or
the script is not finding the right HTTP
requests the first thing you may want to
try is to reach out to the application
with using the browser to make sure the
application is up and running if the
application is now running the script
was not going to run however if the
script fails an open script but if it
runs fine when you try in the browser
then we will need to suspect something
may be wrong with the script script
errors in case B can be typically caused
by the dynamic strings now correlated
when the session IDs are dynamic but if
the correlation is not applied then the
script will use the hard-coded value and
that will result in the error another
case is when the string extraction is
not properly configured at the recording
open script tries to apply the automatic
correlation to the navigations but in
some case the correlation rules are not
properly applied to the strings and he
ends up extracting the wrong body from
the source let's take a look at the real
example in this example the string J ID
1 weight this is a dynamic string so
open script attempted to substitute this
string at recording however
configuration was not well done and when
you play back the string he ended up in
the wrong page the original value was j
ID 1 weight and after the correlation
only one 0 portion from 108 was
substituted and 8 was
hard-coded and looks like this was even
extracted from the wrong place so this
is unfortunate fatal case the open
street automation apply the wrong string
substitution this particular issue was
already fixed in the latest version of
open script but depends on the
complexity of plication you're working
with there is always a possibility that
you may see something not too different
from this example so the examples we
discuss in this slide for case B are
thing when the wrong page was returned
the difference from the case a is where
to look at the root cause the
application between the totally
different content because of the request
you made previously therefore the root
cause is the previous page request now
in the object you see in error message
so unlike the case a where you can find
root cause in an error message in case B
you need to look for why you end up in
the wrong page let's see the example in
the Amazon site again you have recorded
in web application that shows the
recommendations open script extracted
the value zero four seven zero five five
zero four from a link in recommendation
assuming it a dynamic text so far it is
the same with a case a we saw previously
you playback the script but the script
was failed and the error message says
failed solve variable error it is exact
same error message from the last time
but this time it is due to the different
root cause when taking a look at the
browser view in option script UI you
could see the server returning the error
page the fail to solve variable error
was shown because a totally different
page was loaded and that was why open
script was not able to rotate the string
from that page if this page error was
not caused by a server-side problem then
typically the root cause of this problem
is the page request you made previously
in your script
so you need to investigate the
parameters that your script is sending
and check whether they are dynamic and
if they are dynamic make sure they are
properly correlated from here let's see
the examples in the real script we'll
use a medical record application which
is a sample application comes with a
WebLogic server as an application under
test for this exercise the script flow
is simple log into the application be a
profile and log out but when you play
back the script it will fail with the
error message which is the HTTP response
code 500 internal server error along
with a fail to solve variable errors
this is also a typical playback error
message when correlation is not properly
done in the script
this is a script I pre-recorded a
medical record application I will
playback this script by pressing the
playback button in the toolbar and this
will going to start up playback now the
script should be executing the HTTP
commands that were captured during the
recording and the server is returning
the contents back to open script the
script result is showing up in the
result page indicating a failure the
script execution has failed the error
message is HTTP response called 500
internal server error the first thing
you want to do when you seen an error in
the script is it take a look at the
error message carefully so I'm going to
click this button to show up the
properties dialog the summary shows HTTP
response called 500 internal server
error you can also see what has returned
from the server in the browser view this
is apparently not what we expected
but we ended up and you may wonder why
the error message is now failed to solve
which we discussed in this session but
HTTP response code this is because it is
the message returned in the response
header for this request so let's take a
look at the response header for the page
request I made for this is what is
returned from the server at the playback
when server sends back an obvious fader
in its response code open script will
try to show that message instead of fail
to slow variable errors let's take a
look at another script I have which is
failing with fail to solve errors when
take a look at response headers for this
request what I have is the HTTP 200 ok
so let's take a look at the browser boom
or what's happening for this request and
I see the error page so totally
different page was loaded the next
do for this script is to check whether
this was caused by the server-side
problem or the correlation in the script
but the point is this application did
not return the error code in the
response header so open script was not
able to identify whether the error page
was loaded or not and went ahead to
process the variable substitution and
ended up in a failed solve errors but
here in the application we are working
with open script was able to understand
the server error because it was
specified in the response header and
that is why open script is not processed
of further steps to get the fail to
solve errors but actually you can
control that behavior if you go to the
View open script preferences and go to
the error recovery go to the HTTP invite
response code and if you change that
therefore to fail to ignore then this
will ignore the scripts termination
based on the response code so now the
script is playing back and now it is
executing step 3 now you see the fail to
solve variable errors because we ignored
the response code and it went through
the process of next step but because a
totally different page is loaded the
variable was not found from the page
content so this is a case B which we
previously discussed in the slides when
the totally different page was loaded at
the playback so what we need to do is
take a look at the request we made it
previously to get this page to
understand why the server returned this
error page I'm going to go to the error
recovery page to set back the response
code to fail so that we can go back to
the original state
select the fail to note in my previous
run and go to the comparison tab so just
to recap open script stores two sets of
data recorded and playback so when you
select a node in the script view open
script will show the recorded data in a
details view and if you select a node in
the playback result view then playback
data it is shown in the details view I
have browser HTML headers and also
comparison tab for the playback data and
what this compares on tab allows you to
do is to compare the data between the
recorded and playback I can compare the
content which was returned from the
server and I can also compare cookies
resources and also the request headers
and response headers I'm going to
compare the request headers because this
is where typically the problem resides
taking a look at the comparisons I can
see some of the parameters are not
correlated in the post data parameters I
see J ID ID 3 which looks like a session
ID but that recorded in playback was
having the same value also JBOX
faces bills state this again looks like
a session ID and also having a same
value between the recorded end playback
so this could be the reason the script
is failing maybe we are sending an
invalid session ID to the application
next I want to do is to correlate these
parameters
let's reveal what was a correlation in
this application case the application
assigns a dynamic value to the session
at the step two in the script and he
embeds the value to the input type the
hidden field in the HTML page this is a
dynamic session ID the client will need
to send a session ID back by the post
data to the application so that is how
the application and the client
communicates however at the step three
in this script the body is hard-coded
bill state parameter is hard-coded it is
using the original recording value this
body has to be correlated at a runtime
in order to use the dynamic body so how
to correlate a parameter first you need
to identify which parameter you want to
correlate you can find the parameter by
selecting the node that is failing and
right mouse click select find fader in
the tree and this will navigate you
automatically to the navigation that
includes the fader so in this step three
in the posted up I see at least two
parameters that looks like dynamic
volume but in this case I will correlate
parameter Bill State right mouse click
select substitute variable and select
create a new variable click Next this
dialog allows you to extract the dynamic
string from the earlier navigation
within the script so in this case open
script detected the selected string in
the step two and this is a source of the
page that includes a dynamic string j ID
3 3 6 2 4 is a session ID you want to
correlate and by going through this
process opens street will store this
string into the variable so that you can
use it later in the script and in this
case open
found only one location for this text
that you are looking for so the next and
previous buttons here are disabled but
in case the string was found in multiple
locations these buttons will be
activated so that you can search and
select the correct string the leg area
expression was also suggested by open
script but you can also modify the
regular expression directly into the
text here or you can simply select the
string from the source so if you think
this syntax is strong enough then you
can use this and click Next to proceed
in this dialog you can test the regular
expression you created in the previous
step whether the syntax is robust enough
to retrieve the value of uniquely from
the page or not so left click this test
button but this is not good because the
wrong body was selected and also there
are multiple bodies shown in the list
you may select the wrong value at the
playback so this regular expression was
not strong enough so let's go back
actually you can go with a default
position open script provides let's try
there click Next click test as I only
see a single result here and this is a
correct body on looking for only thing I
don't like is this regular expression
may be too long so I'm going back and
reselect the text because I think this
is a good enough click Next and it only
finds one value which is a collective
value so I'll accept this and click Next
I can name the variable I will name it
bar bill state optionally you can add
the variable to the library so that you
can use it later for the other scripts
I'm not doing that for now and going to
click finish and let's see the trigger
here you see the parameter in step 3 is
now correlated with a curry bracket
variable if you right mouse click and
select find the variable source it
brings you to where the variable was
created you can see the sole hulagur
expression was created in the step 2 and
if you select the HTML tab and then
reselect the variable node then he was
show where in the source the text was
extracted from by this change the
dynamics change should be extracted from
the source in the step 2 and will be
passive to the post data parameter in
the step 3
and used during the playback so let's
run this script and see how it goes I
just click the playback button in the
toolbar so this will start to playback
now the result is coming back in the
result pane and now he passed the step 3
the script actually failed in the step 4
so looks like step 3 is passed so the 1
provenance resolved but looks like we
have another problem first let's check
how did we play the octave step 3 the
correct page contents are shown so this
is good because we used to show a server
error page in the previous playback so
looks like we fix this problem at least
and let's verify that in the comparison
tab go into the request header and you
can see the Java fix faced bills state
parameters now correlated it has a
different value between the
recorded and playback this means a
correlation is working properly
because we fix this Croatian problem the
correct page is displayed in a step 3
now the script is fading at a step four
and what we need to do is the same
practice select the third node in the
playback result go to the comparison tab
and select the request headers and we
see the problem build state parameters
is now correlated so that maybe we have
to do the same fix we applied for the
step three for step four as well select
the third node right mouse click find
failure in the tree and go to the
navigation that includes a failed
parameter and I see the parameters are
hard-coded
I'm going to select the build state
parameter select the service state
variable which is the same process we
did for the step three this time I'm
going to select the variable which we
created previously borrow boost it and
click finish and playback
and let's see how it goes now now the
script is running pages three is masked
page forest 'passed and now it is fading
at the page five with the same internal
server error so you got a idea what we
probably have to do is to go to the page
five inch page six and apply the same
fix which we did for the page three and
four I'm going to the page five post
data and view state is now correlated so
I'm going to substitute variable
variable which we just created I'm going
to do the same fix for the page six as
well and play back
script execution is started now it's
page 3 page 4 page 5 and page 6 so
finally the Suki is running so this was
a simple example and the actual load
testing scripting problem you see in the
production could be more complicated but
the troubleshooting steps we saw today
are common in any level of the load
testing of scripting problems the script
province are typically caused by the
request you made previously in the
script if you see the scripting errors
first check if the application is up and
running and if it does then check what
kind of page it is returned if there is
a totally different page from the
recording then check the request header
that was made previously to get that
page you can use the comparison tab the
computer recorded in playback data and
especially in the request headers and if
you see parameters that are not
correlated then use substitute the
string dialogues to apply the
correlation as mentioned in the
beginning of the session the sample
script used in this video training can
be downloaded from the Oracle Learning
Library when you see the link in this
slide access to our video series web
page this is the end of the recording of
the application testing suite open
