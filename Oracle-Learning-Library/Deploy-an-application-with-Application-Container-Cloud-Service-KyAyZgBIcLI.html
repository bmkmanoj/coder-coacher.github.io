application of the Oracle application
container cloud here's how this is a
list of the types of applications you
can deploy I'm going to deploy a Java SE
application I start by entering some
basic information for the application
I'm deploying an embedded tomcat
application in this example the
application is a simple employee
directory for the name I'm going to call
this employee web app now I need to get
the archive from either my local system
or the Oracle cloud storage path or I
can pick one of the sample applications
provided
I've browsed the file system and
selected my application archive the
application archive name appears here I
can set the number of instances and the
size of the container that sets the size
of the container not the heap for Java
the version of Java I'm using is also
displayed if I want to have more
instances running to start I can
configure that right here and the same
with memory size for the container if
you think you need more memory that can
all be customized right here now I
create the application
a confirmation message is displayed
the name I gave the application employee
web app shows up at the top the
important thing here is that under
resources I see the number of instances
and the memory size that I selected are
there it can take several minutes for
the application to actually be deployed
on the service once the application is
fully deployed the informational message
disappears that's how to deploy an
application the application can also be
deployed from the command line using the
REST API thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
