application on the JVM my name is stefan
larson i'm the serviceability architect
at oracle for java SE i'm going to talk
today about some of the tools that are
available in the jdk that you can use
for diagnosing while both the jdk itself
but most importantly your own
applications i'm sorry for these very
small screens i'm going to show you some
demo code some command-line code then I
hope you can see it if you can't then no
closer so we've all been there right
your application is up and running there
are no problems everything is fine but
then suddenly customer calls you or
tweets or something about some problem
hopefully you have everything set up you
have all the tooling in place to go
looking for the problem this session
we're going to look at the tools that
are available in the JDK which means
that they will always be installed
always ready to be used if you know how
to use them I'm going to talk about the
tools I'm going to give you demos of how
to use these tools however there are
quite a few tools and I won't have time
to show you all of them in detail the
goal here is to help you get an
introduction to the tools and then you
can go and explore more by yourselves
most of the time I'm going to spend on
command-line tools there are some visual
tools which can be more powerful but
they're also easier to find out by
yourself by clicking around in them and
sometimes the only thing that really
matters is a command-line that's all you
have available to you apart from showing
the tools in action I'm also going to
talk a little bit about the internals of
the tools how they interact with the JVM
how to get information out of the JVM
and then
they and I'm also going to talk a little
bit about the future
what's things that we are working on
right now so I'm going to start with
demos
and I hope you can read this is it big
enough okay good so the first thing
we're going to look at is how to
discover what JVMs are running on your
system you may already have run jps
which is the simplest command for
finding out programs that are running it
lists the Java programs and process
identifier of the program you can add
some more options to it to show the
arguments to the programs and you can
also see the arguments to the virtual
machine
JPS has been around for quite some time
so may have seen it before something
that we've added in now in JDK 7 is a
command called J command in at its
simplest it's just like JPS it will list
the processes that are running it will
include by default arguments to it but J
command is is much more powerful than
this it can actually send commands to
the JVM for processing in the JVM and it
will get text output back from the JVM
after running these commands so it's
typically used for diagnosing the JVM
and the application I will talk a little
bit more about the implementation of
this later but right now we'll just look
at how to use it so you say J command
you say the process identifier this case
the sleeper process which is a dummy
program doesn't do anything and a
command so VM version and we get back
the version of the VM and the JDK
actually we can also see another
command-line so we get to see the
command-line that was used to start this
program personally I find it quite
tedious to always type in the process
identifier here so there is a shortcut
in J command for just saying the name of
the program instead we'll give you the
same same output and actually this is a
substring match so I can type something
smaller and I will get the same output
if you want to send the command to all
the processes at the same time you can
do that by saying zero and the uptime
for sorry the M up time we get the
uptime for for all the processes that
are running they were started at the
same time so they have the same off time
so that's all good but what other
commands are there available in in J
command well there's going to be a
different set of commands available for
each different version of the JVM since
we're going to add more and more
commands but J command has its own help
system and can actually query the JVM
for which commands are available so if
we sorry if we asked a steeper process
for help it will list the the commands
that that are available helped yep
there are not that many comments right
now as you can see we're working on
adding more and more and if you want to
know what they do
here's just a list of name you can still
use the helps command so we can ask the
end up flags for example oh sorry the
other way around
we can ask sleeper for help on the in
flags we get a little output here that
says that it prints the in flag and
their current values this is nicely
syntax if you have a wider screen nicely
formatted if you have wider screen it
also says the option so there's an - all
option here for example for showing you
all of the flags so let's see what it
looks like
those are were the flags that were set
when we started the program we can also
do all and we get a whole list of all
the possible VM parameters that you
could have used over 700 actually not
sure what all of them do could be useful
sometimes I don't know so there's one
additional feature that is very useful
in the NJ command which is especially
useful if you want to script the running
or J command for continuously monitoring
for example or something like that you
can specify a file with with the
commands in so if you have a file like
like this for example just lists a
number of commands you want to send you
can go a command sleeper - F + + 5 and
it will execute them one at a time so
first up time then the version and then
arguments down here this could be
formatted better I think we'll work on
that
so what else we can do J command the
system properties for listing all the
system properties that are available it
can be very useful sometimes for digging
into problems typically looking at the
class path can be interesting if you
have lots of scripts starting up you're
not really sure what ended up on this
class path in this case it is simple so
those were some simple things you can do
with with J command and some of the
other tools now I'm going to look a
little bit more an output from these
commands so you have probably used J
stack for getting a stack trace
so let's this requires a process
identifier there we go we get complete
thread dump from the JVM you can do the
same thing with J command
it's called thread print get the same
output it's just different ways of
executing the same thing so if you look
at this output you typically have you
get the stack traces for each of the
threads so in this example here we have
a main thread it has the Java priority
of 10 this is an internal identifier of
the thread this is actually the
operating systems thread identifier we
get to see that it's currently sleeping
and thread sleep that's what the sleeper
does it sleeps not very interesting
what's may not be as well-known is that
the stack traces also include a deadlock
detection feature if you have a deadlock
I have a program which has a deadlock
incidentally so
J I can't spell sorry read print there
we go
so at the end of this long printing of
threads we see that the JVM found one
Java level deadlock in this case thread
one is waiting to lock a monitor a Java
line object which is held by thread zero
thread zero is waiting to lock another
monitor head by thread one it's a
classic deadlock they may involve a
deadlock may involve more than two
threads so it made me a lot more
complicated than this simple example you
also get a list of their stack traces
for the threads involved in the deadlock
below here and deadlock detection
actually works if you're using a Java
util concurrent locks as well the
previous example was just normal
synchronized statements in Java
same thing with the process that has a
that uses Java util concurrent locks
reentrant lock to cause a deadlock you
see the same thing thread one is holding
on to a large the thread zero long other
thread sorry thread one wants a lock the
thread zero is holding on to and thread
zero is holding on to a lot of thread
one same thing you also get the stack
trace in this case but it's a lot more
stuff in there
Jake Amanda's new and Jadakiss seven
maybe seven you four think maybe is that
true okay
7u four although yeah I'm running
pre-build of seven to ten whatever
another thing that you can find out from
these actresses is the you can use it to
determine the CPU usage in terms of
threats normally you have a process that
is using a lot of CPU you only see from
the operating system that well there's a
process using lots of CPU but you can't
really figure out which thread inside of
the Java program is using that CPU so to
show you that will start a little
program that uses up my CPU I don't know
if you can see the little monitor up
here but it turned blue meaning that
someone's using CPU resources we can use
PS with some options and we will filter
out only this is almost unreadable
anyway there is one threat this or this
lists all the threads running inside the
Java process and it lists the CPU usage
per thread so there's one thread here
using 98% of the CPU this is the thread
ID of that thread can you remember the
number for me we will then go look for
for that thread in
in the output and we quickly discover
that these are hexadecimal numbers and
the thing we were looking for was not it
was a decimal number and I can't
remember what the number was 72 20 okay
good good you're awake
72 20 so 1c 34 and here's the thread
inside a program it's the main thread in
this case you could have guessed that by
looking at the stack trace but anyway
sometimes it may be useful let me kill
that process so I don't keep burning CPU
so the JVM also publishes a ton of quite
detailed performance data from inside of
the JVM this is garbage collections what
code is jittered and a lot more
information you can actually get at this
information as well with a tool called J
stat I'm going to take a look at young
space collections with the help of J's
dad so if we take a look at what
processes are running we ask for GC new
data from 677 for which is a GC process
and we wanted every one second so we get
some data which is almost unreadable
again because of the but anyway every
every second this will sample
performance counters from inside of the
JVM and we can see this column here
called EC is the capacity current
capacity of Eden it's always the same in
this case the e.u is the usage it edan
usage you can see it fluctuate over time
and now you can't see it but over here
and this column here is the sequence
number for the garbage collection of a
young space garbage collection and in
this column here is that time so it 2.7
seconds to do this garbage collection in
this time this in this example
yeah so we correlate so the question is
in the previous example I showed how you
could find a thread used a lot of CPU
and what I did was correlate information
from PS which showed the CPU usage per
thread and then information from the
stack trace showing you which thread
that was in in terms of javathread so
the JVM itself doesn't provide that
information but using the operating
system ended JVM commands together you
can find out so another example of
information from J stat we start a
little program that does something and
we can say print comm elation 473 for
every one sorry every one second we see
the JIT compiler doing its work in
filing a number of methods in this
example
I don't know if that's useful but you
can also list so there's a whole set of
options yes that - options will tell you
the the available options so you can see
class class loading for example when it
happens and a lot of other information
from the garbage collector that I didn't
show you can also take a peek at the raw
data that this is using by using the J
command curve counter print we get to
see all of these counters so they're
typically some name of a counter and
some value and there's 200 of these I
think something
so now that we're talking garbage
collection I'm going to look at some
other commands that are useful for
looking at the heap the first is a class
histogram this will show you what the
number of instances for each class that
are currently loaded on the heap I will
also show you the total size for each
instance type this can be useful for as
an initial way of finding memory leaks
if typically if you see one class
growing over time that's an indication
of a memory leak for that type and I
have a little program here that leaks
memory let's start it in the background
then let's look at the class histogram
for that so in this example we see that
we have 92 thousand instances of hash
map entries and almost the same amount
of instances of a class called key and
hash map entries are taking up to point
nine megabytes of space if we do this
again same command we see that now we
have we've grown through to 300,000
instances and if I keep doing this
you'll see the number go up it's a it's
a typical case of a memory leak you can
do you can get the same output I show
the J command you can get the same up
with J map - histo i think mr but then
you need to specify the process
identifier I didn't have that but it's a
sense another way of getting to the same
information
while taking the snapshot yes it's it's
like a garbage collection sorry the
question was this blocks the application
threads while you do this yes it's like
doing a garbage collection going through
the whole heap counting all the
instances so if you if you figure out
that maybe I have a memory leak you
probably want to create a heap dump that
you want to analyze later in more detail
you can also do that with J command so
let's do that for the sleeper process in
this case GC the heap dump and we also
have to give the name of the v we want
to save it in and this as you can see
this does a full garbage collection it
creates a heap dump that's their 1.1
megabytes not that big very small heap
in this stupid example typically to look
at that heap you want to use a visual
tool such as visual VM for example or
there's an eclipse project called memory
analyzer tool I think mat which is also
very useful for looking at these kinds
of heap dumps which brings us to visual
VM which I will demo a little bit
so official VM is also a tool included
in the JDK a graphical tool in this case
here you get a list of all the processes
running on the system you can click on
one to show you more information about
it you get to see the system properties
down here for example you can get a live
monitor I hope you can see the tiny
graphs we see the heap usage here for
example you see each garbage collection
as it happens and the heap usage goes
down so let's take a look at how we
could use what visual VM would look like
if we look at a memory leak so I will
start the leaking program again in the
background so it showed up here
instantly will go sorry
ah I have to yeah that's unfortunate
no I don't want to kill that one what do
we have
that I think yeah so let's start it
again fresh a fresh leak close that one
Thanks yeah it's a it just used a J
command to list the process identifier
finds out that and the skill minus nine
on it so we can look at the monitor for
this and we see the heap here growing
over time and growing and growing
growing and never shrinks the blue line
is the used heap we can then do a heap
dump in here get a heap dump you can see
you can't see sorry
there you can see the instances on the
heap in this it's the same histogram
that we looked at earlier and if we take
another dump we can compare this with
the previous dump
in the loire we see that between these
two dumps we increase the number of
instances for these two classes by
almost 200 thousand you can then use
this to drill down into the instances
all right we can click on something here
that's leaking you can hardly see this
can you I'm sorry about that not much I
can do about it either you can go try
this at home
so anyway with this view you can look
backwards from from one instance you can
look backwards to who is referencing it
in this case we have something called
key which is referenced from a hashmap
entry which is referenced from a hashmap
entry array which is referenced from a
hash the field table in a hash map and
we get all the way down to my little
program called leak which which has a
hash map that's apparently leaking
memory I'm going to kill that so we
don't have that running anymore
another useful feature in visual VM is a
profiler let's take a quick look at that
sampler profiler we can profile either
memory or CPU in this case we see well I
don't know what is the little program
I'm looking at is doing XSLT
transformations so maybe these names are
a little bit weird because they're
generated but you get a call graph here
of who is calling who and where time is
spent
I'm not going to dig into details of
exactly what this means you can figure
it out
by playing with the tools and reading
the manual by yourself
sorry ok yes J console is another
graphical tool that's available in the
JDK that does similar things it's a
little bit less advanced but it it does
show you the same kind of graphs so so
far we've all only looked at live JVMs
JVM - they're currently running but the
JDK also has some tools that can look at
core files if you happen to have a core
file of a crashed JVM around that
shouldn't happen but it might you can if
you don't have a core file you can still
use these tools with a G core utility
and Linux for example to create the core
file to create a snapshot of your
process and then maybe later analyze it
there might be use cases for that I have
a core file 13 gigabytes something no
megabyte whatever we can run J stack on
this for example and to do that you need
to specify the executable that you use
to start in this case my java is here
and you specify the core file
and here's a thread dump for that
horrified it looks like someone was
playing Sudoku I wonder who could have
done that
JC I can also show you the native frames
so you see the JVM in action or a Jane I
library if that's what you're doing you
had - em and you get some output that's
a little bit harder to interpret but
typically you see some native frames on
the stack here and you also see some
names that are very hard to read because
they're mangled
unfortunately that should be fixed okay
so that was the end of the demos I'm
going to switch back to my presentation
and I'm going to talk a little bit more
about internals how this all works
behind behind the scenes but before I do
that I wanted to mention remote access
to the JVM I've only showed you local
access now because it didn't make sense
to do anything else on just one laptop
there are two ways you can access JVM
remotely
the first one is JMX this is what visual
VM and J console users through JMX you
have access to all the information from
the java.lang management mbeans which is
garbage collection information threading
operating system there's a lot of a lot
of stuff in there JMX uses both ssl and
authentication to make sure that it's
secure
you can either enable JMX at startup
with some parameters or this is new you
can start it from bio J comments or J
command management servers out start and
you need to specify a lot of parameters
to get it started very useful if you
forgot to do that before we are also
adding support to the J max access here
for running diagnostic commands or the
the DJ commands all of those commands
are also going to be accessible over jmx
the other way to access the JVM is to
use J stat D this is a demon for J stat
so you run J study on your server
typically and you can connect to that
with a normal J stat application
so you've connect to the server to DJ
study which we'll talk locally to the
JVM and send back the information J stat
D has no encryption or authentication so
be a little bit careful there so let's
look at the internals
how does JPS and J come and find the JVM
s that are running on the system well
each JVM the starts will create a file
in a well known location in slash temp
HS perfect data your username you may
have seen these files lying around
wondering what they were and so JP s and
Jacob and typically all they do is list
the files in this directory and that's
how they know that running JVMs so each
JVM that starts will create a file with
its with the name of its process
identifier and just at that directory
and it will delete it when the JVM stops
running
unfortunately in JVMs can crash or be
killed
so if there are any dangling files in
there they will be garbage collected
when when a JVM starts so JVM that
starts will create its own file there it
will also look through all the other
files to make sure that those processes
are still running and because both J
command and JPS are Java programs they
the JVM they run inside will clean this
up before they actually look at this
directory so that's how they find the
JVM but how do they actually communicate
with a JVM in most cases the answer to
this is attach the attached framework
this allows for sending commands let's
call them that to to the JVM the JVM
will process these commands internally
and send back some text output to the
tool attached only works for the locally
on the same machine and only works for
the same user as running the JVM so
that's how it is secure this is what J
command J stack and J map uses the
mechanics for doing this is different on
different platforms on the UNIX assist
the let's take J command as an example J
command then we'll create a file in
slash temp called dot attach pit and did
of the JVM it wants to attach to it will
then send the secret signal to the JVM
usually when a JVM receives say quit it
will do a thread dump but if it finds
this special file it won't do a three
dump instead it will create a socket in
slash temp dot Java tid and this socket
is then used for from communicating
between J command and JVM so sending the
command over that socket and getting the
result back Solaris does the same thing
except it uses the door API on slice
instead of a socket on Windows it's a
little bit different here the remote
process will actually inject some code
into the JVM into the process space of
the JVM through some operating system
calls it will then create a thread
inside the JVM this thread will call the
injected code the injected code would
look up a JVM function called JVM and
cue operation and that's how it will
send the command to the JVM the result
will then be read back from from a pipe
so these diagnostic commands that you
can execute over via attach this is what
attach will execute in the end these are
helper routines created inside of the
JVM they can do almost anything that's
possible to do within a JVM but
typically they're for diagnosing so they
do something gather some information and
print it back as I said these can be
executed with J command or soon but with
jmx
they have a self-describing health
facility so every time one of these
diagnostic commands is created in the
JVM you have to specify all the
parameters and some little help text for
them and as I said there's different
commands for each platform of the JVM so
it's very useful that there's a little
help command so you know what what's
available now let's look at what J stat
uses to find its information that
discovery file I talked about it's not
an empty file it's actually a memory
mapped file that has all the runtime
information that we looked at with with
J stat so the JVM creates this file it
Maps it into its memory it will
continuously update these counters in
memory and J stat will just read it from
this file
so here's a little diagram showing you
all the access paths to the JVM you can
see that there's jmx there is attached
and there's JVM stat which are the
different paths into the JVM on the left
there is there's a J command for example
using attach to connect to the JVM or in
the middle here we have J stat D also
talking to the JVM and on the right side
we have another machine where J stat for
example is used to talk over a RMI to J
study which then talks to the JVM
there's also JMX client like Vishal VM
or J console or Mission Control so a
little recap of the different ways to
talk to the JVM there's attached and gay
vmstat for local access or these only
attached is a two-way protocol JVM start
can only read information for remote
access you have JMX
and Jace that D only JMX in this case is
a two-way protocol you also have the
serviceability agent which is what's
used to talk to core files or read core
files that I showed you earlier it can
also actually talk to a running JVM if
it wants to it uses a debugger to talk
to the core file or the process so this
should be used as a last resort if you
actually have to typically a JVM that's
hung you can't attach to it because that
requires JVM to actually be running but
using a debugger you can attach to it
you can get information out of it and
that's what the serviceability agent is
you use it with J stack pipe saying the
executable on a core file or dash F for
force and the process identifier
and the little diagram showing you how a
J stack for example in this case is
built on top of serviceability agent
which uses a debugger to attach to the
JVM
so a lip look at what's coming in the
future the first thing I want to talk
about is the Java flight recorder there
was a session earlier today about the
flight recorder you may have listened to
if you have used a rocket you may
recognize this as the J rocket flight
recorder flight recorder anyway is a JVM
built-in profiler and tracer it's built
to have very low overhead so that it can
be always turned on it uses circular
buffers in memory to capture information
for about the JVM and the application
that's running on top of the JVM the
typical use case for this is you
discover something is drawn in your
application you can then dump the
information from these buffers and then
you will have the information leading up
to what went wrong so you have some
informations you can see what happened
before it went wrong can be very useful
and that's what the name comes from
apparently so it will capture both
information from the JVM and the
application so garbage collections locks
compiler events exceptions CPU usage IO
information also something that's going
to be added to over time another list of
things that's coming Java Mission
Control again if you use J rocket you
may recognize this as the J rocket
Mission Control this is a graphical tool
that provides very detailed runtime
monitoring information from the JVM you
can think of it as J console but on
steroids it's also the graphical
front-end for JFR or for a flight
recorder which you can use to visualize
you can query information you can sort
things back and forth you can create
graphs of the information that you've
gathered
as I said we're also adding more
diagnostic commands to J command the
goal is to make this a very powerful
tool
eventually we're planning on replacing J
stack J map J and for all the other
tools with just one front end but it has
to be at least as good as the other
tools before we can do that JM x 2 dot o
something we're picking up again and
will start at a very long time ago we're
trying to revive that project now so if
you have any thoughts about what should
be in JM x 2 dot o let us know it's very
interesting we're also working on
improving the logging inside of the JVM
so the current state of logging into JVM
is a little bit sad there's one
subsystem for logging for each subsystem
in the JVM so everyone has written their
own little logging features there's a
proliferation of different Flags not all
features are available to all subsystems
of for example only the garbage
collection logs have rotation none of
the other logs have that so we're trying
to unify this to make it easier to use
it and also for us easier to maintain
the code there's a Java enhancement
proposal I think Jeff is short for
called 1:58 which you can go look at if
you want to have more information about
this the last thing I wanted to mention
is the Java discovery protocol that
we're working on which is a little way
for a JVM to broadcast information on
the local area network about here I am
so that graphical tools such as J
console or Mission Control can find it
and connect to it easily we're going to
publish a jet for that within a few
weeks I think we're working on it right
now
right so I think that was the end of
this I hope that you have learned
something new and hopefully something
useful if you haven't learned something
new then that's good do you know
everything and by the way we are hiring
I also hope you learned something useful
and if you didn't I would like to know
what would be useful for you so please
let us know and go and experiment with
with the tools and questions yes ok so
the question is I run on with the JRE in
production and I don't have access to
the tools you can just copy them over
yeah that and you need the tools dot jar
file sure work
any other questions sorry
huh yeah enlisted processes yes
sometimes you don't see all the JVMs in
vishal vm
uh-huh okay so that sounds like a bug
send me an email and describe it we can
file a bug for it okay in JDK 7 Vishal
VM doesn't find any processes okay
apparently I did for me when in 7 update
10 so it may be fixed yeah
did you see oh yeah
how much hmm yeah I did show the demo on
Linux for a reason that may have been
part of the reason yeah the Mac support
is a bit behind unfortunately we're
working on it to show slow methods so in
Vishal VM you can do a profile which
will show you where time is spent CPU
time is spent and that this is an
indication of a slow method or at least
a method where he's spending a lot of
time it may not be slow it just does a
lot of work but ok yeah
so I think visual VM starts the question
was how the eye I said visual VM uses
JMX how does it actually start gmx and i
think it does it with it uses the
attached framework I think to load a
using the java.lang instrument API you
can load a jar file which hooks into the
JVM and then that jar file can start the
JMX process it's a bit convoluted if
they would redo it now with the support
we added for management server to start
I think that's the way to to use it it
can start it for local processes but it
can't start it for remote process yes
request
I can't provide timelines sorry that's
what the big legal thing said in the
beginning yeah
yes oh so what's the problem or what's
the limits of running this in production
so yes some of the tools does a full
garbage collection like dumping the heat
doing a class histogram if that's a
problem then yeah that's a problem using
JMX to monitor should have very little
overhead it's going to create a couple
of threads in your process but other
than that I think the overhead is very
small
flight recorder of course is built to be
very low overhead so and designed to be
used in production so that should be
fine I wouldn't use the serviceability
agent in production if I absolutely
don't have to
find that
just because I couldn't find it for
so the in J console you can access the
mbeans directly but in you can find out
in Vishal VM and I actually don't know
if that's available or not there's a ton
of different plugins for visual DM so
perhaps one of those solves it I don't
know there is a plug-in that shows you
damn being okay okay I don't know that's
right I wasn't aware of that parameter
there are way too many parameters to
starting jmx I think yeah
Instagram
no that's him
yeah I thought the question was in the
heap histogram can you see what
generation garbage collection generation
these things are in and no there is no
way but I told you understand your use
case that would be an interesting
addition to have yes yeah
no I think the model is free for
development but charged for in
production I believe that stuff
okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
