joining the webcast so as you Natalie
said I'm one syllable school I working
information security second talking team
in linear presale center I'm actually
basically the first moment and the topic
i'll be covering during today's webcast
is around the use of security as a
business enabler for mobile cloud and
social black homes
together with me the Anthony's work he
is a principle consultant based in the
UK he'll be answering a lot of your
questions which I'm sure will come up
and he will also be supporting my web
cast all right so before we go any
further I just need to show you the
usual legal disclaimer slide
now
a couple of words about our agenda today
first we're going to look at wise
mobility importance because mobility
something everyone is talking about at
the moment and having lots of
conversation with a lot of people a lot
of customers in the industry that wants
to know about mobility so just to
understand what the big hype is is all
about my busy at the moment the second
one would be to look at what the
security mutations are so we said that
mobility is important but actually what
are the things we should be talking
about are there the same concerns you
would normally get with any other sort
of identity and access management
information to die projects or are the
different challenges and finally we're
going to take a look at some of the some
of the ways can address some of these
challenges and as Natalie said we will
have time for a Q&amp;amp;A session but if you
have any questions then bio-inspired in
your chat window and either Anthony will
answer them on the spot or it will pick
them up and answer them at the end
so taking the first topic why is
mobility so important you can go for
yourself on the internet and have a look
at so many reports at the moment with
various stats &amp;amp; information that really
show that mobile is becoming the
dominant so here's just one particular
statistic that I picked up from a morgan
stanley research report it's actually
quite a couple of years old but actually
if you go and look at today's up-to-date
information you would see that it's
pretty much the same what what basically
saying is that mobile is becoming the
predominant channel because the morgan
stanley research we go to form a couple
of years ago they they they estimated
that the turning point between desktop
or mobile actually acquiring right about
now so between now and next year it will
be about 50 50 and then as you see on
the graph it's going to start increasing
and mobile with the actual channel tools
so what does actually mean to you as an
organization well what it means is
firstly that your customers are more
likely to be accessing your services
where their mobile devices and also it
means that your employees are most
likely to be accessing your enterprise
systems using mobile devices obviously
when we're when we're talking about
mobile devices we're talking about both
smartphones and tablets and all kinds of
devices so mobile is not going away that
is for sure and back you don't quite get
away
okay so just to quantify some of these
figures and sort of scale what what what
we're talking about here so firstly you
can see the 83 vs vs went to state a
statement in there what it says that
eighty-three percent of enterprise like
university mobile is 30 people or the
organization whether that's or the
customer base or or the employee base
for the moment though only twenty-two
percent have a strategy on mobile so it
would be interesting to understand
within your own organizations do you
know if you have a mobile strategy at
the moment so is it something that
you're aware of is it something that you
as an organization are thinking at the
moment is that strategy more focused
total employees or is it just focused on
the performance these are very natural
questions and these are questions that
you need to be thinking about winning
organization to understand actually on
the on the on the overall mobile journey
where you currently are now that's a
fairly big number here ten billion that
the research behind it suggests that by
2016 there will be 10 billion smaller
devices on the planet so that's a big
big customer base to go to to try to
address and it's a large number of
employees with with with devices also
though that will be try to actually sure
your own price systems
you
here's an R interesting statistic saying
that tons of traffic on the Internet
Mobile has grown all over one hundred
and twenty-five percent over the last
year compared to desktop so the figures
are actually suggesting that mobile is
becoming predominant and these are
actually backed up by the fact that
traffic is showing that as well
also at a conference that garner held a
couple of weeks ago they actually
suggested that by 2020 eighty percent of
user access would be for mobiles or
community devices so as you can see here
from all these years there is a massive
explosion in terms of use of mobile
devices
okay so you may as well ask me what does
that mean for for an organization what
does it mean for my organization well in
my view it means that you need to start
thinking about a mobile-first strategy
or at least that mobile should be an
absolute key part of your strategy
because actually if you think about it
the the dominance of mobile really means
we need to shift our thinking there's
lots of benefits from adapting the
mobile approach it means that we can
start to think about applications /
function for instance or parole so
rather than having a big wide
all-encompassing enterprise application
on the desktop we can actually build
mobile apps and the apps could be could
have their address specific functions or
very very specific roles within an
enterprise system for instance let's
let's take a a big a large enterprise
system inside of which we can have an
application that covers just expensive
or just time and attendance and and so
on it also means that I can start taking
advantage of some of the real benefits
of the mobile channel so i think i can
bring some start to look at things like
how i use my location awareness for
instance how i use the device
capabilities things like the camera or
other other gadgets that i have on my
device and all these become a way to
improve the experience for the user to
connect it to make the application more
intuitive to the to the end user and
this is pretty much one of the main
goals when it comes to mobility so these
are things that are available when we
compare that with their desktop
equivalence that are quite limited in
terms of capabilities on the flip side
of that because there is one
so the flip side of that is that that
that actually move that things like
usability become more more more and more
important longer than just an option
it's actually something that became a
must so you really need to start
thinking about be about things like
appearance and usability of your
applications and this would be quite
important especially on on the customer
side because if the customers don't like
your application they will simply not
use it they will use your competitors
for your carpet your competitions
application or they will simply use some
other from some other articles out there
so there are pretty much other things
you need to be thinking about things
like over-the-air consideration so so
pushing out updates for your application
over the network how that affects things
like data roaming costs and we need to
start to think about the sort things in
India mobility Europe you also have to
recognize very quickly that the app that
you put out there on the on the app
store will become part of your brand so
you need to make sure that you get it
right you need to make sure that it's
consistent with the rest of your brand
messaging for your organization
the other consider
that is that there's not just one device
out there and I suppose this is this is
quite a good analogy with with the
browser compatibility issues we saw
years ago where you had some apps that
would work on Firefox and Safari and
some other applications that would not
work on things like Internet Explorer
for instance we pretty much have the
same challenge here we have lots of
different choices that are very diverse
that have different capabilities a lot
of devices out there so it's really
about understanding and taking
advantages of all the platforms that you
need
sorry so devices are only going to get
smarter they're only going to get more
intelligent so that's going to allow us
take advantage of these new capabilities
more applications more more engaging we
will obviously make them faster more
interesting views which which is really
the exact opposite of what we're saying
with desktop applications of course
maybe I'm a little unfair saying that
the window staff application on your
right you can see from from from the
slide right now is the is quite old and
antique and so on then put that
applications have moved on a long way
but even so they're not and they will
probably never be as intuitive and as
usable as you will see in a mobile app
so a very good example of the use of
mobility is the wrong social networking
for me these things go hand in hand
whenever we're talking about utilizing
mobile it's really about improving the
customer experience by engaging the
customer year earlier and it's it's very
much about making their experience more
symbols social sign-on in my opinion the
key part of that process so you've all
seen websites like the one that you are
currently seeing where you get a
registration form and there they ask you
everything including your invite your
pet name you're your mother's maiden
name on phone now this is one of the
most common reasons people will drop off
websites and we're pretty much they will
even drop stop transactions on a website
just because of that if you get halfway
through buying some let's say and all of
a sudden you get a registration page on
which you get to feel I don't know 10 15
20 fields that's certainly going to put
you off so with it is very very commonly
across so many different websites that
but we actually where things start
change is that for instance if you look
at the screenshot on the right we start
to get the ability to use social
networking from now rather than asking
the user to feel all these forms we
pretty much allow the user to take
advantage of their existing social
notebooks so what we're doing is and and
what we are encouraging everyone to do
is to take the information from their
social networks and to make the process
easier for the user from an end user
point of nudity that'll be great they're
not feeling lots of information they
already feel their data on Facebook
Google or LinkedIn so why not we use
that it means
for user that he's in control of the
data but it also means that from an
organization there's a number of
benefits for instance I can get the
identity of the user earlier within the
process and not presenting him with a
big cumbersome Richard registration form
that will obviously put out the users of
the last chance that the user is going
to drop off transaction orderly beside
it also means that data yet about the
user is likely more accurate with at
least things like the name and email
address more likely to correct it also
that means that you can start a new
social networking or things like target
marketing and there's a lot of
additional supplements reinstate
abilities attached to that
now from a security perspective what we
start to see that the registration forms
go away and instead we get the option to
actually log in with either username or
password or one of the pre-existing
social social accounts so for instance
once I decide to do that is the as an
end user I will be asked to login into
that into that social site if I'm not
already logged in and then i will be at
permission to release my information to
the organization that requiring it so
it's pretty much putting me as a user in
control of my data but it's also
allowing me to share that with an
organization and and there according to
reduce my effort with the things I
registration poems
a large number of benefits we can get
from using social sign-on if we think
about mobility in general and mobility
and social going handy and then for
registration it actually presents a
great opportunity from a mobile point of
view we can take advantage of these
growing mobile user base there's a
number of customers out there that don't
use desktops at all and this is the fact
they don't have computers at home they
want to get purely pretty much wants you
to use nothing but tablets for fun as
well as for work so by embracing the
mobile channel with that we can get all
of these of this growing of this growing
customer base it also means that by
using the mobile channel we can get
things out to the market quicker it
means that we can start to push more
services through the channel and that at
the same time we can take advantage of
the advanced capabilities on the devices
and start to improve the user experience
so user will actually want the
application you know as well as I do you
always use the application that's going
to be that's easier to use the quicker
to use the one that takes advantage of
your location for instance the one this
one is your camera and so on so there
are definitely growing opportunities if
and only if you get it right if we look
at it from a social perspective it means
that we can engage your town or users
earlier if we can take away that painful
registration process by letting the user
login via Facebook or Google work or
whatever their favorite search social
network is don't get me wrong I'm not
suggesting that we all should get rid of
logging forms and usernames and
passwords and just use login via
Facebook
there are challenges associated with
that and that's what we're going to be
talking about
so what are the security implications so
yes mobile isn't that big a great
channel presenting great opportunity to
us but there are different security
challenge the challenge is associated
with mobile and social that we don't
necessarily get from the traditional
challenge channel we are accustomed wave
let's look at some of these so
the first one for for me basically is
lost its way way easier to lose a mobile
device then say a laptop or a desktop if
that mobile device is the gateway to
access information within your
organization think about the case of
bring your own device for instance where
you can bring your own device will work
then that becomes a challenge through a
security perspective so how do I make
sure that that device doesn't get lost
and then use lack of information within
the organization the next big big one is
if stolen so we've seen this thing the
same thing happening with laptops it
looks like a bigger problem when we're
doing with mobile devices two reasons to
tori's and two main reason for that
pretty much the first one is that phones
are not cheap devices if you look at the
latest iPhone that just came up a couple
of months ago they're around 600 700
pounds which makes them very lucrative
target for thieves they're very very
small very very lightweight very
includes feel but there's also another
angle to this that has become quite
interesting in the last couple of years
since mobile devices became these days
the Gateway practice corporate
information they can actually become
target into the skull this is actually
what we're what we're seeing nowadays so
these are doing it we are we are seeing
employees or organization being targeted
to get to sensitive information to
employ devices
another interesting challenge is looking
at where our data sleep so for instance
out of the sudden if we we got mobile
devices actual data whether its customer
facing or an oil painting typically the
information will be accessed over the
import this means that we have to expose
particularly sensitive information out
to the Internet so what we need to start
considering is what are the implications
of pushing out information onto onto
public network that was typically
previously sitting within our private
network in summer in the back of our our
our words
lastly we have malware on the lid or
Mallory has been around for a long time
but obviously we're seeing big threats
around security devices and as you can
see from on a phone certificate in 2012
and where it is by far the more targeted
platform again something to keep in mind
when building mobile applications and
closing information sensitive private
information through the disk is your
channel
you
so let's look at some of the challenges
we need to be thinking about the first
one is security we have a lot we have a
whole lot of devices out there but
depending on whether you're you're
working in the corporate space or you're
looking at the customer space the split
between devices is very very different
at the moment the carpet the carpet
world is by far very eccentric while the
consumer words is by far Android sample
so in a way irrespective of what device
from a security perspective we have a
whole array of devices out there and we
need to start thinking about the
capabilities of each device security the
credit of each the threats to each
device depending on operating system and
so on when we start looking at security
of mobile applications typically we
can't use any existing security that we
have so for instance most organizations
have a wide range of security out there
with things like web access management
securing web services or user directory
and and so on but chances are that you
probably can't use that on your mobile
platform these are things we need to be
look these are things we need to be
looking at when dealing with security
for mobile basil's device control is
also quite quite important with with
employees if you're issuing bonds turns
out we may get more control over over
the user's device for instance to only
installed certain applications that we
know are certain that we know our trust
with and so on but we certainly cannot
do that with customers we cannot control
control what applications are installed
on on our customers homes and also with
this new move towards big girl device
which is becoming more and more
in the market this type of locking down
people people devices is really not an
not an option so as an organization
pushing information out there we have
quite limited device control from a
compliance perspective what we have to
make sure is that we are only providing
the right information to the right
people and at the right time so the big
question we're asking from a security
perspective is how do we centrally
manage security by not coding it
separately for mobile application but by
reusing the existing security
infrastructure while still remaining
compliance and this is a big challenge
the next challenge is their own user
experience so traditionally
traditionally where we're probably
talking about web-based application a
web-based single sign-on which are
pretty much very mature technologies you
login into one application you don't
have to login into goo &amp;amp; wall so you may
have at the moment you make music and
depressing will single science sign on
so you can do this access all all your
so you can access all your applications
on your desktop but the moment you will
be you will start to use mobile app
applications you will get a completely
different challenge since there is no
native single sign-on and this is this
is a big challenge consider consider
pretty much this important statistic
organizations are and writing just one
application so a good example of this
statement is each new go right now and
look at your app store and try to search
for for sky sky is in the TV channel and
you will notice that they put a whole
run range of different applications out
there some some are free to use like sky
news etc others where you can watch TV
on the go like sky girl and so on the
problem is that all these applications
require you to log in from a user
experience point of view at the moment I
log into each of those individually that
will pretty much turn my experience into
a terrible user experience because I am
so very used to having single sign-on
within original web channel so why
should it be different on when it comes
to the mobile channel related to the
negative single sign-on challenges are
the passwords help desk calls so we are
seeing a lot of organizations who are
actually seeing an increase in health
desk calls because users right logging
their native apps
they forget that passwords and that
there there may or unable to log in the
study is that around fifty percent of
help desk of heaven help desks worldwide
are struggling to keep up with mobile
applications and lots of that is late
credentials to reminding implied or
forgotten passwords problems with
logging in finally if we are not careful
we can end up with a very inconsistent
logging experience
let's say I'm one user with one identity
why should I try to log in two different
sides would be confidential whether it's
a native application world or website or
web application because as a customer I
do not care about these things I only
see the whole picture and one channel
and I feel that it's certainly not my
call the technology see the different
channels so when we think about mobile
and social it's pretty much about how we
improve user experience and exercise
effect having improved productivity
what about the challenge is the
developer has so for instance if I'm
writing mobile if I'm writing a native
mobile app I'm going to have to code
security and reach each of applications
but the problem is the typically have
the developer I'm not a security expert
so this is not my job my job is to build
business logic and business
functionality into an application
security is the complex area you have to
look at things like cryptography think
like managing means many conviction
securing storage or securing
transmissions and so on so if you if you
have developers that are not experts in
the field you will end up with a pretty
much longer development cycles and
guaranteed weak security again with
different developer teams for instance
you have some in-house developer
developer dream you had some contracted
developer team some third-party software
house and so on all existing
applications that that those teams will
be created so chances are that they're
they're going to implement the same
things but they are going to do it
slightly differently hence there's a
there's a big chance of inconsistent
logging experience so one major thing
one major thing we need to think about
is how to think we buy application
development while not cutting back on
the security
the next set of challenges is one that I
think a lot of people forget about this
is your own information act if let's say
I have an application on there that is a
very standalone application and just
provide information within it it's
probably a an application of very
limited down we will get real value part
of an application that interact with an
organization's resources that can
exchange information that can perform
transactions that's where the real value
comes from and the applications need to
need the application in to connect some
central services in order to get that
information and pretty much this model
is the same for all the inventions so in
order to do that and to do it early we
need to secure the end points so that we
can provide access from anywhere at any
time but while making sure we do that
for the right people we also don't want
to be to be using very very heavy weight
protocols when exchanging information
because they do incur data roaming
charges charges so we need to take that
into account as well this is another
another major major point that needs to
be taken into consideration when dealing
with mobile applications so when looking
at information we need to figure out how
do we make that information that
available internally probably not in the
right format or or the right level of
security so how do we how do we how do
we make it available into an interface
is its lightweight secure and can be
easily consumed by biden's mobile
and finally the last do collapse epoch
showing news is around social axis all
different social networks are based on
standards like off or open ID to enable
these this exchange of information
between the social network site and the
local site that pretty much is
requesting it although there are a
couple of standards out there the
problem is that the implementation are
the implementations are slightly
different so this type of integration
with each social provider to be coded
within your application also we need to
take to take into account the following
situation we need to link the account
that's coming from a social provider
with an existing local account within
the organization in order to prevent a
disconnect between accounts or people
having multiple accounts one of them
being local and the others being
provided by or social network identity
providers there's a there's a large
number of providers out there and this
also means that at times we can we can
get the conclusion that there is a lack
of trust in this type of this type of
log in this type of setup for instance
so I'll give you a very very short
example I can go on facebook and I can
create an account or let's say David
Cameron I can sign up on account form on
on gmail or David Cameron and use them
together so for all intents and purposes
Facebook things I'm undated camera this
means that using a social login for
things like home banking so home banking
application would probably be a good
idea but we can still use social
networking as a good
the war to get people through the war
and then to take control of a station
beyond that so pretty much really it's
about taking advantage of the
capabilities offered by the social media
platforms
so now the next point is to talk about
how do we address the challenges there's
a number of things we need to put in
place in order to address all of these
challenges mentioned above what I'm
going to do now is to tell you what
Oracle's approach in the spaces
I'm not going to focus on the entire
platform I'm just going to focus very
much on security it's worth to note that
within Oracle we have what we call the
Oracle mobile platform which is one
consistent consistent Blatt form for
building deploying managing mobile
applications a pretty much on on any any
device that need access to enterprise
information this platform is built on
five different areas and you can see the
first of them on the flight firstly it's
it's the developed cycle so the platform
supports multiple devices as part of a
multi-channel strategy and allows you to
build an application once and then use
it across multiple multiple devices but
also supports different things like the
mobile web native applications have
higher elevations and so on the second
building block of this platform is the
integrated cycle that enables you to get
that data out there to your mobile
application and two day customers within
urine right systems
your part is the big we'll be focusing
on security that provides a complete set
of capabilities are mobilizing in and
mobile application management to make
sure that the right users have access at
the right time and then we have the
buoyant manage cycles that handle the
life cycle of the applications and also
the infrastructure that underpinned the
navigations
mention out there so where to start well
for me it starts with with identity if
we're talking about mobile applications
user actions information we can't do any
of that unless we know who the person is
so really the focus for me is what
capabilities why do I need in order to
deliver those mobile application from a
secure consoles
you
from a mobile access management point of
view we need to start thinking about
some of these things about bridging the
gap that exists between traditional
identity and access management and
mobile devices we also need to start
thinking about more than just standard
authentication mechanisms things like
username and password because there's
more risk because we talked about
devices being stolen or lost and so on
so we need to start start talking we
would start talking about taking the
device into account taking things like
the location into account looking at
behavior patterns around the users and
devices and so on in order to support
this new mobile channel we need to start
looking at at securing those ideas as
well the ideas being the interfaces that
we offer to our actual internal systems
and because of the ever-increasing
bring-your-own-device organizational
behavior we need to start looking at
registering devices knowing who owns
what divides and so on we also need to
think about single sign-on we need
mechanisms in place that will allow us
to do single brand on across mobile
applications or across a mobile
application animal in a web application
and on top of them we need a platform
that has the visibility and control for
all all these capabilities so that
actually I can see who's logged in from
what divides and what they're doing in
and and so on
you
now from a social perspective we need to
think about how we turn social
integration from a coding exercise into
a nice trait very good sense so into
something that we call the the tick box
configuration so no need for for coding
just some proper administration in place
this will allow us very much to take the
integration of it out of the application
code and to make it easier to add for
instance new providers and things like
that we talked earlier about the lack of
trust on social network blogging so if
we're not going to allow people to be
sensitive transactions based on their
facebook login let's say we do need some
sort of a mechanism to get them to the
right level of authentication before we
let them do the more the more than
projected so we need to look at things
like the step up authentication for
instance and finally we need to support
all the relevant standards and pretty
much all the standards that are used
within the social networks to do the
interrogations standards like the all
the Federation open eyes and so on
so what what I got in mind is is and the
things I mean I've been telling you
about is exactly what Oracle what Oracle
has done with our existing guidance in
Active management class or what we've
done is to enhance or a given platform
to provide mobile and social
capabilities I'm going to very quickly
run through those we talked about them
on on on previous slide so first we have
a single sign-on so within Identity and
Access Management we can provide single
sign-on between native applications as
well as between native application and
web-based application so that we
actually do improve the user experience
so for instance user logs into an
application one then he doesn't have to
log into to the other applications that
are contained in the same domain in my
opinion this is critically hard doing
critically powerful when we're talking
about mobile and social and frankly I
see no way of doing mobile and social
without single sign-on secondly it's
vital to support standards like the one
needed to enable social login or and to
turn things into a dig box configuration
rather than a a coding exercise all you
have to do as an administrator is to
decide which identity provider you want
to use and to put their get the proper
control in place and you're done no need
for coding no need for for an additional
just that
you also need to be able to do the step
up step step up authentication so that
for instance we can do the things I
mentioned earlier login to our Facebook
account and then stepping up the
potential for providing in order to do
the most the more sensitive transactions
so for for that we are using a risk
engine that allows a user to log in
using the age for social login of a very
very low level of trust and then that
particular user would need to raise the
level of crush so we set that up we
provide a risk evaluation and we inside
how we want to authenticated users
api security there are quite a lot of
mechanisms that allow us security api
api is being aggravating for internal
coupons we are going to talk a bit late
later on about about that and finally
after all temptation we provide an
authorization we need to make sure that
a user is actually allowed to access
certain resource so let's let's talk a
bit about step up authentication i
mention i mentioned it a couple of times
just let's see if we can go into a bit
more detail so as you can see in this
slide we can grab in terms of
information anything from a username and
password we can do the social login the
second the second screen whether it's on
your desktop or in your home we can do
things like providing additional
challenges asking people for
pre-register questions or even sending
one time code blue to people's phones or
you know add the food and so on so
there's a there's a quite large number
of things from which we can choose and
we can actually do that from from drug
lling with configuration weekend and
choose from configuration what options
we want to allow the user to use in
order to authenticate and phones
moving on I i promised i'll be talking
more about you in the end so what we
need to be able to provide information
that later on will be consumed by these
mobile applications that information is
is not necessarily always the right
needed format is not always secured to
the right level we wanted so we need to
put the correct controls in place we'll
ask you to do that we need to secure the
eight yards we need to put some
authentication and authorization around
our API we need to look at things like
threat protection to make to make sure
there is no no malicious content that's
coming through those ad is in for
internal systems if necessary we might
need to transform the data and I'll give
you a very very simple example for
instance we may need to take a soap
service and translate it on the fly to
something that's more consumable more
easy bye-bye mobile devices and all the
things you can seek neither weekend we
can do that within work on mobile
platform we can put control and we can
put governance around the right guys so
we can see exactly losing them when
exactly when they're using them and what
if eight years are used which are the
ones that are preferred by customers and
other other controls around that and all
that integrates perfectly well with the
platform with your overall platform so
actually we have one common one common
platform the dodgy authentication one
single one common way in which we will
do other additional phone
okay so what we end up with essentially
is to entry points into into an
organization so you will end up with
with the traditional entry point which
is your web server or your web
applications which have their their own
policy enforcement points and then you
have your you have your API access
facilitate III v8 yeah gateway so both
of these components total common access
management platform at the back end and
that's what's providing the decisions
around authentication and authorization
and also a that's what's controlling
things like a single sign-on between
different product platforms that's
that's on the on the let's say
organizational side on the mobile side
this effect is facilitated by by having
the security agent that deals with the
with the interactions between the mobile
applications and the security
capabilities needed on the access
management platform
to summarize for me mobile and social
use gives us a great opportunity within
the market so it gives us a chance to
try and move out not just our existing
not our just all existing software
incidence the mobile space but also to
address market so using the access
management platform we can get our
information out there quicker into the
mobile channel we can write applications
much weaker we can use the lifecycle
management to get them out there much
liquor we can make development weaker
the development does not need to worry
about the security of the application we
will take care of that for them also
through the operational controls we get
better readability we can see who's
using our ideas and we can pretty much
enforce service level agreements to make
sure we're getting the right level of
service to our customers through the
security controls we can reduce the
level of risk then start to to look at
risk level access things like context
based access and we are pretty much
taking security out of individual
services and putting it onto a common
platform or better transparency better
agility and Indian better compatibility
finally we can we can reduce costs
because we're not doing it every single
time for every single application we're
shipping out there we're not doing it
big poke and because all of it sticks on
and on an existing platform that already
a number of customers have decoyed and
so this is pretty much a great great
advantage
now moving on to the to the Q&amp;amp;A session
uh Anthony any any questions out there
so say oh yeah just and I think you've
touched on this already a little bit but
a lot of customers do you have identity
and access management solutions out
there so is this kind of building
everything from the ground up again or
can you build on top of existing
infrastructure and how part of that sort
of work
well yeah absolutely you can you can do
that you can build on top of the gluten
structure I actually touched a bit more
on the on the topic during the
presentation but to be honest I think
you can you can tell us more about the
subject I know you way way more
knowledgeable about this at home
you
Anthony
protector
and today I think we're we're hearing
you intermittently at the moment yeah
sorry I things have a since I've dropped
off for a second there so yeah we didn't
end up getting a few other girl so sorry
about that yeah those than just does any
any other questions that supposed then
young people's thinking about was was in
terms of mobile devices so I guess a lot
of people you know it's kind of bringing
around the boss so they may be a little
bit nervous about using corporate
controls and corporate policies on their
mobile devices do you have anything that
you can do around that as well
absolutely there are convicted we can be
done for that obviously we're not
talking about locking in a user's phone
so yeah absolutely then you can deal
with the precise application that's
being being installed from your lawyer
let's say so for instance the moment
human psyche leave the company or the
moment let's say someone amor to kill
your phone or you lose it or whatever
they're ours that there can be can be
taken in order to make sure that the
information contained but first first of
all the your your device is not able to
access any more information and all the
information that has already been
obtained by that device and possibly
cashed will be will be removed so that
there is absolutely no no problem we
haven't even affected the users fine
certainly absolutely not absolutely no
no no just just the particular in
foreign tested the particular
application because that was installed
through the use of the app store
provided by the mville okay
okay i think that's that's that's the
other than any any questions for anyone
else is home
you
now it looks loop there aren't any but I
think it's time for us to round up
so very lucky Anthony particularly for a
great presentation very informational if
there's more abhi identities at the
websites that you see here you can also
use website for further information or
contractor and the video as well the
replay should be upon their thank
everyone for attending 60 wall here and
hopefully see you on another web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
