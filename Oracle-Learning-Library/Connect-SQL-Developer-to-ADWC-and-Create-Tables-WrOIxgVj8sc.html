database in your Autonomous Data
Warehouse Cloud to create tables in the
database. Open SQL Developer and click
new connection, to define a connection to
your Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud
Database.
Specify a name for this connection. Enter
the user name of a database user that
you previously defined. In this example
we are connecting to a user named adwc_user.
Enter the password for that user.
For connection type, select Cloud PDB. For
the configuration file field, click
browse and select the client credential
zip file that you or your cloud
administrator downloaded from the
Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service
console. For Keystore Password, enter the
password that you specified when you
downloaded the client credentials file.
For the Service field select low, medium,
or high. These service levels map to the
low, medium and high consumer groups. Test your connection definition and save it.
Then connect to your database.
Once you have connected SQL Developer
to your Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud
database, use a SQL Developer
worksheet to define create table
statements to create tables in the user
schema to which you are connected.
The SQL Developer script output panel
shows the tables that have been created
in the user named adwc_user.
The new tables also appear in the SQL
Developer connections panel.
The channels table displays details of
each column.
So far we have defined tables but these
tables are not yet populated with data.
The next video in this series shows how
to load data into tables of your
Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud database.
In the meantime, we can immediately
examine data in two sample schemas, SH and
SSB, that are pre-populated in the
Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud.
The SH schema contains the small data
set of Sales History sample data,
allowing you to run some simple queries.
Here we see the pre-populated data for
the countries table. The SSB, or star
schema benchmark schema, provides a
well-known, large sample data set. The SSB
schema contains one terabyte of data,
which you can use to test the
performance of your service.
For detailed steps on performing the
examples shown in this video, go to the
Oracle Learning Library and open the
tutorial named, &quot;Connecting SQL
Developer and Creating Tables.&quot; Find out
