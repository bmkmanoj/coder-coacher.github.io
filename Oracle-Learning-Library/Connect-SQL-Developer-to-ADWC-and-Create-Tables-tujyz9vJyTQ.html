sequel developer to a database in your
autonomous data warehouse cloud and then
create tables in the database
Open sequel developer and define a
connection to your autonomous data
warehouse cloud database specify a name
for this connection enter the user name
of a database user that you previously
defined in this example we are
connecting to a user named ad WC user
enter the password for that user for
connection type select cloud PDB for the
configuration file field click browse
and select a client credential zip file
that you or your cloud administrator
downloaded from the autonomous data
warehouse cloud service console for
keystore password enter the password
that you specified when you downloaded
the client credentials file for the
service field select low medium or high
these service levels map to the low
medium and high consumer groups test
your connection definition and save it
then connect to your database
once you have connected sequel developer
to your autonomous data warehouse cloud
database use a sequel developer
worksheet to define create table
statements to create tables in the user
schema to which you are connected the
sequel developer script output panel
shows the tables that have been created
in the user named ad WC user
the new tables also appear in the sequel
developer connections panel
here we see the details of each column
of the channels table keep in mind so
far we have defined tables but these
tables are not yet populated with data
the next video in this series shows how
to load data into tables of your
autonomous data warehouse cloud database
in the meantime we can immediately
examine data in two sample schemas SH
and SSB that are pre-populated in the
autonomous data warehouse cloud
the SH schema contains the small data
set of sales history sample data
allowing you to run some simple queries
here we see the pre-populated data for
the countries table the SSB where star
schema benchmark schema provides a
well-known large sample data set the SSB
schema contains one terabyte of data
which you can use to test the
performance of your service
for detailed steps on performing the
example shown in this video go to the
Oracle Learning Library and open the
tutorial named connecting sequel
developer and creating tables
