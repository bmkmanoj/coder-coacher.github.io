server pools in an overview of the
create server pools wizard in Oracle
Enterprise Manager opscenter a server
pool is a group of one or more
virtualization hosts of the same kind
one or more guests reside on each
virtualization host these virtualization
hosts shared the storage and network
resources allocated to the server pool
in a super pool you can move guests
among virtualization hosts you can use
this feature for load balancing and
server maintenance without disrupting
the service also repulse require and
network domain a storage library in at
least one virtualization hose there are
extra prerequisites depending on the
virtualization technology let's quickly
review some information about the three
common requirements for server pulls and
knobs center virtualization hosts of a
server pool must use the same
virtualization technology in the same
architecture App Center supports Oracle
Solaris zones for spark or x86 an oracle
vm server for spark or x86 as their
virtualization technology a network
domain can be defined as a network
container and it must have at least one
network a server pool is associated with
a network domain an old virtualization
hosts in the server pool are associated
with the same set of networks storage
libraries stored the metadata of the
virtualization hosts and guests and also
provide a storage for virtual disks
let's continue with an overview of the
create server pools wizard an OP Center
you can create and configure a new
server pool to manage your
virtualization hosts and guests will
review how to create a server pool using
Oracle Solaris owns the steps on the
wizard changed based on the
virtualization technology that you
choose so let's get started the first
step of the wizard requires us to
provide a name and define the
virtualization technology for the server
pool we can select among Oracle Solaris
zones for spark or x86 in oracle vm
server for spark or x86 for the
virtualization technology click Next to
continue now we need to select the
virtualization host members of the
server pool which in this example our
global stones the wizard lists the
eligible members
for the type of server pool we are
creating you must select at least one
virtualization host but to take full
advantage of load balancing and high
availability select at least two
virtualization hosts click Next now we
select the network domain to associate
with a server pool I'm selecting the
default network domain for this example
click Next click the add network button
above the associate networks table to
attach a network to all the global zones
of the server pool click Next the
selected network is not connected to the
virtualization hosts to configure the
connection choose the network interface
the connection mode the IP address
allocation method and eventually the IP
address starting with version 12 to 20
Bob Center if a selected network is
connected the connection settings appear
as read-only on earlier versions a
connected network is not displayed and
it stays is configured click Next now we
select the storage libraries that we
want to associate with the server pool
the available storage types change
according to the virtualization
technology App Center provides two main
types of storage file system storage
such as Nance libraries in oracle vm
storage repository and block storage
that supports and protocols like fibre
channel and I skazhi click Next on the
last screen we can configure the
placement and not balancing policies the
wizard request us to specify policies
for the survival the placement policy
assigns of virtualization hosts in the
pool as a preferred destination for new
guests based on load allocated CPU and
memory or power consumption criteria the
auto balancing policy schedules when in
hell often the load is balanced in the
server pool in the approval criteria
additionally you can enable automatic
recovery of zones logical domains and
guests this feature provides the option
to recover the guests that are attached
to a fail server the recovered guests
are restarted on other servers in the
server pool click Next we now review the
information and click finish to generate
the job that creates the server pool
when the jobs completed we see the new
server pool in its members and the
server poles list we can modify the
server pool to add or change network and
storage and resources and members as
needed this concludes this overview for
more information consult the ops center
library go to docs oracle com look for
enterprise management and select the
Enterprise Manager ops center version
