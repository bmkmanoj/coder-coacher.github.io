application on a real device for a
starting point i'm going to assume that
you've already used the Java ME SDK to
build your application and you've run it
in the emulator and you're pretty happy
with how it works there so you want to
take the next step and install it on a
real device to understand how to install
amid the application on a real device
you first have to understand what a mid
p application is after you build it in
the Java ME SDK a mid p application
consists of two files the first file is
called the application descriptor or jad
file all this is is a pretty simple text
file that describes the application for
example it might specify what version of
API is it needs and the file size of the
completed application the second file is
a jar file and it contains all the
classes and images and sounds and other
resources that your application needs to
run the reason for splitting this into
two files was so device could first
download the application descriptor and
inspect it and then decide if it wants
to go ahead and download and install the
jar file when you use the Java ME SDK to
create a mid p application it places the
dead and the jar file for your
application in a special folder by
default the Java ME SDK places all your
projects into a folder called Java ME
SDK projects in my documents so if we go
look in there you'll see that each
project has its own folder and then
inside a project folder there's a
subfolder called dist an inside dist is
where the dad and the jar are placed
here's the Jag here's the jar which has
its extension automatically hidden to
deploy the mid p application on a real
device you have four options first one
is called over the air or OTA deployment
what happens here is you place the jad
file and the jar file on a web server
somewhere and you set up your web server
so that the jad and the jar have
specific mime types and then on the
device you enter the URL or you you
click on a link that takes you to the
jad file and on the device the
application management software takes
over and takes care of the rest of the
installation now obviously that's a
little cumbersome if you're just trying
to do a quick test as a developer so
there are three other options that you
can use for testing probably the
simplest one is Bluetooth if your device
supports Bluetooth then you can pair
with your computer and simply send the
jar file over the Bluetooth link to the
device and then you should be able to
run it you don't even need to worry
about the application descriptor in this
case a similar technique is if you have
a USB cable so that you can plug your
device into your computer it will show
up as a an additional drive and you can
simply copy the jar file onto the device
and then another technique is a memory
card if your device supports a removable
card you can plug it into your computer
copy the jar file for the mid p
application and then place the card into
the device and that's what i'm going to
show you today it's a very specific
deployment scenario using a memory card
and an HTC freestyle phone so I put the
card into my computer and I'm just going
to show you
I'm going to copy the mid p application
onto the card so the card shows up as
ruble disk and I'm just going to drag
this jar file from my computer onto the
card and there it is and next I'm going
to eject the card and physically remove
it from my computer and place it in the
HTC freestyle and start up the HTC
freestyle and then I'll show you the
steps that you need to follow in order
to run the application so here I am on
the Freestyle I'm going to choose menu
and scroll over and then I'm going to
choose tools and Java when it finishes
starting up I'll choose menu and then
storage it will search through storage
show me a list and i'm going to pick the
one i want to install and touch install
it says are you sure i say ok and it
goes through and installs this
application
on the phone and then asks if I want to
run it now and here's our application
running on the phone check out the other
videos available online and the Java ME
SDK getting started document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
