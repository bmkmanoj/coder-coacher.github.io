to synchronize model changes between
users we start by opening up another
session of sequel developer data modeler
and we need to check out another version
of the same model and so we're going to
check it out to release one underscore
user to this time and click OK and it's
going to check out the model now we want
to open that model from the user to
directory so we're going to go to the
file pulldown window select open and
then navigate to the release 1 user 2
directory and select the model and then
click open and now we have the model
open if we scroll down to the same table
that we made the changes to previously
you'll see that column the two columns
that we added and we're going to
double-click on that table and change
the names of the columns that we created
previously so we're going to select the
first column and change it to update a
date and specify a data type of date and
we're going to check say I change the
second one to created by and select of
our chart 24 this column and we can go
ahead and save those changes we want to
save this model so that we can compare
it with what is in subversion so we have
now saved the model and we can now go
take a look at the pending changes
between this local copy and what's
currently in subversion so from the
pending changes window we're going to
expand the tree and then double click on
the table that is detected some changes
in again over on the left is what is in
subversion over on the right is what is
in our local copy so you can see that
there have been changes detected we're
going to go ahead and commit the
changes to the repository we can specify
a comment and then click OK and now our
changes have been implemented into
subversion now we're going to switch
over to user 1 and refresh the pending
changes for the incoming changes tab and
you'll notice that there have been some
changes detected so we're going to
double click on the customers table here
to see the differences between what is
now in subversion and what is in my
locally safe copy so you can see that
there have been changes made so I'm
going to go ahead and close and now i'm
going to synchronize those changes from
the subversion repository into my
locally safe copy you just learned how
to synchronize model changes between
users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
