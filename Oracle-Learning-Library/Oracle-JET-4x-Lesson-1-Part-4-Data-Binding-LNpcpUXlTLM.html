of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet in the previous parts you were
introduced to require which is an open
source library found in every oracle jet
application in this part you'll be
introduced to knock out which is also
found in every oracle jet application
like require knock out is a free and
open source library also like require
knockout is focused on providing one
specific feature while you have learned
that require focuses specifically on
modularity and lazy loading application
resources knocked out focuses
specifically on the binding of data
between the view in HTML and the view
model in javascript this is referred to
as two-way data-binding we're now going
to go to naka is calm and explore the
website and the related documentation
there we are on knockout is calm scroll
through the page and notice the key
features that knockout provides
declarative bindings automatic UI
refresh dependency tracking and
templating these are topics that you
will learn about throughout this course
there's a download and install area
which you don't need since jet includes
knockout by default there's a large
section of tutorials and learning
resources including live examples that
show you the key features and the key
usages of knockout noticed a
documentation section also very detailed
browse through it and learn from it go
to the forum where you can ask questions
and discuss the usages of knockout and
also the source of knockout is available
on github knockout introduces an
application architecture called model
view viewmodel mvvm in this architecture
we have three layers in your application
a view which is the HTML file a view
model which is the business logic in
javascript and a model the data
manipulation via arrest or other web
service interfaces with knockout we now
have a mechanism to connect a business
to an HTML page
let's create our first observable you
will name the observable name and this
is how observables are defined by means
of Keio observable or KO observable
array type KO observable and we will
specify a default value this is a
property in knockout knockout itself
will observe the property and make sure
to notify all places where this property
is referenced let's now reference this
property on the HTML side of the
dashboard module we create a new span
element and we use the data bind
attribute from knockout to bind the text
attribute of the span element to the
name property that we have defined in
our JavaScript and to make it extra
clear we're going to surround this with
an h2 element we look in the browser and
we see our name tomm there now we can
have more references to that same
property and all of those references
will display the same value let's not
take the next step and enable the user
to change the property we're going to
change our span elements to an input and
the property that we will bind will not
be the text attribute because an input
element doesn't have that instead we're
going to use the value attribute of the
input element and bind that to the name
property when the user makes a change
inside of the input element that change
will mean a change to that underlying
property we kaleb's err verbal with a
named name and the impact of that will
be that these two span elements will
automatically change as well when you
make a change and tab out
notice that the property
is updated and all references are
updated as well you may want to change
the property while typing and for that
reason we have the attribute text input
which means that as we type something
different you will see that each
character results in a change to the
property and all the references being
updated at the same time you now have a
very basic understanding of knock out
enabling you to understand how property
is defined in JavaScript can be bound to
the view defined in HTML for the
homework exercise you're going to spend
some time learning about knock out go to
learn knock out is calm and complete the
online tutorials that you will find
there and as always we thank you for
spending time learning about Oracle yet
and look forward to seeing you in the
next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
