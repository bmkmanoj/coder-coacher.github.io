Claire control 12 seeing demo series
this demonstration will show you how to
create a basic report in beyond
publisher against Claire control 12c
target data and that bi publisher honors
Claire control target privileges in this
demonstration we will see how to create
folders for our reports had a created
data model that our reports can be built
upon how to use the report wizard to
create a report and how to use the
layout editor to modify that report you
can use the links here to jump straight
to each section or just move to the time
for the sections
now that we have assigned bi publisher
privileges to our enterprise manager
Claire control users we can start
creating our own custom reports as part
of the integration between bi publisher
and Enterprise Manager Claire control a
shared folder called Enterprise Manager
Cloud Control is created within bi
publisher this is the folder hierarchy
that is displayed within the Enterprise
Manager cloud control itself however we
should not extend the hierarchy nor add
our own reports to this structure as
future patches and updates may overwrite
our editions site-specific reports
should be created in their own folder
hierarchies although on the surface this
seems cumbersome if we remember that the
report hierarchy displayed within cloud
control is merely a punch out to be our
publisher itself it is no more onerous
than running the out-of-the-box reports
let's log into bi publisher to create a
folder for our own reports to do so we
need to log in as a user with the EMB IP
administrator role which in our case is
the M admin user will create a folder
called custom reports under shared
folders
next we need to modify the permissions
on the folder to allow our fellow
Enterprise Manager cloud control users
to access the folder and its contents
will allow anyone with the EMB IP author
role to read write and delete items in
the folder
anyone with a mbrp scheduler role to
schedule reports in the folder and
anyone with embr pay viewer role to read
and run reports in the folder will also
elect to apply the same privileges to
all items that are created in the fauna
bi publisher reports are composed of two
parts an underlying data model and the
layout for displaying the information
retrieved through the data model I'll
create a data models folder to keep the
two separate
we're going to create a report that will
let you select a managed database and
display some tablespace information for
that database as both a graph and a
table of data and we will need three
things in our data model to realize it a
parameter to display in the report so
the user can select the database to
report upon a list of values to populate
the selection parameter with database
names and a dataset to extract the
tablespace data from the OEM are
filtered by the parameter value lien
reports is the Enterprise Manager cloud
control user to whom we granted the EMB
IP author role so let's log into bi
publisher as a user start the data model
creation process by clicking the create
data model button we will specify its
location in the folder hierarchy when we
save it let's start with a list of
values we give it a name
and we create an SQL query against the
am repulsed
datasource to populate it the in repose
datasource was created for us as part of
the configuration process I'll use the
query builder to create the SQL query
the search field will dynamically filter
the list of available objects as we type
into it drag the objects you want to use
from the list and on to the Builder pane
I want to select instance name and
target grid tuplets to populate my list
of values so that the instance name can
be displayed but the target grid will be
used as the key value in the background
this means I need to ensure the display
field is first and the key value is
second so use the conditions tab to
reorder target grid and instance name
appropriately clicking on results runs
the query so we can confirm that it
works it's working okay so we'll save it
now that we have our list of values from
create a parameter so it can be
displayed we give the parameter an
internal name
and a display name that will be seen on
the report for this demonstration we
will restrict the selection to a single
value as the final piece of our data
model we create a data set for the
tablespace data this will be an SQL
query using a TM reposed data source
we'll use the query builder and filter
the object list
then drag the objects we want to use
onto the Builder pane
the query builder lets us join the two
objects by selecting column in the first
object then the second it displays the
join and if we hover over it
we see the definition of the mapping we
just created next we select the columns
we want to use in the data set
and had a condition on the target grade
column to whatever is selected in the
parameter
as this column is only present for the
purpose of filtering the results we will
uncheck the show option save the dataset
now we can save the data model to the
customer reports custom data models
folder that we created earlier
bi publisher allows us to generate
sample data for the data set that can be
used later to visualize the report as we
build it click View data to run the data
model query we see that our parameter
behaves as expected and by clicking view
we see the XML document that is returned
by a data model let's save this as
sample data for use later on
now that we have our data model we need
to create a report to display the data
we can select new report from the
standing menu or use the create report
button on the home page or simply use
the create report button right here on
the data model page new in VIP 11 1 1 7
is the guided report wizard making a
simpler to create a basic report without
the need for using the layout editor
it's a simple matter of selecting the
data model to base the report upon
although in this case VIP is anticipated
then we want to use the data model we
were just editing then we choose to
guide me radio button then we click Next
to proceed through the guided steps the
next step in the guided report wizard is
to select a layout for our report I want
a portrait layout with a page header
where I can display the database name
and version and a chart and the table
layout to display tablespace data
notice that the steps to be executed in
the wizard change as we select different
layouts click Next to move on to the
next step which in our case is to define
the chart bi publisher displays three
hotspots where you can drop fields to be
displayed as chart values series or
labels i want to display tablespace size
and used space from my graph so I
dragged those two columns to be values
notice how the report wizard uses the
sample data that we saved earlier to
show us how the report will look the
tablespace name should be the label so
let's drag that to the label field click
Next to move on to the next step which
for us is to create the table of data bi
publisher automatically uses the fields
we dragged onto the chart we can move
those fields or delete them
I want to display size and used size so
first I'll check what column is missing
then drag it to the table again bi
publisher displays our sample Dana
I'll let bi publisher at a grand totals
row click Next to save the report with
the option to view it or further
customize it using the layout editor I
want to view my report before doing
anything else so I'll click finish and
save my report in the custom reports
folder
now the report opens and I can use my
database instance parameter to switch
between databases
let's see bi publisher honor the
Enterprise Manager target privileges
first as AM user one who has view
privilege on am 12 rep and Oracle
databases then as a user to who only has
view privilege on the OIC on database
you
the report wizard has given us a
functional report but I want to change
the title and add some information to
the page header that I got the report
was it to include to make changes like
that we need to use the bi publisher
layout editor so once again we log in as
the e/m reports user then click the edit
link for our report either from the list
of recent reports or from the catalog
which takes us to the reports home page
here we see the data model that report
is based upon together the layouts used
to display the data for this report it
is possible to have multiple layouts for
one report allowing you to view the same
data in different ways the wizard to
created a layout for us and that's what
I want to modify so I'll edit that first
I'll modify the chart title to something
meaningful for this report
I want to display the instance name and
version of the selected database so
we'll add a grid under the title to hold
that data
in the top left-hand cell all had a
field label
and then I can drag the field from my
data model into the cell similarly with
the database version I had a field label
and then drag the DB version field from
the data model on to the report layout
and I'll adjust the column width to suit
the labels I'm happy with that layout so
I'll save it
and now when we open the report we see
the modified layout
