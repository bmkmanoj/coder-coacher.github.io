builder which is part of Oracle
functional testing Oracle's application
testing suite is the central piece of
Oracle's application quality management
portfolio it offers three main
components namely Oracle functional
testing Oracle load testing and Oracle
test manager if you are testing oracle
packaged applications like Oracle
e-business suite Siebel Fusion
Applications JD Edwards PeopleSoft or
Hyperion you are using the same tools
but they are licensed from the
applications price lists and are then
named Oracle functional testing suite
for Oracle applications or Oracle load
testing suite for Oracle applications
Oracle provides specific accelerators to
support the Oracle packaged applications
this makes scripting much quicker and
will also help create robust scripts
that requires less maintenance and this
is of course important because as a user
you would like to minimize the time that
you have to spend on either creating or
maintaining your test automation scripts
when looking at testing the testing
challenges for packaged applications
like Oracle e-business suite is that to
test all changes that you have in the
application from a manual perspective
takes much too long time and business
users seldom have the time to step in
every time and do updates or test
updates repeat this over and over again
because they have their own tasks that
they have to deal with if you look at it
from test automation perspective it's
sometimes difficult for
organizations to find the technical
resources that they need in order to
create a test automation another problem
is that the business processes changes
every now and then and this may then
impact the test automation scripts that
have been created so they need to be
updated or maintained and this is of
course done again an additional effort
that has to be put into the calculation
Oracle introduces a new approach to test
Oracle e-business suite applications it
helps to dramatically reduce testing
time it minimizes the need for technical
resources to create the test automation
it reduces the testing complexity and it
minimizes the effort to keep your test
automation scripts current and
up-to-date we are introducing Oracle
flow builder a keyword-driven testing
framework let's begin with discussing
what is keyword-driven testing
keyword-driven testing is basically
another way of creating test automation
scripts traditionally you would record
transaction flows against an application
and all the different actions that the
user performs with the application is
recorded into a script you could done
later parameterize this script insert
verification points to validate
different data or values coming out to
the application but in this case we do
not have to have the application
available to us we do not record
anything we're defining the test
automation script by using keywords so
this enables non-technical resources to
compose these test flows or test
automation scripts by basically defining
user actions that combined becomes the
test automation flow the user actions
that our used wood keyword-driven
testing frameworks are typically
operations like click set text select
and so on the test flows that are
created with the keyword-driven testing
framework are then later on transformed
into executable test scripts that can
run against your application to verify
the functionality of it so how do
customers typically implement
keyword-driven testing frameworks well
they have to start with some kind of
platform to harness the keyword testing
framework and this could be an open
source solution or it could be a
commercial solution then the testers
typically analyze the application that
needs to be tested and defines what kind
of key words are needed in order to do
testing or test automation for this
application some developers or technical
resources implement the keywords and map
these to code key words like click and
objects like button could then generate
code like web dot button and the
specific object that you want to
interact with not click for instance
this would perform a click on a button
object once this is done non-technical
testers can use the key words to create
their test automation flows there might
need to bind test data to the flows last
but not least you generate the test
automation scripts and can start your
testing the benefits of a keyword-driven
testing framework is that the
maintenance effort over time at least is
considerably lower compared to
traditionally recorded scripts and the
test scripts are also in mostly in a
more readable form which makes it easier
to present the flows to test managers
to management's generally seen and the
test cases are also in most cases very
easy to modify you can reuse keywords
and if implemented well the test scripts
tend to be more robust if the framework
allows you to it may also support
multiple test automation tools the
drawbacks however are that you typically
need technical resource or developer to
define the keywords and these solutions
are only suitable if you have a high
reusability with the content that you
produce it also takes quite some time to
get ready to do the testing because you
have to implement the keyword-driven
testing framework and all the keywords
the learning curve is initially a little
bit steeper with these kind of solutions
the Oracle functional testing suite for
Oracle applications offers both
traditional record playback through the
open scripts scripting environments this
is something that we have had for years
it provides robust test automation
scripts for Oracle applications it's
based on Java so you can extend the
scripts using Java code we are now
introducing flow builder which is a
keyword-driven testing framework that
you can use in order to generate your
test automation scripts without
recording we also include pre-built
flows and components that allows you to
do testing of e-business Suites in a
much faster way than ever possible
before and if you combine your own flows
and your own data with the existing
flows and components and the flow
builder framework you can dramatically
reduce your testing efforts and generate
scripts for testing Oracle e-business
suite
the big difference with flow builder
compared to other solutions is that the
keywords needed to test Oracle
e-business suite are already in place so
they have already been defined for user
we also provide a very rich library of
predefined components and test
automation flows a component could be
something like log in create purchase
order header create purchase order line
and we have over 2,000 100 pre-built
components that spans across all
different modules of Oracle e-business
suite and based on out of these 2100
components we have over 200 test
automation flows across these modules
that the user can the testers can use to
jump start their business we testing the
concept of an Oracle flow builder is
that you have keywords that defines the
different actions that we want to mimic
multiple keywords forms a component you
can then take multiple components chain
them together create component sets
which is then a predefined sequence of
components you can use the components
and the component sets in any
combination you want and create flows a
flow will then generate a test
automation script that is executable
using Oracle functional testing you can
execute this either from a command line
from oracle open script which is the
scripting environment or from oracle
test manager
you can create the components either by
using Oracle flow builder browser-based
UI or offline by using a Microsoft Excel
template if you need to customize or
change your components based on your
customizations of Oracle e-business
suite you can easily do so as well this
is the architecture Oracle flow builder
Oracle flow builder uses an Oracle
Enterprise Edition database as
repository and runs on a web logic
application server users can interact
with flow builder through the web-based
UI using a Firefox web browser please
note that Microsoft Internet Explorer
currently is not supported users can
also use Microsoft Excel to create
components offline from flow builder
they can generate Oracle functional
testing based scripts users can also be
notified via email Oracle flow builder
addresses the testing challenges by
reducing the need for manual testing
freeing up the business users from the
manual testing it also requires less
technical resources allowing
non-technical testers or even power
users to create test automation flows
and whenever the business processes
change the flow builder can be used to
quickly and with minimum effort update
test automation scripts or components in
order to keep the scripts up-to-date
Oracle flow builder reduces the effort
required to do testing by offering a
keyword-driven testing framework and
pre-built components for Oracle
e-business suite it also helps to reduce
the testing time because test automation
scripts can be developed even before the
application is available it offers a
quick and easy maintenance of the test
content
and it eliminates all the major
drawbacks of keyword-driven testing by
providing predefined keywords and
predefined components and flows Oracle
e-business suite Quality Assurance team
have been using Oracle flow builder for
their test automation and they are
saving up to 60% of their time compared
to using record playback Oracle
application testing suite helps you to
reinvent the application testing for
Oracle e-business suite it offers an
optimized solution for Oracle
applications it helps you to jumpstart
EBS testing with the predefined content
and it allows organizations to become
truly agile it empowers non-technical
resources to be part of the testing it's
easy to work with it's easy to maintain
components and create them and it helps
customers to maintain their test scripts
with a minimal effort truly reduces the
complexity of testing and most important
of all it allows customers to test every
single change it allows customers to
uptake new patches new updates new
versions of the applications in a secure
and manageable way it allows customers
to become truly agile as an organization
now let's take a look at how to work
with tool
Oracle flow builder is a part of Oracle
functional testing and if you are
testing Oracle applications you are
using Oracle functional testing suite
for Oracle applications flow builder is
a keyword-driven testing framework that
allows users to create test automation
scripts by defining keywords and
components rather than recording
transactions we're going to log in here
to flow builder as the administrator
user as you can see the user has access
to a web browser-based UI and on the
welcome screen the user is presented
with top notifications around components
that have been approved or if the user
has to approve any user access to flow
builder for instance you also see a list
of the most recent components have been
created you can change your access
rights and request access rights on the
top of the screen we can go to the
circled components Oracle flow builder
is specifically designed to work with
Oracle's ebusiness suite applications
and offers a really broad range of
components that are pre-built for all
different applications within Oracle
e-business suite in fact Oracle flow
builder is shipped with over 2,100
components covering all the the main
functionality of a business suite and
you can use these components to create
your test automation scripts a component
refers to some kind of activity in
ebusiness suite it could be something
like a login
we create purchase order header it could
be create purchase order line and what
the user has to do is basically either
to use pre-built components and based
all of these components he can create
test automation flows which can then be
transformed into test automation scripts
can be run against the application or if
the components that the tester is going
to use or would like to use do not exist
then the tester can obviously create his
own components or modify existing
components based on the customizations
that you have done for your e-business
suite application now if we would look
at one of the existing components we
could take for instance in the CRM
application in the customer online we
can look at the create person components
so we right click on the component and
choose view and this will give us the
how the component looks like so in the
beginning we will see a keyword saying
set app type web so this is obviously in
the self-service part of a business
sweet so it's it's the web part it goes
to a window called Oracle customers
online it starts by clicking on a link
customers it waits for the window
organizations to pop up it clicks on the
link persons waits for the window
persons to appear and then it goes in
and creates a new person entering first
name middle name last name email address
and so on
and at the very end of these components
the components verifies that a
confirmation message is appearing on the
screen that the person have actually
been created in EBS from flow builder I
am also able to look up components in
case I don't really know where to find
them so I can for instance select the
release that I want to work with the
product families say it's the leasing
finance management in that I'm going to
use Lisa finance management and I can
select a specific feature like billing
for instance and once I search for that
I will soon see the various components
that I have for the billing feature in
flow builder we can also modify existing
components and to do this I simply
select the component right click on it
what happens done is that we will see
all the different actions and keywords
that makes up this component in this
particular case we see that we are
interacting with a web part of our
business suite but as you can see we
also have the possibility to work with
forms page as flex pages as well as two
new ADF controls it actually even
supports working way to tell that
components so if you have these telnet
handguns that are used for inventories
and things like that that can also be
simulated by using a flow builder in
most cases your customizations might be
that you are adding a control or a
number of controls to a screen or that
you are maybe removing things and in the
case that you have added additional
controls which needs to be reflected in
in your components you can simply go
into one of the components and insert
a new keyboard roll and in this keyword
roll we can unselect what kind of
keyword we want to use in this
particular case maybe we want to be able
to click something so we select a click
and then what kind of object is it that
we want to interact with click a button
and the button name is check social
security number the attributes the
object identification name is but now if
I would save this component this a new
additional user action is going to be
part of the component and whenever we
create any kind of new scripts or flows
containing this component this new
action is going to be part of it
let's have a look at the flow sections
the flow section is the place where we
have all our predefined test automation
flows for flow builder globular contains
over 200 predefined flows covering the
main processes of all the various EBS
applications you can use the search if
you want to search for a specific flow
so let's do a quick search here
and let's have a look at this flow so we
can view the flow so this is a fairly
long and complicated flow as you can see
and for each and every of these
different components you can right click
on them and work with the test data that
is supposed to be used for this
particular component we can also create
our own flows so if I create a new flow
under the customer relationship
management section nice right click
select create flow I will have to give
this flow a name so it's my new test
flow what type of flow it is and you can
see that we have a verification
automatically that checks if this flow
name exists or not I can have some tags
here and then I say create flow
structure the create flow structure
gives me a new script basically here
it's an empty container and I can select
from either my favorite components or
any other approved component to create
my flow same here I can use the search
or I can simply browse through B and the
various components what I do then is
that I just simply pick a number of
components that make sense for my
particular script and just drag and drop
them into a sequence that makes sense
for me for my testing in this particular
case I can also go in and I can right
click on a component to enter test data
for this component that can enter a text
that is supposed to be part of this note
and I can save this
or I could go up on the flow level and I
can generate an Excel spreadsheet where
I can enter all the data for all the
different components that I have in my
flow the Excel spreadsheet is not
downloaded so I can open it up and I can
see here that the test note data is
already entered and for the create task
I can go in here and I can create this
yes tests subjects I can go in and enter
all the different data that I need to
have here once I'm here I also have the
possibility to create component sets a
component set is multiple components
that are grouped together so let's say
that I always use this create node then
create task together in a combination
then I can click on make component sets
and it will then make a bundle of these
two components into component sets which
I can then use instead of picking these
two components every single time so we
assemble the flow and we are now
basically done with that flow creation
if those were the only two components
that I needed from my new test flow I
can now do a couple different things so
I can generate an Oracle functional
testing script and that can then be used
to do test automation on ABS or I can
generate and download the test plan so
let's download the test plan test plan
is basically a document that is
generated for me that contains
information about the test flow that I
created so it has all the information
about who it was they created it any
kind of document references
the document control what the flow name
is any kind of effort and then it starts
to go through all the different actions
that are done by the two components that
we have so this is a simple way of
getting the documentation for the the
tests as well so they are automatically
generated by Oracle flow builder so it
helps you to keep track on on your
testing in the notifications we have the
possibility to have a look at what is
happening in our system what kind of
notifications are sent who is supposed
to prove them and so on you can even do
searches on that in the history section
we have similar capabilities looking at
various historic activities that have
been taking place so you can for
instance look for component history
components that history flows or user
history so everything that is around
what has happened inside of the tool is
tracked here in the reporting part can
create reports based on for example
components and versions specific
products families and so on and you can
search for them to figure out how many
different components do you have what
status do they have you can export this
into Excel or view data as graphics to
give you a better understanding about
then the amount of components that you
have available for your testing but also
of course on test flows and such
the admin ministration page gives you
the possibility to maintain what kind of
releases you're working where the
product family is the features users as
well as things like mail server
configuration or function libraries that
you have added to flow builder this ends
