builder to create a view you can create
a view graphically using the query
builder there are many options when
using the query builder you can see the
selected columns from the criteria list
or structured tree in addition you can
automatically see the generated sequel
query and test the query as well
you can reorder the columns you have
selected by using the context menu and
you can add a union sub query as well as
filter the objects using a sub view in
this topic you learn how to use the new
query builder with our relational model
open we want to select the view icon and
click in the background here's where we
want to give the view a more meaningful
name so we'll call it job history
details view and then we want to go
ahead and click on the query button to
open up the query builder here we need
to select the tables that we want to
include into this view so we'll select
job history and jobs and then go ahead
and select the columns that we want to
include in the view you'll notice that
the criteria list is modified with the
columns we selected as well as the as
the query area that shows the sequel we
want to go ahead and move up some of the
columns so we right-click and select
move up in this case we want to move the
start date and end date right underneath
the title we can also do select the
criteria list and show a structured tree
that will appear on the Left we want to
go ahead and run this query to make sure
that it works successfully so we click
on the icon and then select the
connection that we want to connect to
for our database the query is successful
so we can select the query results tab
and you'll notice the data is presented
we're going to go ahead and close this
dialog window and at this point we want
to go ahead and create a union sub query
so we right-click on the queue and
select that option we're going to select
the employees table and
and select some of the columns in that
table for the sub-query and we're going
to go ahead and select these show
current query sequel only and you'll
notice only that sequels selected and
then test that query to make sure that
the results are presented appropriately
we'll close that dialog window and then
create the view so we go ahead and click
OK you've just seen how to use query
builder to create a view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
