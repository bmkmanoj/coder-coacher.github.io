name is alex is risen from oracle i
walking away me as a set of elation and
got a number of my colleagues today and
we will talk about your use case with
done throughout you know essentially a
continual working with a number of
companies so i'll go in just ask my
colleagues you know trenches dug
themselves a great start my human friend
great yeah thanks Alexis my name is
Manfred Koopa and I work for a company
called Centurion we're at gemalto
company and i'm pretty sure every one of
you guys has a gemalto product in their
pocket because we're all about security
so actually we're doing the American new
biometric passport banking card sim
cards NFC and we're all about security
at Centurion we deal a lot with well m2m
and we make those tiny little modules
that manufacturers can embed in their
applications and make them communicate
of the cellular network I've been in
telecoms for 1213 years now and doing
m2m stuff for nine years so it's quite
an exciting area very happy to be here
today hi I'm amid ghia I'm from ad
medical and we are a device manufacturer
making devices such as blood pressure
monitors weight scales thermometers and
other home health care equipment and
there i'm the product manager for the
telemedicine devices and telemedicine is
defined as a blood pressure monitor with
a layer of connectivity whether it be
blue too
and cellular or any other type of
low-power radio and we also use the
radios to work with system integrators
who I think will talk a little bit more
about towards chill everybody my name is
Adam odesk II and I'm a product manager
at orange the france telecom company and
i work here in orange Silicon Valley
focused primarily on partnerships in
health in the healthcare space and I'm
also the founder of an internal project
with an orange called sense Lee which is
a remote assessment hub equipped with a
set of diagnostic tools so basically
presents patients with a virtual avatar
that can pre-screen them ask some
questions about their health care and
use medical devices to collect
information from them to an analog for a
doctor to analyze all right everybody my
name is rich ikkaku on the project
director for mobile health at the GSMA
association the gsm association is the
industry body for mobile operators
around the world we represent over 850
mobile operators worldwide and we run
strategic projects which are aimed at
trying to develop the mobile ecosystem
and develop new innovative opportunities
for mobile operators around the world so
the lights of orange telecom AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon here in the US are all members
of the GSMA thanks everyone so I'll
jumping into products a gender &amp;amp; first
do it quick overview of what we've been
trained to do to give up sonar context
and then we'll jump right in the panel
discussion so it's a pretty small
audience so please know feel free to ask
questions as we go along and we'll take
some time on thorium so first you know
what is continued I we've used that in
the title of the session so to give you
any bit of perspective I won't go too
much in depth but it's essentially a
consortium of company the over 240
companies at our member so all of us at
the table actually member of continuum
and that covers the world ecosystem of
companies in telecare so anywhere from
the chip manufacturer
cynthia being a chip manufacturer the
device manufacturer with indy here but
also the service provider like orange
the seller systems integrator and also
the end-users electrical organization as
galvanization so forth and they've been
looking at the finis guidelines and
standards and reference implementation
also for Teleca and we talked in a
minute about what it is and so they are
essentially looked at the entire into an
essentially system define you know the
guideline the standards that they have
the results of limitation and they have
the state testing labs to actually
verify the diff devices are compliant
you know with the specification that in
about seven labs now worldwide between
asia in our US and yours they look at
the business technical and also
regulatory aspects this class is fine
you know the feeling three set of use
cases one build wellness fitness so this
is 0 bollettino people wanna stay in
good shape right the Kree disease
management which is probably the weather
bulk of the revenues are by some
estimates up to like 90 personal aides
pendings no cougar incurring disease
hundreds of millions of people know in a
developed country right anyway are like
her condition diabetes and obesity so
it's becoming a major concern and
through this initiative is really the
opportunity to bring everyone together
and tackled of problems and really
reduce the cost and be able to develop
preventive care maintenance in the last
set of use cases essentially what's
called leading-edge independently so
there's some overlap of craig disease
management so this is all about the
elderly wanna stay independent and stay
at home in as long as they can there's
been a stronger adoption and interest
continued hard there's actually a more
and more relationship with in all the
organization you know like I to you and
there's also in the last few months or
countries you know like a country of
Denmark has been adopting data for a
tilaka programs you're moving forward
from a very high level stirring point
this is what the architecture looks like
on the left side of a personal or
medical devices so there's a large
number of professional available and a
continued is essentially relying on some
of the I Triple E standard to expose you
know those devices nurse
a data format manner so each of those
devices listed on the left and more of
actually well defined data format and
then to the middle is what's called the
aggregation manager that's essentially
the device gathering data and connecting
with those medical devices there's a
number of interfaces available in
continuum so they've defensed an hour on
white connectivity a USB and wireless
connectivity specific Bluetooth and
zigbee another Center you can see that
those aggregation managers can take a
number of phones right it can be a of
the shelve you know pc it could be like
a dedicated pc with like a touchscreen
or it could be like a setup box a
headless gateway or even a phone or
tablet and essentially the basically you
know the the middleware can be available
to run on on those devices and still
interpret in a standalone of fashion and
to the right side is the old ears care
system that it would you consider the
essentially order and 0 record systems
and so forth and in continue our data
format and the interface is actually oh
stop web service interface so throughout
the architecture really what it allows
is to be able to pretty much connect any
medical device on the left to any get a
provider in the middle and then in turn
you know send that data in the complaint
you know standard format we need Obachan
systems so up to now you know this is
basically you know the profile we had
available and so the member on that
panel along with a few other companies
and she looked I defining another
profile so we realized that something
else we could actually look into one's
devices I could connect directly to the
network using cellular connectivity so
we essentially work in a mobility
working group to define a new profile
that's called en in that slides that
stands for embedded on and walk and the
idea is to take another Shelvey no
medical device are the wireless
communication module on it and doing so
providing only mobility but also
standard compliance so on that device
running a central java virtual machine
and we have an application and yeah
during translation from the data format
in the data in the device 2 h's 7
continuous web web service invocation
that is to not complainin so essentially
we're kind of allowing not to take the
device and by adding that chip make it
you know continue compliant and you can
send the data directly you know to the
back engine using a cellular network so
this is basically a theme right taking
essentially device and being able to
what connectivity so this is something
we validated you know for n square
specifically so to continue our compiler
is the last report but clearly this is a
use case get can be used in many other
in a machine to machine you know
scenarios as well right I think lots of
us at the table including service
provider to manufacturer believe that
they be more now Bochy opportunities to
connect directly devices to the entire
to the network using cellular it's
especially make sense you know when
India mobility and when you keep
mobility in mind and this is what we're
going to discuss your throughout the
panel actually in the next few slides
architecture one so again we took a few
devices at the bottom you can see
devices from Andy so we actually do have
a demonstration next door and we have a
device you know that stands you know
right here from India blood pressure
monitor so we took a number of devices
blood pressure money 20 weight scale
sleep therapy device we added
essentially communication Moodle on it
and that essentially consoles with a sim
card in dollar rose to essentially
connect to a cellular network so we've
been using your engine or cellular
network and in turn we have a back-end
that basically back an implementing the
web service cioppino interface that gets
the data in the complaint manner you can
see she can essentially process it so
these are the various components we have
a in the system and I will talk about
that probably through the Q&amp;amp;A will
discuss you know some of the benefits
but over on what some are some of the
key takeaways is that through that
demonstrator we could take advantage of
the continued ecosystem so there's a
wide range of devices already supported
while range of backhands essentially
allowing you know to get that data so
the whole idea there is not reinvent the
wheel but tap into the ecosystem also
something we actually found really
interesting it will grow long
feedback when we started demonstrating
that couple months ago I in Berlin for
the continued event is that a lot of
people really like the plug and play if
you have to walk with the gateway device
it is more complex you could have the
Gateway you can have the right middle on
the Gateway you can have the right
Miller working on the device and you
gotta do things like peering you're
going to be able to do the initial setup
to have those devices and essentially be
able to talk to each other and this is
something the user has to do as opposed
to in that situation it's very much
plug-and-play and the user experience is
the same so we could use it in the
weight scale and you take your
measurement the same way you will do it
before and from a you and use your
standpoint you are the same experience
you don't even know necessary that you
know the de Rana is a very well you know
and available on the network the
platform is very flexible so we can
essentially adapt to any type of device
and as we'll discuss also it's a very
mature you know platform that's been
deploying in the billions you know cell
phone so there's a strong competitor and
device management strong security it's
essentially a proven platform that
that's been in the field for quite some
time so I sing the Upstate you know for
the interruption i can probably take a
few questions you know to clarify things
if you have any and then we can move in
into some of the panel discussion any
questions anyone sure just interface
between the sensor devices on your arm
like a photographer yes you know down to
the mid-range and Emma look how that
yes you want to take that question
because the gem can actually explain to
your love variety of functions and
connectivity options they have for the
module because they have a wide range of
connectivity options yes yes exactly yes
sir as alexis has shown on the slide
historically those devices were
connected to gateways may prove
short-range so continue with specified
bluetooth for instance of cd4 that
connectivity but you always have a
different well a component in the middle
right so we thought with this
demonstrator of what we do is we get rid
of that component in the middle we
directly integrate the cellular
connectivity into the medical device and
this is what we've done to this blood
pressure cuff you can also see that side
later on if you want we just attached
our development keep their on the back
and on our cells and modules we put on
top of the baseband which comes from the
companies like welcome or Intel what we
call our m2m stack and that m2m stack
provides a lot of different interfaces
so we've got SBI i2c USB interface in
this case we used serial interface
rs-232 where we could very easily
connect to the blood pressure monitor
measurement device from a and D and just
read the data which is on this little
wire still in a proprietary format and
then do all the conversion on them
cellular module in Java so this was
something that the device would not be
capable of doing beforehand because it's
a very cost optimized device with a
microprocessor that's a very back row
very simple and and then what we do is
yeah we take this data turn it into a
continual compliant format which is h or
7p d co one and send it across the
cellular network in a secure fashion to
the back end where it can be read from
any continua compliant van receiver so
it's all about the
interoperability aspect means exactly
that one that's a proprietary interface
in terms of the Vedic another device
exactly and as all these are jobs that
to you to the continual format education
which is standardized that were
connected from there yeah we can
directly connect to the network without
the need of a cellphone or another
gateway that does the job it's actually
on such a small form-factor you have all
the cellular connectivity functions that
you need you can send text messages you
can send and receive data in this case
it's 3g we actually launched this here
at javaone is the smallest 3g java
module in the world it's hardly bigger
than a sim card really and we even have
voice if you want to add that and then
gps which apparently is also a feature
that could be of interest for for some
use cases in this space it eventually
this is what you have in the device
right here we have a development box
which will speak but eventually will
integrate and just you know the
communication model pot yeah thank you
hey good thanks for question yes please
no because continua um specifies on the
data interfaces on the protocols so what
we want to do with our approach and yeah
that's why we thought it's very valuable
for us to to actually be part of this
team doing the demonstrator is that we
can provide frameworks for industry
standards like the continuous standard
to put that in a Java framework Java
library that developers can use and be
really well out-of-the-box standards
compliant with their devices and we also
believe that we can really leverage from
the flexibility of Java to adapt to the
different proprietary interfaces because
that's the only thing that our developer
then would have to do you know get the
specifications and off you go but
there's no jsr is so far here we could
think about that question here
video you could we do that in your asana
technically speaking most of certainly
we can do and our models are used in a
lot of for instance security
applications like one of our customers
is actually connecting security cameras
who provide video streaming across the
cellular network so that is of course
possible and there's other use cases in
the medical space where you have
continuous data and we're currently
looking at that within the continued
alliance for these sort of applications
but it would be possible at the NIH
won't yes I think so i think from a
health perspective the response for
question is at the moment continua only
really standardized the interface around
the machines machine reading type
solutions but they have within their
work plans to to do video to do all our
continuous monitoring etc and the reason
why it's quite critical that it gets
certified is that it needs to meet all
of the healthcare standards which have
been divided by n CA and other
healthcare certification organizations
yeah institutional question also
continua does provide you know the
essentially the stander in the
guidelines the do reference
implementation so this is where we can
do in over for instance regulation
Beijing Java but they don't mandate you
know any given technology as long as
this is interpreter or in our case we
essentially demonstrated not only you
could do it and we could do it in Java
and before that profile didn't exist
because they were only considering you
know gateway top of integration but we
demonstrated that actually we could use
the same exact interface already had and
bring it up to you know the device
itself using a komodo push in the back
we talk about java
so what does that coming makes you want
to pick up that one may be on the
compliance sorry i meet lady yeah sure
so for on the hip aside from our
developed device manufactures
perspective we're getting the data out
so if it's following the continuous
standard which I believe takes in like
the hl7 security encryption and also
puts encryption on both sides whether it
be through the cellular channel or if
it's using the like the slide above
where it's going through the pan and
then through the wine interface both
times the data is encrypted so in terms
of data being sent its always HIPAA
compliant and when he receives the
aggregation and the health system it
still stays HIPAA compliant as long as
its meaning the continuous standards so
for that scene are you we are not
building you know the backend systems I
mean this is outside the scope right so
we can work with existing systems yeah
so I will see basically as soon as the
data is encrypted and securely
transmitted it's kind of outside the
scope of that but clearly the back end
that eventually gets the data probably
as some Eric ramana's to you know it's
totally doubts manage the data so we can
be in a HIPAA compliant hey good so I
think we're going to some of the panel
questions you don't have and again I
think you guys have a lot of questions
we can carry on during the conversation
if you want to jump into some of the
things baby I just go over some of the
funniest and probably ask them my first
question why are you interested in to
that what's the what's the deal for you
guys again I guess okay so why are we
interested in continual well I'd have to
say for for our company Centurion and
mojo we were active in a lot of
verticals like the automotive space
remote maintenance and control
telematics in general and with that said
M health mobile health care is still a
very small verdict for up for us but
definitely a vertical of the future so
it's showing really great growth rates
and growth potential so it's likely
sleeping giant that's just waiting to
wake up but probably one of the reasons
why we're not there yet and we're em
health is not living up to his potential
is some of the barriers that are in
place today in one of the main
challenges i believe is interoperability
and our contribution to actually reach
scale with these solutions em turn to
well come across that get across that
interoperability barrier is that we
support continua and the work that
continued us together with the other
member companies that we tear down those
interoperability barriers those
information silos islands that are in
place today and promote open standards
so this is why it's very valuable for us
and we also have learned when we put
together this this demo that continua
and and java really helped us to build
this really fast because of the
standards and based in an open approach
and and in the future we believe as i
said that we can very easily integrate
those industry standard frameworks on
the module make it available to java
developers and and see what other great
things that they can come up with I mean
sure so from a device menu for
manufacture perspective being part of
continual is very valuable for us
because right now we have to work with
each independent system aggregator or
disease management company and in each
time there's a very long development
stage and we have to constantly work
with both engineering teams to set up
the environments make sure the data is
being transferred make sure their site
is you know the specific radio specific
data matching so with having the
continuous spec it allows everyone to go
to one place get all the data send it
how they feel and makes for much easier
transition and allows it to be
implemented in hospitals disease
management locations in homes or
anywhere where the use case is going to
be valuable well orange is a very large
carrying Europe and even on a more
global scale orange provide as 200
million customers gather in Europe and
app and northern Africa as well as the
Middle East and you know its core
businesses to provide standards-based
connectivity to its customers and so the
ability to basically take standards and
disseminate them to every single patient
so that every single patient can
communicate with their with their
doctors regardless of boundaries
regardless of regulations that are
specific towards in a particular devices
is very important particularly in
countries like Africa would believe that
you know having people use standards
based devices and having them
communicate with medical records and eh
ours and then people in other countries
can review and make decisions on is
extremely important to level the playing
field and health care okay not really
wanted to repeat anything anybody else
to set and go last it's always the the
joyous role but for me one of the
important things about continued is that
if you implement continuing correctly
from a patient perspective it just works
there's none of the complexity around
any of the device that there's none of
the complexity around having to
integrate or get my 70 year old father
with high blood pressure to Bluetooth
pair his blood pressure cuff to his
smartphone my dad has an active
difficulty making a phone call with this
smartphone let alone the complexity of a
bluetooth pairing so the idea of the
continual guidelines but then also the
implementation which we
here where I'm the jarba really does
enable the usability of the device it
really proves that these are the kind of
solutions that enable mobile health to
Segura to grow to the scale which it's
which it's been predicted to coming from
the mobile industry in the last 25 years
we've seen that that industry grow from
nothing to over 6 billion connections
worldwide and covering over ninety-five
percent of the population and that
growth has been based around the use of
interoperable open standards and
currently by looking at health care
you'll see that a lot of those solutions
are actually closed and bespoke and very
limited to the single provider model and
we believe that an open interoperable
model will enable em how to reach scale
thank you reach on on that topic also
can you elaborate you have a brewer
prospective rate you're looking at it
here but also industries ever wear
anything you can share to adoption of
you know communication Moodle for
machine-to-machine anything interesting
you see yes yes so probably for a from
an M health perspective will we'll look
at it and sorry I'm probably going to
chuck some boring numbers but just to
try and give some some global scared
around what the opportunity is here
obviously I think we're all aware that
the healthcare systems around the world
are all or under pressure and under
strain obviously for various different
reasons here in the US and and in Europe
due to you know the economy and state
that sin but then also there's a number
of different characteristics to those
markets so we see that there's a huge
opportunity in healthcare Healthcare's
of five trillion dollar business around
the world fifty percent of which is here
in the u.s. in terms of spend and it's
not just as I mentioned that developed
world problem in markets like the US and
in Europe are facing huge challenges
around chronic disease and and the
incident of the kind of lifestyle
diseases which was seeing
things like diabetes things like cardiac
disease and just to put diabetes into
scale it's predicted that rather that's
currently 345 million people around the
world with diabetes and in some regions
of the world particularly in the Middle
East you you're looking at penetration
of around twenty percent of the people
in those countries have got diabetes so
the need to be able to treat these types
of diseases is going to be is going to
be fundamental on top of that are also
seeing a world population which is aging
and and it will and the ratio between
those people that are going to be under
the age of 65 versus lives above this is
becoming smaller and smaller so of
course effectively the burden for the
covering a cost of healthcare is
increasing on a day-by-day basis so
that's the developing world but also in
sorry too developed world but and then
in the developing world we're seeing the
populations crying out for more access
to care and the burden of offering extra
care is huge and we're also seeing
communicable diseases and haven't
happened to tackle those but then we're
also seeing those lifestyle diseases
that have been traditionally focused
around us and europe moving into
countries like China and India where the
numbers of diabetics that will see by
2030 is going to be huge and quite scary
so all of this really leads to us having
to find a way or essentially healthcare
and healthcare delivery is going to have
to change and there's no way it can be
sustained going forward it's going to
require a huge huge redesign a health is
an accepted model we start to see more
and more examples of where it's being
used more and more studies being
published using email from the positive
effect that can have or tell you how for
one of a different different world
different name and within that we see em
health is one element of that and
probably the biggest growing element of
it in terms of numbers we believe that
the em health business will be worth
around 23 billion by 2017 here in the US
around six point seven billion dollars
and then if you look at m2m devices from
a healthcare perspective by 2020 s
forecasts that be eight hundred and
fifty million devices around the world
and that's a huge opportunity for those
people that can build the devices so
that they can be used in a way that is
user-friendly and an easily
implementable reach them anything you
went out to that I mean you know clearly
directed right with service provider you
know in emails and no machine to machine
I know you guys are looking into that in
addition to a bunch of other things but
anything you can share as what some of
the chef's probably are trying to do
yeah in its it's very similar to it you
mentioned you know that the health care
industry is immensely problematic and
especially in the u.s. like you said
half of the spenders also 50 million new
uninsured people that are going to be
entering this is the orga completely
over tax system and so what doctors are
based essentially faced with is as they
have no more time for patients and they
essentially have to figure out a way to
offload patient treatment it's in
somehow an automated in some kind of
automated fashion and like you said a
health and particularly
telecommunications and telemedicine is
an accepted and also heavily promoted
model of offloading this huge demand
that's occurring on to patients and
having this kind of interoperable
working systems that places very little
burden on the patient that you just you
just plug it in and just works makes the
system usable like you mention
specifically well software is changing
quite heavily now you get upgrades and
software all the time upgrades and
hardware aren't very easy at all if a
patient already has several devices that
work you know you cannot create the
software own you can offer the backend
EHRs and other systems but it's very
hard coming in and very expensive for
the doctor or for the hospital to
comment until the patient they need to
replace all their hardware devices just
because they're changed or software in
the back and the problem even
complicates is so further because here
the US and many other countries you know
a patient's switch providers all the
time based
job are based on other other factors and
if these providers have their own kind
of wall garden systems it places even
more burden education to make the system
even more expensive to essentially
operate so having these are ability
standards operating in a standard
carrier-based cellular network your
voice of videos is not just important
but I think the only way to really start
reducing these costs in the system thank
you I've had maybe a question for you so
you talked about the technology a little
bit you explain some of the integration
but can you explain le B more what does
it take to mobilize the devices that you
got and device like a nd and you want to
make it you know mobile to the neighbor
or what does it mean yeah so looking at
from a historic perspective yep in the
past were a lot of non connected devices
with individual information silos where
you can't really leverage on the
benefits of connecting the data and
making more sense of them the next step
was to have what we see a lot today in
the Wellness space mobile phones acting
as gateways but with significant
challenges for the user you know you
need to educate the user they might have
to download an app they need to pair the
device I think well my grandma doesn't
even have a mobile phones for her it
would be hard so I think for this
population the benefits if you integrate
that but also for a developer's
perspective I think using that approach
with with a cellular phone is very
challenging because you have to do a
support very many different platforms
you know you have Windows Phone you have
iOS you have Android and the different
flavors and whatever whereas with this
approach in Java and you have one
platform that you have fully under your
control and and I think that that
actually provides a lot of benefits
because also for the getting carried
away but but also from commercial
perspective how will you build for a
mobile phone be used for that medical
so it's interfering the private and the
commercial space I think that would be a
bit of a challenge and yeah so I think
with with those embedded devices you can
cater for a lot of more um really
innovative business models like the
various like for instance that you could
do the as I mentioned in our discussion
before like the Kindle ization of health
care that you could actually have the
cost of the connectivity already
calculated for in the device purchase
because the data that's typically
exchanged for such applications of
patient monitoring it's it's very very
little bandwidth so it also for
operators I think is very attractive
space today even though maybe iPhones a
lot more sexy and cool but it makes
developers having to invest or the
mobile network operators having to
invest in the infrastructure whereas
with these kind of applications they can
that don't use up a lot of bandwidth
they can really leverage a lot of their
existing assets yes and what it takes
yeah took us well you need a sim card if
it's gsm or 3g and in that space there's
lots of developments with new form
factors for solderable scenes that are
very popular in the automotive space
they're very very tiny that you could
use for integrated devices like like
watches things like that then of course
cellular module in our case we chose
that our Java modules which eliminate
the need for an additional application
processor you're saving and build of
material and of course you need an
mobile network operator like orange in
this case who provided the connectivity
through their network hey good actually
can you give a sense of all and Ed take
actually I know we talked about it
forward walk in a mocking group or when
you can down to the implementation Oh
fast was it I can make it happen we
we put this together in a couple of days
and I think it can be strongly
attributed to to the standards framework
that is in place through the continued
alliance and also thanks to Java and I'm
convinced because you can reuse building
blocks from other m2m applications
because like the basic basics like
establishing the connectivity it's the
same it's been done in other verticals
as well you don't need to reinvent the
wheel same goes for the security
functions that we used and if you're at
this stage where we could offer this as
a framework all the work that's really
necessary to do is do that adaptation to
the individual devices and Java provides
the flexibility as well but we actually
put these together in a couple of days
thank you see we have a question in the
back so with our modules we want to make
it easy for our customers so all our
modules are pre-certified to run them
pretty much any operator network in the
world also in the US so they're
definitely FCC approved and our
customers if they want to integrate a
cellular module like that have to go
through like a delta type approval
process yeah where we can also support
our customers in that space on top of
that we also offer already certified
fully certified terminals that we used
with another company in this use case
for with vineman who provides a sleep
therapy device and with that use case it
was that we could just retrofit devices
that are in the field with patients that
want to add cellular connectivity at
telemonitoring you just attach the
module really plug and play so to speak
and then sell they enable that and then
those terminals are for instance fully
FCC PDC RV and what have you certified
okay we we don't have FDA approval
because these are not these are not
medical devices their communicate seen
as communication accessories right I
meet you going to add something sure
just to add to a man for its point for a
device manufacturer on we're kind of
technology agnostic you know we started
30 years ago with simple devices and
then we added different sorts of
connectivity starting with rs232 USB
bluetooth etc and often time the first
one does the apple of the submission of
the simple device is the most
challenging with the FDA because after
that when you add a radio all all that's
really happening is the manufacturer is
submitting for equivalency meaning that
the product is still the same product
it's just that adding a layer of
wireless transmission so in that sense
you know for us we've been able to get
our Bluetooth products or a and T
product or zigbee product or USB product
all certified within less than three
months upon first time submission
well actually you Bluetooth has its own
requirements of each via radio has you
know FCC or IC or siiii morons and those
usually typically come from the module
manufacturer so likes interior would
provide that aspect so all we would do
is we would integrate the two together
and then we would submit it as a whole
system but to your point if it's just a
VP module or something that's going into
a larger system like a dialysis machine
or something on those lines then yes the
whole system would have to be
recertified but for independent devices
such as blood pressure monitors
thermometers etc those would not have a
very challenging resubmission for the
FDA just one additional point on that
and your question you know the United in
the United States things the government
realizes that the FDA April for that is
devices and health in general and very
slow it doesn't keep up with the pace of
innovation there's actually a recently a
new law that's been proposed it hasn't
gone through Congress yet by a
congressman in California the proposal
is essentially to set up an office of em
health inside the FDA to basically clear
and accelerate the approval of these
kind of devices much faster the law
hasn't been approved yet but at least
it's a step in the right direction that
the government realized they're kind of
a bottleneck with all this innovation
going on
you realize that in usual accidents
where patients suffering to change I'll
take it so um you're absolutely right i
think the FDA has really jumped in on
the software aspect um in fact i think a
few months back the FDA has released the
guidelines for for instance mobile app
developers as to what they can cannot
put within the application so by putting
you know unnecessary limitations but
people in the right direction it should
reduce the the in direction or the
problems that was previously caused with
software just we call that also dr
device is right a license using the same
technology and already of gia certified
so one such example in the feebs
respironics which is a six a therapy
management device is actually running
the same exact chipset that we are using
using you know cellular connectivity and
that's actually a class three device
because this is essentially managing
sleep apnea which is like a non-critical
in no condition in the u.s. so the
similar technologies being used what we
were was never done in the puzzle was to
bring everything to be rendered instant
us report out of the box but that's a
good example that those solutions are
already out there and in the market and
fuel proven so I think Philips we
launched that product to get together
well two years ago um actually wanted to
use them a word for that which was and
they've been very successful with that
kind of sleep therapy solution but
you're right in terms of software as
software makes up more and more inside a
medical device where in the past have a
small of mechanics which is obviously
going down the share there's a lot of
caution that you have to to put in place
there and I can maybe add a bit of a
European perspective because I'm based
in unique Germany there's a
a law that's throughout the use of the
medical device directive and also
evolving some some risk assessment and
certification for software requirements
for software no so the FDA in the 510 K
in the other situation we had countless
description actually with them because
we wanted to see there was any value of
actually stratifying you know the
platform itself like we've done for
instance for governor industries we've
like you know come on Crete il support
or like 15 or 140 support a long story
short they do not stand out as you know
any of the underlying a technology or
middleware or they're looking at our
applications centers for other platforms
like another GE on the cardiac monitors
they use Windows Embedded and same thing
Microsoft doesn't go and okay so sorry
and they don't intend from the
description web with them they don't
intend to go there either maybe I me to
a one more question for you about what's
the potential there you know what's the
value of being able to do pro gameplay
continuous report I guess sure it's you
know absolutely beneficial for us you
know as I mentioned some of the other
technologies Bluetooth you know as
Richard and Manfred meeting on the just
the amount of pairing that's acquired
it's very cumbersome and challenging
process and that's one of the reasons
that we don't sell our Bluetooth or some
of our telemedicine devices to retail
because if we did we'd get a lot of
calls on customer service just in terms
of how to pair it or how to use it or
which software to use it with but the
advantage and beauty of this demo is
that with the
technology embedded within it it can now
be sold on a retail shelf a person can
buy it take a measurement and without
knowing what's going on in automatically
send the data to the backend from which
he can either be diagnosed through his
doctor or view it himself or shared with
his friends but for us it allows us to
actually not only get product on retail
shelves but it also allows us to open up
the market because right now we're
limited with disease management and we
are tied with system integrators and
guys who are making the aggregation
devices question halos back on the issue
of privacy is a device not broken into
what's on a device that may expose
patients or maybe even further like in
the back yeah we specifically doing so
well you can choose to to put that in as
in a secure space on there like the SIM
card would be a good place because the
SIM card has has never been hacked
frankly so that's a very secure element
to store your data so if you want to
design a super secure solution you could
take an approach like that but in
general there's actually no patient
identifiable data because you have an ID
yeah and only the medical device a
service provider can actually match the
ID with with a patient right so I guess
there's no really too much value in
breaking into these machines but there's
definitely the technology bricks
available to actually have a super
secure solution in place
for like developers who pick up en
lovely the best practices saying this
initiative restore private information
maybe it's not so much the the patient
data that's for blood pressure cuff
that's probably not really worth
stealing something that could be worth
stealing is and that's something that we
explore with a couple of medical device
manufacturers in the space sometimes
there's years and years and years of
research that goes into the the
algorithms that go into such a medical
device to provide diagnosis like for
cardiac monitors that have to detect how
to Ruth years or even sleep therapy
devices and those manufacturers they
want to make this IP secure right and
there's definitely ways to do that to
secure on the IP to have that one in a
secure space in the application so
that's probably no specific information
contrary strings or whatever right that
could ruin middle school maybe other
patient's privacy there's Brinkley
Sutton so just from a telecoms front of
you it's fair to say look at the air
interface element of GSM and technology
and mobile as a whole but I mean there's
ever been a real life example of that
being hacked and somebody actually
hacking into that kind of information
and then so from an air interface point
of view for the transmission of data you
know that's pretty secure within mobile
solutions already deployed within the
marketplace at the moment we're already
seeing end-to-end solutions being
deployed which provide end-to-end
security those aren't necessarily in
health care at the moment but we're
actually seeing it certainly within
banking we're banking transactions and
going over the air including your
account details and going from an end to
end point of view and the security
around those has been built so that it
meets all of the banking regulations
around the world on top of that coming
back to members point and over your
original point around the device itself
for example the SIM cards we're now
starting to see people's bank details
being implemented on to your mobile
device so I'm not sure how widespread
NFC technology is here in the US but
certainly in Europe they starting to put
people's account details people sort
code people's all of the information
that enables you to do a banking
transaction onto the phone itself and
generally that's stored in a secure
element in some forms of NFC that's
within the sim card and again back to
mint which point the sim cards never
been hacked in in real life scenarios so
from a patient identity probably
unlikely to have your exact identity on
there but I think you can be confident
it'd be pretty secure let me add
something maybe after that something
where you're probably using it every day
you every day you go to a restaurant
think of those point-of-sale terminals
where you swipe your credit card a lot
of those are cellular enabled and future
yeah industry standards encryption that
we can also leverage an alpha good space
question in the back again
in case of connection what if you get I
can make a quick comment on that it's a
it's very very very contractual based so
without kind of going into the detail
you know like these layers of vendors
essentially signed contracts between
each other when they basically create
these business partnerships clearly
define its technology of their provide
and outlining points of failure and who
will be responsible for that points of
failure so in a lot of these cases let's
say an unfortunate incident like that
would happen they're basically a chain
of kind of responsibility this craft
advise the contractual agreements with
the partners yes exactly I don't think
orange would take the full
responsibility for these kind of cases
given the fact that they would be you
know using vendor based technology for a
lot of food inside make the entire
system work so I just kind of want to
say is that they're essentially as a set
of contracts and a set of like change
responsibilities depending on the case
depending on what happens and the
various kind of externalities and after
effects of it pushing it back brother
goes back to combine than having very
reasonable use of the data from patient
to decision if I'm not
but yeah in that to be fair in that case
we are really not looking at the
distinction because these are existing
system you know in digital great system
you know that essentially you know you
know products right that we can
integrate with because you know
essentially most of the windows and
payment need OCH artists are essentially
adding the what's called one receiver to
continue interface that allows you know
to get data beyond that they do
essentially all the things i have to do
around it'll create disease management
and this and that right so it kind of
goes outside the scope of what we're
doing here just one more point on that i
think i think the point here is that
we're not really suggesting anything new
is suggesting that these kinds of
devices should be fully compliant with
the current regulations which are
defined and just one more point around
the around liability i don't think we'd
be SAT here suggesting that these kinds
of technologies are used for life
critical situations i think they're some
like some some challenges with a mobile
network that you need to consider so I
think the best efforts delivery is
certainly the role which we suggest from
a from a healthcare perspective of
course from a technical side you you
have to be aware and acknowledge the
fact the fact that it is best effort you
know you have drop calls in the networks
but you can really well consider that in
your application design that you have
retransmissions you know you have maybe
fall back channels like SMS text
messages
I usually was fighting who was drafted
not be used in advance or health
situations of commission that reason I
don't you can no no I think the point is
even in a fixed line network you can't
guarantee what a one hundred percent
coverage we within a connect with in a
pure wired connection there could be
something which brings down that network
so i think the point of view is it's a
pragmatic approach and if you're going
to have a heart attack and you want your
doctors know about it i wouldn't rely on
one of these types of the voices now you
can you can you can provide service
guarantees but you can't provide
guarantee that somebody isn't going to
go and put a wire out as a fixed line
network there's nothing you can do about
those concepts I hear there again take a
look at the philips respironics class 3
device it has quite a bit of
intelligence on the device because it's
essentially manages your sleep for the
people who have sleep apnea so this is
essentially cap therapy so it has an air
pump it pushes it into your lungs to
open your channels right so the
application the code is running in Java
this is actually you know cellular
connectivity to be able to push you know
the information 24 by 7 but he an also
cache data locally in case there's no
network connectivity and you can do
remote over the adjustments essentially
all the day is captured on the server
the other platform as a service they run
analytics and they can in real time
you're through an algorithm or are they
are through dr. looking at the data they
can decide to do a remote adjustment 40
miles deep convo so this is a great
example of fairly critical technology
being used and I mean in a real war
manner and they're sold you know several
millions of this and they are
essentially companies and distributors
and companies actually managing right I
don't think Philips does actually the
management when you buy the device they
go through companies actually provide
the contract and I know tech tech
probably no guest book of the liability
and probably a subcontractor
question here from the device standpoint
is you're a larger opportunity for all
of these devices and different
categories is it preventive health
diagnosis treatments like you were
saying the increase billions of people
with diabetes but do you think that
because we'll have so many devices out
with all this preventative health maybe
that will be reduced I mean what is your
take on in marketing we will actually be
using it so i can add from a from an
interim perspective i think we can
contribute a lot to those professional
applications doctor to patient and
especially in the area of chronic
diseases so not the the critical
intensive care stuff of course but but
monitoring of chronic disease is where
there's sometimes a very slow
deterioration of the condition that you
want to detect early on but it's not so
well yeah time critical life critical I
think that's that's a big area for us at
least but of course there's other
applications like in preventive care
where probably a lot more money could be
saved but that's more in the consumer
space I think there's a big debate about
you know what is the future of health is
it a preventive care and wellness or
says like better recovery and from
perspective like I like to think of it
in terms of motivation it's very hard to
motivate people to take care of
themselves pretties wellness but once
then a condition occurs an incident
occurs people will be on it for the next
month or two making sure that they get
better and right now that month or two
that recovery processes is terrible
right maybe see a doctor a couple times
a month if you're lucky but essentially
during that whole entire time everything
you're experiencing your metrics your
condition you know your your
improvements during that time is
essentially lost either in your memory
or you know completely and doctor
doesn't know about it so tactically or
immediately that part of space of being
able to manage your recovery is
something that you can do with these
devices as well as something that
doctors with their kind of authoritative
demeanor can tell patients to do and
follow along with
yeah and so the question comes back on
so to who is going to pay right if you
like a crazy disease management is
essentially non-recognition that the
insurance company is the K organization
the one who have to actually to pick in
pony up you know money how the one that
are thinking about doing that now so
they are looking to our model that's now
cut off like the nation's you know model
company right the insurance company move
that right for car insurance by meaning
that they'll make people pay more for
the insurance if they actually you know
do not you know do preventive you know
no prevention ahead of time so I think
there's a great opportunity there for
because for them it's all about
constriction and in the u.s. what fifty
percent of the embryo are self-insured
so they end up adding to pay alimony for
essentially you know things that they
could have prevented and they could have
done a better job involving a chronic
disease management programs so we
probably have time for a few more but
actually I second TV sorry I dick ever
well there because the right just to
vary a little bit
I know that I can take a look at what
the dangerous send that I see them face
green yes sighs their problem and a big
there's a problem dr. have already taken
care of it Asajj feedback channels yes
yeah so typically yes because the data
is basically all standing on a server
right so from there you can have like
mobile unit services you know desktop in
a web services we can basically look at
look at the data right so once you get
the data on the server you can do all
kind of chronic midget management kind
of any kind of access right no you can
talk about maybe just to jump in with an
example for like blood pressure there
are jnc standards so based on the
reading sometimes some blood pressure
monitors show a pressure rating
indicator to show exactly what group
level you fall in you know you're fine
with blood pressure borderline
hypertension stage 1 stage 2 so that can
also be you know color coded on an
application or a dashboard so if you're
you know in the red or something then
you would see it in red if you're
reading is okay to come in green so
there are certain standards so for blood
pressure it's J&amp;amp;C and then for weight
it's calculated through the BMI and
based on BMI levels with your height
they could deem you as overweight obese
or in line like for more like um you
know tougher issues that require actual
adapter systems diagnosis a lot of this
data that's collected you know there's
are very smart across different disease
groups they're very smart decision
support systems today that take this
data analyze and produce predicted
diagnosis now typically you don't want
to actually give these predictive
diagnosis right back to the patients
because that's a liability but what they
essentially do is they help a doctor
make a much quicker decision about what
the patient has and adopting and using
some of these automation tools can
quickly approve and send a message back
to the patient like here's where you are
color coded here's how you're doing etc
but the idea is that the doctor time
spent on performing this analysis is
much shorter than it was before and
allows them to basically treat more
patients and get
patients get burnt much better data and
insights about other progressive thank
you very much a single rina last time
we're gonna have to stop but we're going
to be available in afterwards for those
of us too because if you want to ask
question and also we have a demo next
door so if you want to stop by and see
it in action please please stop by and
thank you very much for Pineda</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
