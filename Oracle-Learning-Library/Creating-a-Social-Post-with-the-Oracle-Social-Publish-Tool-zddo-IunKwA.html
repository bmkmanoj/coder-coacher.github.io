name is Nick and in this video I'll
demonstrate creating a post and publish
publish starts here on the post page
let's create a post by clicking the
create a post button first we'll name
the post give your post a descriptive
name to help you find it later on the
post page and publish or and listen and
analyze your followers can't see the
name you're typing here I want to
publish this post to our Facebook stream
in our Twitter stream but I don't want
to publish to Google+ so I'll deselect
the Google+ option now let's enter the
content of the post you'll notice as I
type previews are being generated to
show you what the message will look like
on each social network if for our tweet
let's use a hashtag now let's add a
photo I'll click the add Media button
which looks like a paperclip and since I
want to add a new photo I'll click the
Add button I'll upload this one for my
local folder
give it a name and description and then
click attach now I can see the image
that I want so I'll select it our
administrator has set Facebook photos to
publish to the wall album by default we
could publish to a newsfeed there's
another how-to video that gives more
details on publishing photos we'll
schedule the post for 6:00 p.m. Friday
night this publishes when it's 6:00 p.m.
in your timezone the timezone where
you're writing the post that's fine for
us because the farmers market is local
and most of our audience will be
checking their pages on their way home
from work the listen analyse section of
social marketing can give you insight
into finding the best time to schedule a
post that will maximize user engagement
based on previous activity
so now let's treat the post for Friday 6
p.m. by clicking the schedule button and
we'll publish to Facebook and Twitter
now that we're done creating a post were
taken back to the post page if we look
below in the post grid we can see the
post we just created one for Facebook
and one for Twitter they're scheduled
but not published yet
fast forward to Friday night and this is
what our fans will see on Facebook so
that's how easy it is to create a post
and publish if you need more information
our documentation can be found here or
if you'd like to see more demos you can
find those at our Learning Library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
