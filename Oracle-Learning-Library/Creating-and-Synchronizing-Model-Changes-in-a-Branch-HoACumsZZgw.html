to create and synchronize model changes
in a branch you are now ready to create
a branch so you're going to right-click
on release one in the trunk and select
branch and you're going to browse to
select the branch node and click OK and
then click OK to create the branch so
now if you expand the branch node out in
the navigator you're gonna see release 1
is located there so now we're going to
make some changes in the trunk which is
the model that we have open so the first
change we're going to move one of the
tables and we're going to save that
change to our local copy and then we
want to go to the pending changes and
commit that change to create a revision
in the repository in the trunk it does
not change the branch at all so now what
we're going to do is create make another
change so we're going to double click on
order items and go to the columns and
create a column and once we do that we
click OK and we'll go ahead and save
that change to our locally saved copy
and then we'll go ahead and commit those
changes to the subversion repository in
the trunk so we've made two changes
since we've created the branch and we've
made those changes on the trunk and now
we're going to go ahead and make a third
change by moving a table in this case
the orders table and save that change
and then we'll go ahead and commit those
changes to the repository so we've made
three train changes in the trunk and now
we're going to close this model and
we're going to go ahead and open up the
branch model by we're going to check it
out first and we're going to create a
directory where we're going to check it
out too so we'll call it release one
branch and then click OK and so it
checked that up from the repository so
now we're going to go ahead and open up
that model so I'm going to go to the
release one branch drug
and select the model to open now the
model is open and if we scroll down
you'll see that the changes that we made
are not in this branch copy and so we
want to take a look at the changes since
we created the branch so we're going to
go ahead and select the versioning and
then merge design because we want to
merge the changes that we made in the
branch in the trunk
into the branch so we're going to browse
to select the trunk version and then see
what revisions have been made since and
so we see that there have been a few
revision eleven twelve and thirteen have
been made so we want to select those
revisions and then right-click and we
can first test the merge to make sure
that there's no conflicts and we do see
that it has finished successfully so we
can go ahead and perform the merge so
we're going to do that and you'll notice
that the changes have been incorporated
so if I scroll up a bit you'll see that
the tables have been moved and the
column was added so we're now going to
go ahead and save the changes into our
branch version and then we can select
the pending changes and update these a
version repository with those changes so
we're going to go ahead and commit those
changes we'll specify that we wanted to
merge the changes into the branch and
then commit those changes you can also
see that the revisions are in sync now
if you expand in the tree in the
navigator both the branch and the trunk
and then expand out you'll see that the
revisions in both of the branch and the
trunk are the same
you have just learned how to create and
synchronize model changes in a branch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
