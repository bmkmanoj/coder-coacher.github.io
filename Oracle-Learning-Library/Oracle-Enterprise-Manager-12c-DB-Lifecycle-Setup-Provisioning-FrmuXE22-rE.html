Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series users can ensure the
consistency and compliance of their
database deployments from the very
beginning by using enterprise managers
database provisioning capabilities to
access the database provisioning
capabilities go to enterprise
provisioning and patching database
provisioning Enterprise Manager 12
introduces several new capabilities and
concepts including the separation of
rolls into a designer and operator role
a designer can essentially create
standardized deployment procedures with
pre-populated values that can be locked
and when they can then grant access to
operators to their pre-populated
deployment procedure and the operators
will not be able to change those locked
down values this ensures consistency of
deployments because there is no way to
change those values from there locked
values Enterprise Manager 12 also
introduces the database profile concept
that a profile is nothing more than a
reference installation that is stored in
the software library that includes the
configuration of that deployment as well
as the software structure and in the
data as well at the database if is so
desired these profiles can be used in
conjunction with the deployment
procedures to pre-populate many of the
values and then also be used in the
deployment procedure to deploy that same
software therefore eliminating the need
to deploy simply the installation image
and then patch it after the fact your
needs so the to create one of these
database reference profiles is very
simple I simply click on create and then
point it at a reference database
installation
then choose what options i want to have
created from that whether it be a
template gold image and then submit the
job and that will be automatically
stored in the software library to use a
database profile we can launch one of
the out-of-the-box procedure deployment
procedures or a customized deployment
procedure as you can see down below you
can see that Oracle ships with numerous
out-of-the-box deployment procedures for
single instance as well as real
application clusters as well as specific
tasks related to those but types of
deployments including scale up and scale
down for real application clusters I can
customize an out-of-the-box deployment
procedure by selecting it and click
clicking on create like or I can simply
launch this procedure and then we'll be
able to tailor it to our needs the
inputs to our needs and save that as a
new deployment procedure so you can see
to begin with we can choose whether to
use a reference profile which we are
going to in this case we'll check will
use this reference that I've created
prior to this and I can select attacks
task so I wish to perform including
deploying the grid infrastructure the
creating a database as well if I'm going
to be choosing a database gold image as
well in this case I'm just going to
choose database software you'll notice
that this padlock exists here and in
this case I'm going to click on lock
this locks this input so that when I
save the procedure at the end as a new
name the operators that will get access
to this procedure will not be able to
make changes to anything that has been
locked therefore again guaranteeing
consistency amongst the deployed
software in my enterprise I'll click on
search and I'm going to choose just a
host in this case to deploy on will
click on next and now i'm giving a
number of steps to follow here the
number of steps will
vary based upon the deployment procedure
in this case I only have two that I need
to complete I will choose the privileges
or the operating system credentials to
use and again I'm going to lock these
down and I'm going to click Next I'm
going to lock the users of the group's
down rather and click on next then I'm
going to click on deployed software and
I'm going to lock down all of the inputs
here as well and we can I can I need to
choose a reference database software to
choose from here I'm going to choose a
reference gold image that I created
earlier when generating the profile so
I'm going to select that and I'm going
to lock that down as well and then Auto
choose next and I've completed both the
tasks so that I can move on to the
custom properties if any and we're going
to I can choose on to schedule this and
notification I'm just going to leave
these as by a default and then I'm going
to go next and click on instead of
submitting the job at this point I'm
going to click on save at this point
when I choose save I can give this a
pre-configured deployment procedure a
new name and I'm going to click on save
so I've now saved a deployment procedure
and I'm just going to cancel out of this
procedure and click yes now if we go
down in the list of deployment
procedures we can see that I have a pre
pop I have my procedure here which is
now pre-populated with the inputs that I
just entered and I can give it edit the
permissions to this to expose it or
grant access to the operators who can
then execute or launch this procedure
that they will be unable to make changes
to any of those locked down in this is
the end of the demonstration thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
