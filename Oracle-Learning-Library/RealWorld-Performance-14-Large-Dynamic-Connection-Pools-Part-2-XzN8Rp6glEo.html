completely unstable and unproductive
we've got to rescue the situation at
this point in time is usually a lot of
corporate blame game playing usually the
users are complaining and the
application to team are blaming the
database and the database of blaming the
operating system when in fact really
this is the challenge of one of
architecture so at this point in time
usually people are saying I don't want
more connections to the database or the
database team are saying I want less
connections to the database so at this
point in time what I'm going to do is
reduce the number of connections down to
a third of what we had which was the
6000 let's do that and actually see what
actually happens at this point in time
we've totally lost the system so at this
point in time we're going to rebuild the
connection pool and it's going to take a
little while and this a lesson to be
learnt of the fact it takes a while to
rebuild a large connection pool and tear
it down this is what happens when we
have to do a failover so if you were to
be designing a system architecture would
you design an architecture with lots of
moving parts that need to be
reestablished and failed over that's
something we need to consider when we
design architecture for high performance
as well as high architecture does it
have the capability to failover quickly
okay so you can see that we've recovered
the system and actually cut down the
connection pool and as a result we can
see that the transaction rate has come
back up again CPU utilization is come up
but the transit the actual response time
is again still fairly poor it's up near
240 nearly a hundred milliseconds in
itself and so we still haven't actually
solved the stability of the system
there still is weight events in
contention going on inside the database
here at this point in time it's it's
it's on a latch
although the throughput is back on the
system but we can see that the response
time is
all bouncing around quite a little bit
although the CPU is up in the 90%
utilization now the fact that we reduce
the number of connections what I like to
think about is what happens if we have
those connections set to 2,000 in the
pool and we jumped it to 6,000 at this
point in time the system is still not
ideal but there would have been a
faction of people saying we need more
connections now we show showed what
happens when we went with a higher
number of connections we've just reduced
it but it's still not perfect by any
stretch of the imagination in terms of
the performance so what we're going to
start doing is taking a little bit of
computer science remember when we were
at school we learnt about time slicing
and trying to schedule multiple
processes onto a CPU we learnt very
quickly that there be a point where if
you over schedule the CPU you would
actually get a lower throughput on the
system altogether and this is being
played out on a bigger and bigger scale
now I know I have 24 cores more
processors on this machine that I'm
working on so if I was to reduce this
connection or the number of active
processes more in phase with computer
science and get it down closer to 24 or
a small multiple of 24 let's think and
see what would actually happen to the
performance and the stability of the
system so this point I'm going to drop
instead of having over 2,000 connections
in the pool I'm going to take it to 144
and let's just apply that change and
let's just see what actually happens to
both the throughput the user response
time and actually the CPU on the system
well you can see we're now doing the
transition and you'll notice that very
quickly that transition and
reestablishing the connection pool took
next to no time at all remember how long
it took when we tried to come down from
6,000 to 2,000 took a long time to
transition across that drop in that
connection pool down to 144 was
extremely quick imagine you'll fail over
being that quick and now let's see what
see what actually has
into the system it's quite dramatic the
only thing I have changed is the size of
the connection pool the workload is
coming at me at the same rate but if we
actually look and see what's happening
to the system you'll notice that one the
response time now is under 10
milliseconds of time spent both in the
application server and on the database
we've got this huge drop down in
response time it's a much more
consistence we see slightly more
throughput on the system but what's more
interesting is look at the drop in the
amount of CPU being utilized on the
system now this is where it becomes
extremely difficult to argue in a highly
charged escalation meeting to explain to
somebody you want to reduce the number
of connections so you can reduce the
amount of CPU so you can get faster
response time and get more work through
the system at some point in what I've
just said I've contradicted myself but
the reality is is we are actually using
less CPU we are getting higher
throughput and the response time is less
and half the clue is twofold it is one
you'll notice we're not doing any
contention events now inside the
database so all that CPU that we were
wasting spinning on latches and
arbitrating contention is now being
redirected to actually process database
transactions and the other aspect of the
thing is because we're running fewer and
fewer connections to the database those
connections are staying on the CPU
they're staying scheduled on the CPU for
longer and as a result all memory page
is associated with those processes are
staying resident on the CPU cache and as
a result they become more and more
efficient at scheduling and they're
stalling less on memory and as a result
we just raise the performance game so
just to summarize dynamic connection
pools are extremely dangerous because
they can this destabilize the system
really quickly we showed that in slow
motion as we increment it the workload
and then connection pools that are
massively oversubscribe
the system I a hundred a thousand times
a number of cause on the system are
inherently inefficient and again can
destabilize the system very quickly
