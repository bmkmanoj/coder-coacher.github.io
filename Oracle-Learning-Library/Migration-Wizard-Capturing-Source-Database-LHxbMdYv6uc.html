demonstration in this demo you'll learn
how to use the migration wizard to
migrate from a third-party database to
Oracle once you've established a
connection to your source database and
you created a migration repository
you're ready to use the migration wizard
for this example I will be migrating
from a Sai based database select your
source database connection right click
to open up the context menu select
migrate to Oracle this will open up the
migration wizard you notice that there's
a series of steps that you'll be going
through the first step is identifying
the migration repository you'll then
give your project a name specify your
source database capturing the source
database you'll then convert your
metadata and then translate any sequel
select your target database then you're
ready to leave your data at any point in
each of these steps you have the option
of proceeding directly to the summary
page this allows you to exit the
migration wizard and you can come back
to the wizard at a later time the step
this is where you select a connection
that holds the migration repository here
the name I'm migrating from Sybase and
the database is pubs cue for the output
directory this is where I want to
specify a location where I want the
generated scripts and all the migration
logs to be stored click on choose to
navigate to the location in the source
database step this is where you can
choose to either do an online or offline
migration if you have a large migration
you want to go ahead and select offline
this will generate the migration scripts
for you to be able to execute add
another time so we have a small database
we're going to be migrating I'll leave
the default of online mode in the
connection this is where I specified the
source database and in the capture step
I'll select the database that I'll be
migrating its plots to and now you're
ready for the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
