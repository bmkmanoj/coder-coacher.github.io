cpu and heatsink installation crew step
1 caution possible component damage the
pins of the CPU socket can be easily
damaged if touched or if the CPU is
installed incorrectly do not drop the
CPU onto the socket the CPU sits atop
the socket and does not require
insertion do not press down on the CPU
step to open the cover ensure that the
CPU retaining cover and the release
lever are in there fully open and
upright position step 3 ally on the CPU
and socket keys make sure that the
notches and the keys are aligned one
corner of the CPU is marked with a
triangle and one corner of the CPU
socket is also marked with a triangle
these two triangles are the key and must
align when the triangles are aligned
other king notches and trims line up as
well but not just an indents in the
socket and CPU lineup and the CPU says
flat within the socket step 4 set the
CPU in the socket caution possible
component damage the pins in the CPU
socket can be easily damaged if touched
or if the CPU is installed incorrectly
carefully set the CPU in the socket
ensuring at the notches and indents in
the socket and the CPU align and the CPU
says flat within the socket do not drop
the CPU under the socket the CPU sits
atop the socket and does not require
insertion do not press down on the CPU
step 5 close the CPU retaining cover
close the CPU retaining cover lower the
release lever and secure it under the
retaining clip step 6 apply thermal
compound caution possible thermal
related component damage to ensure the
proper transfer of heat away from the
surface of the CPU apply the entire
contents of the syringe step 7 clean off
the heatsink bottom if you are reusing a
heatsink be certain to clean off the
bottom with an alcohol wipe step 8
secure the heat sink
lower the heat sink onto the top of the
CPU caution system thermal failure or
component damage once the bottom of the
heatsink contacts the top of the CPU do
not move the heatsink excessive heat
sink movement can cause a thermal
compound to smear and become uneven this
can result in voids in the compound that
can negatively impact the transfer of
heat away from the cpu step 9 tighten
heatsink screws press down on the center
of the heatsink to engage the
spring-loaded captive screws with the
threaded standoffs on the motherboard
pressing down on the heatsink relieves
the pressure generated by the
spring-loaded screws to secure the
heatsink alternately tighten the captive
screws 180 degrees until both screws are
fully tightened</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
