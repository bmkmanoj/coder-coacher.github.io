you how to create a Java call out using
oracle solar suite for healthcare
integration here you can see the Java
code that I've created for this demo
call-outs allow you to incorporate your
own Java code into a healthcare
integration application I want to set a
transport custom header for inbound
messages so here I've entered this text
my custom header healthcare will invoke
the call out immediately after it
receives an inbound message from the
remote system and then this test
directory you can see the class file and
the jar file that were created from
compiling my java code now in the
healthcare console on the designer
administration tab will go to settings
runtime and here we need to specify the
location of the jar file so let's enter
the directory and apply now we'll create
the call out so let's go to
configuration and we'll double click
call out to create a new one we'll give
it a name and select the jar file and
the implementation class and click OK
and now you see the new call out now
will include the call out in the inbound
endpoint so let's go two endpoints and
will open this our patient admission
endpoint and for the transport call out
will enter the call out that we just
created now to load the call out we have
to re-enable it so let's disable it and
apply
and then re-enable it and apply now
we're ready to test the call out we have
the simulator running and you can see
it's log messages in this window here so
let's drop our message into the in
folder and it disappears you can see the
log messages coming up and the message
appears in the out folder so it's done
now in the health care console will go
to reports and will view the end bound
message for the outpatient admission
let's close this pain and let's view the
wire message now let's scroll down and
in the protocol transport binding
section let's scroll down here and in
this custom header field you can see the
custom header text has been set
correctly so the transport call out is
working note that if you need to change
the jar file for health care to read the
new jar file you need to restart the
solar server so that's it for creating a
call out in Oracle solar suite for
healthcare integration for more
information on Oracle's so is sweet for
healthcare integration please visit the
Oracle Learning Library and watch other
videos in this series and also visit the
Oracle technology Network thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
