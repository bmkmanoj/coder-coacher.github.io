to collaborate with us through Oracle
social network when an outside user is
part of a conversation or has access to
a document I'm notified with a banner at
the top of the screen outside users have
limited privileges and can only see
items they've specifically been given
access to for example they can only see
conversations of which their members and
they can't see any user walls once our
system administrator enables extended
collaboration and sets up a white list
of email domains from which we can
invite users I can invite outside users
to join conversations just like I'd add
any other user to the list of members
the only difference is that I enter the
person's email address when I save my
changes the person is sent an email
invitation the email the outside user
receives includes a link to join the
conversation on our social network and
if necessary includes login information
he or she clicks join now and logs in to
open the conversation and get started
when the user logs in there immediately
brought to the conversation they were
invited to thank you for watching for
more information be sure to visit us
online
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
