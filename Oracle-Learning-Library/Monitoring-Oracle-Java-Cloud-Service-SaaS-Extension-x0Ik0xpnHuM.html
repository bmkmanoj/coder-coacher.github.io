extension instances I'll use Oracle Java
cloud service SAS extension control a
powerful web-based interface that
displays in a single view all usage
metrics for a single JCS SAS extension
instance each region contains a
different set of data that can either
point to a specific performance issue or
when taken together provide insight into
the overall health of my instance or the
applications running on it the
performance summary region helps
identify any issues that might affect
the availability of the service instance
along with a 24-hour timeline it
indicates when the instance was up or
down I can also see critical information
about disk usage servlets and JSP
sessions and important jdbc connection
data when monitoring my service here I
want to be sure that the number of open
JDBC connections is within the expected
range if that number increases steadily
over time one or more of my applications
might be having trouble managing
database connections and transactions I
should also monitor all three servlet
and JSP data points to see if their
values indicate any unexpected
performance the data sources region
lists the data sources associated with
my service in the response of the load
region I can compare request processing
time to the number of requests per
minute and see any correlation between
those two metrics this data will show me
if the servers are behaving as expected
if any server is overloaded or if a
server is taking too long to respond and
load anything i need to do with my
applications i can do here in the
applications region not only can I
review the status of the applications
deployed to my service but I can also
deploy delete and redeploy them from
here and start or stop them to be sure
an individual deployment is working as
expected I can also test it
when I want to see information about a
specific application I can open its
homepage and see a performance summary
information about servlet and JSP
sessions requests on the work manager
and detect any load and response issues
I can also launch the application from
here
similar to the applications region I can
use the libraries region to deploy and
manage any shared java ee libraries or
optional packages supported by oracle
weblogic server the table also shows the
status and other details for the
deployed libraries I can monitor CPU and
heap activity here in the resource usage
region this data will let me know if the
servers are behaving as expected or if
any server is overloaded or using too
many resources if either of these
conditions exist I can request more
servers or if I suspect my servers are
performing poorly that's the cloud
administrator to restart them whenever I
submit a job for my service a summary of
that job appears in the jobs region here
I can review the job status and you
logged information for each job if I
suspect there might be a problem with
the job for example the deployment fails
i can check one of the activity logs
these text documents let me know if the
application contains a virus or could
otherwise cause problems for instance
let's say that I suspected deployment is
failing because it's using disallowed
packages to investigate this possibility
i'll take a look at the whitelist
validation lock well I could save the
login review it later I'll just open it
now this lug shows if any packages are
disallowed if I don't find anything here
I can check for other problems in one of
the other logs JCS a sixth inch control
logs all application activity two
messages I can view on the view log
messages page here I can display the
service and application log messages by
date range and message type I can filter
the results to just those containing a
specific text string
or buy messages that apply to a specific
application
I can also select which logs to search
when I find a message of interest I can
display it here this is helpful if a
message is longer than the space
provided in the message list as might be
the case with an error message finally
if I want to save a message for later
reference I can export it in one of
these formats
the tools available on JCS SAS extension
control make monitoring instances and
applications a simple task to learn more
about this subject and all other aspects
of JCS SAS extension visit us online at
cloud.oracle.com the Oracle Learning
Library or any of these other Oracle
websites and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
