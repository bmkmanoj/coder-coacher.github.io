to take this time to plan out this
webcast is a live presentation of an
Oracle by example an OBE tutorial of the
same name and I'll paste the URL to the
tutorial in the chat window so if you
would like to follow along look at what
I'm presenting as I'm presenting it you
can go to that link that I posted to the
checker no give me this is the standard
Oracle safe harbor notice basically it
states that this webcast does not imply
a contract between us and that what I'm
presenting today should not be used to
make any purchasing decisions okay to
get the most out of this webcast I am
assuming that you have some experience
with eclipse
ideally have some experience with ADF
and Java Enterprise Edition but if you
don't don't worry about that you can use
this webcast to kind of get a feel for
eclipses of the nigh de or potentially
to get a feel for the types of tools at
Oracle offers to the OEt and how to use
ADF to create applications and create
database schemas with Oracle cloud which
is really the focus of this presentation
so for this webcast I have already
installed in my local system here the
Oracle Enterprise pack for Eclipse this
specific version twelve point one point
one point two this version number is
kind of important and missed the version
of a week P that's specifically designed
for use for the world of cloud I also
have installed Oracle sequel developer
which we use a little bit later to copy
the local schema from an Oracle database
to the Oracle database cloud service
I've also installed the Oracle Java
cloud service SDK which is part of a
download set required to
with Oracle Java cloud service and then
lastly I have an instance of the Oracle
cloud a trial version now before we
continue I'm going to ask area to put up
a couple of polling questions here to
get your eye gaze your experience level
with Java SE and een with ADF so if we
took the time to complete those surveys
and and I'll continue along as you're
doing that but one last thing I want to
mention about the software one of the
advantages of working with Oracle is
that all of this software of the Oracle
Enterprise pack for Eclipse sequel
developer and the cloud service SDK even
the Oracle cloud itself and trial
version is all available to developers
for free under what's called a developer
license so this allows you to learn how
to work with these products and yeah
there's some experience before you or
your company decides to make any first
decisions so I'm sure by now you've
heard the term cloud it's pretty much
become a buzzword in the industry it's
certainly become the standard by which
all things pool are being judged you
know if you have something in the cloud
and one of the things that's that's
important to understand is that a cloud
comes really in three different flavors
one of those is infrastructure as a
service or IaaS is the second is
platform as a service or pass and the
left one is software as a service and
what this graphic depicts here is the
relative functionality of each of these
different cloud types so each of these
different clouds provides a certain
amount of technology that represents a
service level for each of these clouds
so an example of these
various different clouds and a good
example of an eye as is a kiss Amazon's
gg to a good example of a software of a
service clearly the other end of the
spectrum is Salesforce I'm sure you've
heard enough sense Oracle now has a
relationship with so forth and in the
middle and the one that we're going to
look at today this is really the realm
of the Oracle cloud it is and others but
Oracle cloud is a form of the service so
I have a platform as a service Oracle
Java Oracle cloud actually had several
different components platform services
that it provides to you as a developer
it has a database service over here it
has a Java service here in the middle
and as with these two components it
provides the functionality to produce
applications that consume or create Web
Services restful restful services ADF
services and all of that is controlled
by the Java cloud service and includes
an identity management component so it
has a fully capable application server
instance running in a remote location in
the cloud that allows you to create
applications that can be then deployed
on the web on a mobile device as an
office application or even to another
cloud in case you have one cloud
communicating with another clock so the
Oracle by example tutorial that's the
basis for this webcast and in that sorry
in that tutorial you'll find a link
download OAP again the Oracle Enterprise
pack or Eclipse so let me just state
that Oracle Enterprise
circlets is a Eclipse distribution in
fact it's Eclipse 3.8 and they all have
names so this particular one is called
Juno and that distribution is integrated
with WebLogic server cloud and ADF
components which makes it basically
fully functional to do the types of
things we want to do today today we're
going to write an application on a local
system do all the development locally
and then deploy that application to the
cloud does sort of our production system
so this follows the typical model I
think for working with cloud where you
would work locally do all your testing
all your developments have it even
potentially you know justed within your
organization and then move it as a
tested tested application to the cloud
so in this webcast what we're going to
do is follow that that model that
development model we're going to create
we're going to look at a created
application we're going to take that
application and we're going to run it
locally we're going to pretend that the
development is already happened I'll a
lot tear the application show you what
it is it's a simple ADF application so
you can see from the picture it has
three panels
one of the panel's has information about
departments kind of panel has
information about employees and then the
third panel has a pie chart graph the
display the salaries of the employees in
a particular department so it's nothing
complex or overly complicated but it
does illustrate both the use of ADF
applications in ativ components in the
native application and it also is taking
the data and recording the data to an
actual database so we're going to move
that database a schema and all of its
data to the cloud that will be part of a
limb doing this webcast
and then we'll deploy the application to
the cloud and again as if we were doing
a production deployment of this
particular application okay so let's get
started let me share out my desktop here
there we go okay so here I have the
Oracle Enterprise pack for Eclipse
running and install again all the
download information for you to download
this particular instance of OAP is in
the tutorial that I posted paste of the
link to in the chat and I'll do that
again at the end for those of you who
joined a little bit later so I have it
running here on my laptop this is a
Windows 7 laptop I also have running in
the background a local instance of an
Oracle XE database and it's been
populated with the sample HR database
schema so let's start by running or
starting my local Oracle WebLogic server
instance I have it installed already but
it's not running so I'll go ahead and
start that it'll take a few minutes to
get going down here in the bottom part
of the window you can see the progress
that the application is starting so what
we'll do while that's running is I'll go
ahead and I will open up the HR test
application and import it into my
workspace here so to do that I'm going
to click on file and then import
I'm going to import an existing project
into the workspace I need to browse to
where it is I put it in to my C colon
temp directories to make it easier to
find okay there it is to have three
components I want all those components
to come in you can decide whether or not
you want to leave the components where
they are or copy them into the workspace
I'm going to go ahead and copy it into
the workspace it just makes it a little
it just makes a copy of it from where it
is into the workspace which is fine for
this particular application okay and
down the bottom here in the window so
I'm here a bottom actually went by
quickly there but you can see that the
server is now in the running mode okay
so now my logic server instance is
running and if I come back here to the
traffic that's what logic is now started
them running okay so let's look at this
software a little bit first of all let's
look at the model the model represents
the objects that I'm planning to use in
this application all of the data so if I
look inside here at the source packages
you can see that I have some Java beans
and a branch Java B needs to communicate
with my persistence my persistence in
the background in this case my database
I have two objects that I'm going to be
working with one is the Department
object
let me open this up the Department
object simply represents an empty in my
database in this case it represents the
department's in my database
likewise employee represents the
employees table and the employees entity
in my database there's a those are the
objects that I'm going to be working
with in this application down here in
the web part of the application this is
where these are the components that
actually work with the front-end so
these are the the JSP x files that will
run in my web browser so if I look at
look down here at the web content you
see then on using a three column
template this is a standard ATF template
I have a JSP X file again this is
openness up this is simply the user
interface of component to my application
we're using standards ADF tags so we're
using that page template that I
mentioned we have like the three
different columns or putting some
information into each of those different
columns from the various tables the
employees go into the center the
department's go into the left and I'm
going to have a binding in here to a pie
chart graph again see if you're not
familiar with ADF that's okay this this
is more background information on how
ADF works it should look familiar to you
if you've never programmed with
JavaServer faces there's a lot of
similarities between JavaServer faces
and the application development
framework crazy up
anyway what we want to do at this point
is basically just to run this thing we
have an application that works we've
already done all the development so now
let's just only had and test it and
we'll test it locally so I'm going to
click on the Employee List just X file
and I'm going to run this on one of my
servers now the server I want to use
right now is my local WebLogic server
instance so simply click finish here and
this will go ahead and start the
application in a browser again down the
bottom here like an isle I had this
before finishes down the bottom here we
can see the status of the publishing to
be with to the web server so this takes
a little while this is not something
that I could preload really give it a
few minutes there we go so now the
application has started starting to load
notice that it opened in a browser in
this case I've asked it to open in my my
Chrome browser
and it's taking a sweet time here we go
loading the data from the database its
fetch the data from the database and now
may application is up and running so let
me change this a little bit so it's
easier to see okay so in this department
in the administration department we only
have one employee to go to the next
department actually have two employees
and we fetch the data to get their
salary information and do this little
pie chart with this cool little rotate
animation we show you that again rotates
in so all of this all of this
functionality all of the capability that
I'm showing you here are standard ATF
components a table in the center the pie
chart with even the rollovers the
buttons here and the capability of
loading the data from the database these
are all part of standard ADF components
so we want to do next is to take the
data now that we've determined that this
application works the way we wanted it
to we're going to do next is to take the
data from our database our local
database and move it or copy a rather to
the Oracle database cloud service so
let's do that I'm going to open another
tool I'm going to open the Oracle sequel
developer tool an N sequel developer I
have several connections Hyrum and open
a connection up to my local HR database
so it went out to my local Oracle XE
database instance it fetched the data
and here it is if I look at the tables
in
database I have countries departments
employees job history job locations all
sorts of information um all of these
tables the only two that I'm really
using our departments and employees for
this blob location so we'll move that
data over we'll bring that data over to
the Oracle database cloud instance so
let me close this up well that first
thing we need to do is to create a
connection to my Oracle database cloud
service and by the way this particular
instance of the Oracle sequel developer
isn't able to work with cloud that's why
I get this neat little cloud connections
icon here so let me create a new
connection to my Oracle database cloud
and the username as my email but the URL
is a piece of data that I actually need
from my Oracle cloud instance itself so
let's go there so I'm going to log in to
my trial account with sign in to my
services and I'm going to enter my
username and the password
here are my two services this is a trial
account of Oracle cloud within my trial
account I have two services I have a
database service and I have a Java
service database service is a
cloud-based Oracle database and the Java
service is a cloud-based WebLogic server
instance so what I need is information
from my database instance specifically I
need to know the host name the instance
so I'm going to grab this URL right here
copy it and I'm going to paste it into
this connection next it says what is the
SFTP the secure FTP username and hosting
so again let's go back to the Oracle
database cloud information scroll down a
little bit and here I can see that the
secure FTP the service that does the
secure FTP host for that is is this
information right here except EPW s1
blah blah blah let's copy that and paste
it into hosting and then finally the
username is this specific user account
name within my Oracle cloud instance so
I'm going to copy that and paste it here
and finally one of things I hope you
notice is the port number was actually
22 9 to 22 so we'll change that and I'll
click OK now I've created a connection
I'm not yet connected to that database
what I need to do to connect to the
database is to actually open it or
connect to it here I'll put in my
credentials or my database cloud service
which is the same as my Oracle cloud
service didn't enter the data correctly
typing too fast there we go so if I look
at my connection I can see all of the
tables that are part of my database
cloud service so there are some tables
that do come with the trial service by
default so I have demo constraint lookup
demo blah blah the pregnant employee but
I really want my local data so what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to copy or
bring over the data from my local
instance into my engine to my Oracle
cloud instance so in order to do that I
need is one of the cool little tools
inside our walk with sequel developer
I'm going to use the the cart so let me
click on view and select cart and let's
make this a little bigger so the card
allows me to move data between two
different instances of two different
databases this isn't probably one of the
coolest tools I think in Oracle sequel
developer but it's also now been changed
so that I can move data not only between
two different local databases or local
or remote I can also remove data from
our local database instance in this case
my local XD instance - to my cloud
instance and it really could not be
simpler to use simply take the tables
that I want in this case I would like to
take the department data and the
employee data can I drag them down onto
the cart by default I'm going to copy
over the data definition language
the company over to Sima follow the
information necessary to construct these
two tables in whatever remote site I
want them to go but I also want the data
to go over so by simply collecting
simply checking this box data I'm now
going to send the data as well as the
schema over notice I have a little icon
to deploy to my cloud I simply click
that button and I can copy the schema
and the data over to my cloud connection
I'll give this deployment a title we'll
call HR TB copy I already have the
server that it's going to in the port
number I have the SFTP password SFTP
user name I do need to enter a separate
password for that secure FTP account so
let me go ahead and do that I have some
choices about how to transfer the
information I'm just going to use a zip
file and on the other end I can decide
whether or not I want to replace any
existing objects or not replace existing
objects they don't exist currently it
doesn't matter I think that a good rule
of thumb you probably want to replace
two distinct estimation objects assuming
that you're basically doing an upgrade
from a local database to the remote
database so then it will click apply I
can ask a question about whether I want
to overwrite my zip file say yes and it
starts running in the background now
while that's running it's running that
in the background while that's running
let me scroll down here and show you how
it's being deployed that I have some
status here about a diplomat if you can
see it goes way at the bottom of my
screen here but I'll double click this
this shows me the status basically of
the deployment as it's happening so
right now the status is approved if i
refresh this log eventually it will go
from approved to process indicating that
it has moved over the schema and then it
has populated those two tables with with
data so let's see if that's happened yet
don't click on refresh let's do that one
more time
not quite Ariat
okay well well that's happening just one
more time well well that may be thing
you've been time to refresh the status
here let's actually go back to the
tables I'm going to click on tables here
and refresh my tables and see if they've
appeared yet no okay no no it's way over
there well we can also check the status
here in the database itself in my
database cloud service I can go to my
data resources let's launch a service ok
I can open up the sequel workshop so
this will tell me all of the current
information about my database cloud
service so I could see what objects have
been what tables have been created
recently and when they've been created I
can get information about I can run a
specific sequel command you know there's
a lot of information that I can process
with the interface to the database cloud
service ok let's see what's going on
here the log
there they are okay good second time was
the charm so here's my departments and
my employees so he successfully brought
over the data now that I've done that I
can run my application in the Oracle
Java cloud services so let's go back to
ite here but before I can do that one of
the things that a lot of point out is
let's go back up and look at the the
model for my local version if I look at
the persistence dot XML file
persistence dioxin on file is a
persistence unit definition and it
describes how the information is being
transferred between between the database
and my application so what I need to
look at here is the connection what type
of connection am i using with this
persistence unit so right now the
application is using a resource local
transaction type which means that it's
using a JDBC driver and you can see that
down here Oracle dot G DBC a local
driver to communicate with my local taxi
instance data obviously is not going to
work in the cloud what I want to do in
the cloud is to use a Java transaction
API rather than a resource locally we
need to use a container so I'm simply
going to change that from resource local
to GTA and I can specify the JTA data
source show you that let's go back to
light my cloud information look at my
database details again the service name
or the JTA is database so that's what I
want to enter into this information
about where to get the data from in my
cloud deployed of
so on simply a type database here I'll
save my persistence dot XML and now I'm
going to run this application on a
server this time instead of running it
locally I'm not going to run it on my
cloud instance again this little window
down here in the bottom is very valuable
to sort of tell you what the status is
right now telling you it's publishing
the Oracle cloud at 0% a few seconds
that'll change to more than 0% you know
so then it goes from 0 to 50 almost $100
once
and I can actually look at the
information about how the deployment is
happening by looking at the log files I
got to do it here by the way through
eclipse or I can actually look at it
online as well let me show you that I'm
going to go to my database that's are
eating my Java cloud service oh well
while I was going to show you the status
it actually opened up the application in
my cloud service that's why I got this
pop-up window in in Chrome so it's
loading the application
now it's actually running deputies now
if I was not already logged into my Java
cloud service I would have to login
first I'd have to go through and the
single sign-on that I showed you earlier
when I logged in to the cloud service
but in this case because I'm already
authenticated we went right into the
application so here's the application
you can see by the URL I'm actually
running in my cloud application I'm not
running this locally there's the
identity domain for my cloud service I'm
running in the Oracle cloud apps book
website so again if I move to the next
row data in the department I open up the
Department salaries and I display that
information in the pie chart okay same
thing I mean didn't keep going that
tenet performance as you can see is
about the same whether I'm running it
locally or when I'm running it through
the clouds the benefit of course running
in the cloud is that I'm not using any
local resources and anyone who has a
single sign-on can use this application
so that's what I wanted to demonstrate
for you today basically how to take an
application run it locally potentially
develop it locally run it locally and
then deploy it if and the data to your
Oracle cloud instance my sort of task
for you is to go take a look at the app
the tutorial again let me take the check
the URL and at this time I will paste it
into the chat again okay so that's the
URL for the old EE that I demonstrated
so we recommend that you go to Oracle or
cloud our local comm and request the
30-day free trial service of Oracle
cloud and and try out this webcast so
let's go back to the slides for a minute
a couple more things I wanted to show
you and I have a couple more polling
questions for you at this time if you
can chew those up Gary
you're on thank you so this is the this
picture of the whip is a picture of the
Oracle Learning Library website it's a
collection of three demonstrations and
tutorials covers a broad range of
subjects the one I cover today as part
of this part of this collection to go to
the Oracle Learning Library there's a
very simple URL it is Oracle Oracle comm
slash LLL hang out paste that in the
chat
another resource specifically for Oracle
cloud is the Oracle cloud Learning
Center and I'll put that URL into the
chat window and ago and the Oracle cloud
Learning Center is a great resource for
information about specifically about
working with the cloud this will be that
I demonstrated today as I mentioned a
few times now is part of the Oracle
Learning Library but it's also part of
the series the series covers working
with Oracle cloud and with Eclipse with
specifically with the Oracle Enterprise
Pack forklifts we also offer other
series that cover how to work with
Oracle cloud and JDeveloper and how to
work with Oracle cloud and that means so
I want to thank you for attending today
I'll take a look and see if there's any
questions hey thanks a lot
and if there's any questions Tom we'll
deal with those now on he'll get them
he'll answer them right online we're
just about out of time here so Tom will
be checking chat for any questions do
you see any time yeah I don't see any
questions at this time
Jerry all right they'd like to mention
again if you're interested in playing
the hacktivists webcast
there was one attendee that couldn't get
any sound a problem on his laptop it is
being recorded and it'll take roughly a
day to get that recording loaded into
ool but if you want to see that
recording just access ool search for
recording my title and you should be
able to find that and play it back so I
want to thank you all for coming and
thank you Tom for a good presentation
and stay tuned you know be your email
for any upcoming Olo live presentations
you can also see the schedule if you go
directly to o ll and look for the Oh L
live calendar
thanks kin and hope you all have a good
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
