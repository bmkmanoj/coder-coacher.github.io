entitled Exadata smart flash vlog my
name is Peter physic and I'll be your
tour guide for this demonstration in
this demonstration we'll take a look at
exadata smart flash log now smart flash
log is a new feature introduced in
Exadata storage server software release
11.2 2.4 this demonstration will focus
on three main areas firstly we'll take a
look at the problem that smart flash log
solves we'll also have a look at how you
can configure smart flash log and
finally we'll take a brief look at the
metrics that are associated with smart
flash log so while I've been talking
we've established a sequel plus session
as a database administrator and we've
pulled up the event histogram associated
with the log file parallel write weight
event this weight event shows us the
latency associated with writing to the
online redo log files as you can see
from the output on the screen the
overwhelming majority in fact nearly all
of the log writes occur in less than one
millisecond however you can see at the
other end of the spectrum that there are
some log writes that are taking longer
than half a second exadata smart flash
log aims to smooth out these occurrences
where log write latency Peaks due to
temporary performance issues associated
with the normal disk based online redo
log files the goal is to deliver
consistently excellent transaction
processing performance using exudative
database machine now let's shift focus
to the Exadata storage servers and look
at how smart flash log is configured in
this demonstration we'll create smart
flash log on Exadata storage servers
which have not been previously
configured to use this feature note that
on a new Exadata storage servers
configured with the latest Exadata
storage service software
smart flash log will already be
configured so I'll have been talking
we've logged into the cell CLI utility
and confirm that there is no flash log
currently configured on this cell we can
also see the cell metrics associated
with smart flash log and since smart
flash log hasn't been configured on this
cell you can see that most of the values
are set to zero Exadata smart flash log
uses a small amount of the flash memory
available on Exadata storage server to
temporarily record online redo log
entries on this cell all the flash
memory is already allocated to exit 8 a
smart flash cache so to configure smart
flash log we must first drop the
existing flash cache then we can create
the flash log area and recreate the
flash cache to consume the remaining
flash memory
after completing the process here's what
the default smart flash log looks like
you can see that by default exadata
smart flash log is configured to use a
total of 512 megabytes of flash storage
spread across the 16 flash-based cell
disks present in the storage server
that's 32 megabytes per flash based cell
disk you can configure the flash log on
a subset of the available flash based
cell disks and you can also specify the
size of the flash log however the
default configuration shown here should
be more than adequate for most
situations now remember that each
Exadata storage server is equipped with
384 gigabytes of flash memory so 512
megabytes is a relatively small
allocation so now that we've seen how to
configure smart flash log on a single
cell let's repeat the configuration on
the remaining cells in this environment
so firstly will drop the smart flash
cache on the other two cells then we'll
use the DC
I command again to create the default
configured flash log on both cells and
finally we'll recreate the smart flash
cache area on the other two cells in
this environment after all of the
configuration commands are completed we
can examine the newly created flash log
areas and here we see essentially the
same thing that we saw on the first cell
so each smart flash log area is
configured to consume 512 megabytes
using a small amount of space on each of
the 16 flash devices on each cell in the
final part of this demonstration we'll
examine some of the metrics associated
with the use of smart flash log now to
do that we'll first execute a small
workload containing 5,000 table updates
after the workload completes we can
shift our attention back to the exadata
cells and start looking at some of the
metrics associated with smart flash log
now at this point it's worth noting that
this demonstration has been produced on
a set of virtual machines that are
simulating an Exadata database machine
so we can see smart flash log in action
but we won't get a true representation
of the way it performs so bearing that
in mind let's examine some of these
metrics we can see that since smart
flash log was configured on the cell
there's been a little over 8,300 log
right iOS serviced by the cell with
exudate a smart flash log log right iOS
are written simultaneously to disk and
to flash and the operation is deemed
completed when the quickest IO returns
in this example we can see that nearly
all of the iOS are being serviced first
using the normal disk based log files
this matches
what we observed right at the beginning
of the demonstration when we examined
the log file parallel right weight
events and saw that most rights were
completing in less than one millisecond
however we can also see
7900 requests that were serviced first
using flash we can also see metrics that
refer to outliers in this context an
outlier is a redo log right that exceeds
half a second in this example we can see
that smart flash log prevented 27
outliers however in this example we can
also see that 209 actual outliers are
still recorded this is because of the
simulated nature of the demonstration
environment on a real exadata storage
server you would expect the actual
outliers to remain close to zero when
smart flash log is enabled finally here
are the metrics relating to smart flash
log as observed on the other cells in
the environment as expected the results
are quite similar to what we saw on the
first cell this concludes the
demonstration thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
