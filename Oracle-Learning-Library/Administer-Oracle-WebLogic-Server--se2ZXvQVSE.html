cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to
perform key administration operations
against Oracle WebLogic server using
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c previously administrators were
required to use the WebLogic server
administration console or the Oracle
Enterprise Manager Fusion Middleware
control console to administer their
domain however key administration
operations are now available directly
from the Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud
control 12c console from the cloud
control console administrators may now
lock a domain configuration prior to
making configuration changes access the
system mbean browser manage JDBC data
sources configure log settings perform
selective tracing and lastly record
configuration actions performed from the
cloud control console as a series of WL
ste commands having a single tool for
both monitoring and administrating
Oracle WebLogic server simplifies an
administrators job and increases
productivity
to begin this demonstration let's
navigate to the domain that we want to
administer we'll click on the targets
tab then select middleware and from the
middleware summary page we'll drill down
into the domain that we want to
administer notice that this WebLogic
domain is version twelve one two
however administration features are
supported against web logic version 10
as well let's navigate to where we can
manage our JDBC data sources for this
domain we'll click on the target menu
and then click on JDBC data sources from
this page we can see all data sources
configured for this domain notice the
informational message indicating that
the configuration session has not been
started yet
in order for us to perform
administration operations such as
creating new JDBC datasource delete a
data source or modify a data source we
must first go to the change center to
lock and edit the domain this ensures
that no other administrators can make
their own configuration changes while we
are making ours so now that the
configuration session has been started
we can manage our data sources from this
page we can create a new JDBC datasource
delete a data source or drill down into
a data source let's drill down into an
existing data source in order to view
its configuration here we can see
general information on the JDBC
datasource as well as access to other
information on how its configured for
the purposes of this demonstration let's
modify the connection pool properties
for this data source we'll click on the
connection pool tab and change the
maximum capacity of the pool from 15 to
25 notice that while the settings were
updated successfully the change has not
yet been activated we'll have to return
to the change center in order to
activate the changes once we are ready
to do so from the cloud control console
we can also control the data source
if we click on the control tab we can
then select a specific deployed instance
of the datasource and stop it suspend it
shrink its database connection pool or
perform a number of other operations
against the datasource instance let's
return to the target menu in order to go
to the system env browser with the
system mbean browser you can view
configure and use and beans for the
purposes of this demonstration let's
change the value of the accept backlog
attribute of a server's configuration
and beam we'll click on the find icon
enter the MB name and click the arrow
icon while 7em beans were found the EM
bean for server 0 is now displayed on
the right hand side of the page we can
see at the very top of the table the
attribute that we were looking for the
accept backlog attribute we can see that
the current value is 700
so we will change it to 300 and click
the apply button since that's all the
changes we want to make for right now we
can return to the change Center to
review all the pending changes prior to
activating them these changes look good
and none require a server restart so we
can go ahead and activate them all once
all the changes have been activated
we receive a confirmation message
informing us of this and that our edit
session has been ended as part of this
demonstration we'll perform one more
administration operation an operation
which is tracked outside of the change
center feature will modify the log
settings for a managed server so let's
access the manage servers target menu
click on the logs sub menu and then
click on log configuration from here we
can modify the log levels for both
persistent log
as well as active runtime loggers we can
also modify the log file location where
messages are logged to the format of log
messages as well as the rotation
policies for log files for the purposes
of this demonstration let's change the
log level for the security logger will
change its log level from warning to
trace in order to obtain more detail in
the logs and then we'll click the apply
button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
