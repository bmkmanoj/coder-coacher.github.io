in this demo we're going to create an
application server connection in
JDeveloper before we get started there's
a couple things I've already taken care
of I've started the WebLogic admin
server and soleus servers they're
running in the background I've opened
JDeveloper and I've deployed an
application called Pio processing which
we'll see again in just a moment to
create our application server connection
we're going to use the resource palette
if it's not displayed when you open
JDeveloper you can go to the main menu
select view and from there select
resource palette the resource palette
appears on the right side of the screen
if you take a look there right now under
IDE connections we actually see an
application server connection called so
a server we see a folder underneath it
and we can actually see our deployed
application this tells us that it's in
the application server deployed now so
let's go ahead and step through the
process for actually creating an
application server connection in the
resource palette to the upper left
corner we see an icon of a file with a
starburst over it when we click on it we
discover it's a menu on that menu we
select new connection and then from the
sub menu select application server with
that choice we've invoked the create
application server connection wizard
it's a five step process in the first
step we're going to create our
connection I'm going to give my
connection a name in this case I'll call
it my connection will leave the
connection type as the default WebLogic
10.3 then click Next in the
authentication pane we give username and
password connectivity information the
WebLogic name is fine for password we're
going to use welcome one in lower case
it's the word welcome and the number one
this username and password combination
was set up when your lab machine was
first configured click Next that brings
us to the configuration pane this is
where we actually provide the substance
of our connection we provide the name of
the host where the administration server
is running the port numbers it can be
contacted on and the domain we want to
connect with our installation has used
the defaults our admin servers running
on our local machine using default port
numbers so the localhost seven thousand
one seven thousand two combination are
all fine
we're going to change the name of our
domain though to sew a domain that's
lowercase SOA underscore domain with
that typed in we click Next again we've
actually configured our connection
already what we want to do now is test
it to do that we click the test
connection button the status button
reveals the outcome of a series of tests
our goal is to see eight out of eight
tests successful and that's indeed what
we see our connection is working at this
point on the bottom of the wizard we can
either select next
or finish we're all done I'm going to go
ahead and select next so you can see
that last screen which gives us text
confirmation that we have completed
creating the connection we can dismiss
the wizard then by clicking finish I can
draw your attention back over to the
resource pallet on the right side of
JDeveloper where we started our
conversation we see there's been added a
new connection called
my connection and when I expand it I see
that I can indeed see my deployed
application so our new connection is
working equally well as our first test
connection so that's how you create an
application server connection in
JDeveloper remember you heard it here
first and thanks for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
