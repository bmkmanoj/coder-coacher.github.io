demonstration my name is Maria Billings
I work for oracle server technologies
curriculum as principal CD we want to
install you us so that we can execute OS
commands directly from enterprise
manager in this demo we first show you
the download and unzip of the tar file
then we attempt to perform a task for
which we neatly asked which will
obviously feel we install it and we
perform the same task again this time
successfully which is to view the
default system run level to download yes
open your browser to http OSS dot oracle
com on the page scroll down to the very
bottom and on the left bottom is the
access to Yost on this page you click
the download the last rpm for the
version that you need here I go to i386
or number dot tar file which I download
to the local drive I've locked into the
host terminal is the root user and you
can see that here is my tar file to
unzip the tar file I execute the tar X F
V command done
navigate from host to administration to
system services and then to the default
system run level so the information
returned is that you are required to
install asked in the a.m rapper script
to be able to perform this functionality
it also shows you the URL where you can
access it which is HTTP OS s oracle com
/ projects / last we assume that the ask
software is downloaded and unzipped and
that you are logged into a terminal on
your host is the root user so now you
confirm that you're in the right
directory by executing the LS command
and we see here on the screen that there
is indeed the install dot is age this is
the script that you execute it checks
various rpms and install just
so this is it you installed you asked
next we want to confirm that the
installation is correct and we return to
enterprise manager to execute from that
interface host command on the host
homepage select hosts administration
system services default system run level
and you see now that you have accessed
directly to those services because
default run credentials are not set we
specify new credentials and until the
host username and password and we can
test the connection the test is
successful so we click OK to continue
with our task finding out what are the
default system run levels and as you see
our current run level is 34 mighty user
node with Network your default system
run levels might be different and
because we use this just as a test to
execute a host command directly from
enterprise manager we will cancel out of
this screen
