will be testing Microsoft sequel 13.1
plugin the objectives for today are to
build a test case scenario is iam
version thirteen point two so first I'll
push the 12.1.0 point five version of
the agent to a server running Microsoft
sequel 2012 well then push the 13.2
agent to a box or any Microsoft sequel
server 2014 on the OMS and both of the
agents I will deploy plug-in version
12.1.0 point six I'll then discover the
sequel server targets
I will then upgrade the plug-in on the
OMS to thirteen point one well upgrade
to plug in on the thirteen point two
eight box - version thirteen point one
and I finally I will upgrade the sequel
server target to 2016 so you can see
here I am downloading the 12.1.0 0.5
agent software to be pushed to the
Microsoft sequel 2012 box after that is
downloading downloaded I apply it to the
management server
you
following the very short download from
zeph succeeded I jump over to the
command line on the OMS itself and
execute command e MC L I submit at host
I specify the host name specify the
platform number the installation based
directory the credential name and the
agent version once that command succeeds
I am able to track the job using am CLI
get ad host status and then the session
name which you can see here a couple
things have succeeded but the
installation is in progress
once they see everything succeed via the
command line and jump back over to be
webui
and begin to prepare to push up the 13.2
agent to the sequel 14 server itself you
can see there it's best by the platform
and then on the next page I specify the
installation based directory which is
just C slash agent and then the instance
directory is Auto populated after that I
use a named credential Oracle which is
just the administrator and the password
for the administrator on the windows box
itself
following that I hit next and then
deployed
you can see that that succeeded all
green checkmarks all good things
so now I will go back and deploy the
12.1.0 point six Microsoft sequel server
plug-in on the OMS and both of the
sequel targets
you
here I specify the repository username
and password
you
since I do the same thing
on each of the servers I have decided to
speed this video up about double time
you can still see what I'm doing but
it's a little bit quicker than real time
after the plugin is deployed
successfully on the management server I
go ahead and deploy on the management
agents on both of those servers the 2012
in the 2014 sequel servers that all goes
successfully
you
so now I begin the process of Otto
discovering those sequel targets both
the 2012 and the 2014 I sped up the
configuration just a little bit again
you can see what I'm doing but you don't
have to sit through it in real time as I
make typos and have to delete things and
here it's just the SA role the database
password the cyst ADM as the database
role and the JDBC URL of the 2012 server
you
after both those targets are discovered
you can see that they're listed as equal
12 and sequel 14 on the sequel 12 it
looks like everything's reporting back
not a lot of data is coming back because
it's not an active database you can see
the same is true on the sequel 14
instance as well here go ahead and log
in using the M CLI I sync up and then I
begin importing the 13.1 plugin using
import update i specify OMS local
because I'm on the OMS and then I
specify the plot of the file I need to
import which is Addabbo Park once that
has succeeded use check update on the
web UI which gives me access to the 13.1
plugin and then lets me deploy from the
web UI itself
again here I set it up to about double
time so you can still see what I'm doing
you can still see that I'm deploying
13.1 agent on the management server and
on both management agents but you don't
have to sit through it in real-time now
I begin the process of upgrading the
sequel 2014 server to sequel Server 2016
since that installation process is kind
of lengthy I figured it might be out of
the scope of the video so I decided to
leave out the installation component but
you can see that the 13.1 agent is
deployed on the sequel 14 target which
is now then upgraded to 2016 and you can
see in the database version that to be
true thank you very much for watching my
name is pete mckenna and this was
testing the microsoft sequel 13.1 plugin
thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
