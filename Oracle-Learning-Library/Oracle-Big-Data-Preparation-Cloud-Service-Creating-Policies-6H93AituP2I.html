it to run against my data files using
policies policies are schedules that
allow me to run transformations on an
entire data set in my cluster and
publish the repair and enrich data to
specify target locations
in Oracle Big Data preparation cloud
service and navigate to the policies
page where all the existing policies are
listed and create a new policy in the
create policy page as specified details
to create the policy and details to
schedule the policy I enter a unique
name for the policy and optionally
specify a description for the policy I
specify if I want to receive email
notifications only when the schedule
policy starts and ends or an elaborate
email mentioning details of when each
engine started and ended or I can opt to
not receive any email notifications by

the transform that I want to run against
my data set in this policy the directory
where my source files are located and
the target location for the published
results the source and target
directories could be either Oracle cloud
storage Oracle business intelligence
cloud service or the default HDFS that
is provided for this service I specify
how I want the files named for the
publish results each time the policy is
run in the schedule section I choose how
often I want to run the policy when the
policy needs to run and the start and
end dates if the policy will run over a
period of time after I save the policy
it is listed in the policies page using
the context menu I can edit policy
details or deleted when the policy is
run I get a notification and a new job
ID is created
from the jobs page I monitor the status
of the policy once the job is completed

page and download the publish results to
my local file system in the home page
