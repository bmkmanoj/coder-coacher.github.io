hi this is Matt with the Oracle
Primavera curriculum team today we're
going to look at the Primavera cloud
administration application released 15.2
this application provides a simple way
to manage users for Primavera cloud
we'll start with an overview of the
Primavera cloud administration
application which will refer to as
simply the admin application Primavera
cloud users are stored in an application
called Oracle Identity Manager or oh I
am the admin application works by
writing information to oim and offers a
simple option for managing users versus
doing so directly in o I am inside the
admin application users are stored in a
table there are tabs at the top for
filtered views you can also search to
find users notice that some buttons are
only available when the checkbox is
selected for a user upon logging in the
checkbox for the first user will be
selected so that these buttons are
present to add a new user start typing
in the blank row at the top of the table
enter basic information for the user
such as name organization and user type
then add provisioning for the user
in this step you assign roles and
application instances to the user in
order to grant the desired access in
Primavera cloud click OK when done and
then save changes a notification
indicates the changes have been
processed any errors would be reported
here and the log would provide
additional details for further
investigation after creating a new user
select the checkbox for the user then
click the reset password button this
will send the user an email with a
temporary password note that there is no
prompt to confirm this action or save
changes and the password reset is
executed immediately
users can also be imported in bulk from
a spreadsheet to do so first create a
template for entering user data click
download template from the import
drop-down list add the roles and
instances to be included in the template
using the shift key to select multiple
options when finished click OK then
click OK again to open the spreadsheet
just as in the application enter
information in the table to add new
users to provision roles and instances
enter a Y in the appropriate columns
when finished save the spreadsheet to
import the users into the application
click the import button and select the
spreadsheet
use the manage provisions button to add
or remove user provisions for a single
user use the left and right arrows to
add or remove provisions for multiple
users the options are different the list
of available roles and instances is
presented select a role or instance then
select the checkbox for a user to add
access or clear the checkbox to remove
it click OK when done and then Save
Changes users become locked after too
many bad password attempts they can use
challenge questions to reset their
passwords and become unlocked but if
there is an issue with that process
users can be unlocked in the admin
application select the checkbox for a
lock to user or multiple locked users
and the unlock button becomes present
when clicking the unlock button the
action is executed immediately after
unlocking a user it may be necessary to
use the reset password button to send
the user a temporary password when users
leave an organization or otherwise no
longer require access to Primavera cloud
their accounts should be disabled the
disable button is available when the
check box is selected for a user or
multiple users when clicking the disable
button the action is executed
immediately
disabled users can be enabled again to
do so
select the checkbox for a disabled user
or users then click the enable button
this action is executed immediately
there are some actions that cannot be
executed in the admin application a
user's general information such as name
and email address must be edited
directly in Oracle Identity Manager
users will also be directed to oim to
reset their passwords and setup their
challenge questions other actions
require that a service request to be
submitted to support these include
changing the default password Paul

generated email notifications and
changing authorization codes thank you
