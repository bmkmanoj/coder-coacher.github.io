and I'm here with Todd from Bar Flair
hi Todd hi how are you good can you tell
us about wire Flair and what is fire
Flair into yeah so at wire Flair we are
the developers of a project management
solution for the AEC industry called
linked linked is based on a mean stack
technology and deployed across Oracle's
cloud infrastructure as indicated on
this board that's great so this is the
architecture for linked that is correct
so can you walk us through this
architecture of course so primarily the
traffic comes in and hits a load
balancer from that load balancer the
traffic is distributed across our
application servers we have a single
core standard i/o servlet handles
redirect traffic to HTTPS while we have
three other servers that are four core
dense IO that are serving up the
application itself the application is
using node Express and angular we're
running four instances of node using all
four cores on each machine from there
our clients can communicate with the
object store in order to send and
receive files they also have our
archiving server over here which is a 16
core standard IO server this allows the
clients to be able to see archived
emails within our application as data
and email storage grows we attach
additional block storages to that
standard IO 16 core server that allows
for extensibility of the storage on that
server lastly our application
communicates with two databases as
indicated by these pink lines we use
Alaska search in order to allow our
clients to search within the application
below that we have our Mongo structure
our application connects to the mongos
and configuration servers as indicated
by these bottom three pink boxes these
servers
have metadata which tells the app where
the data they're looking for in the
database is stored in production we have
to have three of these once the data is
requested it enters into these servers
and then as I mentioned gets distributed
to these blue bounding boxes
these are replicative sets indicated by
a B and C each replicative set has a
shard in it the shard is made up of
three servers one of which is a
tiebreaking server in the case that it
might be needed so this is pretty much
an overview of our architecture on
Oracle cloud infrastructure that's great
so how about the high performance
compute requirements of the application
where is it addressed in this
architecture so it's indicated by the D
i/o the DI o stands for dense i/o and
throughout the majority of our
architecture we are using dense i/o
servers and that is because of the high
ops requirement with our application and
also the database the higher the higher
IAP salão zust to to read and write
data quicker than in a standard i/o
server thank you for sharing the
architecture with us today god thank you
for having me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
