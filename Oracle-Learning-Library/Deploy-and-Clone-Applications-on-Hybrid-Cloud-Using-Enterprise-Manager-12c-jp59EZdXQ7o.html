in this video we will show you how you
can manage your entire hybrid cloud
state including development taste and
production environment from a single
console we will see how to deploy on
provides application on Oracle cloud
development environment how to configure
data sources required for application
based on database cloud service on
Oracle cloud and finally we will also
see how to clone your own cloud Decius
instance from development environment to
optimize production environment when
your development cycle is completed
before you begin make sure that you have
jesse's instance created on oracle cloud
and a date to enterprise manager
you can check that here so let's get
started we will first see how to deploy
compromised application on Java cloud
service on Oracle cloud i have uploaded
application from my production
environment to software library good
enterprise provisioning and patching
software library browse for folder
middleware other service appt
and expand it you will see visitors dot
war uploaded here we will deploy this
application on JCS instance on cloud
again go back to middleware targets home
page from targets malaria right click on
domain which is created on cloud from
the pop-up menu go to provisioning and
then deploy and deploy Java EE
application on deployment procedure
manager select the procedure to deploy
application and launch it on select
targets page say it with project domain
where you want to deploy application and
click select
you need to also select the servers
where the app should be deployed i am
selecting here- server where the app is
going to get deployed click Next to
select application click on Add button
and select application from Papa also
mention application name
and click ok
click Next
on credentials page enter credentials
for Oracle cloud host where Jesse's
instance is located also enter
credentials for WebLogic domain where
application will be deployed click Next
on a final page review all the details
and then click deploy to deploy an
application when you click deploy button
Enterprise Manager submits a deployment
procedure to reply application on the
target WebLogic domain submitter
procedure looks like this procedure it
will take about five minutes to complete
the procedure once DP is completed you
can see the deployment application from
domain home page
now this completes application
deployment but what if this application
requires a data source now let's see how
we can create a new data source on JCS
instance on Oracle cloud from domains
homepage go to weblogic jerry bc data
sources
I am log into WebLogic domain here you
can see all existing data sources click
on create new data source button and
select generate data source change data
source name as required by application I
will keep it as it is select appropriate
driver since we are going to create data
source based on dbcs service selected a
source for service connection and week
okay click Next on next page filling
other details for data source like habis
host name
you know his name is username and
password all these details are entered
Enterprise Manager wizard automatically
creates database URL and populates other
fields the click on next on next page
you can either submit a request to
create new database or click on Next
button to configure more advanced
options I am going to click on cancel
button since we already have a database
with us was created as soon as the data
source is created and deployment
procedure is complete data source
appears in this list let us explore one
of the existing data source
as you see here this particular data
source is created on novice clout
instance which is again on Oracle cloud
so we have deployed application and
created new data source now the other
point team can go ahead which changes in
the application once the other pen team
completes changes to the app they need
to recreate domain deploy application
and create data source on on-premise pre
production environment where we want to
taste the pre production setup we will
now see how Enterprise Manager 12 105
simplifies this process and allows user
to clone entire domain with complete
staff including deployed applications
and data sources to all premised
environment with just few steps to clone
domain you need to first clone required
schemas once we have a database with
required schemas you can create a
profile from on cloud domain to create a
profile go to enterprise provisioning
and patching and middleware provisioning
from create drop-down select from
WebLogic domain option enter name and
select WebLogic domain from which we
want to create a profile once WebLogic
domain is selected all the details about
the domain are populated enter Oracle
home credentials
and then click on free to start creating
a new profile since all they have a
profile created let us explore that once
profile is completed it will look like
exactly of this profile profile contains
information about domain configurations
in name and domain source it also
contains information about servers the
domain administration server and managed
server I am also information about data
sources including the data source that
we just created now using this profile
you can provision new domain on pre
production server you want using
revision option thank you for listening
