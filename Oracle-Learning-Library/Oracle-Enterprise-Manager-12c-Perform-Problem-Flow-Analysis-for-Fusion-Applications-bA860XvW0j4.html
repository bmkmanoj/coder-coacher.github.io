welcome in this demonstration you will
see how to use and a price manager Cloud
Control to perform problem flow analysis
for fusion applications application
management at Ford Fusion Applications
provides comprehensive monitoring and
management features for Oracle Fusion
Applications it provides these features
in three major categories discovery and
monitoring performance diagnostics and
lexical automation in today screen watch
we are going to focus on problem flow
analysis feature of performance
Diagnostics problem flow analysis is a
new feature in enterprise manager 12
cloud control release this provides a
simple workflow to identify the root
cause for an incident typically an
administrator goes through a simple
workflow to identify the root cause for
any issues generated in the fusion
applications the first time is when
incident comes you look at the email or
message right into me what's going on
sometimes the incident is simple they
know what exactly the root cause let's
say a database is down or server is down
they immediately know what's that second
thing they would like to see is they
want to analyze the corresponding matrix
for this incident to see what's going on
and then they would like to see the
health of the related matrix identify
what's going on for example if them
number of order process the basis matrix
is violated some threshold they would
like to see what are the key metrics
like how the database performing how is
a large federal performing and how the
JVM performing so they want to see all
of the related metrics and then they
also would like to see what are the
health of the related targets let's say
what's the patch is what's the number of
patches apply it in the past 24 hours
what are the typical configuration
changed in the past 24 hours actually
right they were to analyze the related
targets finally they would like to
search the log file to see whether any
patterns got logged for the particular
issue so this is the typical workflow
followed by the administrator to
identify the root cause so this problem
for analysis feature captures this
workflow and provides an user interface
for the administrator to do
this from a single page what you see
here is a homepage of HCM compensation
application in enterprise manager Cloud
Control ecology release this page
provides high level overview aboard the
application the problem flow analysis
entry points can be from two different
places one it could be from an incident
or it could be from any arbitrary chart
actually so increase clean wash i'm
going to start from the request passing
time chart so as you see here records
passing time spite during 5 a.m. in the
morning as an administrator you want to
understand what went on why this by
happen so you click on the request
passing time legend it shows a pop-up
which has a link lu lu a problem
analysis II what do you see here is the
problem flow analysis page specifically
for records passing time so this request
passing time show the data for past 24
hours by default but as an administrator
can click on all or two hours or 15 min
to narrow down our expand the scope this
page also shows the health of all the
related networks for echoes passing time
of this application depends on the cpu
usage of the server the request passing
time of the server remember a records
came in for the server TP sage and the
memory and cpu realization of the host
so you see here request passing time of
the application spike dab and
correspondingly the number of requests
came in also went up so in this case
it's pretty straight forward saying
records passing time is high because of
number are the increased number of
requests so looks like a capacity issue
so if additional servers are available
obviously the request passing time can
be brought down so let's say if the
derivative the related metric is not
giving an idea of what's going on so as
an administrator can go to the bottom of
the page to take a look at the health of
all the related targets actually like JD
application so a composite database
never thing so this table also captures
the
what are the configuration changes
happen in the past 24 hours typically
performance problems can be tied to the
configuring change occur in the past 24
hours actually so by looking at it you
can immediately derive their issues
because of configuration changes
actually let's say if the config change
also doesn't provide any information as
an administrator can go to the top of
the page and click on view related log
messages to look at any increase a log
in the log file for this particular
issue so click on view later log
messages to see any entries there so in
this case there's no entry because and
so obviously it doesn't show up but if
there are any entries for the particular
issue this this screen shows the the
relevant entries so by going through the
simple one-page phloem the administrator
can identify the root cause you can look
at the sauce metric health or later
metric health-related targets health and
also you can look at the large messages
to see what exactly went on to an
identify the root cause of any issue
