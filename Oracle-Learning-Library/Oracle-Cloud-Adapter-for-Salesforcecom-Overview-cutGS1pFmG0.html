Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com.
This video provides an overview of the Adapter
and then demonstrates how you could use Oracle
SOA Suite and the Salesforce adapter to synchronize
Account information between Salesforce.com
and E-Business Suite on-premise.
The Oracle Cloud Adapter for SalesForce.com
Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com within
Oracle Fusion Middleware provides breakthrough
developer productivity, comprehensive connectivity,
reliability and performance while integrating
with Salesforce.com.
The Adapter provides value across three key
dimensions:
Reduced Cost
Integration with Salesforce.com is not just
simple and straightforward Web Service or
REST connectivity.
There are several design-time and runtime
considerations that require additional implementation
of authentication, session management, transformation
mappings and more.
The Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com
significantly lowers the cost of building
and maintaining this complex business logic
through out-of-the-box features that users
can graphically configure through point-and-click
wizard designer integrated within Oracle JDeveloper.
The Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com
provides robust error handling capabilities
to handle errors when they occur.
The adapter also comes packaged with diagnostic
capabilities that aid in reporting and alerting
in case of errors.
Improved Developer Productivity
The Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com
provides a graphical wizard for configuring
connectivity and integration with Salesforce.com.
The Adapter streamlines and simplifies the
development experience by providing a graphical
business object catalog that enables users
to natively browse, search and select one
or more business objects of interest without
needing to understand technical details.
Faster Time-to-Market
Not burdening the integration developer with
Salesforce.com Application Programming Interface
(API) complexities and avoiding the need for
manual construction of all the code for integration
significantly reduces the time-to-market for
integrating Salesforce.com with other cloud
and on-premises applications.
The integrations will also be less error-prone,
shortening test cycles as well.
Comprehensive Salesforce.com Connectivity
SFDC exposes various methods for integration:
SOAP API, REST API, Chatter and Bulk APIs
to name the most important.
The Oracle SFDC adapter supports integration
via the SOAP API through the Enterprise WSDL
and gives access to the following operations
on SFDC business objects:
CRUD (create/update/retrieve/delete)
Query (SOSL/SOQL)
Core API Calls (e.g. convertLead, merge)
Utility API Calls (e.g. getUserInfo)
The adapter also simplifies specifying header
information for operations.
Only headers that are applicable to operation
of choice are exposed to the user at design-time.
Simplified security and session management
The Oracle Cloud Adapter for Salesforce.com
requires the user to specify the credentials
to connect to Salesforce.com at design-time
and runtime.
These credentials are securely stored and
managed using the Oracle WebLogic Credential
Store Framework.
The adapter has intelligent session management
capabilities enabling reuse of authenticated
sessions across multiple requests to Salesforce.com,
thereby limiting the number of requests to
stay within the quota caps imposed by 
the application.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
