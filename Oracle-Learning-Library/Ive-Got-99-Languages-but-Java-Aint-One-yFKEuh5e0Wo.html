a couple beers we've had dinner and you
guys are like here at six-thirty when
you could actually be eating so yeah so
that's cool thanks for coming on that
this will be fun alright so I'm Tom in a
bow I'm Charles nutter we're live your
face yes the jruby guys you can see his
eye appt yes a different hat another hat
alright alright so people who work on
languages and run times are cool I'm not
like saying anything but we work on a
language and hopefully we don't say
anything negative about people who work
in languages because we know it's a lot
of hard work and we do actually
appreciate that people have this
adventurous spirit and making languages
right there's there's some goofy topics
and goofy languages that will have in
this talk and we know we know mean no
disrespect to the people who have poured
their lives in their hearts into making
these bizarre and useless languages well
in most of the mostly useless and
bizarre languages are intended to be so
right right so hopefully they understand
that they made a bizarre language okay
so the great thing about Java is when
they built it they decided to go and
build to java bytecode so they had this
first language that everyone used but
then they also sort of had this hidden
language I mean it was in the spec and
so forth and by Java one point oh we
started to see a proliferation of
various languages is it kind of
frustrating to me because there was this
there's been this debate about the dart
p.m. from google they decided to go with
a source based vm basically it takes the
source and goes directly down to
compiling if there's no bytecode BM and
i think we've had so much benefit out of
having a bike coated vm for the JVM for
years all the different language
implementations all the different ways
to do things it just seems like hubris
to believe that dart is the only thing
anyone's ever going to want to write for
that vm so i think the the JVM has had a
right for a long time that's right so
the first section we have our
alternative implementations there's a
small theme here on movies had we had
more time obi-wan would have been had
James
Gosling's had pasted over that but it
didn't happen so we have one question
how many people know what Rex is any
recs programmers can you want this about
five all other languages are fairly
recognizable but this one has slightly
special mention because it was a
scripting language developed for os/2
and at some point they decided on this
is a pretty good language we better port
this to other os's then they made
networks the problem with that was that
it wasn't actually compatible with racks
so little interesting weirdness without
doing any 80 programmers here anybody
dying 88 at work Wow sweet that doesn't
come up like there's probably one or two
COBOL folks may be back in the day no we
do I still admit it oh yeah pick a few
seconds to ya courage to come out
awesome alright yeah so there there's a
few of the clones that have come along
so now 16 years later these these two
are gone however people like making
clones of languages and so there's still
eight is still alive and now there's
four different versions of Kobol
including a micro focus JVM visual COBOL
I think we can pretty much gauge that to
be two thousand one or two thousand two
base in the word visual was before he
became popular yeah I should actually
ecole all most likely and it's also
proof that the marketing branch of this
company probably came up with this name
kala didn't go away and it still
maintained by the same guy today but I
think this proves the point that
everyone who decides to write their
first language we'll start with scheme
there's a lot of them in here I mean
it's kind of amazing that there's this
many scheme implementations scheme is
not that complicated a language why you
could just use tawa or sisk and they'd
be just fine but they're not only need
six and we need ps3 I and hot scheme and
all these other ones do jaja SI himanshu
yeah nice
awesome okay I didn't expect this how
many people program in Pascal today
today how many people have ever
programmed in pasco yeah lots of folks
yeah so there's there's interest
obviously it's nothing a Pascal on the
JVM it's not too surprising that they
made it and if it compiles down to pee
code then a peacoat interpreter is very
simple to make as well yeah for sure I'm
like Java skull is a good name oh the
best midlet Pascal the best name right
here is Pascal interpreter in Java yes
someone really really reached for that
one they went really creative on that
that name if you go either as you pass
call me Pascal there you go 2,000 4,000
for ya speaking of using letters there's
an awful lot of languages that just
prepend Jeon or playful Jay in there
somewhere yeah of course including jo
bhi we weren't responsible for that we
started the project a couple years after
it got started yeah we probably we
probably would have chose not to have a
J in the name given the implications of
the J merging is actually interesting
one in here we don't we don't talk about
it much later but Erlang on top of the
JVM and actually performs and does a
whole bunch of things a lot better than
the Erlang vm right now so the lot of
these implementations are not even jokes
or JRuby is an excellent ruby
implementation probably the fastest jai
thon was the fastest for a long time it
still is for many things jaspal i think
they have some challenges monads stuff
is def difficult to do on the JVM butter
jang the j tickle stuff a lot of these
languages actually do a pretty good job
of reimplemented whatever that languages
and and doing a better job of it on the
JVM I've never thought of this but if we
could actually change the name of jruby
what the hell would it be that's a good
question fast for me yeah you be yeah I
tried you in a couple of my friends said
that you probably shouldn't use that one
so but yeah I don't know we should go
with like a fast Ruby or awesome Ruby or
something that's what the Ruby guys kind
of like hot Ruby right I really is
already used yeah hot rupees already out
there
all right there's a huge huge space of
languages wikipedia has a nice list of
languages and then there's another site
and unfortunately we don't have these
links at the end of the talk but when we
up when we upload the slides the links
will be on the last slide but it's it's
a great site because it lists all the
languages that are written on top of
JavaScript VMs and java VMs and there's
like 800 of them yeah there's there's
literally pretty much every languages
out that is some implementation known as
C is on here as well there are see
translators for the JVM and and see our
native translators that turn native
binaries into binaries they can run on
the JVM we'll we'll talk about a couple
of those later but yeah there's a crazy
amount of languages that all target the
JVM and all because it is a
general-purpose vm for a lot of work for
a lot of a lot of these large sort of
languages and you know the JVM only has
800 implementations on it so we need
more clones and in the truth is it's a
lot of fun to work on a run time because
let's face it how many software projects
do you get to work on where you actually
know the requirements before you start
yeah one hundred percent of the
requirements just pick the language
specification out you're ready to go
right and I guarantee you'll learn tons
of things you never would have realized
had you not worked on a language
implementation right tom toms fond of
saying that the regional reason he got
into JRuby was because he thought it'd
be a great way to learn Ruby what turns
out there's not not so much just learn
all the nasty parts of Ruby can relearn
how the JVM works and doesn't work but
in every corner case of the language
which are really the things you don't
want to know so there's a challenge and
there's enough people here or I think
this challenge might actually happen
there is no implementation of the PIAT
language now the PIAT language is
awesome there's two programs listed
there the one on the left prints p it to
the council and the one on the right
prints hello world and just basically
what happens is you start up in the
upper right hand corner it looks at the
color and the brightness and then
decides what to do from there and it's a
stack-based interpreter and just push
his values and just kind of roams around
until it stops like a little state
machine based on piet mondrian paintings
it's the rat it's awesome I I'm actually
curious if any of his real paintings
could be interpreted as doing something
I wonder if anybody's try that p it's
practically a real one it is it looks
like it could be hanging in the Louvre
or something for sure so this is
probably only it's probably a thousand
lines of code you could get it be an
easy one if you want to if you want to
add another clone or add another
language to this list we need a JP it
desperately desperately would be awesome
one thing I did notice is a lot of the
lot of the clones aren't so true to the
original i downloaded jay pearl and then
put print hello world thinking it would
print out first it didn't have
parenthesis and it crashed and like oh
okay so i added parenthesis and edge
chillin work then i had to go to the
website and found out that you have to
actually use xml brackets and put jay
pearl around it to actually have it
evaluate because there's men for
templating it's an interesting decision
interesting decision and not just be
able to execute a perl script directly
but you would think for debugging for
debugging you seem like a very like you
don't have to have tags in it to get the
program to run it doesn't have dash e
yeah so yeah whatever all right so no
now what kind of go into some languages
that are a little bit more practically
oriented their their language that have
been talked about as possible job or
replacements in a lot of cases and you
know like chow yun-fat we're looking for
a better tomorrow for the JVM really a
better job and so there's lots of
languages so every year there's a new
language that someone says is going to
be the replacement for Java and it
really all kind of just boils down to
marketing at some point every one of
these languages has certain things they
do better than Java certain things they
do worse than Java and a lot of them fit
into particular domains even within more
general purpose languages like a like a
scholar or Cylon and we have to point
out we're not saying these projects are
saying we're better than Java and we
want to replace Java although maybe some
of them have but
this is mostly bloggers and evangelists
right so I mean any of these languages
wants to get users they look at the pool
of nine million whatever the number is
this year java developers out there and
that's that's where you go after right
we're better than job I use us instead
and really the point of all this is that
we have the choice we have options of
all sorts on the JVM we can use
different languages for different tasks
and let them fit where they're supposed
to be and you know some of these guys
they don't seem to do the best job of
marketing because extend if they would
have gone in search for this there's
actually another product named extend
that is really not a good good image to
be sending an or maybe it's the great
image to be sending I don't know you
know it really doesn't make a whole lot
of sense that choose that name but
whatever we let them go with whatever
name they want to have so now our
opinion kind of comes into this and
we're interested in what you guys have
to say if you want to tell us afterwards
or whatever but our opinion of what a
language would be that could replace
Java or it could be a brother of Java
take a lot of those developers away if
this is a real course this was a real
question if it actually meant something
for something to replace Java you know
it probably has to have at least some
support of static typing either
partially statically typed or partially
dynamically typed butts that exciting
has to be an option so that you can get
down to raw performance if you need to
primary requirement very simple one
probably not too far away Singh
tactically if we're talking about
drawing daba java developers away from
that java language so we're pretty much
stuck with like see styles tin tacks for
the rest of our our existence on this
planet unfortunately it cannot ever be
perceived as slower than Java this kind
of plays in with static static typing we
need to be able to write code in
whatever that new languages that is
guaranteed to have no performance impact
compared to writing we can just say the
equivalent coding job otherwise why
would you use job for it but but but the
perception is an important point to
because how many years have you had to
walk around and talk to C++ programmers
in a going huh Java's slow right right
so it is very much the perception issue
but you know it has to be at least be a
language that can be perceived as
equivalent performance to java
and no runtime libraries one that I
think everybody seems to be missing the
boat on well not everybody I don't know
hmm let's go back to that previous slide
O'Meara yeah maybe another language
thought about that but a no runtime
library is a key requirement that I
think you need to be able to get down to
the point where you compile source in
get class files out maybe it's small jar
file out and that's it languages like
groovy JRuby closure Scala that have 125
10 megabyte jar files that you have to
ship along with it you're limiting where
you can deploy this you're limiting what
you can do with it I think anything it's
going to replace Java needs to be able
to just run like Java does with raw
class files and not have a big
dependency so jruby works quite well on
on Android for for writing apps but
because they didn't want to download a
10 meg jar for every app they actually
have it as an appt dependencies so I
have to download two apps so that's the
kind of tricks that we have to pull to
get around the fact we've got this
runtime library and you know if you're
doing big enterprise lat applications
that are 50 to 100 men wore files or ear
files anyway maybe it's not as big a
deal but you know being able to just get
source files in class files out is a
major benefit I think its requirement
for someone to actually take over Java
all right so so the general idea here is
that you know it doesn't have to be
about one new language that's going to
take over I think over the past couple
years we've realized that there is not
going to be a single language it's going
to display displace all other languages
in the JVM as being the primary one
including Java polyglot is the future of
the platform everybody that does
anything on the JVM now works with the
different languages at different times
if you don't you should come to our talk
tomorrow where we talk about why we want
to you polyglot how you wire all that
stuff together and I think that's that's
the future of the platform is that we
are going to have multiple languages
we're going to use Java for what its
best at will use groovy and Scala
closure and JRuby and everything else
for what they're best at and have these
mixed systems that actually use the
right tools for the right job does
anyone think that Java is the best
language for anything you could ever
write for everything would say is Java
the best language for everything of
course nobody agrees with that I mean
Java is really a tear
occasionally I was giving some people a
chance I know I'm not going to give me a
chance all right so we'll talk a little
bit more about the main specific
languages at this point has anyone seen
this movie we couldn't we couldn't think
of any movie that the word domain in it
so we just randomly picked one there's a
4 out of 10 on IMDb it could be some
sick slasher movie we don't know must be
great all right I have any processing
stuff playing around with that basically
domain-specific language for doing some
pretty cool graphical demonstrations
graphical visualizations representations
it's written in Java it has a nice
little IDE sort of thing it's very easy
to write little scripts that will draw
fractals that will draw all sorts of
crazy visualizations we've had some
people script it from JRuby I think
there's been some folks who've done
groovy and closure stuff on top of
processing but another fun little
language the language itself is not
particularly inspiring but the fact that
it's designed around the domain of
generating really cool graphics and
fitting into a nice little graphical
environment makes it kind of an
interesting one to play with in the
Heidi is pretty pretty pretty nice I
mean having a language that is built has
a built-in live graphical ide for doing
graphical visualization stuff is a great
way to start really easy to pay a play
with and there's at least one or two
books on processing itself and doing
visualization and graphics with it the
next one is drools it might have been
renamed to jboss rules which is a pretty
funny name more of a statement than a
name isn't a new oh not that we work in
red hat or anything but we do work it
right now well this one kind of brings
me back to my college days it's
essentially a logic programming language
you can decide you can set up a ruleset
throw throw something in there it
bounces around and you get a result set
back it's based on being declarative
let's take a look at the awesome drools
code yes
now I don't know I swear there must be
another way of writing this without
having to persist it to XML because it
just it feels really old to me I mean
it's fine it's just a persistence format
but I does it anyone know any any drills
people here is there a drill syntax
other the next amount we couldn't find
on sir is there okay yeah they are they
were working on some doing it seems like
there has to be I know it I know why
would you use that when you can use XML
honestly yeah oh very nice very nice
yeah I think they actually do have like
some scripting plugins for a couple
different syntaxes but this is like the
standard the baseline for drools right
and and even in the sectional format you
can see that there's java colon that
could be groovy colon or another
language Israel so you can embed
different languages into XML maybe you
can mix them that would be pretty cool
yeah but so this is a definition of a
rule this rule needs to bind to these
parameters if it can bind to those
parameters at one then it comes down to
a set of conditions if these conditions
all fire then this rule matched and then
it just execute the consequence down at
the bottom here this context object gets
its state set to find seating and then
drools gets notified that the object
changed and no that's going to be used
for for future rules matches all right
so like a roller our logic language you
basically can have a whole set of these
a whole network and feed data into it
and it comes out different sides and
then of course the the endpoints can
feed off into services or a service boss
of some kind and and then all you have
to do is maintain this XML it's simple
right yeah so hey yeah we should we
stone it down on the XML we said we
wouldn't badmouth yeah hey so it's hard
with eczema if you're interested in the
concept of having rules just pick up a
book in Prolog right right we actually
were going to have it we were
considering having another xml-based
language anybody done any serious jelly
programming there's a couple a couple
giggles for Google to know that a jelly
was a language was written for
what was the purpose of jelly maven
that's right all right it was written as
a scripting language for maven and since
maven is all XML naturally jelly had to
be all XML too so that's a fun when we
decided not to go throw to xml languages
at you at the same time with moonwalk
net free because anybody ever played
with sprink a lot of fun anybody has an
android phone you can install a freak
application any time you want in the
market so I I like this quote I think
this is true too I thought it was true
this is this is what it's eventually
going to have that you can do that you
can do the voice you've got to do the
things I'm not going to do the Glaven
okay we'll move on okay so freaked the
language the language itself is not
again particularly compelling as a
interesting expressive language but
Frank is basically a language built
around a database of all sorts of
different measurements volume wait
historical weights over time currencies
pretty much any sort of metric that you
can imagine for measuring you have
various conversions between them and the
Freak language can be used to do very
complicated conversions between all of
these and calculations based on all
these units so if you wanted to find out
you know what the weight of a pound was
in 1745 versus 1836 that's the sort of
information that is in the Frank
database and you can do conversions and
figure out when somebody talks about in
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein that the
weight of a head is seven pounds is that
7.5 pounds or is that six point five
pounds and actually get those sort of
calculations out of this in a tremendous
amount of different data that's in this
like I say if you have an Android phone
or if you want to download it it's a
really fun one to play with and the
language is very simple to use you can
do pretty much basic conversions or
write all sorts of interesting scripts
that will do more complicated
conversions between different units it's
pretty awesome to see English and metric
measurements mixed together yes yeah
i'll just activate it seems like half
the time i actually do something at a
home i'll have a mixture of instructions
with
in metric I have strange instructions I
guess so this section is on languages
that aren't directly implementations of
other languages there perhaps inspired
by them and they're not particularly
domain languages and I think these
people get an extra tip of their hat
because they're doing what everyone who
goes to computer science gets a computer
science education does is it's the dream
to write your own language and they're
in a way they are bearing their own
Souls because as soon as someone
publishes the language there's gonna be
a whole bunch of blogs going wow that
sucks they should be used go that's
shitty don't do that yeah that is very
personal decisions that go into
designing a language and deciding how
the syntax works and how the language
feels even what if you get to the
certain level what the type system is
you know Scala is Martin odor ski I mean
if you read Scala understand Scala you
will you will see into the mind of mark
and you know ripping on a language like
that and something that something that
something's put a lot of time into is
really tearing down them at like a core
level so if we have a lot of respect for
the language authors that come up with
totally new and totally interesting ways
of expressing and programming in fact
the same can be said for any library as
well so the first language is open
action the the underline part is the
interesting part of the sangwich for me
curly brackets are cryptic so let's see
let's see what this language looks like
now there there are a few symbols in
here there's less than equal these are
well-known mathematical symbols any
small child will know what these are but
now look at that bottom line and read it
if it is not empty and the result is not
cancelled in crimes it
I can't decide if I hate this or love it
and it kind of has a COBOL feel to it
doesn't it yeah bitterly is sort of a
natural language it's like a weber
illiterate language it's I don't know
it's it's really interesting and amazing
it might be really cool to I just can't
figure it out you know we get
conditioned to see certain syntax and
then when we see other syntax are like
yeah it doesn't look like mice and tags
but isn't at the point of learning a
different language you know it's
actually different and has different
uses you know you want i especially like
is that every end has to say what its
ending too it's very XML like in that
way and if end repeat and crimes just to
make sure because you know we might
might buy make sure that they don't
actually end the prime well that Lee
that works until you have two repeats
which are Peter we actually ending at
this point yeah the good one aoki is
really an amazing language that no one
can actually use for anything practical
unfortunately it's created by a mother
jruby guys ola beanie who worked on jai
root for a long time and then went off
and started creating crazy languages
that nobody could optimize in a million
years now that was that was his point of
pride that no one could have optimized
I'm queen of pride I mean I I'm pretty
proud of what we'd be able to do for
JRuby an optimization but he convinced
me that there was no way to optimize I
yogi after just a few days short
discussions so it's implemented it's a
influenced by io Smalltalk list Ruby
it's a home iconic language its list
comprehensions this whole concept of a
folding language where it's code that
writes code that writes code you can
write macros that will modify the
currently running callers ast and change
the way that it actually functions at
runtime this is a nice quote from Steve
that you know folding languages are kind
of a wizardry a wizardry that you can
write in languages that write code that
write code that write code except that
everyone's going to hate everything that
you write in that language and hate you
for being someone that can write that
nineteen ninety percent of the devs will
whine
ninety percent the devil will claim they
can't read it and whine a lot about it
to their bosses so again very expressive
very powerful languages that no one
really wants to use in whole I can write
anything in four lines of I okey oh yeah
so it's a very practical language but
you have to be a long have to be all of
us that's the problem it's a
domain-specific language then the domain
is all the beanie been incredibly
powerful all right so here's an example
of a method in I okie that has a case
statement similar to what we have in
Scala where we've got 10 no more bottles
of beer 11 bottle of beer and then
continue on from that point oh it's a
very expressive language like I okie no
period for doing method calls it's all
just a space between them the value in
the method that you're actually going to
okay I just realized it's the anti Lisp
have you notice that the methods at the
end yes the list yep yep so it's like an
infix Lisp in a way which there have
been a few attempts at that but it's a
very clean language and we have our
entire bottles of beer in just a few
lines of code and it's even if you don't
know I okie you read through this once
or twice and you can kind of figure out
what's going on all actually has kind of
taken a step back from Aoki at this
point to do a language with similar
principle similar design characteristics
that is actually practical called SEF
with more of a focus on immutability and
concurrency but a lot of the same
expressiveness of I okie perhaps without
some of the crazy unoptimized able
features and to be fair this was a
playground for me yes this was a
playground for him to try out all
possible language expression most
expressive language features that he
could imagine in the same language and
then maybe take a step back and put the
ones together that are actually working
well so phantoms something that I hadn't
looked at until very recently this is
one of the languages that was on the
earlier slide as being a Java
replacement but it does have a lot of
things going for it it really does look
quite a bit like Java and it has some
amount of static typing although it also
is partially dynamically typed or at
least you have that option and it's sort
of a kitchen sink but not a
using kitchen sink I think a fairly
straightforward all right so it's a fair
it's a more conservative kitchen sink
than than some other JVM languages that
seem to include a lot of features it
does a pretty nice job of picking out
the ones that are actually directly
useful and not too confusing and it's
it's it's actually targeted more in the
legit JVM so dotnet and JavaScript so
here's a couple more poignant features
it has closures huzzah that's pretty
much every language but Java now it has
mix-ins which are essentially Java
interfaces with default implementations
which Java might sort of have that in
Java eight or nine if you use a arrow
instead of a dot you'll actually do
dynamic dispatch so the compiler won't
do a check there and I'll just throw a
runtime error so it's kind of up to you
accessories are automatically generated
you can go in mark classes as const and
they'll be immutable you can do to to
mutable and will actually make an
immutable version of whatever that data
structure is sort of like a freeze in
Ruby another key feature here that's not
really a language features that phantom
has been designed around having its own
set of classes its own straying its own
list types that it can represent
uniformly on all implementations so
there's a phantom that runs on CL are as
a phantom that runs on the JVM is a
phantom that runs on top of JavaScript
VMs and exactly the same code will work
in all of those different phantom
implementations exactly the same so it
was it was more of a design principle of
being cross platform with a lot of nice
features maybe not integrate with the
platform directly as well but a language
you can use everywhere the JVM was
important enough yes the gym instead of
course a lot barely ok all right so Mira
is a language that I worked on for a
while now some other folks have taken it
over I made that logo I love it I'll do
one more time that took me hours and
hours and hours all right so Mira is we
asked at the time I was working as kind
of my image of what you would replace
java with its it's a nice syntax Ruby
like syntax some people like Ruby syntax
some people don't but it's not too far
off from Java from the most part it's
not Ruby and it won't run rails but I
don't like writing parsers so I just use
Ruby syntax it's beautiful clean simple
like Ruby and it has a lot of the same
design principles that we talked about
earlier amira script a mirror file goes
in you get a Java class file out and
that's it no run time dependency of any
kind it is essentially identical in
performance and pretty much identical at
the bytecode level to what you would get
writing the same Java code but it ends
up being a lot cleaner as a result so
here's our little Java code we've got a
some you know kind of a contrived class
here with some fields and some methods
constructor and whatnot the same piece
of code and mirror looks basically like
this borrowed scala's types declaration
syntax and local type inference we
extend that a little bit farther to even
do field type inference here so at name
and at number actually getting fur to
compile time as being fields of type
string and int and so you don't have to
declare them they just aren't there for
you automatically a few little built-in
things to make it look and feel a little
bit more like Ruby adder access or bills
the getters and setters for you
automatically for those two fields and
then down and then do something here
we've got a runnable that comes in we've
got string interpolation just like we do
in Ruby and then calls can have no
parenthesis all the all the nice little
surface level syntactic features of Ruby
but the result is nearly identical at
the bike code level to the Java code we
just saw and has no runtime dependency
of any kind now I haven't had a lot of
time to work on here and other people
have taken it over but I still think
this is the kind of direction that a
Java replacement needs to go it needs to
look at having a much smaller surface
area and much less of a distance from
how Java works at the bytecode and at
the language level and will reiterate
that there isn't a Java replacement
coming short okay
okay uh we always think of this language
because back in two thousand six we did
this email interview and the guy who
wrote judo script it was like he wrote
poetry or philosophy and he's really
interesting responses in that interview
and I can't find it now I wish I could
but what was the one sentence is like
it's the ultimate interface between man
and machine so he talked about whoring
your heart into a language I mean he's
really poured his heart into designing
judo script and all the stuff that it
can do and so his idea seems to be that
you look at all the things that a
programmer a conventional or I can't
think of the right word a programmer of
today would want to do and then bake all
those things syntactically into the
language and today by today it means you
know 2004 2006 yeah it hasn't it that so
he's got a lot of documentation so I'm
sure it's a very usable language still
and these are the things that he
identified i would say about the only
thing that really is missing from
contemporary there we go i got it all
right his concurrency currency related
is missing concurrency but he's thought
of everything else and it's stayed
mostly relevant now check out this
syntax well the key here is that these
are considered language features these
are not library as you call he baked
support into the language for things
like calm and wisdom and other stuff and
xml directly long before VBS visual
basic or scala even consider putting xml
in as a syntactic feature in the
language he was already doing this and
maybe before link maybe before a link to
and because it that first example their
shows kind of a link like form okay so
try Judas group yeah so the first one I
mean we're building up this is doing a
copy statement changing the how it's
going to filter the files out so we've
got started Java accept a particular set
of files in a particular location
recursively and then it just does it at
that
language level feature for doing file
manipulation at the file system level
yeah the copy one reminds me of
objective-c a little bit moving on so
there's a bunch of goofy languages for
Goofy's sake the first one's always the
one that generates controversy because
some people don't like to hear a word
fuck but I have to say it I'm not going
to say behalf because people think BFF
for something but it's a minimalist
language the source codes actually the
pluses and the spaces and the lesson and
greater than is on the left right right
is like a basic version of it maybe yeah
those are like comments on the side to
kind of show you how those lines are
doing so the left is the code and that's
all there is to this language so it's
meant to screw with your brain which you
know they could have maybe pick that has
anybody ever looked at the language
called white space yeah white space is
my favorite honestly white space
basically does a similar thing to brain
fuck but all of the tokens in the
language are various Unicode and ASCII
whitespace characters so you look at a
piece of code and it's basically just
blank and you have to like turn on all
sorts of highlighting to see what the
code actually is if you do want to play
with this on the JVM search for Oak jar
I don't even think there's a page for it
yeah you'll find it out there there is
an implementation there's probably a
couple implementations for the gym yeah
I never know I wouldn't say it's too
tough to make yeah speaking of not too
difficult to make people have heard of
risk this guy took a one step further
and made misc it only has a single
instruction the instruction does have
four words where the first word is a
relative address the second word is
either a relative address or a number
the third word is a relative address or
a number and the fourth one is just be
it split and broken apart to figure out
what to do with that one instruction so
it really is either 8 or 16 instructions
how much eating but whatever it's it's
it's funny now even more enjoyable as he
decided to one-up brainfuck and actually
implement his own interpreter a brain
fucking misc and there it is so that's
beautiful should be a t-shirt so you
know what light we are going to cover
next some people might all right yay all
cats and this we try to find a logo for
this and oddly and not the only logo on
the Java implementation of law code is
this cat with the words job with your on
Java Sea see in front of it I have no
idea why this is a completely separate
project but if the grammar was probably
written in Java Sea see ya so it's Java
CC + cat equals long combed and that's
how they got the logo apparently so we
were surfing for these images last night
yeah and it was difficult to find the
right one so we kind of have a runner up
here yeah so this one's pretty good too
well cat java thank you be this cab come
on okay all right now my favorite
session because i love low-level
wackiness what about emulators emulators
for different platforms native platforms
for example well they they kind of
Countess languages right I mean yeah if
you're running a particular processors
instruction set you've got a particular
set of runtime structures memory
structures that go along with it it's a
language and its runtime environment you
can you can compile any language to that
runtime environment sure exactly so I
mean it's a low-level language but it is
still a language so there's a couple
emulators that I thought were kind of
cool with Dutch we should probably
include in here so the first one anybody
ever played with nested vm or seen this
before this one's actually amazing cuz
it's in practical use right now nested
vm is a mips emulator written to run on
top of the JVM it has a couple different
modes we can convert either source into
mips binary into java source the Ken
that gets compiled or a mixed binary
into raw JVM classes that have all sorts
of wackiness in
and this is like I said this is actually
practically used right now if you use
the sequel light JDBC driver on the JVM
it will attempt to load a native binding
a jni library that can link in sequel
light if it can't do that if sequel
light is not installed on the platform
or if it just can't load the library for
some reason it actually runs a nested vm
mips binary on top of the JVM to do
sequel light and it's only like three to
four times slower than actually running
ross equal light the jruby sequel light
support for rails and whatnot uses that
driver and on a couple platforms that
actually does fall back on nested vm so
here's the basic sequence you need to
get a cross compiler for mips which is
by far the most difficult part of this
process I have never successfully gotten
a cross compiler from MIPS to work
properly for me but once you can compile
it into a mips binary you can translate
it either into java source which then
gets compiled and the source is
horrendous absolutely horrendous if you
ever want to see the worst java source
ever it's amazingly bad or you can go
straight from the mips binary into a JVM
class file or jar file and then it runs
on top of the vm in its own little
virtual memory space it's just it's
bizarre and what's most bizarre is that
the performance actually isn't that bad
when you talk about emulating a
processor on top of the JVM and we're
only looking at you know five maybe ten
times slower than actually running the
native processor directly and this may
am even improve over time as the JVM
gets better it's kind of amazing you can
actually have an emulator to do this
well on top of the JVM and so if we're
going to go with emulators and you know
not a lot of people running MIPS systems
why don't we go all the way to x86 so
the JPC x86 emulator is again a pure
Java x86 implementation on top of the
JVM it's actually good enough to run
lots of different dos games even some of
the dos games with memory extenders for
fourth dose for GL and things like that
it can run Linux even with a GUI
environment on it and there's a whole
bunch of other stuff that you can do is
still an active project here is their
lovely diagram that
goes oh we can run office and an
explorer on top of the pc or we can run
on top of windows on top of jpc so so PC
running Windows running a JVM running a
PC running Windows running Windows
applications obviously something that
you need to do in your daily life why
why did they stop there yeah why means
exactly i mean this is inception this is
like emulator operating system inception
here we have how many VMS involved in
this process this like four here so
alright so now that's that's not as
interesting running office to office
stuff but if you go to the JPC site
you'll search for it they have applets
that will boot up various Doss
applications or a Linux environment in
an applet window and this one so we're
booting something hard disk image floppy
image you get an ISO loading up lil diva
compiled stuff and here we go we
actually play jewel on top of the JVM
not a port this is an unmodified copy of
doom running on top of an x86 emulator
on the JVM and if that doesn't show you
that you can do anything on the JVM I
don't know what will alright so that's
all we have for tonight hopefully you
all can get out and have a good dinner
if you haven't already or get to some of
the parties in town and we're willing to
rap with you guys for the next three or
four minutes here thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
