something that is really cool it nice
for those of you have been to the
keynote yesterday you have already seen
a short video of what we're gonna show
today that there was not much time in
the keynote for really going into deeper
questions and this is what we are gonna
do in this session there's going to be
JavaFX JavaFX 3d java ethics for
business applications one specific
business business application for
monitoring and planning changes in
container terminal yard and we will see
underlying technology which is called
dolphin and that is the logo written in
Java FX and it should give you some
impression of that Java that this
technology is about finding something in
the ocean if in the in the world of of
Java ethics and Java Enterprise so let's
start with the slides
Oh mm-hmm this in the announcement as I
guess it said that it would be me I'm
the kunuk and undress but we have I'm
just over there
thank you we have posed worked on the
system but the main work was actually
done by Arvind of Ralph um nervous
nervous corporation is you correct me if
I'm wrong
I'd say the the word market leader in
container terminals of pair if you see
any random container somewhere it's the
likelihood is that it's handled by by
nervous technology many customers all
over the world and managing big
container terminal yachts all over the
place so therefore Arvind is with me and
we have just four pots who is from the
Oracle Oracle Desktop architect said
that the correct job ethics today and
he's gonna present in a little bit more
detail what you have seen yesterday the
3d version of of the application that
we're gonna talk about and the
experiences that we had with building it
so let's start with in a very short
introduction what is our domain we are
pushing boxes around that's it
my wife always makes fun of me when she
finds me laughing about rectangles
moving over the screen and a giggle like
crazy I said okay that's that's that's a
running joke at the at home well it all
starts that you that the containers are
shipped over the ocean they reach a yard
and then they are stacked up and you
need to get some overview what happens
here and there's lots of equipment in
such a container terminal there's trains
and there's straddle carriers and there
is a rubber tube can trees and so and
this is by no means trivial I mean
the software that we are doing actually
ends up in people pushing stuff around
and if you're sitting over here and if
you're driving such-and-such a car and
you'd have a collision with somebody
else you'll die right because there is
no there's nothing that protects you
really if that falls over well we had a
bug we just counted all that okay
so Java ethics and business applications
sometimes and sometimes this questions
about you know you have all this vast
capabilities in rich new eyes is that
really relevant for business and yes it
is because and not only for the domain
that we are seeing and that is because
you want your users of your system to
really dive into this world that you're
presenting to them as a software
developer you're creating worlds and you
want your users to immerse into this
world and this is what we are trying to
achieve and the best way of showing how
you can achieve that is with the
demonstration and I'll hand over to
Jasper to give us the first impression
of that
so about six months you hear me
so about six months ago we met with
Navis in canoe and sort of talked
through this application and they
explained the whole domain to us and the
sort of thing that came across my head
was wouldn't it be cool if we could play
around with some of this in 3d and start
doing some words to stuff so they sort
of showed us what they were doing with
the existing stuff and it and then went
on to show the domain so they've been
working busily on this - DUI or built in
ethics which they'll explain more in the
mill but um we wanted to take the same
sort of view you can see here so this is
this is a Dockyard in Antwerp and
there's all water where the ships are
coming and there's the very stacks where
the containers go and so it wants to
take this view and then present it in 3d
so there is our 3d view of the dockyard
so what we do perceive but the idea was
here was it matches up with the 2d so
the idea was to get it as easy as
possible to switch from the 2d 3d and
relate yourself but all Caesar is 3d we
can fly out and we can look at our docs
from any angle we can go down at the
ground level we can look at the ship and
we can move around so we have a complete
three-dimensional view of the dot all of
the containers so we can I can move
around the mouse and so all the
containers are pickable so we can look
at a different container and look at
these details or toys I'm maneuvering
this without a mouse for the first time
so it's a bit interesting with a
trackpad in three dimensions
so she going and pick the various
containers and look so because things
are stacked in this manner you know it's
really just hard to grasp it from the 2d
I was just amazed when they're
explaining housework how clever the
operators are we do this how they can
Mack from the various Tweedy views and
relate this to the 3d world of
containers
it's amazing how adaptive the human
brain was so we really tried to see if
we could sort of simplify that
understanding by creating a 3d well they
did navigate around so what we can also
do is we can turn on so this is
executing a sort of simulated sequence
so we can now see all of the cranes
driving around a little track guys
coming in so you go and get a complete
view of the dockyard running the idea of
this would be to run you know
simulations that before the dockyards
even built they can be simulating it
seeing how things were making sure
there's no collisions making sure the
guys are going to survive and also you
know optimizing it to find the best
possible sort of ruse and we can fly
down and see our little truck I kind of
had lots of fun with the image
I don't even quite see on there the
number place has gel effects there's a
nice ins since little qyx in there and
there is a little bug here though you'll
see that our driver does not stir died
though under some virtual software so no
one needs fixing before a gypsy
production s so this is the whole sort
of world we created we actually had the
aerial photographs and we have several
different aerial photographs so the
moment the sort of currents do we don't
have any java effects 3d out yet we've
done it there's a prototype we've been
working on for about a year
we're in the progress of doing the real
thing this should do we have weekly
early access builds going out at the
moment
hopefully the graphics team will have
something out in the next couple months
so but as soon as they do it you'll see
it so you'll be able to play with it
please go to open GFX download the 8 so
jelly K 8 early early access will
include Java effects 8 early access so
grab it play with it tell us what you
think
you know if there's features that are
missing or you know things that aren't
easy to understand let us know you know
the earlier we get feedback the better
but you know hopefully hopefully in a
few months you'll be able to do this for
real
and then that'll be shipping next year
in 8 as a general availability for
production it holds it but you can get
get going earlier and start developing
on it and let us know what you think so
uh thank you gesture so the the
application version that we have been
developing Navis and canoe was mainly
the in in two-dimensional of a
two-dimensional part and then on top of
that oracle added the the 3-dimensional
view and the next point would be to
explain it a little bit more what the
application does and we will see the 2
dimensional rendering of things and
later on we will see that it doesn't
really make much of a difference for the
application whether you rendered 2d or
3d we go then into that and
mm Xer so so coming back to the present
world so this is all just for explained
that this is a top-down view of the yard
right so this application has several
layers to layer that you're looking at
right now is called the yard block layer
so all these a GAF a and Haidee what you
are seeing they are yard blocks right
and so right now a man who's zoom in one
level here and on top of it what you can
do is that based on your function or
what you want to do I have to strain my
net you can look at the yard layer layer
right and now and then you can go and
view different layers example if I can
only yard pads it will give me all the
paths within the yard
and then what I can do is
turn on the reboot Slayer so now you see
the vessels right the ship-to-shore
cranes right and there we and all the
container handling equipment which we
saw earlier in 3d
and a moving around so but before that
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to the yard block here again
so within the yard block layer you can
have a more coarse-grained view which
you are seeing here for just the blocks
but what you can also see is that you
can have a more detailed view in here
which is down so here I'm saying show me
what is in those blocks right there it
will be more so in this case what you're
seeing is you're seeing the individual
rows within the block right and also the
columns in a block so what what you are
seeing here is all these colored things
so they are the because it's a top view
so they are the top containers right and
all these slots which you see white so
they're empty slots what it means is
there's nothing in those slots
and even what you can also do is so this
so these slots if you look at it so so
these colors they are not fixed right so
what I mean by that is that right now
they are colored by port of discharge
which means that where the container
will be going right so if you won't have
a different view you can change this
view I can change it by the way so it
doesn't look that good in on the
projector okay but it changes the color
based on and these colors so they are
configurable for example in my case my
weight is red if it's over 25 tons right
customer can easily configure that and
similarly for the port of discharge very
working it back to my original scheme
so now we are going to view the same
animation which just for sure in 3d
earlier right
so this is some gonna say execute work
sequence so work sequence is just a
bunch of work instructions as we call it
right so this is a series of steps where
you tell a container handling equipment
either to go to a certain slot right so
each of these things is a slot and it
has a unique address based on the block
right and the section which is it is in
I and the stack which is this thing and
after that a slot how high it is right
so and that naming scheme again is
configurable by the customer so here you
see so that is the straddle which we
looked at earlier so it was yellow going
in but now it has a container on it so
that's why it's turned view sorry
so now what Australia's going to do is
it's going to drop container here and
you'll see this thing is coloured based
on that container spot of discharge and
a guy become became yellow again now
this is the second thing which is
happening now this straddle is coming in
and placing a container on a truck
you'll see this will become yellow and
it's back after that rock that turns
blue which means it's a latent laden
with a container so right now for the
demo purposes it's the same work
instructions which are kind of moving
over and over but in the real world all
this stuff comes from the server
alright so we're sending the
instructions what is going where right
and where things took place and the UI
is updated so this was the monitoring
part of the application another thing
which I want to show is and we which you
didn't see in 3d is the planning part of
it so that is beforehand when the plans
are made that when the when the
containers are coming off the vessel or
ship where they are going to be placed
which ones both first right and so they
are easily accessible and things like
that
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
hide all the other vehicles and then
mom
your machine is calling home I mean try
it again
I'm gonna zoom out in here
so another thing is what we can do in
here is that for the individual block
like if you want to drill down more into
it and look at how the things are right
you can right click on it and here let's
see show the block details and this is
again the same you where it shows the
top containers in a block and again the
color by which you can see here actually
can always change it based on so in this
case what I'm going to do is all these
things so they are rows here but in this
kind of expect expanded view you can see
that you can see this is the row number
295 294 right and then also the column
number which is o 2 or 3 right and then
there is a Z dimension to it which is 1
2 3 or 4 because these are usually four
to five stacks high so what I'm going to
do is that here what I can do is I can
drag my thing around if I want to have a
more detailed view of this thing so for
example in this case I'll just have
these 4 in here so what happens is it
tells me the information about it there
total of these right used are 64 and
open at 252 based on the stack height
which we have and we saw this
information here because we have chosen
the arrow tool right another thing which
I can do is I can choose the zoom tool
in here and in this case you see the
cursor changing which is kind of a good
help to tell you so it shows me the more
detailed view of the whole thing right
and in this case what you are seeing
here is these are the weights right off
the container containers and then I can
zoom it even more and see what that
whole section looks like so here it
gives you some extra information and in
this case it's showing when it whenever
it is down it means it's an export right
so that means it's going on a vessel and
then you can see the port of discharge
and this is the ISO code of
equipment type or the container type and
and you can change this thing more - if
I go to equipment ID you'll see changes
to the actual container ID right and you
have some more and a fine grain weight
in here right and and similarly I can
change the weight here again I mean the
mode here again to report of discharge
and then there's another thing where you
have it you can have a custom as well
where the customer can choose that what
you want to see right on that
information and talking about the tools
right so another thing which I can do
here is so this thing presents this
thing in a table view right so they are
the same number of containers I can even
see them in the table view so here the
number which you see here it's the total
number of container you just selected at
any given point of time and because
usually and the planning the operations
happen in bulk right I want to choose
all those things and place them over
there
so here
screen is kind of
so let me choose a thing in here so for
example if I choose select the container
here you'll see it selected
automatically in there and there you
have a count of one right so what I'm
going to do now is move this container
and you can see the selection here to
norm what I'm going to do is I'm going
to let me do it from here because you
didn't see so I'm going to move this
container over here so what you see here
is it is 290 and what was it - 91 a it
should be a whole 9b I can see it from
here and that is this is the row this is
the oh wait which is the column right
and this is the ear height so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to move it here
alright and you will see the position
here change to reflect that so it will
say 291 0 1 a 1
you got it here right and then you see
the position change here another thing
that you notice is now I have a
container here all right so all the
views they're gonna get updated
simultaneously and if I move it back you
can notice this one that will go back
again and this one I can do from any of
you from bought any of these views so
for example if I move this guy to here
you can see the change and you see the
change there so that's where the
planning part comes in
I guess that was the main thing which I
wanted to show so no it's that's good
thank you I wonder
I'd like to add that when we had various
use onto the data onto the container
data which data which containers where
the system the the client system all the
various views do not know anything about
each other this is an important point
when you're creating a rich application
and you create so many views and when
one view changes he needs to know who
other views to update mmm that's a bad
thing
that's speaks against extensibility and
maintainability and so on so you need
something that keeps this information
now there's like two standard ways of
doing this one is an event bus and
second is presentation model and that
means there's some engineering required
behind the scenes to nicely vector the
software to display it in this way so
the the architecture that that this is
build upon is there's a client there's a
server and there some a bridge between
it right okay yeah so the the server
part is the standard Java Enterprise
Server as you have it
in our case it's it uses Grails in
hibernate but doesn't implementation
detail that's a technology choice
it could be GlassFish or it is actually
using Tomcat and or any other standard
Java Enterprise server the client uses
Java FX of course as we have seen and it
uses this is in in the context of
Griffen Griffen is if you do Java
desktop development the project that you
should look at and there's going to be
Gryphon sessions at JavaOne Wednesday
morning right and this is giving you a
whole platform for developing
client-side desktop Java applications so
that's what we are using based on Java
standardization now the bridge is what's
called dolphin and we have announced off
and be open source yesterday and yes we
have the first very interested
interesting feedback for them so what is
it all about so a very short lecture on
what dolphin is Dolphin is a remote
presentation model a presentation model
that is shared between client and server
this allows us to keep all the logic on
the server all the application logic
stays on the server and the server many
pilate's controls steers a presentation
model the presentation model is
automatically kept in sync between
server and client the client binds
against this information and displays it
and whether we displays it in as 2d or
3d is a client specific detail yep so
the presentation model has information
in it that captures the whole state of
what everything you need to know for
this playing your view directly in your
application for example what containers
are placed where of course but also
information about what's the currently
selected container or
the list of currently selected
containers is container currently moving
certain and it commands the client site
may issue command saying I've now moved
this container from this lot to that
slot and even though we immediately
displayed this information on the climb
the server will be notified
asynchronously the synchronous stuff is
very important because otherwise if you
would always wait for the server to
react the application would feel
sluggish right if you have a
client-server environment but your
client doesn't really so let's say let's
say HTML application so your your run
site the browser and the browser
round-trips takes a second then users
accept it because they're kind of used
to seeing the spinning wheel in their
browser but if you have an application
that looks and feels and is a desktop
application then any reaction that takes
a second is much too long that's not
what they expect they need an immediate
reaction that's what you have seen in
the code it reacts immediately
anyway the server gets notified about
this state the server knows what is
currently selected the server even now
stuff like where is my current
perspective so you're kind of hovering
with red from bird's view of the
shipyard can knows the elevation that we
have knows your your angle that you're
looking at that's information that that
you may need on the server side so any
information that you may need on the
server side for reacting is something
that you put into the presentation model
the server says what to display the
client knows how to display that's the
division of labor in that system pretty
easy you would say right if you are
let's go back for a second if you think
in terms of model-view-controller and
apply model not your to a persistent
domain model or database or so much of
the presentation state then the
controller then the server has the
controller the controller logic the
client has the view and the model is
shared
that's Model View controller in that
concept so the server has all the
business logic of course for example you
may not place to 20-footers on top of a
40-footer right because you have like
two small ones and then in the middle it
will break the one down below but you
may place a 40-footer on top of two
20-footers very simple business logic
yeah but that's on the server
that's not redistributed over so many
different clients somewhere as you have
with other approaches so that's business
logic that's something that quite
obviously on the server but even present
a part of the presentation logic that
contained workflows are still on the
server for example what should I display
at a certain when something happens we
all do you have like deep frozen fish
that goes into a reefer it needs to be
hooked up to the power to keep it fresh
and you know if you forget to do it it
might smell a little but you make it you
may not recognize in the office right
and so you need some you need some way
of telling what should happen if the
system recognizes that there is a
container which is not hooked up
correctly so this information what
should happen is on the server side
service has B please now display the big
warning
reaction whatever that is the client may
decide this pops up something a replace
of sound or gives you the the dolphin
sonar sound or something right that's
what you can do
so client decides what to do and decides
how to display this information 770
sites that this should now happen good
as we have seen the client obviously
visualizes the state and it visualizes
the transitions how state and transition
looks like is of course different in the
two-dimensional and three-dimensional
world but that's client specific that's
client code that you write and you're
using the full capabilities of your
client before let's be safe eyetality of
that channel so the presentation model
state is synchronized but often hmm we
can we take care of that you can just
rely on that whenever something happens
you have all the state that you need
even on both sides the communication
itself now gets a little bit more
detailed is follows in a command pattern
so we're sending commands back and back
and forth between client and server
there is application state that is
automatically synchronized but at some
point you also need the aperture the
opportunity to from the client side to
tell the server that something has
happened which is beyond simple changes
in the state for example user has
clicked a button something happens on
their clients the device whatever and
then the server can react to those
changes by modeling by doing changes to
the model store presentation model store
there's more instance of a client so
keep state and in reacts accordingly
key effects we fully exploit the
capabilities of the client and that is
now the best possible that we have with
Java and on the client is JavaFX but
even if you're a like old-fashioned shop
and wanted to swing you can use it with
dolphin or it gives us if he or
what-have-you and
as we have seen when you introduced
often you're enforcing clean structures
you're enforcing that your views are
decoupled so if all kinds of good
benefits from good software engineering
for your client code and it protects
your investment so and since you have a
division between the business logic and
the visualization is whenever you decide
that your rigid light chain with
visualization
should change you can do so without even
touching the server not even redeploying
not even recompiling know you can change
it this protects your investment and is
also a good migration path if you want
to go from let's say swing to Java
ethics demo so dolphin itself is open
source you'll find it on github under
open - dolphin and what you're gonna see
is that dolphin comes with 20-plus demos
so every important feature every
important use case of dolphin has a
dedicated demo to it and I'll show you a
demo that that does something similar to
what we have seen before but you know it
stripped down to the very essentials of
that story and that story Wars not
starting the logo but starting to push
demo
that's that yeah started over here sir I
know that was the dolphin sorry it's not
start logo but start push channel the
scenario here is that there is in fact
you see down below and the logging sea
means client as main server there is
commands being sent between client and
server and there comes a small user
interface like to master views and one
detail view there's there's some
information which is colored and has an
x and y position and entered orientation
you may see this as vehicles for example
moving over shipyard but there there is
no collision detection yet okay not
quite like vehicles that they move over
map which is one master view and you
here see the table which is second
master view and here's the detail view
where nothing is selected yet so the
typical use case is you would select one
let's select the blue one so you'll see
the details of the blue one and tap and
you'll also see that the blue one is
selected over here you can do the very
same action in the map view so you
select the red so you select the red one
the red one is over is selected over
here and the red one is selected over
here no view knows any other view right
there is only a collection of what we
call vehicles here and this is a
collection of presentation models and
live every presentation model has
attributes the XY and orientation
attributes and this detailed view binds
against the so called selected vehicle
the selected vehicle was a special one
which gets automatically updated
whenever a selection changes
that's the way that it structures now we
can change the data from from the client
side let's say give change the Y
position if we change the Y position you
will see the Y position is changing over
here and you'll also see the the red
vehicle moving up because Y position is
horizontal thing so if I double click
double-click 0 it gives up with an
animation right and then after a while
that will be reset from the server logic
because service randomly putting that in
various places makes sense so far in the
back behind you see there's constantly
information being sent from the server
to the client at this point this is done
we are a long polling so we are opening
request and the server may take so long
to give it back to us to respond with
any change and after they've received to
change we will process it and then
immediately issue a new brief rest
that's long polling it's one way of
doing this ok so far how does it look
like in code right
don't get overly excited that's not good
for your health things yeah let's see
how does it look like here's the start
push them out let's give me make it four
so this is only four starting we say
that we run in an in-memory
configuration you can run the whole
system blind and self apart inside the
same VM if you want to you can deploy
the server part on a standard Java
Enterprise server and the client part on
any Java enabled machine but you can
also run the very same in the same
engine and then you could get direct
method calls and not even go through the
HTTP stack very important while
developing in debugging and so on
profiling yeah you can even say yes I'd
like to run in memory but I'd like to
have a delay that kind of mimics the
behavior the time constraints that you
have with the server I'd like to have so
many so much delay and so good we are
registering an action this happens on
the server side there's a server dolphin
it has a connector we are registering in
action this is the starter that does it
in memory so it is registered directly
in memory if we do this on a server side
for example in in a Grails application
you have a controller in a Grails
application and there it is it says the
very same line reaches to the custom
action so the very same code can be run
inside one VM or distributed how does
the custom action look like what do we
do on the server on the server side we
do nothing else but using changing
attributes in the presentation models or
create new presentation ones here we are
registering for the pull commands for
yet the command pool
some code goes from here to here and if
you've never seen groovy before it is
like Java so for every vehicle that we
have there's a list of vehicles that
comes in we create a new presentation
model with these attributes and give
them random values and some width and
height and so on and then comes then
with we're setting the the presentation
water-type we can give it a special type
saying distinguishing vehicles from
containers for example and then we
create a presentation model create
presentation model command that the
client sends to the server sends to the
client and then add it to the response
that's all we do after what this is done
in the very beginning of the application
after a while the long polling will ask
for an update this is how the update
takes place we sleep for a random time
between zero and one second and then we
suffer all the vehicles and pick the
first one from all the vehicles and
changed its attributes and then what
goes down the line again is the change
attribute command change value command
sorry down to the client and client
processes it that's how it's done so
just like in normal Java Enterprise
environment you have actions and you
kind of have to react on what the client
wants to have here with this special
design decision that we only send
commands over the wire very simple
command commands are very simple pojos
that we send around now how does the
client look like that's the whole server
that was the whole server only these two
actions so how does the client look like
client may have totally different views
but here's one view that's that's all
the code like give you a short overview
of like so that's all the code that it
takes for the full application
well there's nothing else for this code
this is how the long polling works
that's all it needs for the long falling
we're we are sending a command the CMD
update command and when it has finished
we register some logic what should
happen when it has finished and has
processed everything that is we call
ourselves again
sounds like an endless recursion but it
works since you're working in
asynchronous threats why do you get no
threat of Stack Overflow here and then
there is a specialized presentation
model for the selected vehicle with
these attributes and for this father for
the sake of static type checking we have
put them into constants and using a
constants here constants are the only
pieces of code that are shared between
client and server application specific
code that is shared between client and
server you can decide whether you want
to do this or whether you want to be
string Li typed and know about the
strings on client and server side just
as if if you have a normal client client
needs to know what you are else to look
up for example no that's kind of another
goes to that so and then reflect on the
client side now it comes
JavaFX Pacific's there's observable list
and then when the client gets back some
information and here's the general
layout of this there's the detailed view
and there's the table view and there's
the map view so to speak and I wouldn't
go into the details it's all on github
you can directly look into this code
through the browser whenever a selection
changes the only thing that we do is we
get the presentation model that is now
should now be the selected presentation
model be it in the table or be it on the
map
and we apply that one to the selected
vehicles so all the information gets
transferred to the selected vehicle
presentation model that's the way that
dwarf and hamlets switches between
presentation models so to speak and then
there's an observable list of
presentation models whenever the the
collection of presentation models
changes we have to react somehow when
there's a new vehicle we have to put it
in the map and in the table and so on we
have to animate it and this is what
happens in that code and after a while
we send at the very beginning so to
speak we sent the pull command and when
this comes back now here's the
unfinished handler when when these
presentation models come back we go
through every presentation model and add
it to the list of presentation models to
the observable list and everything comes
automatically from there
that's the elegant part of it now you
have some action you don't care about
who needs the information you just say
here it is don't we ever whoever wants
to know something about it can subscribe
for changes right that's it we're
styling it in blue and then we're
binding these various fields together
this is all you know client-side
JavaScript our FX is the binding like
that very much and then your binding
color stuff and so on so the the rest is
details
questions about it
all these demos is open you can go to
github click through the under samples
demo something you'll find all that good
tamo
yeah yeah sitting me I checked I changed
my thing here huh okay here it goes
yeah yeah almost good the post demo
yep so if you're not confused yet this
should confuse you red is so to speak
all the various features of dolphin and
green is the benefits that you get you
don't have to remember that that the
main point is Dolphin uses the remote
presentation model to keep the logic on
the server that's the important
distinction between many other
approaches like the the typical Java
ethics for enterprise labored approaches
the see these days are using having all
the logic on the client and using like
rest calls to the server to get some
data right this pigeonholes the server
to be a data source only but like our
customers and nervous in the first place
they do have normally serve a centric
architecture like all the applications
currently run on the server and that's
for a good reason it's not only security
and efficiency for fetching under the
database it's also restrictions for
example legal restrictions you may not
send arbitrary code to some client in
some other country in also and you want
to have this protection of your
investment of all the information that
you already have on the server and all
the information what containers are in
the shipyard where they are what are
what is the business requirements for
them is already there it's already on
the server you just want to have a
better way of displaying it reinforcing
clean structures and I would say that
even some clients are only moving from
the existing application onto dolphin
for getting a better structure and to be
ready for the future when they want to
change the client wicked here's how you
can find more information either
directly coming to me or asking canoe
and I'm happier happy to have like five
minutes or so for questions yes please
now there's a question was whether there
was an event bus evolved no I mentioned
you can have an event bus in addition to
dolphin but dolphin is not an event bus
there is approaches that work like in
distributed event bus with JavaFX I
guess the read FX are e d FX project is
doing something similar player maybe
mistaking I'm not an expert on that one
no I was just saying that if you want to
have clean structures in your client
code there's like two different
approaches to it that I know of one is
an event bus like NetBeans for example
is using an event bus or you may have a
presentation model which is more fine
granular modulation modeling of what
you're doing on the client yeah and we
have decided to go to the presentation
model
yes also thank you very much
question was whether there any thready
concerns when you're using it
yes so every client will kit has special
rules about threading you know swing has
it JavaFX has it with JavaFX you are
much less likely to step into the easy
to find traps there's still some hidden
ones so what you do when configuring I
can show you when you configure dolphin
for a certain UI toolkit you say how you
correctly reach the UI thread we need
this information
and whenever information comes from the
server and needs to be processed through
the binding listeners and so on we need
to make sure that this happens in the UI
thread therefore we need to know how to
hook into it and it may change between
toolkits so what you do in in the push
demo for example pay using the JavaFX in
memory config in the JavaFX the memory
config as the UI thread handler which is
the java epics you guys pretend but
that's a swing thread Handler and
Eclipse RCP and so on swt thread Handler
and this says well execute inside you I
thread for a certain run a ball is done
like so platform run later this is how
you do it pretty much the least amount
of code that you can possibly think of
for running that so if you go back to
the UI thread Handler and look into what
else is there
now there's an anonymous month in the
Java demo not even here is what you can
do as well you can set the UI thread
handler directly as an anonymous inner
class and here is not the groovy style
of the Java style this is typical Java
style they say a first week we just say
we're going into UI now and then we call
the run on runnable
and then that's only for this demo
beatdown can we count down the ledge
such that we know we are finished before
the app the application finishes
application threat finishes right that's
what you can do
thank you very much for that question
more yes please
the question is on the clients how can
you use something that is not even Java
at the moment no that was that times
over sorry
eh okay what we sent over the wire is
configurable at the moment is JSON with
the the commands that we are sending
over the via a very simple JSON photos
pojos S JSON so if anybody is up to
writing a client dolphin in for html5
and JavaScript for example he can just
digest the JSON and work with it and
when he tries to go to the server he can
just send JSON well he needs to know
about the five or six commands we are
saying that we are sending and he needs
to know what what it means what he
should do but he can write his own
client so you could have I experimented
with it and it seems to work but it's
not yet in the codebase to have an html5
client or GWT client or which is an
interesting combination of Java and
JavaScript or iOS client or android
client it's not yet there but we are
open source and we will certainly
appreciate any contribution in that
regard even if it's not the full thing
and we have to rework it I don't care
but that's the depend huge benefit of
open source that people can contribute
such a thing
doesn't that doesn't answer the question
thanks a lot have a great job of one and
make this day count</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
