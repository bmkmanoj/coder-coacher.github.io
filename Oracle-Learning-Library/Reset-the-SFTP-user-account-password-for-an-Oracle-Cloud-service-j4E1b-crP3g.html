the SFTP user account password for your
Oracle cloud service SFTP user accounts
are used to upload and download files
related to your Oracle cloud service
identity domain administrators can
manage SFTP user accounts
okay so let's sign in to the my services
application so you can view information
about your Oracle cloud services located
within a single domain be sure to
specify the correct identity domain when
you sign in on signing in you are
presented with the services page which
lists all your services within the
current domain in this case the trial a
en1 domain there are three services in
this domain database database - and Java
click a service name to be details
including SFTP details about that
service from the overview tab scroll
down the page to get the SFTP details
that you need specifically for this
exercise what I want to know is the SFTP
user name for this database service I
can use the service SFTP user account to
import and export data to and from my
service on a related note each identity
domain has its own SFTP user account
that SFTP user name is used to retrieve
your data that Oracle archives when you
terminate your paid subscription to an
Oracle cloud service so let me just go
back and show you compare that with this
other database service
alright let's scroll down to SFTP
details
remember that SFTP user name for the
database service instance was trial a11
know that the SFTP user name for the
database - service instance this trial
0:01 however because both services are
located in the same identity domain the
user name for the identity domain SFTP
account is
same in this case trial of 16 there is
only one identity domain SFTP user
account for the domain so we can also
take a look at the Java service if you
scroll down to SFTP details of that
service you will see a different SFTP
username for the Java service as well
okay so let's go back to the original
database service let's click on database
let's scroll down we are going to change
a password for the SFTP user name for
this database service in this case trial
0 1 1 click identity console click
manage users enter SFTP in search box to
limit your results to only SFTP users
let's scan the list to find SFTP user
for the database service remember the
user name is trial 0 1 1
select the trial 0 1 user and then click
reset password make sure you select
manually change password enter your new
password and then confirm your new
password click reset password and that's
it
passwords change successfully and now
ready for use with FTP transactions know
that while you are here on the manage
users page you can reset the password
for any of the SFTP user accounts in
addition as the identity domain
administrator you must supply the SFTP
sign-in details to your administrators
who will need access to the SFTP server
I'll show you how to deal with data
export in another video but for now
that concludes our effort to setup an
SFTP user account
