my session today systems integration in
the cloud era with Apache camera before
I start a session I want to introduce
myself shortly my name is Kai Vina I
work for my Bond wolf at all that small
IT consulting and software development
company in Germany and in a main time
time of my task I to consulting and
developing especially in the Java
environment besides I do some talks at
conferences and write articles for
journals if you have any feedback for
the session please write me an email or
contact me via Twitter or via a social
network link in I appreciate every
feedback ok I want to start with an
introduction why I'm doing this talk
today and the reason is growth
everywhere and every company where we
are for our customers
they're always more and more
applications you have more interfaces
and technologies and a number of
products increased a lot and combined
with this you also have a new paradigm
ahead so in the past we had
client-server which we use for
applications then 10 years ago we
started with the service-oriented
architecture architectures and now since
two or three years we're starting with
cloud computing and so this new paradigm
in cloud computing also has to be
integrated of course it has to
communicate with other services with
other cloud services but also with
legacy applications and so in the end we
have to integrate all these cloud
services the problem is all roads lead
to Rome in the end you can write a lot
of glue code every time and integrate
your applications and reinvent the wheel
every time and of course that's not
really a good solution it's a lot of
efforts every time and so some wishes
for system integrators these wishes are
first standardized modeling all
integration problems and then when we
have our problems model then we of
course want to integrate them
efficiently
this means without a lot of boilerplate
code and so on and finally and that's
probably often the toughest task is to
also automatically test these
integration problem
though we don't want to do it only by
hand we want to do it automatically
we are unit tests and if you have ever
integrated several different
technologies in the past you know how
hard this can be if you don't use the
right tooling mmm though this was a
short introduction why I'm doing this
talk and now I will show you how you can
integrate your cloud services with
Apache camera and therefore today I have
three key messages which I hope you will
keep at the end of this session first
key message is the cloud already arrived
definitely and it must be integrated
your cloud services have to communicate
with all you other applications and
services then the second message is the
cloud integration is already possible
and apache camel helps a lot as you will
see in this talk today I will also show
a lot of live demos so you will see it's
really easy to integrate cloud services
with a Pecha camera so let's look at the
agenda shortly first I will start with
an introduction to cloud computing no
bar is only one or two slides then I
will introduce apache camel to you move
you already know so patrick hammer so ok
it's about 30 percent or so so i will
about 10 minutes or so take to explain
apache camera and then i will go on and
integrate different cloud services with
camel and I will explain several
different examples and finally I will
show you how to create custom cloud
components if there's no one available
within camel ok so we start with an
introduction to cloud computing at your
site only two slides no worries just to
have the same understanding of what we
are talking in this session about and if
you take a look at the slide here you
have several different alternatives for
deploying applications on the left side
as the on-premise alternative so you
host the applications in your
environment on your machines and then
you have different alternatives for
cloud deployment in the middle you have
infrastructure as a server and as you
can see here um you have full control
over the application that you develop
but you don't even have full control
over the VM which you use so that is a
huge difference
difference to on-premise solutions and
then you can also use a platform as a
service solution there you don't even
have full control over your app which
you develop and finally you can use
software service there you don't have
any control you just use the service I
just wanted to use this definition
loaded we are all talking about
assignment I say cloud computing or
infrastructure as a service also and
probably as you know every window and
the meantime has cloud products
available so the cloud definitely has
arrived and must be integrated so let's
now come to a penci camera what is a
patrick hammer and apache camel is an
integration framework so to explain you
what exactly is an integration framework
I have a small graphic here and you can
see on the left this is just an API so
if you have an integration problem and
have for example to use just one cloud
service then you can use the API of that
service for example if you use Amazon
Web Services you can use the Java Java
API or Internet API or a ruby API to
communicate to this cloud service so but
if you have several different
technologies which you want to integrate
then you should use an integration
framework because an integration
framework is exactly built for this
problem and it helps you a lot it
reduces the efforts for you a lot as you
will see today and on the right we have
two Enterprise Service bus this is the
powerful integration product the
difference to the integration framework
is that you have much more capabilities
you cannot just integrate your different
technologies and applications you can
also do Business Process Management and
business activity monitoring and you
have an rules engine and all that stuff
so um if you need all of that power then
you can use an integration and
Enterprise Service pass but if you want
just integrate your technologies and
applications and integration framework
is the best solution because it's not
that powerful and not that complex
therefore and if you look at integration
frameworks in the Java environment you
have three alternatives
these alternatives are apache camel
spring integration and muller all of
them
open source and all of them have the
same capabilities in the end the goal is
to integrate your applications and your
technologies and services
it's not about dentist talk about a
difference of all of these so I've
written a blog you will get a slides
later you maybe want to read this blog
about the differences to sum up shortly
my favorite is a Patrick camel for
several reasons first it has the largest
community of all of these three then it
has the most connectors and it has the
best domain-specific languages and as we
will see later it is really easy to use
and in my opinion the best framework but
of course you read this blog and look at
the other one too so all of three of
them can be used for integrating
different applications but today we will
talk about a Patrick camel and so what
now is a Patrick camera it's an
integration framework and this
information integration framework
implements the enterprise integration
patterns so enterprise integration
patterns that's a book here by Rico Hopi
and Bobbie wolf and this is a defector
standard for modeling integration
problems so when you have a large
integration problems you can divide it
into many small parts and then you can
solve each of this problem in its own
and combine these solutions as you will
see here and the great thing about
apache camel is that apache camel
implements these enterprise integration
patterns so for every simple small
solution you have one method in apache
camel which you can call to do it so you
can see here for example there are
several of these enterprise integration
patterns there's for example a splitter
and there's a translator and there's a
content-based ruta probably you i've
heard many of these patterns and you can
use them to divide total use your
complex problem integration problem and
divide it into many smaller part as you
can see here in this example so here we
are using a file directory as input and
we read the csv files and ran between
transform them and then we split them
and then we use a content-based router
to send the messages to end point
depending on the content of
message and probably also view if never
seen these patterns before you really
can understand what is happening it's
really easy to understand and it's a
good visualization of your integration
problem and it's divided into many
smaller parts and as I said apache camel
implements these patterns so as you will
see in the demos now um for every of
these patterns we have one method an
apache camel which you can call and this
is the reduction of polar plate code
because a petra camera helps you here
and reduces the efforts a lot because
you don't have to write this you just
care about you integration logic but not
about what's behind these in these
patterns
let's now shortly talk about an
architecture of apache camera let's look
on the left first so here you have your
domain-specific language for your
integration logic this is called a root
in camera and here you write your
integration logic and the processing of
it so you always has a from endpoint
where is your message coming and you
have two endpoints where do you want to
send it and in the middle you can also
do integration logic for some processing
for example routine transformation
enrichment transformation and that stuff
and this is the second component and the
third important component of emoji camel
are the endpoints and components or in
other frameworks it's also called
connectors which in my opinion is the
best of what a better word connector but
here it's in component so you have a
component for every different technology
you want to integrate for example here
we see gemma is an HTTP and file and
there are about 120 other components
available and the great thing of how the
magic camel is that you have always the
same syntax in your code for your
integration problems no matter which
technology you want to integrate so as
you see here here we use the file
endpoint and we use the chain as
endpoint and the HTTP and smtp and it
does not matter which endpoint you use
you always have this syntax for your
route and all the implementation under
the hood is done by a veggie camera you
don't have to care about that so it's
really that easy to integrate your
different technology is always the same
way
and as you will see later unit testing
is the same concept so you also ride
unit testing with these concepts and
always the same way so what's also great
about Apogee camera is that it has many
different domain-specific languages so
in my examples today I will use the Java
DSL and Escala DSL but you can also use
XML or groovy or even a couplet DSL is
in the mean time available and this is
one of the advantages compared to other
integration frameworks such as spring
integration or Muller and spring
integration and newly you only have an
XML DSL so I don't like it that much
because I like the programming dsls
because you can better use them in your
IDE with code completion and refactoring
and so on
but also you can decide by yourself
enough people also you will say XML DSL
in a petri camera and as I mentioned you
have several different components
available already about 120 in a moment
and you can also create your own
components easily as I will show you in
the end of this session apache camel can
also deploy it everywhere on the java
platform so it doesn't matter if you use
under standalone application as i will
use today in the demos you can also
deploy it on every web container like
Tom Carcetti you can apply deployed on
an application server like WebSphere
WebLogic GlassFish and so on you can use
it in combination from Sprint container
with OSGi and you can also deploy camel
in the cloud if you want
and finally apache camel is definitely
enterprise ready also it's an
open-source product not all open-source
products are really Enterprise ready but
camel definitely is it's about five
years old now and it offers all features
you need a new enterprise projects like
scalability error handling transactions
monitoring and it also offers tooling
and commercial support by different
vendors and that's also an important
fact for an open-source framework
there's not just one window behind it
such as for spring integration and
you'll there are different vendors which
implement tooling and offer commercial
support for camera so you do not depend
on one vendor if you choose a patchy
camera
so now I want to show you a little
example of a Petri camera in action
before we get over to the cloud
integration so I will first show you
here on my route so this is a relatively
simple route as from endpoint we use a
file so we read files from this
directory and then we do some custom
processing here you can implement
whatever you want I will show you the
code in a minute and then we use the
unmarshal component to read CSV files
out to convert them to objects and then
we split them so as you can see here
these are these enterprise integration
patterns each one is one method so after
we have split them so one incoming order
can contain several different order
attempts and we split them so every
order item is one message since here and
now we lock it and to a content-based
fruta pattern so it depends on the
content now where we send this it item
so if it contains DVD I send it to this
directory if a contained CD is a little
sis directory and if it is something
else I send it to amok amok is just
another component such as file or JMS or
the cloud components we will use later
so this is my route and as I've
mentioned you can either use enterprise
integrations head-ons which are already
available or you can of course implement
your own custom integration logic for
example for transformation or enrichment
or whatever and I have two examples here
the first one is a local processor here
you implement a camera interface so you
can access the exchange the exchange of
the messaging Kamel as the message input
and meta information and so on and you
can easily access this input so here you
can see in this loking processor i just
locked the message but you can do any
custom integration here you can call our
web services colony JP whatever you want
it doesn't matter you can call
everything within here it's your code
and this is one example and then you can
also use pins the difference of pins to
a processor is that a pin does not
depend on
Patrick Emma so is a beam you can use
every Pocho which maybe already exist
for example if you have already spring
pins which are poachers you can
integrate them here using this beam and
here again you can also write every
custom integration or check if one
calling JB's web services and so on and
this is the root and I've also written a
test for this route though that is again
one of the great features of camel that
you can unit test all of your
integration or check with the same
concepts you just have to extend camel
tests apart this extends from chai unit
so it's all a unit X concepts plus
advanced features added so what are we
doing here we are using the template
producer this is a feature of apache
camel and send a message to an endpoint
so remember this here is the endpoint
which we use in the root as incoming
root here we have our file or as inbox
and what we are doing in our test we are
sending a file to this endpoint with a
body of a message so this is the message
we sent there and so we create a file
there right so and again here it doesn't
matter if you use a file or if you use a
mess or whatever technology it's always
this syntax to send a message to that
endpoint so you can use it all your
integration tests and then we use a Mac
moment mock endpoint which is also a
part of Patrick ml to create this mock
here again the mock is this one and then
we can do a search ins if messages
arrive to this mock and so on so here
for example we say and we expect one
message because the mob receives all
messages which are not Eva T's and CDs
and as we can see here we have a CD a
DVD a book and the CD so only the book
will be received at a mock and finally
we also check if the file was created
for orders outbox DVD because remember I
can here if some order items contain
activity we send it to this directory
and so here we check if it is created
and in the first if it has a correct
content and then we do some
set up before I won't talk about this
view um so that's a simple camel test
case and you can use this for every
technology in every chemical parent in
this way and now let's run it so we will
see it as green the unit test also
starts a chemical text which is also
used in your running applications or
this test simulates running Hemel
context chemi runtime and here if you
would look at a log you can also see
some of the logic which I've implemented
for example this one it's a logging
processor which I've implemented here so
as you can see the test the screen
everything works so the file was created
all content is correct and so you can
see that this integration route works
and thus exactly what we want so this
was a just an simple example for accept
apache camel and i hope you can get a
feeling about it how you integrate
applications with it so let's get back
to the slides and let's now integrate
some of these cloud services first we
come to infrastructure as a service
here's example I've chosen Amazon Web
Services and again remember
infrastructure as a service you don't
even have full control about your VM
because you use the ones from Amazon but
you have full control about the app
which you develop there are several
different providers in the meantime we
use Amazon Web Services here and Amazon
Web Services has different API so Java
for top net Python and so on and it's as
every other infrastructure as a service
provider
it offers especially services for
computing and for storing in the cloud
so these are the two main reasons why we
use infrastructure as a service if you
look for example at a Amazon Web
Services Java API in this example we use
the s3 service notice three simple
storage service this is just a no sequel
key value store in the cloud and this is
the Java API it's really complex but the
problem is this
lukovitch you have to write every time
when you wanted to create an application
and combine it with Amazon and of course
we don't want to write this glue code
all the time and so we use Apache camera
to integrate Amazon Web Services with
all our other technologies and here two
examples how we do this it's the same
concept as with every technology as I
mentioned no matter if Chinese HTTP or
here Amazon Web Services at first we use
a producer producer means we send
something to Amazon and stored something
in a cloud so it does not matter where
we start where our message comes from
this is a direct endpoint this means
it's a synchronous call in a picture
camera but here you can also use file
Jamis and all other components then we
use this message and send it to Amazon
into a bucket bucket is a Amazon
specific name or concept with my access
key and secret key and later if I want I
can of course also read my data back
from Amazon and here I use the endpoint
of Amazon ID from root and it's always
the same and then I can send it anywhere
else in this case I use a lock component
just to lock it I Fatima for this tool
first I want to show you the Amazon -
bot let's refresh it
so as you can see here there's no back
here at the moment a pocket is a storage
object where you can store your data and
files inside so now we will go to the
code so until now I use the charity SL
as you've seen here now I will use the
Scala DSL but it doesn't matter in the
end it looks almost the same so it's no
problem for you to understand because
it's very easy routes so here we can we
started to produce a route you've seen
it on a slide so I don't have to say
anything about it
this is my camera route and then I have
a test for it so this is my test it's
also in Scala
but again here as you if you have not
used a lot before you can call all of
your Java API s and as you see here it's
almost the same syntax you use a
template producer and send a message to
our consumer endpoint which is this one
and we have to send this message and
then here I use the Amazon API to check
if the message was really stored in the
Amazon Cloud so it's just some simple
storing here and now I check the content
and do some assertions and you write
your test as you write in other
applications with j-unit so let's run
this test
and SEC to test the screen and we can
also look back to Amazon application our
Amazon dashboard and as you can see he
here's our packet the bucket is the one
which we define in our route if it's not
already existing it's automatic
automatically created and here we see
the content this is the content which we
have sent in our message via versa sent
body exactly current date and now let's
open the text okay and here's our
content which we have sent so this works
here of course we use just similar text
and string because it's at K key values
datastore a no sequel datastore at
Amazon you can store whatever you want
here but for simplicity I use only some
text here and then it's the same for
consuming again so as you can see here
here we use from endpoint we read from
our bucket and send it to a file and to
a mock and as you can see here it's
commented out here but you can also use
it for here example Amazon sqs which is
a Kiwi service of Amazon and any other
service it's always the same it's you
have just to change the component and of
course any configuration if it's differs
and I've written also a test here it's
no surprise so you can see here you can
I create a mock and I check if the file
is read correctly and what I also check
if the size at Amazon is zero this is
because by default if you read data from
Amazon it is removed from the datastore
here of course be a configuration you
can change this so let's run this test
okay and the test is green let's go pick
two Amazon - bot refresh and as you can
see it is removed here so as you can see
it's really easy to connect to Amazon
Cloud we have a Pecha camera from any
other technology so let's continue with
platform-as-a-service
here I choose Google App Engine let's
remember platform-as-a-service
you don't even have full control over
you app so no control over VM and you
have no full control over your app and
also in a Java environment many many
different providers available already I
have chosen Google App Engine before it
because it was the first one and it's
probably the most stable one platform
as-a-service
has the advantages that you can easily
deploy it and you have automatic scaling
so you don't have to start your
instances by yourself as you have
instructors a service so with Amazon Web
Services you have to start your
instances by yourself and here it's
automatically done via your provider and
you of course have several restrictions
ones with Google App Engine are really
high for TR e class whitelist you have
many welcome
so it's really honestly it's really a
plea to develop for Google App Engine so
but nevertheless you have done you a few
services like pushing queue you have
queueing yourthe mailing images you can
store your data there too and some other
features and as I mentioned user hinder
on Google App Engine is the most complex
scenario for platform-as-a-service if
you want to use openshift or Heroku or
any other platform it's much easier to
integrate because you can easily
communicate with these solutions so
again here's an example of the API of
the Google App Engine we don't have to
understand the content really here but
it's again one glucose Google App Engine
was a servlet here and here we write
some code to do some queueing on Google
App Engine and as integration time demo
here I have chosen an example of
report which is already deployed to the
camel tutorials you can also look at it
and use it and as you can see in the
middle this is an example where camera
is really deployed in the cloud though
this is what I mentioned in the
beginning that you can use camelina
standalone application in a web
container or even in the cloud so here
the camel is running in the cloud
application and what we are doing we are
just calling from a web interface or pro
mathematically this endpoint here and
then there's some work done and we get
an answer with the weather as email so
this is take a code for your route this
is a little bit more complex root you
see here use this HTTP is a Google App
Engine component and also red sheet ask
so here's some tasks are done within the
Google App Engine and this is the camera
route for it I want to show you this
shortly as a team or tool so we are
doing two things in this route first we
have to test so we have two routes here
the first route is very look in we have
to login once first I can show the web
application you can here we can use the
web application to use this camel
application in the cloud but we can also
do it programmatically because with
Apache camera to integrate with other
applications as we will do here and
therefore we have to do a login first
rocky matically
so here we do our login and then when we
are logged in we can stand any other
requests to this cloud service to get
better information for our city which we
enter and as you can see here it's first
our log in with user and password then
we get our cookie after lick in login
and here's the template with a request
for the weather service a city we was
money Munich and then we send it to this
endpoint here
so this is a simple example how you can
communicate to the Google app and chin
so it's it doesn't really differ as you
see for Amazon use some end points so
I'm sorry if it is pouring with the time
but it's really the great thing about
camel that it's that easy that you can
integrate every technology with the same
concepts so we can switch over to soft
as a service soft as a service with
Salesforce remember I can soft as a
service you don't have any control over
your app you just use it and probably
pay for it there are also so many
windows in the meantime I use Salesforce
here it's one of the most prominent
windows for platform-as-a-service it's a
customer relationship management or
sales service and so on depends on Java
but the development is really strange if
you ever used it it uses Apex it's a
language which is 95 percent simulator
Java but it's not Java and I don't know
why I didn't use Java and if you develop
a developer dinner the tips of course
and what's really nice it's not really
nice but it's so if you compile your
code you compile it in the cloud so
that's no joke you cannot compile in
eclipse on your local machine you I
always have to come to deploy your code
on a cloud to compile it I've never seen
this before but um ok it doesn't matter
for the integration problems so here
again we have some Java API again some
clue code you would have to write every
time again and we again can use a pet
chicken in here so this is the last time
so once again concept always the same no
matter what you want to integrate if you
see now it doesn't matter if you want to
integrate infrastructure as a service or
platform as a service or soft soft as a
service it's always the same you enter
your end point here of your component
and then you enter your URI and that's
it you can consume from everywhere you
want and send it through Salesforce and
you can use Salesforce and read your
data and send it again wherever you want
if a team of what is to let's look first
at Salesforce the website so this is a
development edition of sales first but a
paid version looks almost the same so
here at the moment we have no articles
and sorry
here we have our producer test so in
this test case I have entered entered a
route directly into a test that's also
possible and here you see as you have
seen in the slides you can send data to
Apache camera here in this case we use
another enterprise integration pattern
the recipient list because the the URI
is a little bit more complex because we
have to use the body of the content here
with this expression language all it's
an advanced feature of Apache camera but
nevertheless in the end we read data
from anywhere and send it to apache
camel
so the test was successful and now we
look we look back at a website let's
refresh okay I just wanted to create one
I have not deleted one when trying out
it before before this session so here's
our here's our created article um the
time is wrong because I have had time
and time zone but it's was now one
minute ago and now as you can see you
have created it and we can of course
again also consume it
so from Salesforce and send it to a mock
so let's do that also
and as you can see you receive phone
message because there's exactly one
article here so this works too so now I
have shown you several examples of
integrating cloud services Patrick Emma
and as you have seen it's really easy
and the great thing is it's always the
same concepts including unit testing
there's now one more problem of course
epic ml does not have a cloud component
or component for every technology every
product now so sometimes you have to
create your own custom cloud components
and the good news is that is really
really easy with Patrick Emma and it's
also easier as well spring integration
I'm usually so that's another benefit so
how do you start here you always create
an archetype usually and we may have an
archetype which creates a skeleton for
you and then you I can have to implement
your integration logic once and then you
can use this component in your
integration problems you have a
component for class system lemon it's
really just for classes it's a component
it's an endpoint and a consume my
producer and I will show you this in the
code and you will see how easy it is and
maybe you guessed it because um there is
no Salesforce component available yet by
Patrick Emma so this is a component I
have implemented by myself and it's
really easy so I will show you the code
again here are the it's just four
classes the configuration classes
optional because I exported some stuff
in in this class but here's the
component the component first so here
you have general information here you
define how your route should look like
right and here for example I say that
you have to enter a custom object in
this case custom object is a sales for
specific name and I say in this case we
have to use article underscore
underscore see that's exactly what I
have here so this is custom Salesforce
logic and then I do some
if conditions checking and then I'm
going to the endpoint at the endpoint I
implement some stuff which is important
for both the consumer and the producer
of course for example here this will
create a connection so we have to log
into Salesforce set username and
password and implement that here so this
is the blue code that you write once and
then you can use it as you write it once
and then you can use it in your camera
routes all the time here I use the
endpoint and then I have to producer the
producer also has some sales for
specific code to put data in the cloud
and the consumer is the same here you
use the Salesforce specific query
language to read data from the cloud and
you I have implemented here once as you
can see and now let's go back to the
route which I have shown you before so
these four classes I had to implement
once and then you can really use
Salesforce this component in every of
your project and wherever you need it so
a lot of reduced efforts in my opinion
um and it's really a great and easy
alternative okay so of self also another
good alternative maybe you just have to
integrate a specific service only one
time or two times and you don't want to
create your custom component then you
can of course use other interfaces so
cloud service is usually in the meantime
of all cloud services of our rest
service some also of a sub service but
most use only rest at a time for example
Amazon Web Services house has already
deprecated its sub services and only
office rest services and you can also
use these and Apache camera really
easily as we can see here so here we
have again a from root and and wanna
send some data to Salesforce and here we
can use the HTTP component this is a
similar way to use HTTP and rest within
a camel root so you type don't even need
another HTTP client and Java which you
use
RS or whatever it's again an
implementation of an component within
camera you don't have to write any clue
code you just to hear your rest call and
you can read data and write data as you
can do with rest so and again here you
could use every technology here or here
and it's all the same concepts also with
rest if I can one more time oh it's the
last demo for today yes the root thing
it's the same as you see in the slide so
I won't go through it and you have your
tests and again as you see everything I
integrate I always tested with unit
tests and I recommend you should do this
too because it's really easy with camera
and automatic tests also for integration
problems are really the best solution in
my opinion and here we have two tests
the first one put some data into the
cloud in this case we I use chase in
here
so I write to chase in by my own and
then we read the data again and here I
use chase in the Java library so you can
do whatever you want in the end it's
important that you send Jason measured
message here at this endpoint though
that it is executed and as you see it's
always the same it was a massage which I
unit and that's it so let's run this
last test all
okay it's on a such narrow maybe I have
created too many too many articles here
I don't know yet but I don't want to
bore you here and as you see usually it
works I don't want to try to fix it now
okay so I've shown you a lot of
different examples how you can integrate
cloud services and so finally I hope you
did get the key messages let's recap
that again the cloud already arrived
definitely probably most of you will use
cloud services in next year's and it has
to be integrated it has to communicate
with other cloud services and also with
legacy applications this integration as
you've seen is already possible and
Apache can really helps a lot and the
main message here is it's the most
important thing about Kemalists
that it's always the same concepts no
matter which technologies or cloud
services you have to integrate and also
including unit tests so that's really
the key message of this talk so I hope
you did get this message and if you want
to start and I wet your appetite I can
recommend you this book had become an in
action there's a really good
introduction for starting of Patrick
hammer and Apache chemist open source
everybody can contribute so um it's
really great and so finally I thank you
for your attention and if you have
questions we can start now yes exactly
it's a child library you can put it into
your project so this is why you can use
it in a standalone application
application container it's just a shy
website you can edit via mail or just as
a one I'm sorry
float what do we want with or is it well
we surely will tooling of course you can
do it so you can you can do it
programmatically with Java or Scala you
can do it declaratively with XML or you
can do it with tooling for as I
mentioned that different vendors fuser
sauce which is bought by a pirate at now
and talent for example tie off a GUI
builder so you can create it with
visually
so you asked if it is how it would
nothing funny or or okay um well it
always depends on every component or
their specific use case for every
component and you can configure you most
of your components how you want to or
you want to do it so for example also if
you have for example a file example and
if several order items and want to
process it differently they have
different enterprise integration
patterns which solve this problem and
this is again of one more method caller
saw so there's always I used his case
and solution for every of these problems
so
how much overhead okay that of course
chemin is not much oh right it always
depends on which technologies you want
to integrate so if you use soap web so
this is where if a lot of pics ml and so
on so that's a problem but the order of
camel is not much so that's not a
problem in our cases we use huge
processing with file and Seamus and we
didn't see any difference between using
camel and not losing camera so that
shouldn't be a problem in normal use
cases
okay from you as I've mentioned maybe
you should also read my blog I think we
have some minutes I can open other
slides are there any other questions
before then I can show you two minute of
slides about Newell yeah
okay the question was when to use an
enterprise service person when an
integration framework so the integration
framework assessed okay so it's no hurry
thank you the integration framework is
as you have seen it's just a little bit
of code to integrator technologies and
an Enterprise Service bus offers much
more future so exam as I said for
example Business Process Management so
one part of the Enterprise Service bus
is also the integration framework so
several enterprise Enterprise Service
passes um use integration frameworks
inside so for example service mix and
tell any is be used apache camel inside
so apache at integration framework part
is just for integration and if you need
more like this is process management and
monitoring then you can use an ESB so
it's just more power but it's also the
same functionality of an integration
framework but more okay
okay so that the question was I'm what
if the service is not a cloud service a
web service so it's an internal service
or Java or whatever yeah that's also
possible so you don't have to use remote
calls or so they are example as you've
seen in the route that was to spin and
you can use Java beans inside and there
are components for example you can use
the VM component and so so it's also not
only possibility inside one VM so but
there's also a component I don't know
the name but you can use different we am
switching machines and communicate
between them so there are many different
components for all of these use cases so
there's no overhead through remote
computer communicating when you have
just local codes yeah yeah it's also
appropriate Sanyo and ok maybe I can
show you two minutes about the
comparison at Muller and spring
integration because I have slides with
which compare this
so I was it the slides are charming but
I'd hoped it's no problem for you so
it's not much texture what is I mean I
will just show you some slides of the
differences okay so they're also very
similar stuff it says here all have
tooling all open source so what about
Sprint integration first first spring
integration has much less adapters and
it's more difficult to create your own
adapters because there isn't even on
documentation there how you can do it as
I mentioned with camel are also a few
you lay there are types which you can
use to create it and then this
difference here is in my opinion one of
the most important ones spring
integration annually only have an XML
DSL and in my opinion the charity SLO
programming language to use as a much
better because they have better
readability and better support for
refactoring and so on now here comes the
spring integration guide I know
all right so maybe it will be improved
in the future so so I'm no in any of
other frameworks so it's okay for me
okay so let's look for example here at
this tears L of spring integration so
we'll compare dinner at a mule in a
moment so in my opinion this is no real
DSL it's really tough to read compared
to the other ones so remember the
charity is L where you know what's
happening when you leave read a Java
code and look at this one and then I
will show you the XML tears L of mule in
a second here is Nuala julia has an
advantage compared to camera later
several proprietary connectors so you
here you have connectors to ASAP and
typical and paypal and such stuff so
these are some components which you
would have to write with a Pecha cam at
first but it's only some one so it's no
support for SGI and muller so if you
want to combine it with
OSGi it's not possible with mule apart
with camel and it spring integration I
think and the DSL also is only excel and
as you see here at least this is a real
DSL in my opinion this at a camera XML
DSL looks almost like this one so you
can read it easily and this is what I
need from RT is L and remember again the
spring integration PL let's go back to
it again in my opinion this is not as
good to read not easy to read and so one
great thing about this integration
framework is that you can realize your
integration problems easily by modeling
and realizing them and if you look at at
ESL and it's tough to read and it's only
half as good in my opinion
but again that's my opinion so in you
can of course do it but I'm there's even
an spring integration connector for a
camel but usually it doesn't make any
sense because it doesn't make any sense
if you have an integration problem if
you use to integration frameworks for it
but if you have two applications which
all both use and integration premium you
can combine them of course too so
exactly but you can the question was if
you want to for example use the newly
connector for PayPal and another
component of camera but here I think you
are better if you use just one
integration framework and write one or
two components because as you have seen
it's really easy to write a component
for the example paper love as a REST API
is probably one day or two days to write
this component and if you use two
integration framework it's much
workaround and much more effort so I
don't think this makes sense and you
most use cases ok that's it thank you
for coming and if you have any feedback
write with Twitter Linkedin also thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
