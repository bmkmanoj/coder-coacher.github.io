product manager in the database team
here at Oracle and my team is
responsible for a bunch of storage and
performance related features in Oracle
database and want to talk today about
storage optimization for Oracle database
specifically advanced compression and
how it helps both save space and improve
performance for Oracle database and so
most of our customers are facing an
exponential explosion in the amount of
data they have to manage in the Oracle
databases one analyst projects that the
amount of data will grow by 50 X by 2020
but the number of IT professionals
available to manage that data is only
going to be one point five X so how are
you helping our customers solve that
problem well I'm going to show you how
advanced compression helps save space
inside an Oracle database by using this
demonstration here on the table so what
you see here is a representation of an
Oracle database block we have a block
header which contains metadata
information about the block and then
rows of data for a table within this
block and each of these rows has a few
data values so we have two rows here
with four column values each and
advanced compression what it does is it
D duplicates repeating values into the
header of the block replaces those
values with pointers so for example you
can see these four cubes here these four
column values are the same color the
same structure advanced compression will
put one of them into the header replace
that with a pointer and it will remove
the others and replace all of them with
pointers as well and this process of
course will end up saving a whole bunch
of space
in the block and of course it doesn't
stop with those repeating values you can
see these two values are the same so the
database will put one of them in the
header replace it with the pointer and
remove the other one and place it with a
pointer so now we've freed up a whole
bunch of space in this database block by
doing this deduplication process this is
all transparent to applications and to
users there's no nothing to change in an
application code or sequel statements or
anything like that and it saves a whole
bunch of space and as you'll see in a
minute it also helps improve the
performance of Oracle database when
accessing data in this compressed format
which I know it sounds counterintuitive
people assume compression means a
performance penalty with our compression
that actually means performance
improvements but first let's talk a
little bit about the space savings our
customers are actually reporting to us
so just a few few numbers from CSX
corporation for example they reported
they're saving about 21% of their
database storage requirements another
example is a Mara source Bergin they've
actually think under si P they've
reduced their storage footprint by 60
percent that's a pretty big number I've
got the same number from Saguna foods
they've increased their data storage
capacity by 60 percent with advanced
compression and finally Telecom
Deutschland has reduced their storage
hardware needs by 25 percent but also
they they see a lot of benefits in
reducing their overall operating costs
their power requirements licensing
requirements space requirements in
general so they've seen a lot of
benefits just in terms of space savings
now we should talk about performance
next and what are the performance
benefits of advanced compression and and
so to do that I need to show you another
kind of demo using using the same
approach that we did for space savings
so here's the original uncompressed
database block we started with when a
user tries to access any of the data in
this block Oracle database will read the
block from storage into memory and that
read operation or i/o will quickly copy
the block from storage into memory now
here's the compressed database block
with an additional row added we were
able to add this row because compression
freed up space in the block so now when
the database reads the block from
storage into memory more user data is
read into memory with the same amount of
effort as with the uncompressed block so
shown you how advanced compression can
help improve performance but let's talk
about a little bit about what customers
have told us about their real-world
experiences with advanced compression
and performance and so customers have
reported back performance benefits both
for queries which is not a big surprise
because as you've seen advanced
compression reduces the amount of i/o
but also for batch jobs for
transactional workloads so they seen
benefits anywhere from 10 fold for
certain batch jobs to 40 X for certain
query workloads or 20 or 30% depending
upon what types of workloads you're
looking at so overall advanced
compression can give great performance
improvements as well as storage savings
