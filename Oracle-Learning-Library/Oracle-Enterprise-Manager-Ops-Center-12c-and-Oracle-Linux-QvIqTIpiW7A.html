system that OS must have a community
that stands behind it but at the same
time must be accelerated towards
understanding the needs of a business
service Oracle Linux solves those
problems and more after examining the
features that are available to all
oracle linux basic and premier support
customers this global company decides
the solution aligned perfectly to their
operational best practices and bottom
line what was it about Oracle Enterprise
Manager opscenter 12c that attracted
this company to Oracle Linux let's take
a quick look the first thing this
company enjoyed was the robust discovery
mechanism built deep inside of op center
op center understands how to find the
assets in the technologies that mean the
most to your data center next they
enjoyed knowledge capture op center
provides deployment plans that allow you
to have multiple steps that bridge the
gaps between hardware and operating
systems very quickly we can configure
service processors configure raid
controllers update firmware and do a
very extensive OS and kickstart finished
script ops are also logically groups
boxes together here we'll see new
equipment has been discovered will very
rapidly deploy it with a click of a
button will provide IP address ranges
for the new equipment and by clicking
next will enter into a op Center
deployment plan here we can be as
complex or simple as we like this one's
going to check an unbreakable linux
kernel and also check case place
opscenter also allows us to investigate
a west performance issues op center will
group like boxes together and give
summaries based on cpu memory and
network usage op center will allow you
to dig deep into individual processes
checking out thread counts and anonymous
memory heap sizes op center will suggest
thresholds based on key performance
indexes op Center will allow you to go
back into history and look at individual
processes that were running on the Box
in the past it also provides an
exhaustive list of metrics here I can
dig into individual topics that are of
interest to me during troubleshooting
procedures through an integration with
enterprise manager Cloud Control ops
center is fully aware of what oracle
applications are running on your Oracle
Linux here we can dive into the target
we have a live event feeds to the
application of napi we can perform
performance analytics on individual
processes ops center is intelligent
enough to link the processes back to
their Oracle application target
compliance and security over the utmost
importance in your data center op center
allows you to get the most out of your
unbreakable linux network it
automatically subscribes to the vendor
provided network repositories and allows
you to do testing that makes sense to
your operations compare host together
plug into a third-party
government-sanctioned minor org CDE
repository pull into security scans do
time-based checking where the case may
be obstinate allows you the reporting an
interface to make sure you're compliant
reports are simple and easy to read
they're even simpler to take action
against op center will list out the
targets it will clearly identify what
changes are needed to be made on that
box based on the profile or the vendor
provided suggestions it will list out
individual changes in the lower part of
the screen ops center allows you to
compare your targets against the vendor
provided milestones such as updates here
we have a very complete list where we
can check our boxes against
those guidelines provided by the vendor
next obstinate will allow me to connect
to the serial console tables through the
lights-out management service processor
op Center will allow you to connect to
the serial console no longer a need for
expensive terminal server networks op
Center provides an event interface it
allows you to pass events to individual
admins annotate them insert best
practices plug into the my Oracle
support network automatically open up
service requests or open them up on an
ad hoc manner op Center allows you to
pool your resources together to define
that these Oracle Linux instances will
have a relationship based on their
shared storage the server pool that they
live in and the network they reside on
you can then leverage those server pools
in virtual data centers also known as
clouds here we're establishing an Oracle
VM x86 cloud it is made up of networking
storage server pools and accounts
accounts are assigned CPU memory and
storage allocations account holders can
login in a self-service manner and
create virtual servers these virtual
servers can be Oracle Linux instances
Oracle Linux instances based on server
templates Oracle provides an extensive
library of vm templates Marion Oracle
Linux and oracle applications together
in a very user-friendly manner all of
this and more provided through the cost
of your Oracle Linux support contract
now you can see why this global company
chose to leverage Oracle Linux and
enterprise manager ops center together
the solution offers a path to a highly
efficient data center
