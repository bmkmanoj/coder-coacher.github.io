hi I'm Steve friedberg curriculum
developer for Oracle glassfish I will be
demonstrating how to auto deploy a java
web application to oracle glassfish
server version 3.1 we have a collection
of java web applications that exist as
war or ear files in a labs directory
rather than go through all the possible
options for deploying an application to
a server we're going to do a quick and
dirty auto deploy auto deploy is fast
and easy typically used during the
debugging phase of writing code you can
always come back later to do a more
formal deploy the application we want to
deploy is hello two packages war file
it's a very simple application but could
represent the more complicated
application that a programmer is working
on glassfish three is already installed
here and has a single domain domain one
which is created by default here the
main procedure is to copy and remove war
files to and from the auto deploy
directory under the main domain
directory first let's prove that the
hello application is not there yet run
the AS admin command to list
applications notice that there is no
hello application now we're going to
switch to the target directory and list
the contents ignore the bundles
directory for the moment but notice
there are no files here yet what we want
to do is copy the application you wish
to do auto deploy from the labs
directory from the source to the to the
target directory the auto deploy
directory now when we list that by
default glassfish server checks every
two seconds for new files to deploy you
can tell if it worked by the presence of
an auto-generated deployed file with the
same name did it work let's repeat the
earlier command to see if it worked
using the up arrow and you see that
hello to is there now we switch to the
web browser and launch the newly
deployed application because the default
is to deploy it to the server the
default port is 8080 and the name picked
by the programmer is inside the war file
there the hello to application is
running to undeploy this application we
go back to the Auto deploy directory and
just remove the war file there now it's
gone you can tell if it worked by the
presence of an auto-generated undeploy
file with the same name there it is
let's repeat the earlier command that
listed deployed applications and you can
see that the hello app has been unda
ployed just to make sure let's retry the
web browser hitting the refresh button
as you would expect the hello
application is no longer available so in
summary so in summary the auto deploy
feature is enabled by default to use it
just copy Java war or ear files into the
directory and then delete them from the
same directory when you're done this is
a great feature for programmers doing
iterative testing while in the debugging
phase of writing code thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
