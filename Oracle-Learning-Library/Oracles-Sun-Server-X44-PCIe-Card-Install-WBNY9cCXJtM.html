procedures installing a PCIe card
important before performing this
procedure see the server service manual
and pcie card documentation procedure
overview to install a PCIe card and the
server prepare the server for service
following EST and components
serviceability requirements identify the
slot where you want to install the new
pcie card install the card and when you
are done return the server to operation
to prepare the server for service use
Oracle I'll on to power the server to
standby power mode you can also use the
operating system or the server front
panel power button before going to the
server use Oracle I LOM to turn on the
server's locator indicator the locator
indicator helps you find the server when
at the server create an ESD safe
workspace use a wrist strap and adhere
to component serviceability requirements
to prepare the server for cold service
disconnect the AC power cords from the
server remove the server cover the PCIe
card slots are located at the back of
the server identify the slot into which
you want to install the PCIe card the
server contains 11 pcie gen3 slots all
11 slots are available in a force vpu
server only the first six slots one
through six are available in a two cpu
server 9r by eight slots and to our x 16
slots slot 2 is reserved for the HBA
card see the service manual for
information on slot population order
unlock the PCIe card retaining bar
rotate it to its upright position and
remove the PCIe card filler panel from
the slot caution server over temperature
when you remove a PCIe card you must
replace it with another pcie card or a
filler panel install the new pcie card
into the slot return the PCIe card
retaining bar to its closed and locked
position to prepare the server for
operation install the server cover apply
full power to the
server and configure the PCIe card as
needed no you might need to allocate
option ROM for the card refer to the
