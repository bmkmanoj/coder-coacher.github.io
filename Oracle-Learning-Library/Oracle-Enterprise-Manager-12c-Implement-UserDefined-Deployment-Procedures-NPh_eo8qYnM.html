way to automate custom deployment
processes in this demo we will stage and
install some JRE six on a Linux 32
server to access user defined deployment
procedures go to menu and price
provisioning and patching procedure
library select the drop-down and choose
create new click on go go in a useful
name and description to automate this
process we require a single input from
the user this is the install location
for the JRE this input can be captured
or asked during the procedure interview
by using the procedure variables tab
click on the procedure variables tab
click Add row and add an variable for
destination location provide the
variable name the display name a
description and check the flag as
required this will ensure that the user
provides a value before submitting the
procedure once done click Save to save
this procedure now let me move on and
add the actual steps required to
automate this process every user define
deployment procedure comes with a
default phase a default phase in simple
words is a loop over a list of targets
as a prerequisite to creation of the
procedure we have uploaded a component
and a directive to software library the
component contains the JRE binaries
whereas the directive is the script
required to extract and install the JRE
let's start by adding a component step
to the default phase select the default
phase and click insert provide the name
and description for the step and choose
the type as library component wait for
the page to refresh and click Next
on this step we will search for the
component that has been created within
the software library enter the search
filter and click go select the component
that is required and check always use
latest revision
this will ensure that in future any
updates that are made to the component
are still active and picked up by this
deployment procedure once the component
has been selected click Next
to select the directive again search for
the directive by entering the name and
hitting Co select the director from the
software library and check always use
latest revision flag technics to
continue on this step
choose all defaults for directive
properties there is a single input that
is required by the directive this is the
destination location or the install
location for the JRE here we will use
the variable that we just defined for
the destination location the value of
this variable will be provided by the
user as part of the procedure interview
click Next to review all the details
that have been provided confirm your
inputs and click finish
next we will add a host command step to
check the version of the JRE for this
take the default phase again and click
insert provide a name and description
for the step and choose the type as host
command
wait for the page to refresh and click
Next here provide the command to verify
the JRE portion in the command we'll
make use of the variable that has been
provided by the user as input this is
the same variable that we define in the
earlier procedure variables step the
master variables created by users can be
seen in the section called procedure
variables here can form the command and
click Next review all the inputs that
have been provided and click finish to
complete this step now that our
procedure is ready we will click Save
and close our procedure has been
successfully saved and is ready to be
executed to execute the procedure ensure
that the procedure is selected and click
Launch this will kick start the
procedure interview as for step add the
targets on which you wish to execute
this procedure select a suitable host or
a list of hosts and click select click
Next to continue
provide the install location and click
make
choose a preferred set of credentials
choose the correct set of credentials in
this case we'll use named and click Next
select the schedule and the
notifications you wish to receive for
this demo we will use image it and click
Submit provide a meaningful submission
and click OK the page note redirects to
procedure activity and an instance of
the deployment procedure is submitted to
track progress of the procedure instance
click on the instance link the detailed
status of every step can be seen on the
instance tracking page refresh the page
manually until the procedure completes
once the procedure is completed click on
the status link to see the output of the
procedure we can see that the correct
version of the JRE has been printed and
thus the deployment is successful
