how to perform mass aging deployment
from am 12 10 3 using ad hosts Brazil
also known as aging potion in EF 1200
three you can perform mass agent
deployment using games Eli login into MC
live within the OMS home
first step in an agent deployment is to
make sure you have agent software
downloaded in self update run the list
add host platform hope to obtain a list
of platform for which the agent software
is available and downloaded in self
update
in this table we will deploy agents on
AIX and Linux so we have the required
agent software downloaded we can carry
on with the next step if agent software
for a platform on which you want to
install the agent is not available
download and apply a choosing self away
self update can be used in online and
offline mode let's begin with agent
deployment by running summit at host
world to learn about any work run
command against Allah health and the
wool let's try until I help with some
madad host
the heck will tell us about syntax and
usage of summit add hosts work through
examples
it also explains the syntax
note that parameters mentioned in
brackets are optional using em July you
can install fresh agents only on a
single platform in a single and host
session if you want to use MC Lyte to
install fresh agents on different
platforms then you must create a
separate add host session for each
platform let's run this command to
deploy agents on AIX forced en sol i
submit add host hostname platform the
platform parameter specifies the
platform ID every platform has a unique
platform riding associated with it and
the value is displayed in the output of
list add most work or it's also
mentioned in install kinda let some of
this command to deploy agent on AIX
platform now this results in an error as
the agent installed user Asia Iran is
not added in named credentials you have
two options now go to the am consoled UI
and and username password Indian
credentials or you can use NC live verb
create named credentials in this demo we
will use MC legwork create named
credentials to create named credentials
the user Asia Iran is now added to name
credentials we will retry the summit at
host we can run gift and host status
work to view the status of the ad host
session this will tell us status of
aging deployment on the host and
different stages of agent deployment the
last column error will show us a reason
of failure and recommendation if you run
get at ho status work with hyphen
hostname parameters it displays all the
ad whole session that the host is part
of let's try this coming so the output
of this command tells us that they were
to add whose session submitted on this
host one was on 24 jun another one is on
352 and put the deployment types were
fresh agent installs to know what all
steps are executed in each of the phases
like initialization remote requisites
agent deployment we can run another work
which is emc like add who status with
name and hostname in case of any
failures you can refer to the log file
location displayed in the output of this
command let's sum it another adverse
session to deploy an agent on on the
next host we need to know the platform
ID so we can execute the command angel I
list add host platform hyphen off in
this adverse session I provided the port
as 22 so that we can generate some
failures and try out different verbs
like continue ignore failed host and
retrying boobs let's run add host work
to view the status of this ad horse
session by running m'selle I get at host
status and session name let's clear the
screen in check the status again in this
demo we have submitted to add her
sessions if you want to see all the
advert session submitted from this OMS
then you can run this work emc ly list
add her sessions this will display all
the session history let's look at the
deployments that we submitted today
which are the first two on the top one
of the sessions that we submitted on the
Linux host is failed so let's go and
look into the remote perquisite why it
failed the output of this command tells
us why did the agent deployment on Linux
failed and it tells us very clearly that
the port is not available or it is wrong
if the agent deployment fails then you
have option to retry it using verb retry
add host verb and this verb has further
two parameters or options which is retry
using same inputs and update inputs and
retry so now we will retry this ad host
session again with update inputs let's
clear the screen so now we have we have
we tried this session with updated
inputs where we have not provided the
port value so the application will pick
up the available free post let's clear
the screen check the status of
deployment on AIX host this is still
going on so
pick up another session which is
successful and then I can show you the
details of the steps let's run into my
list advert session let's pick a one of
fat hoe session which is succeeded or
which have reached to the Asian
deployment stage so that we can see the
details of the steps clear the screen so
this session was submitted few days back
and we are using the warp gate at ho
status with session name and hostname
you can refer to the log file in case of
failure and the output tells us all
these steps that are being executed and
what is the status this is the end of
the demo thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
