connection from sequel developer to a
database in the Oracle database Exadata
Express cloud service we will then see
how to manipulate data in the database
using familiar sequel developer
operations in this example our local
workstation is an apple computer from
the exadata express service console
download and save client credential
files onto your local computer you will
use these credentials to connect sequel
developer to your Exadata Express cloud
database
exadata Express service console provides
a convenient link to download tools
among them sequel developer
the sequel developer link takes you
directly to the Oracle technology
Network page for downloading sequel
developer
download sequel developer to your local
computer and open it
in this example let's first connect to
an Oracle 11.2 database on our local
computer which contains the employees
table of the HR schema
now let us connect to an Oracle 12.2
pluggable database in the Oracle Exadata
Express cloud service as the HR user
notice that the connection points to the
current shell zip file that we
downloaded to enable sequel developer to
communicate with the cloud database
when we expand the sequel developer
object tree note that there are not yet
any tables in the HR schema in the cloud
database
using the sequel developer object tree
we can easily drag and drop the
employees table from the HR user in the
local Oracle database to the HR user in
the Exadata Express cloud service
database
a copy to Oracle dialog appears and in
our example we can accept the defaults
returning to the HR user in the exadata
Express cloud database we now have an
employee's table in the HR schema and it
has data
we can use sequel developer to run
sequel statements against this cloud
data and Exadata Express runs the newest
and best Oracle release Oracle Database
12c release to Exadata Express includes
advanced capabilities of Oracle database
Enterprise Edition such as the ability
to compress data using advanced
compression option and hybrid columnar
compression say that you are
anticipating the employees table getting
large so you want to compress it then
run an advanced compression statement
like this next say that you don't want
everyone who has access to the HR schema
to see everyone's salary so you want to
redact the salary column run a PL sequel
statement like this finally let's query
the employees table again to show that
redaction of the employee salary column
is being enforced
