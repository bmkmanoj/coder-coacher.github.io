ready to use Oracle mobile cloud service
to develop your first mobile app with
Oracle mobile cloud services mobile
backend you get features and platform ap
is that can send push notifications to
iOS Android and Windows Mobile devices
store application data in the cloud
using the storage API so it's protected
and easy to get at allow users to edit
and update resources offline and
synchronize with the server once they're
back online provide user login
capabilities and test real users and
roles gather usage data and generate
analytics reports monitor health and
troubleshoot problems when you create an
Oracle mobile backend it uses OAuth or
basic authentication to provide access
to the Oracle mobile cloud services ap
is you can associate your mobile backend
with one or more ap is for use with your
mobile app and you can create custom
functionality that is described by AP is
and implemented with no Jas and
JavaScript let's explore each feature in
depth have you ever tried to implement
push notifications in your mobile app it
can be a tough task mobile cloud
services notifications API has made this
simple we manage the complexity across
the Apple Google and Windows frameworks
so all you have to do is send the push
and blood us do the rest to register the
app choose the iOS Android or Windows
platform upload your Apple certificate
Google key or windows credentials and
the notification service will handle the
registration with the OS vendor add
client code using our client SDK and
you're ready to send where can you store
application data Oracle mobile cloud
service includes access to storage in
the cloud for easy secure access to your
data the storage API optimizes data
storage and retrieval cloud storage is
secured by role based access control to
make sure the right user
access to the right data how do you
enable your app to continue to work and
update resources when the user goes
offline even where there is little or no
internet connectivity your apps can run
seamlessly using the sink and data
offline component use the component to
pull data from the cloud and cache the
data locally so apps can continue to
work offline while offline users can
continue to edit and update resources on
their apps and then sync any local data
back to the cloud based on the
declarative policies once connectivity
is re-established the sink and data
offline component lets you fine-tune
data synchronization with a rich set of
declarative policies around fetch expert
eviction and update of offline resources
so you can optimize the performance of
your apps how do you manage users
securely the user management API makes
it easy for you to provide logging
capabilities for your mobile app users
the user management interface lets you
quickly configure and test real users
and roles for your mobile apps once your
app is out in the field how can you keep
tabs on how it's doing Oracle mobile
cloud service automatically gathers
usage data about your mobile app and
displays it in the analytics console the
analytics collector API collects system
event occurrences such as number of
users API response time and geographic
locations it also allows you to define
your own custom events to track the
specific patterns you want to see you've
coded a great app but you still need to
debug it are there tools to make
troubleshooting simpler the Diagnostics
console provides many tools to help you
troubleshoot problems a change in color
indicator light alerts you to the
overall health of the mobile backend it
prominently displays the level of 400
and 500 errors the API requests count
and API response time you can drill down
to get more information about each API
request such as the request method it
parameters and the elapsed time and if
that isn't enough you can view the log
messages which are correlated with each
API request to get fine grain
information to pinpoint the root cause
of any problem within minutes you can
set up a mobile backend with a rich set
of platform ap is that you can use to
quickly and easily develop and
troubleshoot your apps Oracle mobile
cloud service is the complete solution
for enterprise mobile application
development you can find additional
information in the Oracle help center
Oracle Learning Library and at Oracle
University thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
