curriculum developer at Oracle in
another video I showed how to request
and activate a trial subscription to an
Oracle cloud service in this video I
will show you how to administer a new
Oracle cloud trial subscription
including the management of users and
roles before we proceed let's pause for
a moment and view a diagram of the cloud
service provisioning workflow so that
you can get an idea of the different
roles and steps for requesting
activating in administering an Oracle
cloud service trial subscription the
first step is to order a free trial
subscription to an Oracle cloud service
by clicking a try it button on the cloud
oracle.com website as a trial requester
you are automatically assigned the role
of the account administrator for the
service next as the account
administrator you receive an automated
notification email to activate the
service while activating the service you
designate who will be the service
administrator and the identity domain
administrator a key task of the identity
domain administrator is to define the
users and the user roles that will give
users their access privileges this is
performed in the oracle identity console
of the cloud oracle com website the
identity domain administrator creates
users and roles for all of the purchased
or trial cloud services the role of the
service administrator is to develop and
administer a particular cloud service
using the my services application in the
oracle identity console of the cloud
oracle com website one important task is
to assign roles to each user of the
cloud service another task is to provide
all the cloud service users the URL and
signing credentials to access the
service here is a list of the seven
steps I just discussed another video of
the Oracle cloud service provisioning
process focused on the first four steps
will during a trial subscription and
activating a service this video covers
administration of the service including
the manager
int of users and roles keep in mind that
depending upon your organization size
and structure the same person can
perform several of these roles
in my role is the identity domain
administrator I will open the identity
console for my identity domain I open a
browser and enter the cloud oracle com
website I click sign in at the top of
the screen I make sure the correct data
center for my service is selected and
click Sign In to my services I enter the
sign-in credentials for my services that
I received in a welcome email from
Oracle cloud the my services application
appears displaying my new database
service to create users and roles I
click the identity console button roles
give users privileges within a service
let's examine the roles that are
initially assigned to me in the identity
console I select manage roles initially
it appears that no roles are defined in
my identity domain to see all the
predefined and custom roles that I can
assign to other users I click search a
list of roles is displayed here you can
create a sign revoke and delete roles
because we are looking at an Oracle
cloud database service the roles our
database related such as database user
database developer database
administrator and identity domain
administrator I'm ready to create a new
user note that only an identity domain
administrator can create user accounts
then either identity domain
administrators or service administrators
can assign or revoke roles for those
users in the identity console I select
manage users
no users are listed I click create to
create a new user make note of the
temporary password you assigned to the
new user the system does not include the
password in the automated email sent to
the new user you must communicate the
password to the user I receive
notification that the user was created
successfully and I click OK still no
users are listed to see a list of all
the user accounts in this identity
domain I click search a list of user
accounts for this identity domain is
displayed including my new user and
myself you can click the last name to
view detailed information about the user
the user details are displayed no roles
are automatically assigned to the user
you need to assign one of more roles
next I will sign a role to the user
click close to assign a role to my user
I select manage rolls again no roles are
initially listed to see all the
available roles to my new user I click
search
let's look at the list of roles the
identity domain administrator will see
all rules for all Oracle cloud services
in your identity domain the service
administrator will only see all roles
related to the services that he or she
manages in the identity domain I will
select database database user from the
list and click assign
now I need to enter my new users name or
a portion of his name in the search area
and click search
I select my user from the list and click
assign the role was assigned to the user
successfully I can click OK in addition
to manually adding users via the
identity console you can create a CSV
file to batch upload the definitions for
multiple users using a load users option
in the oracle identity console there is
another video that shows you how to
perform these batch uploads of users go
to the Oracle Learning Library and
search for the string how to upload
users in batch I created a user and
assigned him the role of database user
now I will find the URL to give this
user so he can access the predefined
sample application included in the cloud
database service I am still logged in to
the identity console with a high-level
privileges of the identity domain
administrator I go back to the my
services application and click the
details icon the details page has a
number of tabs I click the applications
tab to see the packaged applications
available in my cloud database service
there is one packaged application
provided the sample database application
I right click the Run button and select
copy link location to get the URL for
running this application this URL is
what I would give to my new user to run
this application while we are here
looking at the details of my service
let's look briefly at some of the other
tabs available in the Oracle cloud
database service the utilization tab
shows usage information such as the
amount and percent of storage space used
in the number of database objects in the
database schema the data export tab lets
you create an Oracle data pump export of
your data and data structures using a
secure FTP utility
the administration tab lets you write a
description of the service backup your
application Express applications and
lock out the service from end users and
developers let's summarize what you saw
when you create a user account you
manually assign a temporary password to
the user after the user account is
created Oracle sends an email notifying
the user that an account was created the
email provides only the users sign in
name in the name of the identity domain
after the user account is created either
an identity domain administrator or a
service administrator must explicitly
assign one or more roles to the user the
role controls access to applications
resources and services in addition the
identity domain administrator must
provide the temporary password to the
user provide the URL for the oracle
identity console to the user and provide
one or more service urls to the user
depending upon the service type the user
is allowed to access and that's it
you've now seen how to manage a new
Oracle cloud service including the
creation of user accounts and assignment
of roles I'm Rick green thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
