curriculum developer today I will show
you setting up your Java development
environment on Windows the first step is
to download and install the Java
development kit so I will point my
browser to Oracle comm slash Java from
this page you can see that there are
three types of Java development
platforms we have the Standard Edition
which is for desktop and browser the
micro Edition for consumer devices and
smartphones and the Enterprise Edition
for enterprise type applications today I
will be working with the Java standard
edition I will click the link and from
this page under updates choose download
it from under the Java SE 6 heading from
this page click the big Java download
button this takes you to the download
page where you select the platform for
which you are downloading and I will
choose Windows and I will agree to the
license agreement and click OK from here
you start downloading the executable
file locate the downloaded executable
file in your file browser double-click
the file and choose run to start the
installation this will take several
minutes to install
the second step is to set the Java
Runtime and environment variables so I
will go to start settings control panel
and choose Java from the Java control
panel click the Java tab and click view
to see the runtime environment settings
and you can see that for the user the
settings are set to the new Java
installation of 1.60 underscore to four
and if I click the system tab it also
shows the new Java installation of 1.60
underscore to four so I can click OK out
of this dialog and click OK out of the
panel next I need to go to the system
properties dialog from this dialog I
will click the Advanced tab and click
environment variables this is where I
can set my class path so I will
highlight the class path click Edit and
I will type in my new Java installation
so I can separate this with a semicolon
so I will type the semicolon C colon
backslash programfiles backslash Java
backslash jdk 1.6 zero and escorting
slash bin will click OK and click OK
again and once more to close out of the
properties the third step is to create
and run a simple java application so I
will go back to Oracle coms last Java
choose Java SE click the documentation
tab choose tutorials go to the Java
tutorials and from this page I will
scroll down to the getting started
section click that link and I want to
create the hello world application and
from this page I need to choose my
platform which is Windows and now from
the hello world
I want to create a source file this
source file is what I can use for my
java application follow the instructions
to create your source file finally I get
to run my first java application so in a
command terminal
I will CD to My Documents and CD to Java
app and I will list the contents of this
directory and you can see the hello
world app dot Java file that I just
created so I need to compile this file
invoking the java compiler with java c
space filename which is hello world app
Java and it's compiling now I want to
verify that it compiled so I will list
the contents of my directory again and
here it is here's my hello world class
file which is my compiled application
now I just need to run it so I will
invoke Java type hello world app and you
can see the results of my application
hello world congratulations you are now
