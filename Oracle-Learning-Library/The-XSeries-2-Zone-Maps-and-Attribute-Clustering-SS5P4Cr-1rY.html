Oracle and I'm going to talk to you
today a little bit about zou maps and
attribute clustering these features are
new to 12c is specifically 12 102 and
they're really targeted at larger
databases vldb data warehousing type
environments they designed fundamentally
to improve query performance and
scalability too and they do that by
reducing the amount of data you need to
read to satisfy particular queries so
we'll go into a little bit about the
type of queries I'm talking about and
then how we how we solve those sorts of
problems it's worth saying right at the
outset that these these features are
transparent to the applications so
you're not going to have to start
rewriting queries or anything like that
they are they fully transparent think of
them rather like compressional
partitioning their attributes of tables
and storage structures that are just
used by queries are transparently used
by the Oracle optimizer to improve
things and what I'm going to do is start
by looking at Harry access data in an
Oracle database and then from then on we
can see pretty clearly how we can
optimize things and make things better
so at the very basic level if we start
with a table the easiest way of looking
for Rose and matching a particular query
simply to read all of the rows scan the
entire table so that's a table scan of
course so in particular with analytical
queries this works really well so we go
select from our table for example
different regions in our sales table for
example California will read through our
table looking for the Californian rose
and that matches our queries so a table
scanning those circumstances can be
pretty good the overhead of looking
through all the rows might not be too
high it might be acceptable for a
particular query because we're looking
at most we need to look at most of the
roads anyway in transactional systems
that's not necessarily the case so for
example if we need to look at a
particular sales transaction we're only
going to maybe pull one
rose from the sales table if that is the
case we're in a different situation
because the scan in that case is is a
big overhead we're looking at all the
roads rather than one or two that we
want and of course typically in a
transactional system we have indexes so
we create an index and that's great for
the transactional system because we're
looking at a particular transaction we
go through the index and hit the single
row that we need so it's nice and quick
in the analytical case it's not quite so
straightforward because in there in
there if we go through the index we're
going to be reading through the index
fetching a row renew the index fetching
another wrote one at a time so that in
fact can be worse than using a table
scan luckily for us of course we don't
generally need to worry too much about
this because the optimizer the Oracle
optimizer knows the best planning will
know whether an index an individual row
fetch is a good good idea or whether a
table span table scan itself is better
so we leave that to the Oracle optimizer
but that's the sort of choice it makes
underneath the covers for us so what if
we need to improve the performance of
the scanning query so we have a query
that's going to scan our table but we
wanted to run faster what options do we
have for that but what we could do is
simply scan more quickly so we can for
example throw infrastructure at it use
something like Exadata which can scan
Rose extremely quickly so that's one way
of achieving that another way we can do
that is to run parallel query so what
we're essentially doing now is reading
each piece of the table in parallel so
we'll be using a process to read that
part this part this part this part of
the table so the net result is that will
have better query performance by
essentially throwing machine resource at
it another approach one that's going to
be familiar to a lot of you is Oracle
partitioning so if we use partition
pruning what we can essentially do is
use the database to organize rows
together so for example if we partition
our sable sales table by state and we
search by state we know now that we only
need to search one region of the
one partition of the table so that's a
really good way of reducing the amount
of data we need to read in order to
satisfy those sorts of queries what if
we need to go a bit further than that
what if we could just target really
small regions in the table so in other
words we let's in this case assume we
have a sales table and that's
partitioned by date so we have maybe
quarter one quarter to quarter three
quarter four and so on well if we now
want to search by California for example
but we want to target that scan to a
small region we can now do that and
that's exactly what zone maps before
zone maps will enable you to target
transparently the regions of the table
and scan those regions that are for the
particular Rose we're interested in so
bottom line that's what so maps are for
so how does that work well what we can
do is if we take a table and divide it
into zones and against each of those
zones we remember the minimum and
maximum state values for each of those
zones and then we say search for
California we know we can skip the zones
that don't include California so in this
case forever zone for Alabama to
Delaware we know California
alphabetically is between Alabama and
aware so that we know that we can skip
other zones that maybe have different
different letters of the alphabet that
not encompassed by California so now we
can target a California search just at
that particular zone so we can skip the
rest of the table so it's a really great
way of zeroing in on the data that we
need to find so some of you will be
familiar with extra data storage indexes
which do a very similar thing they do
remember for particular regions of disk
the minimum and maximum column values so
for example in our sales table you may
remember the minimum and maximum value
state for example so again Alabama to
Delaware
and then the smart scan will only read
that part of the disk that represents
that contains those rows so how has 0
maps different to that and what do they
add and it's worth pointing out at this
point in fact that zone maps do work
very well with storage indexes they do
work together so they are complementary
technologies so they're not working
against one another but let's look now
as somewhat more complex example and
more real-world example in fact so now
we have a sales table and a dimension
table regions so what we have now is a
query that is going to query for example
again California but now California is
made up of multiple regions and
importantly there is no longer a state
column in our sales table so now we have
to run our query match the relevant rose
in the dimension table and get a bunch
of region IDs and those are the region
ideas we're going to scan for in our
sales table so we're going to at the
basic level read through an entire sales
table looking for the relevant region
IDs that match California how do we fix
that there's no there's no capability in
this case for the storage index to
eliminate rows based on the search for
California other than via the region
ideas so that's exactly what the zone
maps give us the ability to do so now
what we're doing is dividing the at
table into regions or zones that contain
the our particular region IDs that
represent maybe California Delaware
Alabama and so up throughout our table
that's what the zone map gives us the
capability of doing and in fact it works
as somewhat wider than that so in a star
scheme a typical star scheme we have
sales products regions x channels those
kinds of dimensions the zone map gives
us the capability of when we run queries
using those do
from dimensions against our sales table
we can still target zones within that
fact table so that's what zone maps
gives us the ability to do that so just
to summarize now that zone maps record
the minimum maximum values for specific
attributes and you can those attributes
can be from dimension tables or they can
be the from the fact table itself you
can choose so it gives you the ability
to group together Rose depending on
attribute values taken from star schemas
or taken from your sales table so
actually clustering is a table property
so we alter table and attribute
clustering and at that point the rows
that are associated for example with
California will be grouped together so
we actually order Rose dependent on the
values the attribute values in our
dimension tables that are around our
fact so in this case if we for example
have California we can make sure that
all of the region ID is associated with
California actually are together in the
table so we might have region ID 1050
1,400 but we can be sure that they can
be grouped together because we're using
attribute clustering so actually be a
clustering gives us a way of grouping
together our rows in our sales table
dependent on all these dimension
attribute values or attribute values
using the fact table itself attribute
clustering is a property of the table so
when you add it you don't immediately
reorder the rows so that rose stay in
place so you add the attribute
clustering the row stay where they are
if you want to reorder existing rose you
can move the table or the most common
use cases to move a table our partition
at a time so your move partition one
partition to partition three and as you
do that the rows will be reordered for
you so that's what so essentially it's a
way of retrofitting attribute clustering
if you like the other thing worth noting
in fact is that the zone map itself the
with materialized Oh map
no map itself is a very compact
structure it's a small data structure so
it has the advantage over an index for
example by being very small so for sure
if you've got a lot of indexes that you
are using to optimize queries and those
indexes are not particularly selective
then look at zone maps they're a very
good way of reclaiming some of that
space from your database so the good way
of getting your dependency if you like
an index is down and reclaiming that
space giving you more capacity to store
actual useful data so again if you look
under pressure on on volumes and you've
got a lot of indexes so maps are really
worth looking at to give you an
alternative to selecting and picking
Rose particularly in those sort of
analytical type queries very quickly and
effectively so to summarize and if you
want to speed up your queries if you've
got increasing data volumes or
increasing requirements for concurrency
and you will want to say reduce the
number of indexes you depend on your
database is large so data warehouses
vldb those sorts of applications look at
zone maps with attribute clustering they
definitely able to help you in those
sorts of environments where do you go
next for more information a very good
place to start is the Oracle 12c data
warehousing guide as lots in there
there's two chapters dedicated to zone
maps and attribute clustering so you'll
find lots of syntax examples in there
for example if there's a lot in there
too to digest if you want more syntax go
to the online learning library there's
actually a little work through course
there for you to try out these features
so if you want to get some hands-on
without having to read up on the syntax
it's all in there for you so that's
about it for me and thanks for listening
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
