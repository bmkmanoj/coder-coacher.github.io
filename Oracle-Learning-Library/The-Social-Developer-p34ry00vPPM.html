I'm Beethoven hood I'm from Belgium from
a little place count called scone are
the literal translation is beautiful
earth I'm in technical project leads at
real Dolman consultancy firm in belgium
i have a blog triple w peter converter
calm and you can find me on twitter if
you want first of all i would like to
ask everybody move a bit closer it's the
last talk of the other day we're all
tired it's easier for me to talk to you
guys if you just a bit closer it's about
being social so come on watch and i'll
be giving some stuff away so if you're
closer to me it's easier for me to give
it away thank you so much first off i
have three questions for you guys
actually four questions for you guys and
girls whose developer Lisa friends
fantastic who's a manager okay some
managers welcome now who's happy perfect
and who's tired well welcome what's the
social developer actually it's an ID at
our top about one and a half years ago
and it's an idea I want to share it as
many people as possible so I thought
well I'll just send it into Java one and
we'll see what it gives a social
developer in my ID is somebody who wants
to teach somebody who wants to learn but
also somebody who isn't afraid to listen
to people who isn't afraid to speak up
who isn't afraid of his managers who
isn't afraid of his bosses or whatever
you want to call it its social developer
is somebody who wants to have fun at
work a fun with his team with her teen
social developers actually your are
already social developers you'll never
be the perfect
social developer which that's impossible
but you can strive to become better and
better and better it's an idea I have
I'll be explaining it today at least
I'll try and I would love to have your
feedback afterwards so when we're
starting with questions please give me
your feedback I need it so this talk is
about you guys and girls it's not about
me I'll just give an ID and then I hope
you will think about it and you will do
something with it this is my son lay
under is 21 months old and I've taken
this picture because it shows the joy
and wonder of little child everything in
this world is new they're amazed white
with everything that he sees a car it's
like Oh daddy look he sees a plane Oh
daddy I spoke with him on skype this
morning it was like Daddy America
because he can't really say full
sentences but ok it's trying and well
it's amazing to see the joy in his face
and when we all were likely under and we
were small you were amazed at the world
he wanted to become astronauts firemen
doctors who knows I don't think anybody
wanted to become a manager or developer
when he was 2 or 2 years old as be
honest but then well where did that joy
go where did the Wonder go where did I
did we lose it because now well we are
depressed we have to go to work every
day just looking forward to the next
vacation that when we can go away why
how did this happen well let's try to
find out
the roots to being a social developer is
different for each and every one of us
it's not a paved highway 10 lanes same
direction everybody does the same thing
and we'll get there no you each and
every one of you has to create its own
route its own direction in life if you
let somebody else the start decide what
you do with your life you aren't living
your life somebody else is living your
life for you so you shouldn't be doing
it our roads they can cross each other
we can meet we can drive sometime
sometime in the same direction and then
we just split up again but it's not a
payload you have to make it you have to
create it you're the best person to do
it because well who knows you better
than yourself this is a picture I found
in the internet when I was searching for
there is no I and T well it seems there
is one it's a mantra I heard at
University all the time well you can't
have eyes in a team a team has to be
comprised of people who are replaceable
so you don't have bottleneck so you
don't have people who are too important
for your team too important for your
product for your company well does
 if you have a team but people
will have exactly the same skills or
exactly alike then you get something
like this ok yeah it's a group of people
and yet it can do stuff but the best you
can hope for is mediocrity they will
never excel at anything your team won't
be the best at anything because they
have to be exactly equal i have an
example actually two examples from teams
with very different personalities who
when combined become bigger than the sum
of their parts this one dat k come on no
it's it's from the 80s it was when i was
young it was like oh I want to be like
ba or monali like Murdock just a crazy
guy or I love it when a plan comes
together these guys lesbians are very
different
they have very strong personalities but
when you combine them they are true
excellent team and a more modern version
Avengers well in Europe so I'm from
Europe but you already knew that we
don't really know all those superheroes
so it's more like an American thing but
I've seen the movie recently and well
you have superheroes they all had their
superpowers in ellicott whoa he's
amazing but if you combine them in a
team and a true team they become even
better so that's the Avengers and
actually looked up baseball this morning
on Wikipedia because I was thinking
about well these are two fictional teams
but not real life teams are in
television and we all know television
isn't real not even the real shows so I
was thinking about baseball in Europe I
have no idea to play it but I've
searched on wikipedia and there every
player is important but not but they
have all have the different skills
you've got a picture you've got the
outfielders infielders stuff like that
so if you combine those guys they become
excellent teams so now working in such a
team how do you do it how do you work in
a team with different personalities well
you have to listen to people really
listen not just yeah you're saying that
but I'm thinking this now you have to
really listen appreciate different views
you have to you don't have to be afraid
to talk with somebody don't have to be
afraid to speak up to if you see a
problem to notice it to talk about it to
tell your team members well look I have
a problem let's find a solution together
that's where complexity
also building a team building a team
it's not about having one team building
event each year know if you have to
build your team on one day of 65 days a
year you've got the problem you will
never have it true team now building a
team is something you do each and every
day every day you get up in the morning
and you say you're going to say to
yourself well today will be a better day
than the last day I'll do something new
I'll try something new with my tea and
even sometimes you have a problem
sometimes there are people who don't fit
in your group who are actually a problem
themselves not because they want to but
because just the personalities don't fit
that's possible at the moment well we
just say well you have to work with
these guys off with these girls well
it's a lose-lose situation he or she she
isn't happy because everybody hates them
because it doesn't work out and the team
well they just right it doesn't work we
all know that so don't be afraid to
actually move people out of a team to
create true team maybe if you give them
something else to do in your company
maybe if you move into another group of
people they will feel more comfortable
they will become a better person a
better more social developer and your
team your group will become closer
they'll say well now we have our true
team so don't be afraid to make
difficult decisions like that to talk
about difficult decisions like it it can
be a win-win situation so you've got
teams and well in those teams you have
to have people otherwise yeah well you
missed the point those people that's you
those people you your worst to be
invested in
the best investment you can make is an
investment in yourself because it will
last a lifetime if you invest in
yourself you're not self centric because
you're also thinking about if you feel
better with yourself you'll be a better
colleague you'll be a better friend I'll
you be a better family member better
husband father mother daughter son you
should really not see in Belgium we have
a bit of a problem way that we always
think you're always taught don't think
about yourself if you have an ID don't
speak up be quiet somebody else will
will tell you what to do don't believe
in yourself well that's wrong you should
believe yourself you should say well I'm
me and I'm proud about it and I'm
special because you are I once stole
somebody well I'm normal normal and
everybody else isn't it's no problem
it's not in my view it is but I like
people who aren't normal so perfect also
the sometimes say well yeah but your
manager he's more than you he's your
manager he's your boss he knows better
but well that's I hope I can
say the word here well I film
Europe so never mind we always say it
say stuff like that it's your manager
well in the morning he wakes up or she
wakes up first thing you have to do is
well go to the bathroom just the same
like everybody else and then they have
to get their clue children dressed for
school get dressed for work fine time to
have a decent breakfast which gets
sometimes be a problem exactly the same
as us normal developers or whatever you
do do there are people too
why should you do it also because it's
fun it's fun to invest in yourself me I
actually did something special i went to
Weight Watchers I lost 17 kilos it was
an investment for me nobody else told me
you have to do it but it was something I
want to do for myself and now I feel
better I'm I have more energy Henry I my
family says well now we have you you
aren't so sad anymore you aren't
depressed anymore you're more fun to be
around my friends say the same it's
about having fun it's about having fun
with your family your friends your
co-workers it's about having fun with
total strangers like here javaone so how
can you do it actually there are several
courses you can follow to be more
optimistic to believe in yourself those
are all mostly excellent a couple of
tips it's a bit morbid but you have to
think about what do you want people to
say on your own funeral do you want them
to say well he was excellent in world of
warcraft was like amazing or do you want
them to say well he told his people java
something like that or if you're a
teacher teacher well she taught 10
generations of children how to read and
write what do you want what to do with
your life how do you want to be
remembered that's your vision and then
you can start wondering how can I create
this vision how can I get there and you
can just take those little steps try
doing it maybe it can be well actually I
don't want to be a developer anymore
I'll go do something else why not it's
your life it's your choice of course you
have to keep an account your family your
responsibilities it not so it's not just
you can do well I'm off goodbye
everybody I'm going to do to discover
something new somewhere in the Brazilian
rain forest I have no idea no something
else you can do something
little bit easier is get up in the
morning walk to a mirror mirror and say
well today is going to be a good day
simple as that believe in yourself or
you say well today I'm going to do
something different I'm going to do
something new those are all small steps
you can take to just have more fun in
your life to have to be investing in
yourself don't be afraid to invest in
yourself you're worth it trust me
management very important in the
companies they aren't aliens your
managers that's a problem with the word
manager is this one if we think about
the manager we think about somebody
within control is not managing his
micromanagement is telling you what to
do when to do it and how to do it well
that's not exactly how you have to
manage creative people like developers
it's a bit well I don't know if you know
Daniel pink you wrote a book about
motivation it's called drive and
actually is telling about the
carrot-and-stick principle so you have
the words if you do something right will
be punished if you don't do it right it
was invented in the 19th century because
19th century you have lots and lots of
factories lots of work is doing very
simple repetitive things so if you said
well if you can do this 100 times in an
hour i'll pay you more and if you only
do it 50 times an hour of fire because
it's just the same repetitive task the
problem now in this century is it all
those repetitive tasks they have been
automated now we have creative tasks
especially in software developed its a
creative process there's no fixed number
of steps you have to take to create a
new application it's the door to it's
something more special it's creative
process you have to think out of the box
one of those buzzwords but if people
start to micromanagement you manage you
it won't happen so Daniel pink says you
have to actually just let your team do
their work set a goal together with your
team don't tell them how to do don't
tell them when to do it with whom to do
it just set the goal and watch them go
and only support them ask them what do
you need when do you need it and how do
you need it help them out with that and
watch them excel on what they do that's
how we should motivate our teams are we
should lead our teams as managers and
it's also what we as developers should
try to create an RT and should try to
teach our managers it isn't always easy
I know but just keep on trying little
steps to time baby steps and we'll get
there and actually Daniel talks about
three very different skills you have to
create for your developers for your team
it's about autonomy being able to choose
with whom they work how they work and
how to do it it's about mastery but
letting people choose their skills and
supporting them in it and it's about
fulfillment telling you people why they
are doing it not just tell them I want
to have a 1000 for Oracle firms ready by
next week no tell them why you need
those firms tell them the bigger picture
maybe it's for cancer research maybe
it's for helping African farmers connect
better to weather stations so they can
monitor the weather so they know when to
harvest their crops and stuff like that
if people know the bigger picture
they'll be more motivated they can say
well if I can do this then I'll help
those people or help these people and
they will be create more creative
because they know okay maybe I should
try like this or maybe if I talk to
those guys well they can give me another
view of this problem so those are three
principles he explains in his book
a good read it's not tootin to take so I
would recommend it drive by daniel pink
and it's a way in which managers can be
more social can create an working
environment for a team to excel to grow
for people to grow and for people to
have fun don't be afraid to have fun at
work don't be afraid to try to have fun
at work search phrase me at my work I
try to play board games with my
coworkers I actually have some here to
give away later so those who has the
first questions they can get a board
game it's something you can do over
lunch it's something totally different
something social and something easy to
do but it will you help you create your
team help you create a feeling of being
together working on something important
having a vision how can managers do this
what are the next steps well why
starters read a book it's a very good
book then start thinking about how you
as a parent are raising your children
you know when they're 18 years old you
will have to start letting them go you
have to you still love them you still
want to support them but you can't keep
controlling them you're adults they can
do whatever they want so how can you you
as a manager should maybe think about
your team as grown-up children support
them love them help them sometimes
discipline them a bit like a what the
hell are you doing but be kind be
generous listen don't be afraid to truly
listen don't be afraid to change the way
you work now well what can you as a
developer do when you notice a problem
when you notice well I want to change
something but how can I do it you always
have four options three popular ones and
one not so popular one I don't know why
first I'll talk about three popular ones
it's the first one is the
just don't see anything just keep quiet
keep a low profile while you feel
miserable because the problem won't go
away and you'll yeah you'll not enjoy
your work anymore you'll not be as good
in your work anymore so actually it's a
lose-lose situation it's a loose for you
it's a loose fit company second option
is well well I'll find an old company
i'll do i'll go do the exact same job at
a different company i can guarantee you
you'll get the same problem in two years
okay third solution go to a completely
different job maybe become a
professional gardener become a
professional music player knows maybe
you can find your true job to do to live
calling maybe not you don't know or you
can choose the fourth option let's talk
about it talk about this with your team
talk about it with your manager but talk
about it assertively try to think about
the solution before you even start
talking about the problem maybe the
problem is noticed by other people too
maybe your manager manager will say well
I actually have the same problems or
maybe your team members will say that
and even if this is if this doesn't work
you still let the three other options
you choose from but at least you will
know I'm not afraid I've spoken up I've
tried my best so I already Ted be
assertive don't be aggressive don't
start calling outs don't start yelling
at people don't such thing I want this I
want this no think about the other
people be responsible but speak up
believe in yourself don't be afraid also
don't be afraid of failure failure
doesn't exist it's a lesson you just
haven't learned yet believe in yourself
and you'll do just fine this is nice
good life begins at the end of your
comfort zone actually it's true if you
always live in your comfort zone that
never experienced the highs of life or
the lows of life for me this is one of
the highs of life I've been to Java one
before but this is my very first time
ever as a speaker on a conference so it
was like okay i'll send it in and when i
got the acceptance mail it was like oh
yeah finally something then I send it in
for dev ox which is like 20 miles from
my doorstep and it got declined so that
was a low for me but well if I wasn't
wouldn't have gone out of my comfort
zone which would be java development I
wouldn't have had highs and lows I would
have been here so i think i'll still
think it's a win-win it's also what i
meant with do something different each
day do something new each day go a bit
out of your comfort zone maybe if you
really want to do something new you can
start BASE jumping skydiving I don't
know that's too much for me but well
it's your own it's your part you can
choose it so what I would like you guys
and girls to do is go for it I set the
world on fire think about ard I've been
promoting here talk about it talk about
it with different people not just with
your coworkers talk about it with your
family your friends talk about with
people you meet here at javaone you meet
a new terrain you meet in the airplane
and listen truly listen don't just say
well yeah you're talking you and I'll
think i'll be thinking about what you're
saying but not really don't be afraid
you might learn something this is what I
don't want you to do I don't want you to
close your eyes do not see I want you to
look around I want you to learn from
other things you see I want you to speak
up don't be silent talk about it be
brave don't be afraid life is too short
to be afraid and I want you to listen
truly listen to what people have to say
not just me but everybody else there is
a bright future ahead we all know that
were what i am saying here is common
sense but it just doesn't happen in our
communities at the moment in our other
work at the moment we all know this and
it's up to us to change it to make it to
make a brighter future it's up to us to
inspire people if I can aspire one
person today or even this week when
talking about this i'll be happy it will
be a success for me and i hope i will
inspire some people who knows it's about
being happy don't be afraid if you want
to be happy don't be afraid to try to be
happy wonderful quote by albert einstein
everybody's genius but if you judge a
fish by its ability to climb a tree it
will live it will live its whole life
believing it's stupid it's actually very
ingenious it's also the problem with our
school system all our children have to
be exactly the same they have to learn
exactly the same things but some are
more better in mathematics others are
better than sports why shouldn't he be
able to excel in those things be a
genius and those things and that hero
other things slide and another fantastic
quote by a guy I admire enormously Steve
Jobs have the courage to follow your
heart intuition this somehow know what
you truly want to become to bet is that
now what rob was a wonderful time well I
hope they've planted little seeds at
some of you and I hope it will grow out
into a mighty tree like you say we'll
see
and once more try to find the joy in
life do not be afraid life is too short
any questions first one to ask question
gets the t-shirt and the game come on
I like got here yep something saying
like ghosts America today and today I'm
going to something new the phone I think
that if you can't do something that they
just because you don't retire anything
you're being lived by the process of
yeah I know what you mean so you're
actually saying if I don't have the time
to do something new do I have to feel
bad about it because I don't have the
time do I have to live the process and
otherwise I'll won't become a better
social developer or a better person
don't let the process leave you just if
you don't have the time okay it's no
problem well maybe you can think about
something really small like well holding
open the door for somebody it shouldn't
take much time each day it can be a
fraction of a second it can be well I'll
smile to complete stranger he'll fill
the tire feel good well I did something
new today I got a bit out of my comfort
zone you shouldn't always start well
today I'm going to start BASE jumping
tomorrow I'll jump from a bridge stuff
like that you can do it if you want and
if you have the time and the money okay
no problem but most of us we have a life
we have work with responsibilities focus
on small things find those and start
with those start with baby steps they
don't all have to be enormous steps and
if you feel sad some days no problem
that's life you can't always be happy
it's impossible if you're always happy
well you've got a problem trust me and
the other questions and you can come up
later in the Susa teachers choose a game
yes big
sure
race to myself
so many different
developing
store
God said to myself
struggle struggle
more
Oh
thank you for sharing actually it's part
of the story for me to comment 22 years
ago my wife had a burnout our son was
born so it was like okay I have to
straighten my priorities and I have to
live in the moment also so was also
thinking about is it's not about a nap
it's about something more personal but
thank you for sharing a story so you can
come and get the game and a t-shirt if
you want somebody else come on I won't
bite promise share something yes please
could you speak up a little bit
how can you make your co-workers see
things differently yeah lead by example
talk about it listen to their problems
maybe you together you can find
solutions it's it's a process it it
might take years it might take you it
should take a lifetime because well you
can never master something like this you
can never say well now I am a perfect
person or perfect developer or perfect
social being it's something that you
start on but you can never finish it's
like they say it's not the destination
that's important it's a journey and it's
by starting on the journey it's about
giving example the doesn't people might
become inspired might say well let's try
this one it won't always happen you will
you will have failures well don't be
afraid to have failure it doesn't exist
it's a lesson you haven't left yet just
well my co-workers there's some of them
have the same problems and I just try to
talk with them inspire them listen to
their problems find out why do people
come to work as drones don't they like
the word don't like the job don't like
the manager do you want to do something
different what is that passion how can
we use their passion in the job so the
job become becomes more a part of their
life than just a nine-to-five thing to
get enough money to really go living
because not the first time though do you
have to keep asking and you have to
listen sometimes they will say something
if you listen really carefully you will
hear something else it's about actually
all my wife is a psychologist so she
told me something so stuff like that
it's about asking the right questions
and listening to the right to the
answers it's something you have to learn
there are courses you can follow that
you can try to get a PhD
in psychology and then you'll probably
be able to do stuff like that but even
then but it's like it's just people
talking to people don't be a manager
talking to a developer or functional
analysts talking to a tester be a person
talking to another person you shouldn't
we try to become to friends because well
sometimes it's just not possible but at
least become acquaintances and listen to
each other and then do let's see how it
goes
sure why not why shouldn't I d work with
a DBA and developer there are two
different worlds yeah but they're people
too they should listen to each other I
know DBS well I talked with them I
learned from them and they learn for me
it was like the previous talk he was
talking about well developers they don't
know anything about relational databases
well that's because they don't listen
they don't ask it's possible and also as
a manager you can try to promote it put
them together don't put your dbas
somewhere in the back and your
developers in front put your team
together everybody let them work
together yeah
yep
last words were fabulous
well it's wonderful way it's everybody's
evil but sup me you know some are more
experts than us but you know which from
each other you talk about it and you
find your own solutions you work it out
in your team so that's an excellent way
to do it any other comments stories
excuse me
how do you do these things and
social media social use Twitter use
Facebook use instant messaging use video
conferencing stuff like that try to find
a way to create a community within your
team even if you are in different time
zones of course yeah if there are
exactly opposite of the world's they
will never work at the same time so
that's a problem but then you should try
to create local teams and and we
organize your work that a local team can
do it without having to consult the
other team the whole time but let them
have let them share the same vision tell
them why are you guys do doing this and
why are they doing that it's something

Jackson all the world's but it worked

difference
that's wonderful thanks for sharing yes
please well whatever i don't like what
my work around well I don't like the
fact that I have to account every minute
of the day so I have to be accountable
when I am doing something for the
company i have to tell well i'm doing
this now and i am doing it like this and
I'm how do you say it in English I'm
booking in booking it on this budget
from the for the company I have to work
38 hours each week and I have to explain
each and every one of those hours and
minutes and that's not something I like
I want to do my job I want to do I want
to do start am interested in but it's
not always really stuff that my company
at this moment is interested in so I
want to combine the two I'm i work four
days in a week for different clients of
my company on one day in a week i work
for a company and i want to research I
want to read blogs but after if we have
to explain to my manager well today i
read i only read blogs it's like huh why
how do on which budget did you do it not
on my budgets you have to find somebody
else's budget I don't like it and so I'm
talking about that with my managers with
my managers managers and well we'll see
we're trying to work it out it hasn't
been successful yet but at least I'm
trying something else I don't like our
buildings there too gray too old school
I want more open environments more
interaction between the people so I told
it to my manager actually the company
started a group to improve our buildings
are
desk stuff like that but they weren't
going fast enough for me so I simply
wrote an assertive email to our CEO so
we are a company about 1,500 people so i
just emailed it to our CEO and you
actually replied within three minutes
thank you Peter for your comments it's
good to see that people are assertive
it's good to see that people care about
their company so well I am honest I was
afraid but I had something like well
don't be afraid if it doesn't like it
well he'll tell you and then it just can
keep quiet or not well I'm not a person
to keep to stay quiet I don't believe in
it life is too short you don't know how
much time you have it so you better
spend it right
help your coworker find another job talk
to her ask her what do we want to do
with your life okay you don't want to be
a developer anymore you sure about that
what do you want to do be a project
manager be a business's be a gardener
who knows and help her find a job and
then she'll no longer be a co-worker but
she she'll be if she'll remain a friend
that's the idea
yep
project
verse
mentioned lately how you
so actually you're talking about Google
twenty percent I don't know if everybody
knows what it is they actually say well
you have twenty percent of your time and
you can do whatever you want and we pay
for it atlassian had some as something
similar they have their fedex days
actually the now they are called ship it
days each quarter of the year they take
24 hours and they say to their teams
well do whatever you want within 24
hours you have to deliver present it and
then we'll have beer and cupcakes so
it's a way to motivate your people how
you can do it well talk about with your
manager try to find solution maybe you
can say well I'll research something in
my own time if I can get some time at
work to do it or well give me a little
bit less work to do for the clients so I
can invest some more time in myself so I
can be a better developer become a
better developer become a better covert
and again you can sell me for more money
to our clients that's a win-win
situation you had a question yeah
true yeah indeed managing your project
in different time zones open service
environments open sore projects they
have to do that because well everybody
can join in so everybody across the
world is work on the same project any
