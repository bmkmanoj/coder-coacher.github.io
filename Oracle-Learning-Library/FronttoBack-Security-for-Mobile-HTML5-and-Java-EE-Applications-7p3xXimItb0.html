end-to-end security for java ee mobile
applications not talking about Java ME
we're talking about web applications
things like that mobile web but also
hybrid clients and and and native Native
clients so let's get started first of
all introduce my name is Maria spoke of
each i'm working for redhat the jboss
division i'm working on two projects
snowdrop and jboss developer framework
and a lot it is actually the one that's
listed with him said with the school
yeah so my name is Jay blueness I'm a
JBoss core developer I used to be the
richfaces project lead and then over the
last year or so I started being the aero
gear project lead which is a one of a
newer mobile mobile focused project at
jboss which I'll introduce a little bit
later as well I'm also read hath
representative on the w3c and on the JCP
for for a couple of jsr s so let's start
right off the bat with you know why is
security important right it's kind of a
silly question especially for enterprise
developers for the most part we know why
security is important right and that's
pretty much because of threats right we
have to be careful yeah threat is a
malicious action that will compromise
your data or data or identity and Mary's
I love this image you found by the way
so you have threats because you might
have vulnerabilities right opportunities
to materialise threats right loopholes
or problems with your procedure perhaps
a a weak link so to speak all right but
there's lots of different types of
vulnerabilities there's you know there's
infrastructure vulnerabilities
application development issues and and
and problems there so we're going to be
covering today is how to develop secure
applications with Java EE and and some
of the some jboss project we're going to
talk about the enterprise Java server
side we're going to talk about mobile
and desktop web applications right
there's not a lot that applies to mobile
web that doesn't also apply to to a
desktop application we're going to talk
a little bit about hybrid applications
and in native applications although some
more details on and examples around
native Native security access will come
a little later so first I just want to
ask you a question how many people are
familiar with different with hybrid
mobile applications like Apache Cordova
appcelerator phonegap all right so not
too many so I'll give a brief overview
there's really a spectrum when people
talk about web right and so I'm sorry
when they talk about mobile and so you
have one spectrum where you're talking
about mobile web it's where you go to
amazon.com and it shows you a pretty
picture that fits your phone has
different button sizes handles touch
events things like that on the other
spectrum you have native applications
you build them with the native SDKs
objective-c Android java.net things like
that gives you full access to all the
SDKs it's good for games it's good for
high-performance applications things
like that and then somewhere in the
middle you have hybrid applications and
as I mentioned there's a few projects
around that there's a patchy Cordova
appcelerator trigger io sencha touch
different things like that and
effectively what they all do two
different levels is let you use web
technologies or in some cases ruby or
other languages to define an application
once and then compile it or or wrap it
into a native application that you can
put in app stores they ought they often
give you bridges into native
functionality for example Apache Cordova
you simply get a JavaScript library that
you can access the camera of events
calendars things like that and so I just
wanted to kind of break down the
different types so what we're not going
to cover today our infrastructure issues
right that's probably Oracle OpenWorld
there they'll have a talk on that I'm
sure or they probably already did and
we're not going to talk about DNS
attacks why are sniffing right cross
site scripting all right I'm sorry
cross-site request forgery those types
of things they tend to be more
infrastructure issues as opposed to
application development issues although
depending on how you develop your client
application can have a role in that as
well so why mobile right
it's probably a silly question to a lot
of people here and that's probably
because you've got a lot more of them
right how many people here have a smart
phone in their pocket or are holding it
up to take pictures and how about
tablets right I'm surprised everybody
didn't raise their hand again so yeah so
there's just there's a lot more there's
a lot more of them and what does that
actually mean it means that there's
multiple access points per user so all
of a sudden you instead of one access
point at your desktop when you log in at
9am you've got an application that you
can access three or four different ways
you know wherever you happen to be and
so the other issue around that is that
you can end up depending on how careful
you are with data replicated everywhere
all right so you can end up in a
situation where you've got data in
multiple points you have to be careful
about making sure that data synchronized
and in kind of managing that you also
have more operating systems all right
you know late 90s pretty much mobile
pretty much the web one all right i mean
there's that we certainly still have
native applications you know client
server applications like javafx and
others but for the most part you know a
lot of java ee became focused around web
based applications because it gave you a
single operating system effectively
right the browser although there's
different you know tweaks you're still
building a website it was a very
well-known paradigm you know HTTP HTTP
session right the security models there
some of those don't apply anymore or
they apply differently and you just have
to be aware of how those may be
different and so you know now you're
when you're dealing with net you're
dealing with Objective C you may enjoy
ja Java it's Java but there's definitely
some differences you just need to be
aware so mobile really complicated
security yeah it complicated security in
some ways but there's not a lot about
mobile that wouldn't apply to desktop
applications or laptops or you know if
you have your building a native
application in Windows 8 apparently I
haven't I don't have proof yet it's not
that different from building one
for the for windows phone 8 so but it's
still important to know especially for
for our crowd that servers are the
gatekeepers right that is where we as
Java Enterprise developers have control
and a layer in the application stack
where we can provide that application
security we choose what we expose in
endpoints we get to manage that and so
you know to some degree that's part of
what we'll be talking about next and
it's actually America's turn now don't
trip on my my tether my tether yeah I
actually started looking on this
presentation and starting thinking about
the problem and we try to define what
exactly is like what are the challenges
across the entire spectrum to an entire
an entire mobile solution right and we
try to take a look at all the all the
areas like where is where the were more
challenge it's all gonna challenge
yourself to client are more challenges
on the server are much out there are
more challenges on the in the
communication between the two right and
actually found out that each side is
actually has a lot of responsibilities
and has some problem to solve right
let's let's take them one by one I'm
going to start with in between because
this is more infrastructural than an
application based so for the most part
of this your your infrastructure solve
these issues it has less to do about how
you develop your application but more
how you configure the communication I'm
sorry I'm trying not to speak okay yeah
um now where these concerns actually
overlap with development methodology is
where clients is how clients access
servers through different protocols so
this is where you start looking at some
specifications around web and Jason
cryptology so you start looking at https
you start looking at
at secure web sockets you're starting
looking at JSON web encryption you start
looking at web developer VIP avi right
but again these are not things that you
necessarily that are part of your
programming model which is what we want
to focus on next on the client side a
lot of the as actually the client side
especially for mobile is the one that
contributes to the complexity of the
problem why because in with a with a
mobile device you carried a WT your data
it's it's you need to do that because
you have to take into account that your
client may go offline your device so
basically there is a trade-off between
how much data you want to keep on the
device and how much data you actually
want to keep on the server and just
retreat when you need it and it's
serious because your device can be lost
stolen and so on and you don't want
anyone to get access to it in the same
way authentication and authorization
becomes a problem because every keeping
for example a client permanently
authenticated keeping a mobile device
permanently authenticated again is a
risk in case when they're lost or stolen
as I said right so here you have to be
pretty smart and you have to be to do
some trade-offs and they're basically
you have to trade off between the
convenience of between for example
storing principles on the client side or
using a token based solution this is all
stuff that you have to weigh in and your
solution has to take that into account
at the same time again keeping data on
the device implies a trade-off between
security and performance do I have to
fetch data every time depends on the
amount depends on what kind of data I
may not want to keep all my social
security information everything that
defines my digital identity at the
fingertips of someone who actually can
get access to it other than me on the
other hand there is for example
information nothing
and it's not necessarily super secure
that I can store so when you defy the
solution you have to take that into
account as you have to take into account
windows of trust which means that you
may keep sensitive information you may
keep your client logged in for a while
but then after sometime you may want to
incorporate things like for example like
losing like ending the window of a trust
and basically cut the client becomes
untrusted and has to authenticate again
or you may want to have a phone home
functionality to make sure that the
client actually has like it's still in
the it's still who it claims it is
basically it belongs to the person it
belongs to you the server side is let's
say if the client is the most vulnerable
the server is the one that actually does
most of the work it's responsible for
authenticating the clients it's
typically especially if we're looking at
a Java EE solution a lot of the
application logic is on the server and
accessory it has to be secured so
basically you're thinking of your having
to do alt indication authorization you
have to authorize access to restful and
web service endpoints you have to
consider even non HTTP clients what you
do with web sockets and so on other
aspects on the server side our identity
management so basically you really not
only want to have access to information
about you but you want to manipulate
them in a way even when it comes out on
a dolphin vacation you have multiple
ways in which you can do it so you can
have an in-house database and have a an
ldap server have an active directory
against you against which we
authenticate or you can have something
we can have more of an overworld type of
app out of application may want you to
authenticate against the social so it's
like Twitter or Google how many of you
like to subscribe to a site every time
how many of you prefer
for example just using their Google
account del frente gate on a site okay a
few well it's it's really and an
application like it's really it's really
there is a variety of possible solutions
depending on the use cases that you have
to take that into account even on the
server side there are performance
implications to all this as I said
security is most of the time of a
function of security and convenience
mobile mobile applications are somehow
different then let's say the classic
security model where you open a browser
read your email for five minutes close
the browser and go up right data remains
on the client so you have to think about
it whether a session based model for
example is suitable or not session-based
is it's very convenient because every
request basically it establishes a
window of trust which is completely
managed by the application server at the
same time it's not very scalable every
session consumes a bit of memory so
while you don't need to check out sent
occasion every time because you're it's
kind of cashing your session it's really
not very convenient for your application
size so you may want to consider a
different type of solution token-based
now token-based means that a token
travels back and this is all what the
client sends and here you have to send
to think about how long do you want to
keep the token how long is the token
valid you have to consider the fact that
every token basically needs to be
reallocated in some way so you need to
have stablish who was the actual who is
the owner of the token and reestablish
the alto the author the identity of the
requester and so on again it is a
trade-off you have to take into account
whether you have a salute for example
you happening to account take into
account when you consider sash
and token you have to take into account
whether you have a single server or you
have a cluster or you have a cloud
migration of session data between
between them or using the sticky session
sorry CK request model sticky session
model is actually again something that
can decrease the scalability of your
application so basically let let me just
go through our our solution and just try
to to kind of show you how we thought
how we thought about solving these
problems first we are at a montival
using Java EE it's a very like it's a
very powerful platform and we want to
use it to the to its maximum extent to
the maximum extent that it can it can
provide us with you can help us but how
many of you using for example jazz fewer
people than the ones that want to login
on Google or Twitter it's basically jazz
is what jazz is the native security
model of Java EE it's not a very
suitable one we don't find it to be very
suitable for applications for an
application development model it's very
coarse grain it's basically providing in
its provides integration with servlets
with ejbs but they're looking for much
much more we are looking at for example
a more complex programming model that
allows us to find like to provide some
fine grain a fine grain authorization
wall and something that's not
necessarily based on users and second
groups we want to have IDM identity
management able to manipulate that
information so basically we are looking
at something else and that's something
else is what we actually want to show
you today it's a solution that combines
on the server side
a project bigoted link that provides a
security framework for Java EE and air
gear which extends and builds on top of
the of the picket line facilities both
of them providing a together a
comprehensive front to back or
end-to-end security solution on the
server client and this is something that
you don't like well while a lot of these
these challenges are I are due to like
our the fact that we are talking about
mobile applications actually it's not
like this solution is not limited to
mobile a rich desktop application has to
some extent the same challenges and this
solution actually helps solving them the
same thing it works in the same way it
works for both private servers so it
works for both in-house servers but it
also works on the clap and to that
extent the core of this solution is Java
EE it's still Java is not jazz we are
using the Java EE programming model CDI
to actually power this how many of you
of you are using CDI right now how many
of you are considering using how many of
you are considering going to java ee 6 a
DA a few so CDI is basically the
programming model of Java EE 6 it
provides dependency injection it
provides cross-cutting cross-cutting
answer management and so on and we're
actually building on top of it using the
picket line project ticket link provides
a comprehensive security framework it
provides identity management for users
and roll so it's basically holding all
the information all the mappings between
what user what users do you have in the
system what usually belong to what also
they have and so on and so forth it not
only it's capable of interpreting that
but also manipulating for different
sources like a database / jpa or Active
Directory
or LDAP or even external sources of
information like doing things like pop
open a DSL and so on on the other hand
it provides an authentication and
authorization model which is extensible
so it has different forms of
authentication form or digest or
certificates it also has different ways
of expressing authorization constraints
like sam'l xxc xacml or business rules
so it's very extensible in that in that
respect what we are taught by we try
very hard as part of the solution is
hide some of the complexity or some of
the sophistication of picket link and
keep the power under a veneer of a very
simple and intuitive programming model
which again is CDI based so essentially
you have access you can you have access
to your security context to dependency
injection you can use in intercept you
can have use an interceptor based model
for authorization and in fact we use
interceptor bindings from CDI to
actually create an expressive security
language we use CDI events for
application step for this for security
status changes what does it mean it
means that when someone logs in or logs
out or there is a security unauthorized
access attempt the application will send
an event throughout you can observe that
and react to that your application the
whole picture of what I said is this CDI
this binding is providing the link
between the power of picket link and
your application model which can include
so it can use basically this model to
secure not only let's say ejbs but also
other components like restful endpoints
simple pojos business services they can
use it for securing your web layer
so let me just walk you to understand
when I say it's a simple mod let me just
show you how very quickly how it's done
right how do you configure security it's
very simple you have a fluid API which
actually allows you to produce security
configurations now this is basically
this method is a producer method that
creates an object right that picket link
will use further to create the security
infrastructure and what do we do here
it's basically we define this alpha
education strategy which is IBM based as
opposed to other things I go off or
something else we establish an identity
manage we define the identity management
strategy so which is the store where the
that that the that the security
information is coming from at least we
define where the security sessions are
stored so just as a as a no just as a
note you can link provider provides a
way that once you authenticate it it
retains the information about the fact
that you are 10 ticketing and gives you
a token you can use that token to
actually prevent logging in every time
you have to make a request and this
information is actually stored in an
intercession storage now this is not
your HTTP session it's separate which
allows to actually use an in-memory
mechanism or use a data grid to store
this information and so on on the other
hand the identity story itself like for
example the data that the set of tables
where you store your user group and roll
information right it's a game
configurable to another be so you have
another CD I producer method which
actually it sets it up right and
basically with these two beans inject it
into into this injected into
the picket link framework once created
from at the application start that's all
I need to do to actually set it up what
it will provide me in terms of an API is
another not it is a few other beings
that I can use in my application to
actually perform various operations so
this makes it very easy for example to
login the only thing I need to do is to
inject my login credentials in a class
inject my an identity object and then
very simply I pass on a credential
information and I I tell the identity
object the object that manages the
identity states then I want to login and
that's it after past this point if the
credentials are right i logged in and
actually because the model is extensible
credentials can be a lot of other things
certificates for example you you you you
I these exactly so it's extensible at
that level logout is even simpler so I
just have to tell the identity the
identity status being that the currently
logging with the current user that's
using the who's that the application is
that that's working with the application
needs to log out creating a new user so
covering the other part not only
consuming the security information but
actually manipulating it is also easy so
I can use the identity manager being
injected in the that can you can inject
an identity manager too and basically I
can use it for creating user updating
its passwords or granting or removing
rolls right so that is covering the
other part of the identity problem well
they can come from every well as I say
you have an identity store you can store
them in ldap but you can stall them in
jp-a
in a sari in a database that assumes yes
yes that assumes it assumes that you
have like you have a source of
information and it's configurable so you
can configure the tables that you use if
you have for example pre-existing data
it can grab that the fact that you had
that use dependency injection actually
allows you to configure the application
picking linking link out of the box
comes with comes with a set of default
roles and groups and then it's certainly
extensible after that so part of what we
want to do is make sure that there's a
there's a there's a rapid development
process to get started right to give you
things like a jpa based identity store
right you might not want to do that
because you're talking about unencrypted
database right but it gives you the
application developer the ability to get
started start working on your
application and then pick it linked
behind the scenes of the application
developer can swap in an ldap right
without you having to go change every
one of your beans for example right that
would be one of the one of the nice
things about that so that that's just
what pickling comes with out of the box
gives you a better a better starting
better starting a feel right and
basically like what we show here is
probably one of the simples use cases
I'm more trying to emphasize the point
that it's easy like it that it's that
what you need to do to actually get
things started is to create a bunch of
of beans that represent your like
that represent your configuration and
represent how your security is actually
stored and use that model totoo to
kick-start the please security engine
right yes sir I'm sorry
I'm sorry speak up a live like okay
literally Anthony Davis for the benefits
of the question the question asked was
whether the first line kicks in a login
process no it does not this is just
manipulating that the way in which the
users are stored you can't have a login
afterwards it depends like you can part
of the same request have a login but it
doesn't happen automatically you code me
do that it's it's more flexible than
automatically doing a lot it's like a
think of a registration form for example
and we were actually going to add to
show you how we have a registration form
the desert step we have a demo so maybe
some of the things will become clear in
in that context the last part that I
just wanted to show is how do i secure
the code so securing the code is very
easy it's basically just a matter of
applying some security bindings on
methods so you have here for example on
a restful endpoint but you can secure
anything it can be a regular CD I beam
and we what we say here is that only
users with the role at admin can do
anything can access any method of this
class but we actually if you look at the
list all methods we are customizing it
so that even users that have the role
simple can do that as well now when you
look at roles allowed you may think of
the roles aloud from ejb but it's not
it's an ant it's a special a notation
that is that you that the picket link
project has created so is defined this
using the security binding type metal
annotation on it thank you which
basically allows you to set up an
annotation and then define a handler
that processes it and this way you can
actually go and create different types
of restrictions within your application
not necessarily only the ones that
pickup lane else provide those other
ones and basically that kind of shows
you what we do on the server side now
jay is going to show you how aero gear
provides a combined server client
solution for this yes yes yes I mean the
handler the handler is basically where
is your security logic would would go
essentially and the point I was trying
to make here was that this allows you to
kind of customize what kind of security
you want it's not only roles that you
want to have you may want to have
something like time basically someone
can access this method only on Monday
it's it's a different type of it's a
different type of restriction right so
it's not only what comes out of the boss
you can define your own yeah
no now it's using like it's using an XE
di extension project called Delta spike
if you have heard of it but it's not
just it's not jealousy it's not using
jaws underneath in any way it's really
completely something completely separate
alright alright so so now you guys have
you guys have actually got me a little
curious because you and it was like the
last day but almost there was very few
people that said that they're using Java
EE right now so what what are people
using rice spring-mvc how many people
are using spring MVC right now all right
so quite a few are you using the spring
security modules that are in there all
right and then I'm assuming some of the
some of you other guys were on java ee
555 and then plans to go to six there
was a couple hands that were raised so I
was just kind of curious what people
were running alright so the aero gear
project is uh is a new project that
mentioned earlier and it's focused
around around native client library
development so what we're talking about
there is JavaScript iOS and Android
libraries for developing different types
of mobile applications providing a
consistent approach to server
connectivity so what that means is the
server is going to have a defined API
whether that's rest rest based or
WebSocket based and one of the things
that's a little different about about
aero gear that some other projects have
had problems with in the past is we want
to create for example our objective c
library we're not creating we're not
going to go and try to talk to
objective-c developers and tell them you
now need a program like a java ee person
because nothing will get an iOS
developer to run faster than showing
them java and java ee and so what we
want to do is actually we've got some
guys on the team that that are familiar
with iOS development and in our
experience there so we're developing
api's for for the the target platforms
our initial priority is security and
persistence right so basic basic person
since and then this so the security
we're talking about today and then more
to come but that's just kind of that's
just the start of what we're talking
about with aero gear we're also going to
be doing native push and non-native push
so that's going when I say non-native I
mean like web sockets or long polling
comment that type of thing but also
native push so actually working with
Apple and Android servers for for push
notifications when your apps are offline
and so if you can if you start if you
mix if you mix push with messaging you
could see JMS messages going to and from
native clients for example all right if
you create that pipe you can have you
could have a CDI event that's triggered
on the server you know update and
trigger back to the client device right
and then we're also talking about data
synchronization and then offline support
with things like the phone home and
things like that but these these are
going to come a little later we're
currently focused on security and
persistence as i mentioned we're a
relatively new project at at jboss and
so you know that's where as i mentioned
we're actively in development so that we
have in we have all of these libraries
today at different stages of development
we've got aero gear j/s which we use for
mobile web which is what will show you
today and then also cordoba support so
you can you can run these inside of a
Cordova application to give you give you
one way to access secure backends and
and persistent we also have an iOS
library that's actually in cacoa pods
it's kind of like a maven repository for
iOS and you can got some people you can
download that and try that with your iOS
application and then the air the Android
project is actually you know
surprisingly since we're all Java
developers is is actually you know in
early development as opposed to having
having something complete complete and
ready at this point but but it's getting
there so this talk is security focused
so we're what do we mean with security
with air gear now we want to sit
olaf I the auth star across multiple
clients and across these modern clients
right so we're going to have we're going
to have different ways or we're going to
have platform specific ways to access
the security that Java EE provides right
we got where there's a huge base of Java
EE users already and you know a lot of
you are going to have mobile require how
many of you have mobile requirements
today actually like your boss said make
me a mobile app how many of that how
many of those is mobile web web based
how about native Native all right and
then how about a hybrid hybrid based all
right well so that's a really good mix
actually that was that was a little less
for hybrid but the other two were pretty
even so that's good to know so as as
mary has talked about earlier we've got
picket link on the server side that lets
the the you know the details of the
implementation get swapped out
underneath and and frankly it in my
project level I don't care and then aero
gear itself exposes different different
endpoints that and and basically api's
to the client libraries to to handle
that inner if that interaction that the
integration so as I mentioned air the
air gear Jas is one of the farther
farther libraries are more complete
libraries at this point and it has a
concept called pipelines so this is how
you hook up two different endpoints and
different servers so you create a
pipeline to it to a set of restful
endpoints you can define pipes to the to
those restful endpoints and then once
you define that within your JavaScript
code it's very simple to then save
update delete modify query based on
those endpoints are based on those
pipelines in a similar way we have
authenticators and we'll walk through
the code in just a minute on how you set
these things up and one of the neat
things about this is every pipe that you
define can actually have its own its own
authenticator now what that means is
that when your boss tells you not only
have to interact with the service you
you control but you also have to
interact with a service you don't
control then you can change out the
security mechanism for that pipe so it
could be a different implementation now
right now this is rest base by default
we do have plans for web sockets Oh data
support which is a kind of an extension
on top of rest but as I mentioned we're
at rest right we're using rest right now
alright so the server side off that's
our that's right now that's our end
point the name itself may change so this
is this is our our client security
interface at the moment I mean there's
some obviously some sub some restful
endpoints underneath that it's a jax-rs
based right now it allows for login
logout and register and it also has some
token based security that we've kind of
pulled through from picket link so
here's just an example of that how many
people here are familiar with jax-rs
actually wow good lots so here's an
example of the authentication endpoint
that we have see we're injecting a few a
few of the picket link items right and
then that's just an example of the
method we can we can look at the code
more later so what's important though
about that is how we set up the client
connection to that end point right so
this is JavaScript obviously and here's
where we're asking the aero gear
JavaScript library to create me an
authenticator in this case we call it
rest off give it a name we can choose
whether or not it's session or token
base here and the AG off name is going
to change because that doesn't make much
sense to me and you know that does what
that that flips the bit on what Mario's
was talking about whether or not you
have a session based authentication or a
simple token-based and then obviously
you need a you need to tell it where the
the auth endpoint lives if it's not if
it's not the root keep thinking I'm
going to trip on my tether here
not you still that one all right so now
you get that set up and you have an
authenticate Authenticator on the client
what do you do at this point well login
is pretty straightforward again that's
one of the goals of all of this is
trying to make application development
as easy as possible you know while
picket link does a lot of complex things
under the covers so does so does aero
gear client libraries to make it so that
you for the most part you give it some
in this case pass username and password
as a JSON token and then just call log
in and you'll get a call back if the
login succeeds and an error if it
doesn't and then you can query what that
error is and different things like that
and it's similar in a similar fashion
you can just say real rest off dot log
out and obviously for the other the
other client libraries there's some
similar approaches so on the server
these are just the abstracts of the
endpoints right you've got / login /
logout it takes JSON both ways so it can
actually pass back some some status
information yep yep
if they're this if it's the same offend
authenticator used so i'll show you in
just a minute so now i'm the the very
next slide is actually how to how to how
to hook up the authenticator to the
pipeline if you beat me by one slide so
you know as you started you know great
now what right you're connected to an
authenticator on a server you can log in
and you can log out but what do you have
to do next now you have to configure a
secure act endpoint for access and so
this is a this is how you create an aero
gear pipeline object and it's kind of
similar to the to the Authenticator
you're creating give it a name tasks you
tell it what URL represents the the root
of the of the endpoint and then in this
case we're setting the Authenticator to
rest off and so in the in the demo code
we have there's actually three of these
there's it's a simple to-do app there's
tasks projects and tags and each one
looks just like this obviously with the
names or names are slightly different
but they all use the rest off and so
what that means is the credential or the
secure the secure token is shared across
those so then back on the server Mary's
could already show this I'm not going to
get too far into it you've got the slash
tasks endpoints and the slash projects
in different roles allowed for those all
right so now how do you actually use the
pipeline so here imagine the user just
clicked a you know a new task button
you're going to say tasks that save pass
it in data data could just come from a
form you can construct it yourself on
the client side what have you you pass
it in if its success you do whatever you
need to and you're in your standard call
back if there's a if there's an error
you can actually switch off of the off
of the response code of the restful
endpoint which is kind of nice so you
can switch up of a 404 as opposed to a
401 right but a 401 is unauthorized so
here you could hand you know you're not
you need to log back in you refresh or
you know clear the application cache and
show the login screen again that type of
thing and this is all that you this
all you have to do in the code that
needs to kind of be repeated around
right you have some set up and then the
code that you have to write more more
often is this slim down as we can
alright so before we get to the demo you
know there's still a few things that are
up to you the devout the application
developer to make decisions on and it's
important to know that that these you
want to be able to make these decisions
because different applications have
different requirements right if you're
talking about DoD you might not even
store user names it might just be you
know random randomly generated hash ID
that's represents a user that the server
then needs to modify or it might be in
the mites or nothing on the client ever
or it might be something like Netflix
where with Netflix if you use their
their services you can download in store
uh there or if you use their application
i should say you download and store all
of the the client catalog or the movie
catalog but not the account information
right that's a decision that they've
they've made as a company not to not to
store account information in a cache on
the clients but you can store the movie
listing right and then get Delta's
because they don't care if you have that
you also need to think about how chatty
the authentication should be what I mean
by this is as a UI is generating the as
the client is generating the user
interface admins might get extra buttons
right and so you can ask the server you
know can this is a user auth
authenticated for this button is the
user authenticated for this it's
typically a bad practice to return
things like pure rolls right to a to the
client right you don't necessarily want
your client to note this is admin if you
might want it to know that the user has
access to x y&amp;amp;z services and the client
can go and make those decisions on what
the UI should look like you need to
model model your endpoints in your
access there's a project called jboss
Forge which can help with that by the
way but I won't get too far into that
and then you have to think about
encrypted client storage a lot of
devices
especially the newer devices have really
good hardware enabled encryption which
means that yet sometimes that lets the
application developer off the hook
because you can you can enforce rules as
a company to say you must use hardware
encryption if you lose your phone but at
the same time projects like aero gear
and others are do work with things like
JSON encryption and web crypto and other
projects like that and then our roadmap
quick you know error gears new you know
we've been at it for a little while now
but we're still under development and
we're planning to have a final release
around the end of the year and it's also
a great time to get involved because
we're talking about some of the latest
technologies in you know in the industry
and for the most part we're still just
we're still determining different parts
of our of our end project right and so
if you want to get involved with an open
source project it's a great one to do
that with you can check out our new aero
gear org site and anyone who's
interested I've got some aero gear
stickers up here look great on your
laptop so anyway all right let's get to
the demo quick you guys can actually all
access go go ahead right so this so that
what I'm talking about a its future we
don't do today we don't but what we're
talking about is interacting with the
web crypto standard and there's a JSON
JSON encryption standard so that's
that's more around encrypting the the
back and forth not not local storage
right right just that the communication
channel right that way you can do do
some of that communication not in SSL or
HTTPS right but you still need might
want to secure it what yes sure
so I mean trying to damage the app or
trying to like get access to the server
a type of thing right so with mmm-hmm
right right I mean what you're talking
about is multi-tenant client support
right where you talking about what you
within a lot of the controls around that
are actually based on the mobile the
mobile operating system you already have
and what you expose Apple for example is
very restrictive right there's not a
whole lot of inter a piÃ±a k shins that
are possible but with or you have to
there's some a lot of hoops you have to
run through Android is a little bit more
it's a little bit more open I think it I
think it goes to the application
application developer to be to be aware
there isn't like a specific tool at
least that I know of off the top of my
head that manages that you can restrict
like when you want to develop an
application for example you can restrict
the especially when you have something
like Cordova Franklin for instance you
can restrict actually the servers that
they can connect to so basically you
cannot issue requests and it cannot
receive
malicious code for example from from
your application or from an already
learning application so you have have
basically a you have a level of like as
jay says there is some stuff to do Iowa
that the operating system doesn't allow
you to do and then even there there are
ways of actually configuring your
application for me forbidden to do
certain things at the application config
from within the application
configuration itself right so because
what you're talking about is really
interact right you're worried about a
malicious app going trying to get to
another one right I'll tell you one of
the biggest things that drives me nuts
nuts about Android and even iOS iOS but
especially Android is that when you
typically create like generic projects
in like the SDK like all of the
functionalities are turned off right
that's like it so some of this is just
configuration knowledge right knowing
that knowing that you have to change the
configuration so that it's not open to
external external inputs right things
like that all right so we're actually
pretty close to at it well we're
actually pretty close two at a time but
I do want to show you the demo you guys
can actually go to it yourself if you
want that's just a picture of that serve
our new aero gear site uses a responsive
design to change automatically back and
forth but based on the the device type
but let me say so all of you can
actually this is a cloud-based
application it's actually up on jboss is
open open shift our paths offering you
go to to do off dash aero gear to rh
cloud com you'll you'll see this
application this is the web version we
have an iOS version under an under
development right now it's pretty
typical you can create tasks you can
create projects things like that
and what I wanted to show is the network
here actually i'll run it on my local so
I'm just going to log in here I'm going
to do John and the username and
passwords are John 123 and Jane 123 you
can also register new users as well so
now i'm logged in and you'll see what
happened is let's see where to go right
here this is the login request so this
is the request to the auth login
endpoint and that that's what was
handled by the source code once again
i'm not my screens aren't mirrored so
it's kind of difficult to see back and
forth so this is the this is the primary
javascript file for for the demo and so
this is just the expanded version of
what what I kind of already showed in
this live right so you set up your arrow
gear off and then here's here's some
different pipelines then down below is
the is the is the log in case of the
login doing rest off that log in the
type of thing and then handling the air
doing different things based on that so
let's see I know we're almost at a time
so here if I'm logged in as John I can
do anything I want if I'm logged in as
Jane if I try to add a project it's
going to tell me the you know
authentication error you're not allowed
to do that or authorization error and
also if I try to go if I'm not logged in
in a tab and I try to let go to the get
request for projects it will actually
return the 40 the 401 unauthorized from
that so if you're interested in checking
this out more this is up on github at at
github com / aero gear and it's just the
the to do application you'll see some
blogs and other things as well and as I
mentioned if you're interested in
participating in the project let me know
or just
you show up at our website or our IRC
channel I think that's probably all the
time we take some questions or if you
want you can come up front and and we'll
talk to you we've got stickers alright
