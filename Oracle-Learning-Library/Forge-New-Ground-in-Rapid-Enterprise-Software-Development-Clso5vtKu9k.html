talk is about productivity reliability
and testability in a PowerPoint
presentation that is going crazy
productivity reliability and testability
in an enterprise environment my name is
Lincoln Baxter and this is Paul Becker
I'm the forged project lead and he is
the first most awesome forged committer
that we had we're also pleased to be
joined by even-even off he's in her
front row here he's another forge
committer so if you have any questions
feel free to ask us afterwards and will
also be glad to take your questions
throughout the talk so what's this about
why are we here why'd you come into this
room today I'm hoping it came into this
room because getting started sucks every
time we have to learn a new technology
we go through the same process first
there's dread maybe excitement and then
there's delay or maybe we like getting
right into something but there's this
process that we all go through every
time where we have to sort of like pick
up from the ground these things that
we're not really familiar with we have
to sort out where it fits in our
perspective of what we already
understand about technology and then put
those pieces together and you know
that's that's the learning curve right
that's what happens when you pick up
anything new it doesn't even relate to
technology this is everything in our
lives getting started sucks integrating
stuff is hard we work with a lot of
technologies today we're all here at
javaone but we don't just use Java we
use Linux we use bash we use Grails we
use HTML CSS we use all these different
kinds of things we use security
frameworks we use database frameworks
this is all stuff that we have to put
together to make a fully functional
successful application and when we
integrate things we go through that same
getting started process new technology
comes in we have to learn if we have to
pick it up and that takes time I
personally enjoy that time but I'm what
a weird
remembering stuff is hard even the
things that we've already learned we've
already gotten started we've already
integrated we go through you know maybe
we have tasks we have to do every day to
keep our applications up to date we have
to run a few procedures to make sure
that our reports are generated and we
take a week off we take two weeks off
and we come back to that technology and
we have to remember how to do it and
that can be hard sometimes we forget
what we've been doing for years it
doesn't take very long and repetitive
tasks these things we have to remember
over and over and over again these
things we have to do every day are
frustrating they're annoying they are
quickly something that becomes a burden
it's like the boilerplate code that we
write in our applications we would
really love to have a framework that
would make it so that we write like one
line of code in our whole applications
there but we don't do that so we have
these repetitive tasks we have to do
every day it makes us crazy some of us
are already crazy like Paul yeah but
what do we do about it how do we how do
we remember how to do things how do we
learn how to how to use a new technology
where do you go
no audience participation today samples
and tutorials perfect where do you find
this ok from people that support the
framework and how do you find those
those documents Google right we go to
Google we start typing something in oh
wait hold on a second side I mean
everyone else feeling like going down
the road once again and we want to start
programming you know we want to start
making our our stuffed pork and we're
going back to Google once again and then
we start copy pasting our goal first
hour making configuration in our
geography application and a
configuration and I don't want to do
that stuff all over again there must be
something better isn't there I don't
know I think so but we're not going to
use Google today that's absolutely out
of the question today we're going to use
project dear boss forge and it is a
member of the jboss community this is a
project that I'm very excited about
obviously i'm the project lead and it's
going to help us with getting started
getting integrated getting mental so
remembering things and also getting
efficient so taking care of the
repetitive tasks even if it's something
that this tool is not ever designed for
intended to do it can help us with all
these things and we're going to see that
today so let's get started awesome so
what shall we do I would say let's start
off with just creating a project a
project from scratch and well let's
start creating in Joffe application can
we do that yeah sure so force can help
us with that as opposed to going up to
the you know new project wizard and like
typing a whole bunch of things in here
we can just come down to the forge
console and we can say forge new project
named and we're going to call this
tracker we're going to make a task
tracking application today hit enter and
Ford spits out a project here it is an
eclipse that looks easy enough but I
mean I want to use maven because that's
what what we are standing standardized
on and what we have to integrate with
other stuff later on shell it's just
still using Nathan absolutely if you
notice down here in the bottom of the
project we have a maven pom file but let
me first show you what's up here we have
the the default maven may
folder the test folder test resources
the dependencies which we have none yet
and the palm file if we look at that is
just a basic pom file it comes with the
jboss nexus repository by default we
have to put a few plugs in there but
other than that it's just a completely
clean pom file but it is in dish
basically what am a fan archetype can do
for us yeah we could use an archetype
but it will the problem with archetypes
is you you run it once and it's done
right right and and oftentimes you you
get this like big dump of code into your
like upfront project and you're not
really sure what's there and you have to
go through and figure out which things
you want to take out of the archetype
once it's generated so that you can just
get down to the stuff that you really
need and forge lets you just sort of
start from something that's basic or
even start from an existing project that
you've got and add in the pieces of
functionality that you need as you go to
Collins integrations so let's try that I
would like to have jmf application just
go to jaffe or wrote and well let's make
it a web application we want a web
application sure so if we want to make a
web application Forge can do that for us
it comes with a feature called the
scaffold and the scaffold is something
that's going to take care of basically
creating your you're fully functional
most basic working java ee application
so we run the scaffold set up command
and this is an extension point in forge
so if we wanted to we could use a
scaffold that wasn't jsf but in this
case we're just going to go with the
default and show you what's there in the
built-in Forge so it's going to ask us a
few questions it's noticing that hey
you're actually working in a jar project
right now you're about to be changing
that into a war file so do you really
want to make this change Forge doesn't
do anything without your permission but
it can also assume some sensible things
because it's actually looking at the
project it's parsing its understanding
what you've got there and trying to
figure out what to do for you so we're
gonna hit yes and it asks this ok well
now we need to install the java ee AP is
because this is a java ee application so
we're just going to pick the most recent
version of those api's and you'll notice
that that's a JBoss spec dependency
there but there's nothing jboss specific
about that it's just the Java EE AP is
so that everyone can consume them from
maven not all of the api's are uploaded
from the the JCP specification so we've
taken care of like bundling those
together into one thing you can include
have all of them together and there we
are now we have a web application with a
few error pages and we have now
hibernate we have ejb we have CDI
servlet all of these things jsf or set
up for us and we haven't had to worry
about going out and finding which
dependencies to include forges than that
for us so now we are just a basic
project doing Joffe stuff and just
role-playing yaffe there's nothing fancy
or framework related in there and did
all the map and stuff and 40 for the
rest it's still pretty much empty right
because well we didn't write any code
yet right so we don't really have
anything in here yet so I would say
let's add some well JP a related stuff I
want some entities okay but well I
already feel though it's difficult
because we have to write a position that
HTML and I always forget how it looks
like exactly eclipselink or for a
hibernate for example I will stop their
comfort for said to do that for us no
just stop there yeah so Forge comes with
a bunch of java ee plugins to help us
get started in the whole process to help
us configure that various java ee
specifications in this case we can use
the persistence plugin and it's going to
walk us through the setup process so I'm
just pressing tab here and it's telling
us we have all these different providers
which one do you want to use in this
case we're going to use hibernate
because we know we're going to be
running this on jboss application server
7 which is lightning fast and it's also
going to ask us do you want to use the
new jpa to metamodel specifications this
lets you use the type safe criteria api
and how many of you guys have tried to
set that up like the type save criteria
what was your experience with that
right
not too bad well Forge can do that for
us we're not going to do that today and
it's also asking we noticed you're using
hibernate do you want to use the
hibernate specific api's like like the
formula annotation would be available if
we did this and the various other
hibernate specific things but we're not
going to do that we're just going to
stick with straight up Java EE so here
is our persistence xml file configured
for hibernate and for the jboss SAS data
source with a few default properties so
that we can see the sequel in the
console and that it's formats we can see
what's happening nicely okay so before
we move on i'm just wondering actually
just nice integration into eclipse it's
just about the klipsch or no so actually
if we wanted to we could run forge in
console it's completely standalone you
don't need to require an IDE we're
actually trying to get integrations into
like NetBeans and IntelliJ but right now
we just have Eclipse because that's who
the jboss tools project is bundling
forward to their where we're investing
some some some time to make that a
little more nice for people right
because but because it's just a well
maven project I can use it in whatever I
do I would like right so here's for
joining the terminal okay so we've got
the traditional HTML setup that's nice
well good for help us running from
entities yeah sure so I mean we're going
to be building a task tracking
application so we'll go with like the
the user of the task and we'll just be
able to make some some basic
relationships there so that users can
have tasks and we can enter things and
keep track of what people are doing when
so we can turn to the entity command and
we just say entity named user hit enter
it's going to ask us where do you want
to put this in this case we're just
going to use the default because we
don't really have a set convention that
we need to adhere to but if you had an
application you were adding a JP entity
to you could specify your own package
obviously and then we'll add a field to
this string and call it the name and
there's our string and we have getters
and setters that we're also created for
us so I guess we'll go ahead and create
the task object as well
entity named task and it sees that we
already picked this package so it
doesn't ask us that question again it's
learned from what we've we've told it
and we just go back to the field command
string named description what are we
actually doing and then filled temporal
this time and we're going to make it a
date and we're going to call this do and
then as you can see its handling putting
the annotation on this for us minor
optimization but things that could be
you know inconvenient you gotta type the
field you got to make the getters and
setters make sure the annotations in
right place and then the last field here
we're going to do is just a boolean and
we're going to say whether or not this
task is completed or not and then I
guess you should go back to the user and
make a relationship to you joined Tosh
right so we're going to go back into the
user here and now we're going to stop
the relationship between these two
objects we turn to the field command one
user generally has many tasks and we're
going to call those tasks we could
actually build an inverse relationship
here but since we don't really care to
know which task has which user we can
find that from the user it'll drop down
like this is all the tasks user has
we're just going to ignore that but as
you can see here for just providing us
tab completion so we can find the type
that we want and you know handle all the
imports for us here's our one-to-many
relationship it's already put it into a
set and generated the getters and
setters for us so I just started onerous
you do a lot of typing on the forum
online and we are still using eclipse
can I just edit my entities or other
codes in Eclipse sure so let's go back
to the task actually and we'll take this
completed field and let's do our
factoring we're going to call it see
complete we'll just get rid of d so is
this task complete and if we look at
Forge this is what Forge understands
about this entity I just LS this entity
and we can see we have
fields here so here's do description out
there it is complete so we are in sync
if I change it back it's a completed we
did not update the Gators oh it did
update getters and setters so when we do
another LS we should see completed so I
can just switch between using my ID and
using 4ch whenever I want yeah you can
edit files you can do it in text editor
if you want doesn't matter for just
going to keep keep going to your sources
to make sure it has the most up-to-date
information ok so we've got our entities
right now and I've been looking at well
the Ruby on Rails guys for example and
what ifs is very nice scaffolding
functionality where I can just say why
I've got some database tables for some
entities and give me a user user
interface and of course this isn't a
full application but at least it's on
basic cross functionality can we do that
yeah sure so since we already use the
scaffold to set this up we don't have to
run that again if you were running this
on an existing project you would just go
through these same steps you would point
forward your energies and you'd say
forge scaffold from entity use tab
completion to find what you want and in
this case we're going to use a wild card
to generate a user interface for all of
our domain objects it's going to ask us
do we want to overwrite a few files that
it created for its you know the index
that it set up for us when we install
the scaffold and then it goes ahead and
generates the XHTML javaserver faces
because that's the scaffold we're using
files and puts those into our deployment
deployed resources so we can go in here
see now we have a user and task folder
here and these are just plain jeff
hughes this is what the code that you
would have written yourself to get this
functionality I'll just plain Joffe just
plain Java code crazy looks like we have
some nice cold air and could be just run
it on the application chauffeur yeah
sure let's see we got let's drag it here
to the jboss is lightning fast server
and it is deployed right
now okay so go back over to Chrome here
localhost 8080 this was what tracker is
their application great Dennis you have
you have a desk and a user can just well
show us what we got yeah so here's the
task there's users let's go ahead and
add a user here who wants to volunteer
ok I will Paul aria sure create Paul
here and save you and then let's go
ahead give you a new task did we not
right we don't have a relationship from
tasks
interesting I think I regenerated that
relationship backwards yeah I think so
well let you mess that up Thanks okay so
what we basically have is we have just
some cross functionality based on our
entities and we didn't write the line of
code yet and of course if you want to
have our own functionality we just start
writing our own codes but it's all basic
jaffe so we all nothing special there at
least force helped us getting started
setting up made from stuff and getting
all the dependencies in getting the
configuration files etc etc right so if
I had put the task on the relationship
in the correct direction we would been
able to add the task directly from Paul
but since I didn't do that I had to
create the task and then add it to Paul
later okay that's awesome so we've got
our application deployed but I I'm not
really interested in just crude
functionality what I want in the end is
just a restful webservices many other
entities come to just create a rest
endpoint on top of that that that that
entities mm-hmm yes a forged knows how
to create restful endpoints as well it's
similar to the scaffold you just use the
rest command in this case we're going to
use tab and it looks like setup is the
only thing we can do because we haven't
actually installed rest into our
application yet so let's just open up
the web.xml file so we can see what
forge is doing here actually no sorry
let's let's not use web.xml let's make a
java application clashed to activate
West yeah because this is servlet three
we don't have to use web.xml anymore we
can just do this all from annotations so
we're going to use the application class
activator hit enter before just going to
ask us what root path we want to serve
all of our endpoints from we'll just go
with the default rest and say calm that
example that tracker is where we want to
put our application class
I'll go over here and there it is it is
just a standard lecture replication
plush that's configuration torn Jean
Jacques Torres right cool so now that we
have rest set up we can go ahead and say
rest we now have another command
available to us this is the end point
from entity command very similar to the
scaffold from entity command and we're
going to pick XML and then we're going
to go with the same two entities hit
enter and we've generated a few
endpoints so we've got over here it's
just a being a resting point with some
post delete get put the crud operations
for rest endpoints so let's go ahead and
see if this actually organized so we
have to republish because we've added
some some new services to our
application and it's done lightning fast
I'm going to laugh every time I say that
let's go ahead and add a task because we
got to do that first get something done
do yesterday save it then we'll add Paul
again and add him that task save now if
we go to the endpoint URL that we set up
we should be able to access this data so
let's copy this go to rest and then user
there we are excellent oh yeah great and
so we've got our basic application well
more or less working but there's one
other technology that I really like and
I've seen it before it's called
achillion and it enables us to do in
container integration tests and what I
didn't like about the killing is it's
very hard to set up because you have to
go to the documentation and according to
the application server that you're using
you have to well copy a bunch of XML
pulling a lot of dependencies in your
mail
eration and goal I said I settled that
up so are good porsche help us what else
yeah sure before we show up for Jess I'm
just going to go over to our Killians
website real quick and show what that
experience looks like if we get started
this is the getting started guide for
our Killian and I actually wrote that
too much not no fun that's a lot of
stuff I mean it's a very well written
guide if you follow it step by step you
will have a completely successful
application but we can definitely help
make this better so forge not only comes
with this built-in functionality but we
also have the concept of plugins where
you can extend and add new integrations
in to forge so that you can help set up
your applications okay Joe but how would
we find a plugin well how do we know we
want to use we want to do testing right
yeah so we can use Forge find plugin
test it's going to go out to the forge
central plugin repository and we see
here that we have in this case the
arquillian plugin written by you oh yeah
remember something like that and we can
just install that using the forge
install plugin command and hit enter
what Forge does actually anyone can
write a plug-in it's completely open we
didn't want to like make some
proprietary format like you need use
some like weird repository Ford uses
github when you write a plug-in it's
just a maven project it's just a CDI
project like we have been using on all
of our java ee 6 projects and it's using
the same programming model that you're
very familiar with if you've done any
java ee programming you push your plugin
out onto a github repository you point
forward with that and it can install it
and that's just one option of it
installing plugins but you can also
install from disk or whatever but the
central repository works on github you
can put your repositories up there you
can share them with everyone so now we
have the arquillian plugin installed and
we can run the setup and we know we're
using davis as7 because problem with our
killing is that is very there's a
specific implementation for each kind of
container so
you need making configuration for each
each different container mm-hmm and this
is why that guide is so long is because
there are so many different containers
that you can sit up and it needs to go
through all the different options but
we're just going to pick JBL say a seven
and forge is going to step us through
that process in a little more
streamlined manner here it's asking what
version of our killing do we want we're
going to pick the most recent and then
this is j unit and now which version of
a s7 are we using we're using 711 final
so we'll pick number 15 and we are done
arquillian setup right okay you actually
showed a public channel sure kasha
should be some some new dependencies and
it should be shown making profile sure
so the palm has CD inj unit which we
just added hibernate and here's our
Killian and down here we have the
profile for de bus as7 remote if we look
at the palm file we can see that we
actually added you're killing a bomb
file and this is the same thing that you
do in the guides we pick j unit the are
killing container and we added a profile
for jboss remote seven very cool so
let's start running tests oh well well
what if we would add work we wanted a
different container yeah sure well maybe
I would like to test in gloss officials
also uh it don't do closures right okay
what about the different jboss version
so we can run achillion set up again and
we can pick in this case huh yeah sure
when I glassfish remote 31
again we go out pick the version of the
arquillian adapter for glassfish hit
enter and pom file should be updated did
you know something that I shouldn't have
done no but anyway we can just go ahead
and work with a s7 yeah sure so I would
like to have some tests and I remember
if you have if you want to rise in a
clean test you have to create a
deployment method and I always we've got
to take the syntax so can we just
generate one so we have the air killian
plugin installed we can use our killian
create test and pick the class that we
would like to test in this case let's go
with one of our rest endpoints let's
pick the task endpoint because that
one's pretty straightforward and we're
going to enable jpa because we know we
want to go to the date the database and
do database testing as well
so now we have task in point test and
we've already got a deployment method
which is going to add persistence.xml to
the arquillian deployment for those of
you who are not familiar familiar with
our Killian it uses the concept of micro
deployments it takes some or all of the
application source files bundles them up
into a jar file deploys that unto a
running server and then runs the tests
so we can pick and choose what we want
to add in this case we're going to add
the persistence XML file we're going to
add the task endpoint class and we also
have to ask the task excuse me we also
have to add the task class otherwise
we'll have a no class to found exception
when this jar file gets deployed to the
server is there anything else we need no
I think we're good to go show well let's
write a test alright so let's run this
test Ford uses the test command and
we're going to run through and see a
huge success Oh build failed well I have
an idea why this might have failed
because we did actually enabled a maven
profile for Jo Jo seven right so because
we need to tell our Killian which
container to deploy to we're going to
pick jboss is from at seven hit enter
and this time we should have a better
result right yeah let's take a look
good point always actually makes sense
because you don't always want that stuff
in your class pots well not testing
right so here on I'm partly happy I mean
we have we have test test success but I
want green bars because I don't like
looking at Nathan outputs can we just
run this from eclipse sure but why don't
we actually make it test a little more
than just dependency injection oh sure
yeah so let's go ahead and create a new
test method test create task and we'll
go ahead and say task T equals new task
and then we're going to use our task in
point and create that this would be just
like if someone had called a rest
webservice and then once this is done we
should be able to assert that these two
are equal that there is an ID that's
been added to this task it starts off at
zero
oops
but once we've created it we should have
an ID let's go ahead and insert up here
with the idea is 0 and now because you
wanted to green wire right yeah i wanna
green bar alright let's just run this in
Eclipse when I was dating a test do this
every day ooh and we had a problem I'm
guessing this is probably that same
problem we ran into with fo yeah because
she temporarily enabled them a profile
in Nathan but he didn't actually do that
in Eclipse hmm so we run this test now
after we update our profile
oh right it's knoweth not zero tests are
already winning for us yep
and then we got a great bar b bar yeah
so that we didn't have this morning here
but all the valuable information is
actually in the server console okay
awesome Joey F are killing a setup well
the version of our nice plugins that
I've seen before and i think you you're
odometry there's some rewrites
personality that we can you turn on jhf
to have a URL rewriting it's not a
difficult to shut up but i keep on
forgetting it because you just do it
once in a project so i can forge help
yeah sure so what Paul wants to do is he
wants to clean up our URL to get rid of
these you know X HTML files we don't
really want to reveal to people that
we're using jsf in our application so
there's a tool called ocp soft rewrite
which is a rewrite filter and forge can
help us get that set up and streamlined
we're just going to do that same thing
we're going to do forge find plugin in
this case let's just search for
rewriting see what we've got out there
okay we've got pretty faces and rewrite
we're going to go with rewrite today
let's install plugin rewrite
just take the latest version and once
this is done it's going to again be able
to step us through this process of
integration where we would normally have
had to go out to you know the web in
this case we could just go to ocp soft
website and go to the rewrite project
and there's a pretty good guide they're
pretty straightforward it's five steps
but George can still make that easier
for us so here we're just installing
from the repository again through github
it downloads all the files and because
this is a maven project we're fortunate
was how to build it it takes the
artifacts and packages that up as a
plug-in
and a second we should have a prompt
back
I think we're experiencing some
conference internet here never fails
hmm
you can do it
alright so maybe you should kill this
and maybe I can just start it up again
alright
all right there we go
alright so when Ford starts up again we
should have access to the rewrite
plug-in and then we can do our
integration
nobody
so your question is what which oh right
yeah I could have all could have just
gone back and fixed the change and told
it to build the ey again oh right so it
because round-tripping UI is a little
more difficult it is going to obliterate
those changes but that's like this it
provides you template so if you change
the templates if you go out too far
outside of the box of the the forge
generated scaffolding then you're not
going to be able to go back and rerun
the scaffold command because you'll lose
that but we just want to get you to a
place where you can take this and run
with it that's the primary goal I think
the general problem its calf holding
that's well it gets your startup quickly
but after that while you're on your own
again well roux is much more spring
focused so if you're in the spring area
well then probably Ruiz video it's a
better option but if you're in a moron
Joffe site or well in general and non
spring sites then well I think forged us
better because her more plugins which
are not so integrated to spring where
the concepts are from what similar why
would you why would you pick between but
this depends on what you want to do I
mean if you want to use the spring Roo
application use spring Roo if you want
to use Java EE and you know integrate
other technologies there's actually a
spring plugin for this if we wanted to
we can just do spring setup and then you
can set up MVC and all that kind of
stuff too so like I said for does not
really tied to a specific technology
it's whatever you've got plugins for we
were actually playing around with rya
like writing ruin Forge because Ford is
like a technology superset of rue you
could just implement rue with Forge but
for just focused on you know basically a
technology integration problem making it
possible for people to go out and and
streamline the getting started and
configuration process for any technology
Oh
what's that from a from a core
standpoint Roo is more focused on pure
spraying and spraying integrations but
forges is focused on being an extendable
tool that you can use to do anything
question is essentially changes to my
else Afghanistan to prepare
does any that get messed up
absolutely not so forge forge will go
ahead it sees what you've got there it
respects everything you've already got
set up and if it sees the conflict it'll
actually asked you what you would like
to do whether you would like to override
the previous version or use the new
version that Ford wants to install right
Spartan not an open issue for the poem
file and most of the configuration files
because it's much easier to barge much
easier to will just understand so you
can do the right thing right and if you
want I can show you that so here we're
going to set up rewrite and I'm going to
go with the latest version actually now
sorry let's let's pick the version 105
final so I can show you you know
changing the pump file here we've added
our dependency for rewrite and we have
the version up here we can just go ahead
and change the version 10 final save
that and then if we go in to rewrite set
up it still says that rewrite is
installed we're still good so it's it's
reprocessed that information and done
what we want so let's go ahead and
continue we're going to create a simple
rewrite configuration so we can get rid
of our nasty urls will go ahead and put
this in the base package and we'll just
call it rewrite config hit enter and my
class up here be right config
is right there so maybe you can add a
basic rule to just show that it works
mm-hmm so notice here we already have
this configuration provider this is how
their configuration and rewrite is set
up it's done that for us and now we can
just start writing our rules so we can
just add rule we're going to join the
root URL to the the faces internal
resource index dot H XHTML and since
we're changing this URL we don't want
the old links to continue sending people
there so we want to actually fix it if
someone tries to access this this this
now out of date link and we're going to
send them to the new place using inbound
correction so if I go back to our
application I believe I did not need to
redeploy this if i hit enter again here
we should be sent back to the new URL no
I need to read the boy
okay we saw a rewrite startup that time
there we go now if we look at all the
links on the page they've all been
updated if you look at the bottom left
there to use the new address and we can
go ahead and add these for the other
pages just as easily but we want to show
some other stuff well I think I've seen
enough about configuring frameworks in
configuring Yaffe and etc but well there
was a mother kind of configuration that
you often eat in projects like our new
boss he wants us to use well tools like
checkstyle fine bucks just to do some
marcos quality measurements and I mean I
like those tools participate in the s2
too well just set up because she needed
me and plugins and there's a lot of
concrete info so that's kind of
complicated is it possible there is a
plug-in for that in unfortunate yeah
sure actually already already have that
one installed in this case I think it's
the code quality plugin and again we
just go through the setup process now
we're going to do check style and if we
open our palm here we can see what's
going to happen we can go with the
version 13 and then newest version of
the site plugin we look down here now we
have the maven site plugin with check
style right because in maven tree first
inside plugin and when you use the site
command in that you can use plugins
again to configure what exactly it
should do right
so we're actually going to get to see
that how Ford resolves versions in just
a moment but it is going out to the
repositories you've configured in your
palm hierarchy awesome so maybe we can
get me also add another plugin coat coat
checking plugin may be fine bucks sure
because just want to see if it doesn't
mess up the side plugin let's just see
what we got here there's our charities
run it yeah o gg gg so yeah if we wanted
to add another tool we could probably
add no a fine bugs that we go on it sure
36 and stick a look at the boom file
again Tom file has been updated and the
site plug-in has been updated to use now
both check style and find bugs so we got
to keep our existing configuration i
shelled out a whole list of plugins
available here mm-hmm welfare cool and
I've started be wondering that well
there are so many plugins and there
seems to be a plugin for everything will
it be difficult to just write a plug-in
myself well so I mean I guess we could
just take a look at that we got about 20
minutes left let's make a new plugin I
think it's it's pretty much the same
process we go ahead and set up a new
project so what shall we do let's take
plug in debt for four per unit testing
that shut up each team aqua rush ok so a
plug-in that sets up easy mark so this
is going to go out I guess it needs to
find find the dependency and then added
that to the pom file yeah exactly and
maybe later on generation test code
alright so easy mark new plug new
project name easy mark and like all the
other technology integrations in forge
this one comes built in we just do
plug-in setup and it's going to go ahead
and ask us which version of the api's we
want to use which version of the forge
api's we want to use in this case the
latest version show you actually just
created a new project mm-hmm
and i just created a new plugin project
rights and a plugin project basically
just and not our maven projects mhm
nothing special about it here's the palm
file all standard so if we wanted to
make a new plugin we can go back to our
plugins command and we have the new
plugin command available as to us now
that the api's have been installed in
for understands that this is a plug-in
project forge new plugin named in this
case we'll call it easy mock and we go
up here here's our plugin and we also
have a test case that's been generated
for us so that we can see the basic
functionality and just how to how this
plugin would be interacted with just to
get people started if they're not
already familiar with the the show API
and how to interact with that right so
maybe you should take a look at this
goes national man rotation shashi have
to start with us an alias annotation
what else to do so the alias annotation
that is telling forge the name of this
command is easy mark when you type it in
the command line that's how it does
autocompletion that's how it how it's
going to show up when you actually lists
all the commands out so if I went back
to forge here and press tab without
anything here this is where easy mark
would show up okay cool and damages have
to implement the plug-in interface
initiation at inject it suggests basic
CDI yeah I solo from java chat program
ford is implemented entirely using CDI
the CDI programming model you can create
new beans you can inject them use that
whole design to create Forge plugins and
that's even how you access forges
internal ap is that it exposes to
plugins cool so I'm actually using the
setup commands on most plugins so maybe
you can create a set of commands that
actually installs the easy mark
dependencies to the maven pump well sure
so we get the set up command we use the
set up command annotation and we're
going to put that on a new my new
command method public void whatever or
let's call it you know do that all set
up
enter and so we need to what we need to
install the dependency yeah checking
right so to install a dependency we're
going to go out to the forge ap is we're
going to ask for an instance of the
dependency installer the dependency
installer is how you add things to the
pom file it takes care of querying for
what versions are available it looks at
the repositories in the pom file and
that's how you get access to all of the
maven repositories so we're going to do
installer and when we set up we're just
going to installer dot install oh but we
also need an instance of the project so
we're going to ask Forge to give us the
project that we're currently working on
add that and then we need the dependency
that we're working on so we'll use the
dependency builder to create a new
instance of org easy mock easy mark is
your marking up that is just a maven
coordinate and do have to specify
anything a lot of version here no
because again it's going to do that
version query so we're just going to go
out look with what's available to us and
then in Alaska switch version we want to
install when we run this right okay can
actually install it into force and just
try it out sure so let's go back to the
root of the project and then just say
forge install me from sources oops sorry
wrong command forge source plugin it
does a build in this case it doesn't
have to go to github because all the
sources are local and we have success
hopefully we start up again this time
good now we should be able to run the
easy mount command nice so well let's
execute it and see what happens sure oh
yeah that's the list versions so this
actually came from the maven remote
report storage and just get a versions
or from the right from there yeah nice
so we hit enter and now we see that
forges updated or palm file and we can
go in and confirm as easy mark and it
was just basically a one line of code
mm-hmm to get it working yep to do that
that's all we had to do okay let's try
something more difficult than i would
like to Africa mount in our new plugin
that can actually generate a desk loss
for us okay well just so we make sure we
don't miss use this plugin let's add
this project scoped annotation which
means that you can only use this if
you're currently working on a project
because I don't think this really makes
much sense outside of that because we're
going to be asking the project to get a
sources and if you ran this just sort of
like out in the open you'd get an error
and nobody likes errors right so that's
actually going to do two things it's
going to
prevent people from from running this
command without a project so I could
actually go back into my home directory
here and i can run easy mock and i think
i'm pretty sure we're going to get an
exception if i run the setup commands
because there's no project of active so
that's what this is going to prevent so
let's go ahead and now add this method
that's going to do our setup we want to
generate a test class yes and one in
generalized s plus I want to make sure
that the name of the new desk Klaus is
just not the random name that I wanted
to be named like the test we are going
to test repent it with test and that
should be it so that's mean we need to
assume input from the user because we
have to ask the user what class do you
want to test right so to get input from
the users now we specify some options
for our command in this case we want the
test class so we're going to ask for the
test class or the class under test right
yeah that's good and then this is
probably something that's important for
running this command so i'll make it
required and that can actually be we
like this auto completion that we've
been seeing yeah that would be awesome
so we can actually get auto completion
by using the the prompt type and tell it
that we're looking for a Java class so
that that is will actually look at our
project Luke for java classes and just
give us that thatís ultimately
autocomplete options right and why do I
have oh yeah okay so I need to say what
this variables called and forge is
actually going we could eat we could
just ask for a string here but since we
want oops that's what's wrong now but we
don't just want an able to collage girls
we want like package information and
stuff like that so right so we want to
be able to actually inspect what's in
the class in that case let's use a Java
resource and we're just going to give us
a handle to that source file in the
project and we'll be able to get more
information out of it so a job for
resources more or less just a file
mm-hmm right and kind of interest
that like something like reflection like
yeah so we can actually ask Forge to
parse that okay and get the Java source
from that class or from that file and
once we have a handle the source we can
go ahead and say at it we can modify it
we can get annotations imports get the
package we can check to see if imports
there we can see if it has methods if
the public-private protected all that
kind of stuff so basically full
introspection of this class not great
show um but we want to use your
information to actually create a new
class should let's just start writing a
new plot alright so to create a new
class we go to the java parser api and
we say create in this case we know we
want to class because it's going to be a
Jane at test and should have a name it
probably needs a name yeah so will the
name should be well we should get a name
from the test in your collage alright so
we want to make it like class under test
test right yeah check out alright so we
go to the source of our class under test
and get the name and add test to it okay
and I think it should be in the same
package ashta the other cloth right so
again we go to source get package and
there we are and we probably want to
body a new method write a test method
yeah probably it would be nice to have
well like an empty shut up method I've
gotta add before annotation on top of it
alright so let's go ahead and add a
method to this new test class will call
it in it and then we'll add an
annotation to it and that annotation is
going to be org j unit before war ok and
actually if i wanted to i could probably
just go here and add j units my my
dependencies right so i could go here
stearic would write it in a type
driveway yeah so let's just use the type
safe way of doing this dependency
everybody is or got to a unit and then
artifact ID Jane it version
fourth
best
obviously you're the question is are we
going to put the test class in the same
actual folder as the test does the
source file good question we'll see that
just a sec so now that I have do I not
have the right jnet dependency
there we go all right so let's change
this to the actual before annotation so
we can do this in a nice type safer
factorable way and now as you are you
were asking hang on a second let's go
ahead and add a body to this too yeah it
should just be an empty body but yeah
alright so this method is not going to
do anything okay so this is basically a
description of one description of the
new plush we should probably shave it
somewhere alright so let's go about it
to a file let's go ahead and this is the
test source so we want to put this file
like you said in the appropriate maven
package so source tests java instead of
source main java so we're going to ask
forge now to inspect our project we have
a handle the project already and using
this concept of facets we can say get
the facet that represents the java
source java resources so we can get the
java java source facet yeah java source
facet dot class and then now we can
actually just i think just save this
test source yep into the right package
and it's going to use the introspection
api to see where that class what that
classes packaging is just going to make
a new file and save it there well okay
so let's try it out alright so let's go
ahead and run this
install this plugin again
oh we have a problem
alright apparently we don't have j unit
today so let's just do this the other
way
will sacrifice our type safety in favor
of the Oracle Internet reinstall
and and once this is running let's just
make a new class so we can see how this
works because we already have a test
class and our project let's not make
another test class will call this oh
c'mon we'll call this example class
that's just empty and we are going to
make a new test so we have the easy mock
we already have it set up so let's make
a new test class under test here's our
tab completion and now we've got example
class hit enter there's our test very
cool so you can see it's well just
basically a few minutes of work to get
started with writing your own plugins
and she know community doing that
there's a bunch of luggage for like well
all kind of frameworks and technologies
that this out there that's pretty cool
we have like three minutes left show
let's rip the shop and have some time
for questions alrighty so we did a bunch
of things today what just happened so we
used plugins Ford is all about plugins
if there's not a plug and it does
something that you want as you saw it's
pretty straightforward to get started in
making one but it also comes with like a
strong set of plugins right out of the
box to help you get set up with java ee
spring you know a whole bunch of
technologies there's things that i've
written that other people have written
for other third-party libraries we
really want to solve this problem of
like the getting started and getting
integrated thing that's what Forge is
all about so if you want to plug in see
if it's there if it's not there add it
get your name out there put it into the
repository it's a great opportunity we
wrote plugins plugins have a very nice
architecture for introspecting the
project with very well-defined chunks of
functionality I guess called the facets
like we sell the Java resource bassett
that's forges way of saying this piece
of functionality is in this project if
I'm there then you can do anything you
want that I provide so facets provide
functionality for specific set of
features and plugins can depend on
facets facets
independent other facets and you can
build up a whole network of you know
really actually complicated operations
in a very nicely encapsulated way we ate
plugins they're delicious and that's an
empty slide is that the end absolutely
not this is the beginning hopefully if
your adventure with Forge thank you all
for joining us some feedback that we've
gotten from various people forges the
Eclipse of command shells this guy
apparently loves Forge and it's much
easier than writing maven plugins it
takes the cruft out of crud we can just
get something really simple up there
really quickly for those little like
one-off applications that we make or if
you want to start something more
complicated and integrate technology and
distributing plugins with get really
makes it available for everyone like
this is the totally open project we want
to just get this out there and get
everyone involved and if you want more
information there these are the
references from the talk but also please
check out the arquillian getting started
guide if you want to learn more about
our Killian if you want to learn about
how to use jboss technologies check out
the jboss developer framework there's a
whole lot of information on getting
started there and they're focused on
Forge and there's of course on the Ford
website an entire guide dedicated to
writing plugins to help step you through
the entire process so please stay in the
loop join us we want to hear your
feedback thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
