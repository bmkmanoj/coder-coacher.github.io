content and experience cloud the people
you collaborate with may need to view
and work with files and various folders
in the cloud
to help them do this you can share
folders or files in two ways you can add
people as folder members
or send them a link to the file or
folder you want to share
if you want to add a member to a folder
just click members in the top menu
the person you want to add must be
someone who uses Oracle content and
experience cloud
when you add them to the folder you
choose if they can view or download
items in the folder or if they have the
rights to contribute items or even
manage other members of the folder if
you want to send a link to a specific
file click the share icon next to the
file or click share link in the top or
contextual menus you can then copy the
link or list the people you want to send
a link to that's it the default options
are used based on what your
administrator specified public links are
great if you're collaborating with
someone in your organization who does
not have an account on Oracle content
and experience cloud or even if they are
outside of your organization
when using a public link you can edit
the link options to give rights to view
download or contribute to the file or
folder you can also set the link to
expire so that a person's access is
revoked after a certain date you can
even require a passcode to use the link
so if you want to remove a person's
access you can change the passcode
you can also specify if anyone can use
the link or if they have to be a user of
Oracle content and experience cloud if
made available to anyone then the access
history records the name of the link
when it is used if only available to
registered users then they must log in
and their name is registered in the
access history
you could also send a members-only link
to registered users edit the link
options to allow a member to download
the file directly when the link is
clicked provided the member has the
rights to download items from the folder
or to open the file in a browser when
the link is clicked this is a useful way
to encourage people to review and
discuss items online using the items
conversation thanks for watching for
