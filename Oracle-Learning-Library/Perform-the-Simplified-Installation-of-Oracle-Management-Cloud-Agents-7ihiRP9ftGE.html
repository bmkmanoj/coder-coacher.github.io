easily and quickly install agents in
your IT estate the new Oracle management
cloud setup is part of a much more
simplified IT environment with less
agents involved however if you opt to
use Enterprise Manager cloud control you
can use data collector agents to inform
your Oracle management cloud platform
about your IT environment or
environments the new agent installation
covers any combination of an agent type
like a gateway data collector or cloud
agent plus an operating system such as
Linux or Windows agent binaries are now
tenant agnostic and platform specific
therefore during installations the
tenant ID parameter can be passed to
install the agent against that tenant ID
the download page is also a more
user-friendly it allows you to save your
agent bit anywhere including shared
locations your agent bit download
includes everything you need for the
entire installation simply select your
agent type and operating system and
download away one of the most
significant improvements is the
implementation and use of the response
file it has a user-friendly structure
highlighting what parameters are
mandatory according to each installation
type and even providing examples of what
type of parameter values are to be
expected you can also reuse parameters
already saved in this file for
subsequent installations lastly thanks
to this file you type shorter commands
that are less prone to human errors
during installations we've also added a
multiple layer prerequisite checker that
will help you detect any issues or
environment specific issues last but not
least our error messages are more
human-friendly
you can easily comprehend the issue and
therefore focus your attention we're
troubleshooting is needed you can
perform the agent installation and three
simple steps one download the agent
installer to execute the agent installer
script and three confirm that you had a
successful installation to complete this
demo we must have access to Oracle
management cloud we will need to provide
values for 10 and ID upload route agent
registration key in agent base directory
parameters let's start by downloading
the agent installer here we'll use a
cloud agent binary zip file for a Linux
platform execute this REST API call to
download the zip file using Korell
verify the checksum of the downloaded
file matches to what the server has this
confirms that we have a full and healthy
download you may want to save your agent
installers any shared location like a
host or share the folder here the agents
are stored under OMC underscore agents
let's unzip the agent installer we are
now ready for step number two executing
the installation script for the cloud
agent we begin by preparing the response
file let's open it up and first let's
take a quick look at the entire file to
start there's the mandatory parameters
section which is required for all agent
installations the next section includes
mandatory parameters that are needed for
the data collector installations there's
an on mandatory proxy parameter section
here for example if your agents are
communicating with the Oracle management
cloud platform through a proxy then
values must be provided for these
parameters the rest of the file includes
additional non mandatory parameters that
are common for all agent installations
or particular to cloud agents or data
collector installations now going back
to the mandatory parameter section for
our installation we need to input the
tenon ID this is provided in the welcome
email from Oracle or from your
administrator the upload would value can
be found from your browser copy and
paste everything up to the port number
the age and registration
key can be obtained in the agents UI
page
select the tab
registration Keys first we create a
registration key
then we copy and paste it into the
response file last but not least we need
to provide the agent base directory this
is where the agent resides on the host
machine let's save this file now I need
to create the base directory on the host
machine with the appropriate write
permissions it is important to note that
the agent install user or root user must
be the owner of the directory only they
have the right permissions and the
directory must be empty back to my agent
installation folder now we can execute
the agent install script our
installation should run smoothly but in
case we receive errors first we learn
details about the error then we modify
our response file looks like we do have
an error with the registration key it's
open the response file and compare our
key with the one provided by Oracle
management cloud there is the problem
not all characters were included let's
fix this by making sure the entire key
is pasted
save and run the installer again
you
the installation script was executed
successfully to complete the
installation we need to run the route
that Sh script
the third and
of status to confirm that we completed a
successful installation first we check
that Oracle management cloud detects the
newly installed cloud agent
then we execute to Oracle management
cloud commands status agent and status
agent connectivity the status agent
command shows a list of properties for
the new agent let's pay close attention
to last successful upload and last
attempted upload dates they both
coincide the status agent connectivity
command shows that there are no
significant issues with connections
associated with the agent and Oracle
management cloud now we've confirmed
that we had a successful installation
this concludes that we have successfully
performed the agent installation by
following the three simple steps thank
