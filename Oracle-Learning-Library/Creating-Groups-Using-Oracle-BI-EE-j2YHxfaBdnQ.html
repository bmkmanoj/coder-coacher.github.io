I'm a sales manager and I want to review
how much revenue was generated for
mobile devices but I still want to be
able to compare it to other product
types I know that I can modify the
existing fulfillment by quarter analysis
to provide me with the detail that I
need I want to be able to share this
analysis with my sales consultant who is
responsible for the mobile devices first
I must find the analysis I recently
created the fulfillment by quarter
analysis therefore it is available in
the recent heading of the homepage I
select edit I want to create a group for
mobile devices I know that I can create
a group on the results tab so I click
the new group button in the toolbar just
above the compound layout in the new
group dialog I enter mobile only in the
display label field I select products
product-type in the values from list the
available pane shows all available
product types
I select phones I hold the ctrl key down
and then I select smartphones I click
the move button to move both phones and
smartphones from the available pane to
the selected pane I click OK the mobile
only group is added to the analysis I
need to save the update and analysis I
click Save I modified the fulfillment by
quarter analysis by adding a new group
for mobile devices I can use this
analysis to immediately see how well
mobile devices are doing compared with
other product types I can also share
this analysis with my sales consultant
who is responsible for this product type
having an analysis specifically tailored
by product type can help my Sales
Consultants focus on where they need to
improve and signal where they have
excelled in meeting their goals thanks
