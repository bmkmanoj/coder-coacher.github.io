providing insight into the mysteries of
implementing oracle stream analytics on
a local cloud service compute instance
so here we have some applications
running on OS a we have one here that's
executing in the public cloud on compute
on the right-hand side of your screen on
the left here we have a version of a
telematics use case using our spatial
pattern analyzing the data on my
localhost this spatial pattern is
feeding the results of that spatial
analysis into this exploration Here I am
just selecting Adam filtering only the
status value that has information
provided part of the spatial analytics
then I'm going to push that information
to a target and in this case that target
is using rest and I've defined a rest
target here and as you can see I'm using
the public IP address of my version of
OS a running on the Oracle cloud service
compute you can see some of the other
artifacts that have created as part of
this telematics analytics use case and
what we're looking at here is actually
racing cars moving around a track in the
united states and their verse positions
in relation to certain areas on the
track and again here on the right-hand
side you'll see in the information only
of late into the status values being
sent up to the cloud so how did I create
my OS a cloud service compute instance
first of all I signed on to the Oracle
cloud providing my domain name and also
my user ID and password
now I can see my dashboard of the
various cloud services that came when I
requested the trial of the Oracle
compute here specifically is information
about that Oracle compute would take a
look at the more information provided on
the dashboard as an overview here let's
open the service console for my
instances that I created on a compute so
I actually created two instances here
during my evaluations I'm actually using
the second one which is a relatively
small compute instance it uses two CPUs
and some high memory allocation if we
look in more specific details of the
shape and definitions are used on the
cloud compute specifically here you can
see below the shape was was using the
two CPUs and the high memory allocation
using two CPUs and in CC here this is
the memory allocation that was provided
when I created the instance and i used
the 67 linux version as my image for
creating this instance for volumes i
created a specific volume of one hundred
and fifty gigabytes give me plenty of
space and here you can see i set up my
security lists and my public keys using
putty gen utility had to give me the
private and public keys that are needed
for this cloud service
once I have my definition and my
instance running I then set up my party
to connect to this cloud service compute
instance hearings to the IP address and
I'm going to step you down through now
the various options that I defined for
this party definition to access my cloud
instance for instance i use the OPC user
and here you can see where i defined my
private key to access the cloud service
and other options relating to being able
to tunnel use the tunneling function of
patty which i use in my real VNC desktop
access which i'll show you in a moment
ok this is the port and the information
that I need as part of my VNC server
connection using my client he even see
my console and a few pointers here and
what I did and when I actually set up
this cloud compute the root file system
/ was a little bit small for me so I
extended that provided a larger version
of the disk for me Chris the file system
I also increased the swap system and
added a amounted a new disk on my /
mount / door file system if we look here
by fdisk you can see here I added a few
partitions extra petitions on this
instance to give me more space and
plenty of this space to install the
features that I wanted on this compute
okay to use my VNC server my client my
v2 client installed the software using
young and also installed the browser
Mozilla browser as well and openoffice
also on this computer instance if I
wanted to use that as well we take a
look at the setup for my VNC server
there you go the process number and the
fact i'm using the colon one display
option so i said that display variable
before i started my VNC server okay with
that running i was now able to go to my
v2 and connect using that public IP
address to my cloud service compute
instance okay let me provide the
password here for my OPC user on my
desktop and now you can see my desktop
is running on my compute with the OSA
server started installed and running and
executing and allowing me to build
applications not only on premise but
also now on this Oracle cloud service
compute using the rest interface I
family performance relatively good and
was able to send the data efficiently
performant lee up to my OS a running on
the OS X now compute and hearing see the
information again as a data is driven
from my local host machine my notebook
doing that filtering just on the status
code
providing the spatial analytics
information and that's been pushed up to
the OSA application running on the
Oracle cloud service compute
