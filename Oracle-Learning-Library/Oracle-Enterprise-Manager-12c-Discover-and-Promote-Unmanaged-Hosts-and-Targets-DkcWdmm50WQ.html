hello and welcome to our Oracle
Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series this demonstration shows you
how you can use Oracle Enterprise
Manager Cloud Control to discover hosts
on your network Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c contains all
new automatic discovery capabilities
including the ability to discover hosts
on the network as well as services
running on loose host and then to
automatically deploy an agent on those
hosts and finally to automatically
discover targets of them enterprise
managers auto discovery capabilities
allow users to discover unmanaged hosts
and targets on those hosts and quickly
and easily get them under management in
enterprise manager so to begin with
we'll go to configure auto-discovery
which is under the setup at targets menu
and what we'll see is that there are
essentially two types of discovery agent
less and agent-based agent lists
leverages an existing agent that's been
deployed already and to actually do an
IP scan of the network and I can choose
one or more agents in the same scan
definition and give them different IP
ranges to allow for very large scanning
capabilities and so we'll look at this
definition very quick here you can see
that this one has one agent that it's
using and it's been assigned a
particular IP range which can be
discrete IPS cidr notation or dash and
comma separated it's also configured
with an out of the box set of services
and default ports but users can quickly
select those and change them to meet
their internal best practices and
requirements and thus can be can be
submitted immediately and also run on a
regular basis and we can see here the
discovery this time last time found 36
new targets these would be targets that
would not already beat under management
enterprise
the output of both the agentless and
agent-based discovery is in auto base or
auto-discovery results and here we see a
more detailed list of the same host that
were discovered in that IP skin
including their IP address their
operating system and the service names
that were running on them now to simply
get this host under management by
enterprise manager I can select one or
more of these and they can be different
platforms at the same time and I click
on the promote button which would take
me to the agent push wizard wizard to
automatically deploy the agent to those
posts and get them under management once
the agent has been deployed it for those
targets that support auto-discovery the
discovery scripts are executed and the
discovered software on those hosts is
automatically reported back to
enterprise manager and you can see here
it's a long list of you know hundreds or
thousands in this case of potential
targets that have been discovered on
already managed hosts to get this
particular database under management all
I need to do is follow the same
methodology which is the click on the
promote button which would take me to
the agent or to the database wizard but
this time or database add wizard which
would already be pre-populated with the
information that was automatically
discovered this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
