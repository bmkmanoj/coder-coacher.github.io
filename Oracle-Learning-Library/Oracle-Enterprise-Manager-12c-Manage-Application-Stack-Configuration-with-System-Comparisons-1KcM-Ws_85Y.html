Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series grid control 12g allows
users to compare configuration of
targets and systems and control how that
comparison is done by use of a
comparison template in this view that
we're going to focus on the comparison
of systems and the unique challenges
that and differences in that are that
are available for you in the comparison
template so to begin with let's look at
a consistent comparison template so in
this view that I've built a custom
configuration template called I for a
fictitious application called ice and
it's of a generic system type so let's
look at the contents of a system
template versus a data bar an instance
component target instance template and
so what we see here is that very similar
to a all target types a system may have
specific properties and these properties
may be things like lifecycle environment
and cost Center which are going to vary
across the lifecycle environments so you
need the ability to ignore specific
properties of the system which in this
case we're ignoring the lifecycle
environment and the cost center so when
we are going to be comparing two systems
of this type it will ignore those
specific target properties a new tab a
tab unique to the system type template
is the member settings tab and the
member settings tab allows the users to
choose what template to use when
comparing targets that are members of
the system and basically allowing you to
control what configuration is compared
of those component systems so in the
case of database instance let's say if
the database instance
is a member of this system then it's
going to use this template the corporate
database instance template and secondly
a new concept is this target property
for matching now when we go to compare
systems we're not just comparing single
instance targets Enterprise Manager 12c
needs a way to match automatically
targets between two systems and those
systems may have varying numbers of
targets of that particular type so if we
now we can manually map during the
comparison specification setup we'll see
in a second between the two systems - -
which targets to compare to each other
if we want to do it in an automated way
we can simply choose one of the existing
properties the target properties and in
this case what I've done is I've used
the comment field and I've set the
comment field for all the database
instances in all of the targets systems
to contain the same text in this case
ice i seee
that way it will know how to come they
will know to compare all the databases
in one system to the database on in the
second system here so those are the
unique aspects of a system comparison
template let's see how we go about
comparing systems and using this
particular template so again we'll go
back to configuration comparison and
this time we will choose a generic
system I have two generic systems here
one is QA and one is production in the
QA system we have one database instance
and in this in the production we have
two probably a very common scenario so
again we'll search and we'll choose the
second entire system to compare and next
we'll get to the again just like with a
single instance target type we get to
choose a template of that the
systems type which in this case is
generic and you can see here that we can
see the template that we're going to use
when we compare the databases and also
the comment field used for matching
those particular properties now this
again is a new option when comparing
systems is the mapping and you can see
what's happened here is that it's
telling us what targets it's going to
map and compare when comparing across
these two systems so you can see what
it's done is that there's one database
in the QA environment but there's two
iced one and iced two in the second and
because I told it to use the comment
field it's it knows to compare the the
ice in the QA environment to ice one and
also compare ice in the QA environment
to ice two so automatically I have
mapped and the rest of the targets
actually are the same name so it's
automatically knows how that line income
will compare those by default if I
wasn't using that comment field I could
simply click on this create mapping and
it would allow me to manually choose
which targets get mapped across these
particular systems let's go ahead and
submit this job and see the results here
we can see the results are different so
let's take a look and again we can see
that you know we have a difference but
when comparing the ice database to the
ice one database let's take a look at
the same in the generic systems just to
see how the properties ignoring worked
so you can see that here they're equal
but that's because we're not showing
ignore differences and in fact you can
see that the lifecycle status and cost
center are different but we're being
ignored because of the configuration of
the system comparison template
and again looking at the databases we'll
go back and look at the same the
instance information is showing that one
is an archive log mode and one is not
but again we are ignoring multiple
properties because of the comparison
template that we chose in the
configuration of a system template
itself this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
