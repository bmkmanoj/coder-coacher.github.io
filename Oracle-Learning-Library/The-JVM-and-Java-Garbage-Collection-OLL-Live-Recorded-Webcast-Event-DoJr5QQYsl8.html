curriculum developer and Oracle in the
Java group and today we're going to talk
a little bit about how Java garbage
collection works both on some of the
older garbage collectors that come with
Java like the you know five and six and
seven of course and then we're going to
talk about the g1 garbage collector a
little bit as well so let me get started
here so first we have our standard
disclaimer if I make any future coining
statements or anything like that this is
your standard disclaimer that Oracle
reserves right as far as when we try
those features etc etc so please read
through that if you're interested in
that so while you're doing that I am
going to talk through a little bit about
the prerequisites for this course or
this talk and basically we just you just
need to have a little Java programming
experience you know to understand like
objects and things like that you don't
really need a lot to understand this
we're mainly talking about the internal
of the garbage collector so it should be
a good topic for just about anybody and
then I will be doing some command line
stuff but but not a heck of a whole lot
not super complicated or anything and
then um all the features I'm talking
about well when it gets to the g1
garbage collector that requires at least
Java 7 update 4 and then of course when
we prefer that you use the latest
version um and when we add up yesterday
when we did this did the dry run for
this presentation the latest was Java 7
update 25 actually Java 7 update 40 came
out yesterday so that would actually be
the latest but if you want to do
anything in here or in the OBE need to
use the latest version of Java 7 and we
also will be using something there at
the the bottom you can see visual VM and
the visual GC plug and visual VM comes
with the Java JDK so that's a free free
tool that comes with all versions of
Java ok
and I see a lot of people are answering
those polls appreciate that so continue
to do that and I am going to start with
their talk so first I'm going to do just
a little bit of an overview very quickly
to hone in on what we're going to talk
about we're talking about the java
language just briefly and then look at
the java hotspot the JVM architecture
and then we're going to focus in on what
parts of the JVM we're going to talk
about today so as we know Java is an
object-oriented programming language
that's a improvement upon C and C++ the
one of the main features and what we'll
be talking about today is the automatic
garbage collection so in a language like
C if you allocate objects in your job to
deallocate objects whereas in java that
is automatic and that's the garbage
collector takes care of that and that's
what we're going to talk about today and
of course Java is compiled into bytecode
which is you know class Wells we're all
familiar with that which makes Java
cross-platform so that it will run on
pretty much any operating system or
hardware platform and of course any java
application runs in its own java virtual
machine so here is a picture of what the
JVM internals look like we have our
various parts the class loader system
upload their class files we have um for
method area are he the threads the
native interfaces native threads that
our execution engine which has a JIT
compiler and a garbage collector so
today I'm not going to focus too much on
the JIT compiler oh not at all actually
I'm going to focus just on the heat
that's where we store our objects and
then the garbage collector thing that
manages those those objects in memory
for us
so to start with I'm going to go over a
little bit of just basic garbage
collection concepts a little bit and
then we'll go specifically into the Java
generational garbage collection
collectors so basically your garbage
collectors job is basically to allocate
new memory objects and then once we have
those objects in memory we want to
ensure that we can keep track of the
wide ones we don't believe those by
accident and then if we have any that we
aren't using anymore then we delete
those and get rid of those in a timely
manner so this wide shows one of the
first concepts I want to mention which
is called marking so one of the main
jobs of the garbage collector is to go
through memory and identify which
objects are alive and which are not
so that's what this picture is trying to
show so the first picture is our memory
before we marked it so just have objects
there we don't know what's what then
when the garbage collector goes through
and marks the memory we have live
objects and then unreferenced or unwire
not live objects that we mark so the
live ones are blue and the ones that are
not are a red so then after we've
identified which objects are no longer
reference and we have to go through and
delete them or in a sweeping stage of
some sort and get rid of them so this
this particular picture shows that we've
gone through and we've deleted all the
objects in other words we have pointers
to where our free spaces are in memory
so if we want to allocate new objects we
have a data structure that points to
where we to put them now this is one way
of doing that there's the other way to
do that is to take a little more time
and actually compact your memory so this
slide shows compacting so if you take a
little more process your time and go
through your memory and then compact the
live objects move them to the front of
your memory then that allows you to
allocate
a lot easier because you don't have to
keep track of all open spaces or all
contiguous in your memory so by
contacting or compacting memory we can
allocate to new objects a lot faster so
why use generational TC so we just use
their principles we talked about we
would have to go through and look at
every piece of memory every time we
needed to to reclaim some of our unused
er our non live objects and this was nor
typical object behavior there's been a
lot of studies done on this and it turns
out for most applications the objects
are tend to not live long they tend to
have very short lives to allocate and
they not used a lot so they go away very
quickly so generational garbage
collection takes takes advantage of this
fact and try to improve performance
based on this concept that most objects
don't live long so what does a
generational garbage collector look like
this is kind of what well this is what
the memory looks like what we do is we
partition the memory into various spaces
so we have what's called young
generation and that's where new objects
are allocated and since they live they
don't tend to live long they tend most
objects tend to be allocated be
allocated in that space then we have old
generation or tenure generation then
you'll see both terms used that's where
long-lived objects that's what we keep
though that tends to be bigger than the
young generation and of course keeps the
the older alignment live objects then
finally we have the permanent generation
and that stores basically metadata and
that sort of information and it doesn't
it doesn't change as much as the other
two it's kind of more static than the
other two areas
so if we zoom in or look a little bit
closer at the young generation we'll see
that that's broken into a couple
different areas so we have the space
called the Eden space and that's where
we allocate new objects so any object
that's allocated goes into the Eden
space so it'll go there and then we have
two other young generation spaces called
the survivor spaces and these will be
referred to there they have two names
kind of the because if we call the from
space or the to space but they're
generally labeled if you look at any
monitoring tools or anything will be
labeled s 0 and s 1 and I've got some
slides here we'll go through and explain
how the from and the two works and then
I think you'll get a handle for that
then of course we saw the old and the
permanent areas
okay so young generation space that's
where most of our garbage collection
takes place garbage collections are
frequents um and they typically are fast
because we're not dealing with that many
objects there's their shortlist and we
can do garbage collections quickly and
these garbage collections are called
minor garbage collections they don't
take a lot of time the old generation
space is for lot you know old objects
and it tends to be a little bit bigger
than young generation and it grows more
slowly but it can be less tend to get
bigger because it keeps all the live
objects and it's been a bit around in
your application for a long time we
garbage collections on this area tend to
take quite a bit longer and so they're
called nature garbage collections and we
want to try to minimize or avoid those
if we can if we want our applications to
be really responsive so this slide we're
just watching and looking at so we've
got young generation that's where new
objects go
and we'll talk about the aging process
but eventually the long-lived objects
will end up in old generation and young
generation garbage collections are
called minor garbage collections and old
generation garbage collections are
called major garbage collections okay so
we're going to talk about next is the
process of allocating and aging objects
in the young generation area or the
young yeah the young generation area so
this picture shows our three areas so at
the top here we've got the even space
then below we've got F 0 and F 1 or 2
survivor spaces so we allocate new
objects into the even space until it
fills up when the eating space is full
that triggers a minor garbage collection
well this is a stop the world event the
stop the world event is defined as event
where all the application threads in
your application stop so of course we
want to make as short as possible so
that your application can continue
executing so all younger minor garbage
collections are stopped the world events
so anyway so we've just triggered that
this picture shows that our eating space
is full and we can't we don't have any
room for that so I'm going to do a minor
garbage collection so the next step
we're going to go through and do our
marking which I talked about earlier so
if that we've identified the live
objects and anything that's alive we're
going to rent 8 and we're going to put
on a survivor space so notice I have
four objects here and I'm putting them
on a survivor space and notice that I've
put an age on them so these all have an
age of 1 now they survive one minor
garbage collection and then if we look
at the next slide we'll see that I put
call this part to a because after after
you
your garbage collection and have copied
stuff over the eating space is cleared
and the other survivor space is cleared
so in this case we didn't have anything
on it but we'll see as we move through
the aging process that we will actually
be flip-flopping between the two
survivors bases so let's go on to the
next step so we go to our next minor
garbage collection so once again we're
allocating objects to the Eden space and
you can see here this then we have to
live objects now notice if you look at
the survivor spaces I've got a from and
a to label on them this time so f 0 is
the from and s1 is the two so any
objects that survived on the old
survivor space get moved from the from
space to the two so I have two objects
there that have an age of 1 they've
survived in this garbage collection
there H gets incremented to 2 and then
the stuff that's from easily get to 1
and it gets added to the 2 survivor
spaces so just like in the two slides
ago what we're going to do is we're
going to clear the even space so all the
memory is going to be deleted from that
that's going to be cleared and the f0 is
going to be cleared and then all that
survives and beyond the two space and
we'll see in the next diagram what
happens to that so if you look at the
s-1 space now that could become the next
garbage collection that becomes the from
survivor space so what happens is we're
moving the ops as we age the objects are
moving them front from the front face of
the to space and the fish essentially s1
and s0 are flipping those roles the from
and to set flips back and forth one
voice from the other is always the two
and then the next garbage collection
they flip-flop so once again we're going
through we fill up the Eden space and
our aging objects again so the to space
this time is s0 we have two objects that
live to garbage collection two minor
garbage collections let's become an H of
3 then we have one there that survived
ahead and Angel enemy comes in
- and then we have a new one from Eden
which becomes one so you can see that an
object's survived longer they get aged
and they're moving back and forth on the
survivor spaces okay so this process
continues so this is showing a promotion
of of some objects from the young
generation to the old generation and
what we have what this is called as we
have an age threshold so there are
thumbnail to some age and I think the
default 15 but in this example we have
the threshold set to 8 so once a object
in the new generation reaches the age of
8 that gets promoted to the old
generation so you can see here in my
from survivor space that have two
objects that have reached that age and
so they're automatically promoted to old
generation then our stuff that's younger
this one is h2 here that just gets
copied to the 2 space and it starts to
eat continues with the aging process so
basically that's what happens we go
through objects we keep allocating
objects to the eating space when it's
full that triggers a garbage collection
and we move objects to the survivor
spaces we age them then eventually they
get moved to the old generation we're
along with objects live so just to sum
up on eating space new objects that's
where they go we have the survivor
spaces those aged objects and that's
what we use a copy or our objects that
are still alive at the age minor garbage
collections are always stopped the world
events that means all applications read
stop and garbage collections can be we
have a number of different garbage
collectors and I've listed a few here
if some that are single-threaded which
is the serial garbage collector then we
have several multi or
multi-threaded or or parallel garbage
collectors and those include the
parallel the concurrent in the g1
garbage collectors and we're going to
talk about that you want a little bit
more later here and if you want any more
information and I'll keep referring to
this but this talk is based on some OBEs
on the oil l and all the details all the
information I'm going over is in the
mobis you don't really need to write
anything down it's all already out there
on the oil l for you okay and then to
finish up we still haven't mentioned the
old generation at much but once again
that's for long-lived objects when we
garbage collect that it's time and
resource of intensive that's where those
are called major garbage collections
that we try to minimize those if we can
and then the permanent generation is
mostly metadata and if you look at that
it's mostly class information stuff like
that and it's pretty static then the
permanent generation does not generally
change size that much okay so with that
I'm going to do a quick demo so let me
take control here
oh and I forgot peter is also putting up
I'll pull another poll
so please please take the time to answer
the questions there that we'd appreciate
that that would be great okay
and if everybody see in my hopefully yes
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to run visual VM on a sample
application to kind of give you a live
view of what's happening with the
garbage collection so in this window
here I've got a command line you don't
need to write it down because once again
is in the OBE so if you look at OBE
you'll find a tan line either just like
this are very similar to it that you can
run at home and all the stuff I'm
showing you to do basically on any
platform so I'm using a demo application
from the demo examples applications that
you can get with JDK so if you just go
and download the JDK and you should
scroll down a little bit to see the
demos and samples you can download those
as well so this is a graphic demo called
the Java T demo and it just shows off
some of the job of two graphics I'm
going to turn it up here a little bit
maybe take a little more memory okay so
now I'm going to do is I'm going to run
J visual VM and the commands you use to
run that is J visual VM there we go
and what I'm going to do is I'm a here's
my cell this is all the system the live
systems that visual VM is one of the GBM
and then here is a Java to demo I'm
going to open that up
and I'm going to jump right to the
visual GC tab that's a plug-in that
comes with
hold that okay this is a plugin that you
can download for free for visual BM and
you can see here we have all our
elements that I talked just talked about
we have our Eden space you can see it
filling up then you can see the objects
being copied back and forth from s 1 to
s 0 and vice versa so there we see we
just flipped and then you're going to
see some of the data is going to get
promoted sees the old just went up a
little bit and then here we've got some
we've got what's called a histogram
class histogram and that shows the aging
process here so we see the max cannulate
threshold remember I talked about that
it didn't call it that but that's what
that's what they're the max age is in
the young generation it's 15 and then
here we're showing a number of objects
that are at each stage in the aging
process we have mostly stuff that an age
of 1 for this application ok so I'm
going to hide that and then you can see
here we have graphs of the eaten space
you can see here that it's going you
know we're filling it emptying Affiliate
and you can see they're very survivor
spaces as the flip-flopping between the
two and then you can see this
application is steadily the old
generation we hit one Behrens collection
right there one major and looks like
we're building towards another one and
you can see permanent generation pretty
much stable ok so and one last thing
here there's a lot more information you
can actually do some profiling stuff
with visual VM I'm going to show the
monitor tab and once again that shows we
have a breadth of our heat just like a
barrel on this you to look at and I can
look at the perm gen if you'd be stable
doesn't change much and then here we
have our our heap what we're using and
then the changes in them
sighs as we go through our various
garbage collections okay so let me shut
this down close that and I'm going to
close that guy and let's see here oops
we don't want that guy up there we go
and there we are back to our
presentation and thanks everybody for
taking the poll we appreciate that so
next I'm going to talk about the g1
garbage collector and any talk of the g1
you have to make sure you understand how
the old garbage collectors worked
because the g1 works in a similar way
but in different way so the g1 garbage
collector is the future average
collector for Java and it's designed to
be for multiprocessor machines with
large memories which I mean admit it
even like our laptops now might be
considered multiprocessor machines with
large memory - just what we had a few
years ago so the idea is that g1 will
work on those kind of system it will
have very good low cost time so it will
be very responsive but at the same time
it will have a great degree of
throughput so that means just how much
stuff it can do in a period of time so
basically it'll be you know a well
balanced garbage collector and we can
see here that you know hopefully it'll
have more predictable pause times it
will compact the free space and
concurrently does some concurrent stuff
as well as parallel stuff and you know
like once again it's just well balanced
okay
so the next slide here we look at so the
g1 in works it has the same principles
that we just talked about in the older
garbage collectors but it implements
those principles in a different way so
I'm going to show you that here in just
a sec but we don't have so with the
older garbage collectors we have a sign
we take our teeth and we split it up you
know this area of memory is young
generation this Mary memory is old
generation this is permanent we just
it's segmented like that and every piece
of memory has a specific role and that
doesn't change um but I'll get to that
just a sec um young generation
collections are still soft the world so
that always keep that mind young
generation collections are always
stopped the world and then young
generation is done parallel so that if
you have multiple threads on your system
all those threads will be used to do the
garbage collection and alright so let's
move on here so the memory area so what
jiwon does is it takes the whole memory
area and then segment segment that into
like equal size regions and then each of
those regions are assigned roles so
let's take a pig look at a picture of
that and that's this slide here so you
can see that we've taken our heap and
we've got all these various regions of
similar sizes but instead of segmenting
them like we did before say oh this mune
this is this and this is this we
assigned various small segments rolls so
certain memory segments are assigned
eaten space certain are signed survivor
space certain assign old generation so
it gets it's a lot more flexible this
way so if you need to resize like you're
now generation or your old generation
it's super easy because we have all
these various similar sized memory or
memory chunks that can then be real
sign two different roles so this is an
example of what the young generation
might look like on g1 and we're going to
do a quick young generation garbage
collection just that we did leave okay
so once again we would go through when
we consider when our areas are filled up
all those memories egg mints that we
assigned to be young generation once
those are full we're going to do a
garbage collection that's what that
shows here and once again we're just
going to copy it those once again
instead of copying that to that specific
area we can copy it anywhere in here
where we have a memory memory blocks
assigned to that role so this is the you
can see from the legend the young
generation was light green and old
generation is light blue and then stuff
that's been recently copied as to darker
colors so we've just that's essentially
our survivor spaces now that dark green
area and then that dark blue is the new
old generation space okay so the g1
garbage collector is a little more than
fairly complex these are some of the
steps that it goes through and notice
that we have most of them are stop the
world events so they're generally wanted
to stop the world event that means that
step is piggybacked on some sort of
garbage collection usually not always
but usually and then the other two
they're the two the step two and step
three
those can be done concurrently so while
your application threads are running
we're actually doing some tasks like
marking our memory trying to figure out
what's live and what's not and the route
reason scanning is the same sort of
thing it's scanning to see what's live
and what's not in the old generation
areas
so let's go through and see what the
various steps would be for the g1
garbage collector we've got some
pictures here so the initial marking
phase what we're going to do is that's
piggybacked on a young generation
garbage collection so when I do a young
generation garbage collection we're also
going to go through and we're going to
mark okay what regions are live and
what's which aren't so we're looking for
you know of equal size of Endor regions
to see who is live who's not and we're
doing that at the same time we're doing
the drivers the minor garbage collection
so then in the concurrent marking phase
this is a concurrent stuff this is
happening while your applications
running well that while we're doing that
we're looking for any regions that might
not be live anymore and specifically in
the old generation so if we find any of
those we're going to mark them to
denoted here by an X and we're going to
get rid of those during a remark so this
is happening concurrently this doesn't
always happen on every garbage
collection but we're constantly doing
this to try to mark stuff that when we
do have a better selection you can take
care of this stuff then you get to the
remark phase and that's where we do our
final marking and we get rid of any of
those areas that during their concurrent
marking that we find said all those are
empty we don't need those anymore so we
can reclaim those so you can see the two
red areas from before I'm going to go
back oh they're gone and the remarks and
the remark uses what's called a snapshot
beginning algorithm which is much faster
than any of the algorithms algorithms we
use in the older garbage collections so
we've done our final marking and we've
got rid of any old stuff that that we
don't need anymore so the copy and
cleanup phase g1 is very flexible so
it can determine to meet its performance
goal it will determine like how much
work to do in a phase so in this example
here we've got some motifs we've
highlighted both young generation stuff
and some old generation stuff so we're
going to do this copy and clean up we're
going to probably do a garbage
collection and then at the same time
we're going to go through and clean up a
lot of these objects um stuff that we do
during a copy and cleanup include we
scrub the remembered sets and a
remembered set is essentially like the
data structure that keeps track of the
objects and each one of those reaches so
when I take care of that copy and clean
up and then you know empty anything
that's empty and you'll see two
different kind of GC pauses with g1 so
you'll see a GC pause young if you're
looking at the output from like Laveau
CC and that's just the young generation
collection normal and then if you do one
like this that I have pictured here
that'll be a GC pause mixed and then
after that phase you see here we've
cleaned up the memory we've created a
new smaller old generation area regions
that have been assigned to that then we
also off obviously have some survivor
space we have some young generation
stuff so you can see that the principles
are the same for g1 we're still doing
you know we've got our Eden space we
have our survivor spaces it's just the
implementation is different and it's
more flexible so you still have all
those concepts but if because if we use
the regions and we can use the regions
however we want we have a lot more
flexibility on sizing the various
regions and doing what we need to do and
in addition the garbage collector is
just smarter about the amount of work it
needs to do so it can like put stuff off
that needs to meet a
response time goal and so it's just
generally pretty cool stuff so I'm going
to do one last demo here so let me share
my desktop again okay all right so I'm
just going to run the g1 garbage
collector with some command line options
so this one here I'm going to run I'm
put this in the center for you guys
hopefully the center so this time I'm
just running for both GC so I'm running
the our our sample graphics application
or demo this time with t1 so this this
is the verbose GC output and you can see
a lot of the stuff I just talked about
it's very clear as it's happening here
do we have young generation pauses we've
got um concurrent marking going on we're
going to remark see that and then look
at this little jet of those are garbage
collections we have a young and then we
have a mixed which I showed in that one
that one slide and then we mostly have
young so you see both the time it will
be young but when it has an opportunity
to clean up the old generation a little
bit it will okay so that's that we're
both GC as you can see it's pretty much
marks you can see what's happening and
you can see the times but we do have if
you use the command line option print GC
details let's see here if I can find it
there we go so I'm using the G 1 GC and
i'm using print GC D detail this is kind
of a fire hose mode and this with G 1
this one prints a lot of information so
I restarted that
and you can see I'm fitting out a lot
more detailed information or still
seeing some of the there's a denote
survivors it's kind of hard to even keep
up with it I'm going to stop it we can
see here there's a ton of detailed
information that you can dive into and
look at now there's a you might imagine
it's kind of hard to know what all this
stuff is so there is a let me go back to
the let's see here before I do that I'm
going to jump here so there is a blog
entry by one of our actually I didn't
want to do that I want to do let's see
if I can copy this guy they're one of
our engineers at Oracle that details all
that information you saw from Premji see
details for g1 so I'm going to paste
that into chat and if you look at poems
blog you'll see all that information you
can read up on that so once again we
appreciate you coming on and we
appreciate you using Java and although
we've got a lot of cool features coming
out here job once coming soon we'll be
talking about that there um and of
course one of the main reasons when
you're doing this talk is to point you
towards the Oracle Learning Library and
anyway so the Oracle Learning Library
everything I talked about is from to
OBEs on the Oracle Learning Library so
all the command line ops is a lot more
information than what I talked about
they don't have time to go through
everything but if you want to learn
about tan lines which is your g1 how you
can tune it a little bit stuff like that
it's all in those OBEs and they're at
oracle complex LOL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
