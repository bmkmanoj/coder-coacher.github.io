Java cloud service instance by using the
instance creation wizard as I'll
demonstrate here prior to launching the
wizard I will already provision an
Oracle database cloud service instance
and just to be safe recorded the
database username and password for that
instance now I'll launch the wizard
first I'll provide basic service
information my service name must start
with a letter and cannot contain any
special characters nor be longer than 50
characters I'll select a production
level service that will provide the
clustering backup and restoration
patching and rollback and scaling
support I need a monthly metering
frequency works best for the high volume
of usage over extended periods that I
expect can also mean a cost savings over
the hourly rate next I'll select an
Oracle WebLogic server release that
supports cloud infrastructures that span
web server application server and load
balancer tiers and finally I'll select
the appropriate WebLogic server edition
next I'll provide my service details
first multiply in the shape of the
service and provide access information
for integrated services administration
consoles and a secure shell compute
shapes are pre-configured and determine
the processing power of a service
instance I'll select an all purpose
shape rather than one that's memory
intensive
since I might need to connect to the
instance by using a secure shell client
I'll specify the public key of the
secure shell pair well I could specify
the name of an existing key I'm going to
load a new one from my file system by
default the cluster will already be
configured but I want to add a couple of
managed servers to it
this will automatically enable a load
balancer which I'll configure
momentarily next I'll identify the
WebLogic administrator
and now so that I can access
WebLogic and other administrative
consoles select this advanced setting
next all other access information for
the Oracle database cloud service
instance that contains the Oracle Fusion
Middleware component schemas this is why
it's helpful to record the database user
credentials now I'll configure the load
balancer which shares works across
manage servers and automatically
redirects traffic during routine
maintenance activities here too I'll
select one of the all-purpose compute
shapes this policy passes each new
request to the manage server that has
the fewest connections ensuring a smooth
distribution when manage servers get
bogged down finally I'll define access
information for the Oracle storage cloud
container instance that will store the
service instance backups
if it doesn't already exist Java cloud
service will create this container now
I'll confirm the details and create the
instance I can see that the service
instance has been added and will be
provisioned and running soon I can check
the provisioning progress here and here
I'll refresh the screen and my service
has been provisioned I'm ready to manage
my instance and deploy my applications
