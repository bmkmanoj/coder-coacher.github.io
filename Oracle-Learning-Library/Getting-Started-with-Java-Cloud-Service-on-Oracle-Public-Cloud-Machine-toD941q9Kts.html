video I'll show you how to create and
connect to an Oracle Java cloud service
instance running on your oracle public
cloud machine getting started with Java
cloud service involves these main tasks
creating SSH keys so that I can securely
connect to my new virtual machines
creating a service instance in Java
cloud service locating tools to further
customize and manage my Java cloud
service and finally deploying a java
application to my Java cloud service
before I get started with Java cloud
service I need to have some information
handy first to use any cloud service
i'll need to know my oracle cloud
identity domain as well as the name and
password of a user in this identity
domain this identity domain is sometimes
also called my tenant name I'll also
need the URL username and password of an
existing relational database a Java
cloud service instance requires access
to a database that contains the standard
Oracle Fusion Middleware schemas
similarly I need the host name and path
of an existing network file system to
which Java cloud service can record
backups of my service instances first
I'll create my ssh keys
SSH keys come in pairs and consists of a
public key and a private key later when
I provision my VMS in the Oracle cloud
I'll supply the public key then if I
ever need to access my VMS from a
command line I simply connect with the
private key if i'm on windows i'll use
putty to create my pair of keys
SSH keys can include an optional
description and the private key can also
be password protected first I export the
private key as a file
and then I copy and paste the public key
text into a separate file
you
if on the other hand I'm on a unix
platform or if i'm running a unix
emulator on windows like cygwin i'll use
the ssh key gen utility
you
now I'm ready to create a service
instance in the Java cloud service
login to the Oracle private cloud launch
the Java cloud service and then create a
new service
Java cloud service supports
logic server 11g and 12c as well as both
the standard and enterprise feature
editions an enterprise edition service
instance can also optionally include a
coherence data cache but in this
scenario my application requires only
weblogic next I need to name my new Java
service and set the initial size of the
weblogic cluster I also select a compute
shape that meets the workload
requirements of this cluster I'll also
upload the public key file I created
earlier so that I'll be able to remotely
log into my weblogic VMs by using the
matching private key I enter the
administrative credentials for the new
WebLogic domain
I also provide the location and
credentials for an existing relational
database that has been updated with the
fusion middleware schemas Java cloud
service will not validate connectivity
to my database before the instance
provisioning process so I need to ensure
that I type these values correctly
because I configured my weblogic cluster
size to eval you greater than 1 Java
cloud service will automatically
provision a load balancer to intercept
and distribute incoming client traffic
across the servers in my cluster each
tenant in Oracle private cloud has
access to one or more networks I select
a public access network for my
administrators and application users and
I select a network that weblogic will
use to access my database if I was
unsure as to which networks to select
here I'd contact my tenant administrator
finally I specify the location of an
existing NFS remote file system Java
cloud service will use this NFS location
to automatically record backups of my
instance I can contact my tenant
administrator to get this value
now my new Java service is being
provisioned and I can periodically check
its status
you
after my new Java cloud service
is up and running I can customize its
configuration to meet my application
requirements by using several different
administration tools
for example I might need to search
weblogic log files tuna JDBC data source
or create a JMS server I can accomplish
these tasks from the standard weblogic
server console the available
functionality is the same as your
on-premises weblogic environments
alternatively I can use the Fusion
Middleware control console to also
configure monitor and manage my WebLogic
domain
there may also be times that I need to
monitor tune or troubleshoot the load
balancer in this service instance in
Java cloud service the load balancer is
implemented with Oracle traffic director
and I can access the traffic director
console to perform these types of tasks
finally I'm ready to deploy my java
applications to my new Java cloud
service instance I have all the same
deployment options as I have in my
on-premise weblogic environments I could
use the fusion middleware control
console or the weblogic scripting tool
for example but in this case I'll use
the standard weblogic server console to
install my new application
in this typical scenario I browse to the
deployment archive file and then target
the application to my entire cluster
you
after uploading and installing my java
application i can start it
you
because I enabled a load balancer my
clients will access the application
through the load balancers public IP
address thanks for watching this video
about getting started with Oracle Java
cloud service a companion tutorial is
also available that documents all the
steps I just presented welcome to the
cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
