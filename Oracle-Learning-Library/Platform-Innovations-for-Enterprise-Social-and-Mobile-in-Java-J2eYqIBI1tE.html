here who chose us over beer well some
some did anyway it's some some some made
the right choice both also thanks for
coming out our Auerbach was a kind of a
late submission here so it's probably
partly that a lot of folks don't know
about it because it's not on the printed
schedule but in any case so we have
three of us here from magnet systems I'm
Mike peach I had a product and I've got
Charles pakala and Jeff Trent who are
senior architects and who have basically
designed and built a lot of what we'll
be talking about here today magnet
systems was founded by Alfred shuang the
a of b EA so you'll notice some strong
middleware roots here we have a lot of
former weblogic folks and more generally
appserver folks the company which is
about somewhere between 25 and 30 people
at the moment hales largely from BGA
oracle with a little bit of IBM
Microsoft and some other big enterprise
platform companies thrown in so it's
some pretty strong platform DNA in the
company there we're located in Palo Alto
we've we've been around for just a
couple of years now and but really I
think about the technology that will be
talking about today as being roughly
about a year old so we are pre launch
pre pre availability pre GA so in the
spirit of a buff what we're intending to
do today is share some ideas a little
bit in advance of actual product share
it with hopefully like-minded socially
oriented folks who may be wanting to do
some interesting new innovative things
not finding the incumbent solutions
quite enough for what they're trying to
do
and maybe share some of your reaction
with us as to what you see what you'd
like to see what to spend more time on
what to spend less time on etc so by way
of what we want to go through here we'll
spend just a brief a couple of slides
just establishing what we mean by
enterprise social and hopefully what
what the world thinks of mostly when
they think of enterprise social we're
not trying to come up with a radical new
definition of it so much as 0 and on
what we think are the salient aspects
that should be enabled at a platform
level we'll take a look at some of the
existing technologies talk a little bit
about why they're probably not the best
things for what you might be trying to
do well then show our ideas some of what
what we've built in our platform and
what we're intending to build and in
particular talk about that in the
context of this idea of social work flow
we think that workflow is an aspect of
enterprise software that is particularly
amenable to interesting kinds of
improvement with social approaches and
social practices we have a little bit of
material on mobile as a platform company
we're building a platform to address a
number of different use cases a number
of different needs so it's not just a
social platform but that is kind of what
we're intending to focus on today and we
really left a bunch of time at the end
to get interactive about this again in
the spirit of a birds of a feather so by
way of okay what's this enterprise
social thing all about well the idea of
enterprise social is has been actually
around for a number of years as early as
2006 Andrew McAfee and in which some
ideas that he ultimately kind of brought
together in his enterprise 20 book
talked about things like blogs wiki's
feeds RSS things like that you see
search
tagging you started to see that the
beginnings of ideas around
recommendations and using approaches
like collaborative filtering the sort of
phenomenon we all know and love when we
go to amazon and order a book and it
recommends other things for us and lest
anyone think that that guy's kind of
fallen by the wayside as it turns out
he's on the cover of harvard business
review this month with a really good
article and big data I know that Harvard
Business Review isn't necessarily the
top of reading list for for the Java one
audience but the interesting take away
there is that your boss's boss's boss's
boss's are all reading about many of
these things now and and and getting
pretty excited about it so we all know
the good and bad that that means when
the pointy-haired guys start telling
what should be focused on not too soon
after some of those early ideas though
some of the more interesting aspects of
enterprise social started to really
gestate and what you you start to notice
in some of these incremental ideas is
notions of freeform notions of ad hoc
notions of diversity and transparency in
data types and kinds of data in ways
that data are being used and you started
seeing language like emergent right so
let's find an emergent workflow just
just coming out of the the mass of data
that's being collected from social
interactions so you fast forward a
couple of years and you come to today
and you take a spin through the websites
of a number of companies who show up
when you type enterprise social into
google and there's some kind of
interesting enterprise social type of
messaging out there there there seem to
be some manifestations of some of those
ideas from the previous slides in some
products and some technologies out there
you have folks coming at this from
different directions like content
management
a customer relationship management like
the old school collaboration software
you've got some some folks that really
were born right from the beginning to do
social right that they've been talking
social since the beginnings folks like
jive our premise as as builders of a
platform on which we envision enterprise
developers building custom software
applications custom enterprise apps
folks who would use this our architects
and developers who are building complete
bespoke apps building from the ground up
something custom something business
critical business differentiating for
their respective companies as such they
need some social capabilities right
they've been reading about these
different approaches these different
technologies they'd like to have some
capabilities related to inviting
connecting sharing some some abilities
to do recommendations right some things
that kind of fall under that broad
rubric of social but you don't
necessarily have the scope the budget
the need the desire to put in place some
big honk and dedicated you know mostly
done application with a few knobs and
dials on it for customization you want
to just have some some social
capabilities in that application that
you're building you're probably building
an application like that inside an
enterprise on top of some sort of
platform like a weblogic like a
websphere like a JBoss right so a Java
EE or some other even maybe lighter
weight type of container and those
traditional Java Enterprise platforms
don't have these these fundamental
social capabilities baked into them you
would have to build such things from
scratch and that's a lot of work right
some of the some of the things that
we're talking about especially get into
recommendations with collaborative
filtering you're talking about fairly
you know significant math significant
algorithms and so on not necessarily for
the you know everyday person who's who
doesn't have a PhD in machine learning
right
so let's drill down a little bit on I
kind of touched on it and glossed over
it pretty quickly but but what are some
of the things that that folks would like
to build that you know from
conversations that we've had from
experiences we've had as developers
knowing what you know what we're trying
to build into applications well it's no
longer just wiki's blogs tags and feeds
right it's not it's not a superficial
kind of social right and it's not about
recreating Twitter and Facebook inside
the enterprise I mean with all due
respect if there any you know sort of
Yammer folks or jive folks here at my
last company we we try to use Yammer and
it just never got traction it's like why
are we trying to recreate inside this
same infrastructure we can just use
Twitter and and and those other things
and maybe there are use cases where it's
appropriate but anyway the things that
we're talking about are building your
your core enterprise application and
having capabilities in it like making it
easy to find the right people find the
right content making it easy for
individuals who are different users of
an application to find each other and
connect in different ways right have ad
hoc interactions may be to create ad hoc
groups right to have a number of ad hoc
interactions come together and and turn
into a longer-lived group and then
taking that to the next level what we'd
really like the software to do we really
like the application to do is be able to
capture mine and ultimately enable us as
developers to apply intelligence from
that data that was gathered and all of
this to the end of getting real work
done right not just posting a bunch of
random stuff on it on an internal
Twitter feed about oh I you know came
into the office today isn't that
wonderful right we're trying to use this
data to to get real work done so social
work flow let's let's try to put one
notch more of concreteness around what
we're talking about many if not all
enterprise apps have sequences of
activity activities they get carried out
right they're generally not you know
sort of
one off quick look up types of things
there it's it a piece of enterprise
software is typically something that
involves multiple different roles
multiple different types of users
interacting collaborating to get
something done and there's a sequence of
activities there for social work flow
where we're positing that the sequence
is driven not just by a top-down rigidly
structured rigidly defined process like
in Business Process Management but
rather there is some some ability for
the software to support those ad-hoc
interactions I was mentioning but then
mine the intelligence implicit in those
interactions and then feed that back
into suggestions for things to do in the
future so in other words there's this
combination of top down there is some
structure right you can't have a
complete free-for-all there are some
things that are required to be done and
some macro level ordering of let's say
groups of activities but within those
macro level steps and within the
constraints of certain steps that
absolutely must be done there are a
whole bunch of things that aren't known
at design-time right and and what we
really want is the application to just
let people do what they do mine that
automatically and again feed that back
into how the software supports workflow
now I'll breathe I'll just
parenthetically mention that there are
some challenges to that sort of learning
type of system that sort of self sort of
adapting type of system and and in
enabling such things in a platform and
in in in providing the ability for
developers to use that type of thing we
want to be very careful to not let
things get out of control and not let
not let sort of the the things that are
adapted become invisible and and and and
hard to manage so by way of just a
couple of broad categories of use case
you could think of an internal employee
app an app that that is might be
referred to today as a workflow app that
enables
folks in only employees within the
company to carry out steps related to
let's say closing sales right and so you
as we mentioned earlier right finding
relevant people finding relevant content
items to close that sale engaging the
people that are found creating those ad
hoc teams we start to get to that
learning part that that automated
adaptation we start to see things like
the system recommending the best next
step to to to finish that workflow to
achieve the goal of in this example
closing a sale if you look at a customer
facing let's say an e-commerce app
something more akin to the you know
Amazon type of online commerce example
you've got users looking for things
products to buy opportunities to rate
items view ratings of other users those
are certainly social characteristics
social capabilities we want the system
to present the best next piece of
content or recommend the best let's say
next product to consider for purchase
and one of the things that's interesting
there is you notice there's there's a
remarkable parallel between those those
two sets of social capabilities in that
internal workflow app and that external
commerce app there's a lot of finding
and connecting that invite connect share
and there's also this notion of
recommending right of the system sort of
on the basis of historical data guiding
the user in presenting optimizing his or
her sort of activities you know based on
based on that knowledge from the
historical data one way to summarize all
this is to make the goal is to make all
of these types of enterprise
applications like the Google experience
and what we mean by that as you know
when you go and you do a search in
Google nowadays it's amazing how much
context is brought to bear to to tune
the results of that search for you right
so if you do a search and I do a search
we're going to end up seeing different
sets of results because of the history
of things that we've done within the goo
environment so in a nutshell the magnet
approach what we are trying to do is
provide a general-purpose platform for
enterprise application development that
has primitives in the very platform
itself that enable these kinds of social
capabilities that we've been talking
about here and with that I'm just going
to hand it over to Charles again one of
our senior architects who's done a lot
of the building here to go through a
little bit more okay what does it mean
to enable those primitives in a platform
what are the primitives look like what
are the API so so just to sort of
continue with the theme that Mike had
been describing what we're talking about
is that most of our users now are using
applications like Facebook and these
other app and Twitter and all these
other the other applications to share
information to organize their their
personal lives to organize their
relationships to get things done I mean
some of the things that have happened in
the last couple years in terms of using
social media to to cause social change
like on a large scale like what's been
going on on in Europe and it's been
pretty impressive and the challenge
again for enterprises is that they want
to be able to allow their users to do
the same sort of thing right we've all
been involved in developing enterprise
apps and the problem with developing a
series of forms and going out and
collecting all the sort of reliable
requirements is that you know usually by
the time you finish writing the app the
business circumstances have changed
right it's pretty hard to adapt that
application to those changes as quickly
as they happen right so what happens is
you know oftentimes a lot of our
customers will go our user base will go
out and they'll be doing all their work
in spreadsheets right or in in
organizing their data by sending emails
around and that kind of thing so they
will find their own ways
to accomplish these things so what we're
actually trying to do is translate these
social concepts into and allow you and
enterprise developer to leverage those
concepts in your applications so for
instance in enterprise there's a very
strict notion of a user and departments
and who you actually work with right and
in social applications we're talking
more about forming social groups right
using thus to figure out who you have
interacted with in the past who you're
most likely to interact with in under
what context so again it's about and
about sharing information with those
users so when you when you see the you
know when you're you going on Facebook
and checking out your friends right
you're seeing the activity that they've
been involved in right if and what
they're up to and there's a sort of
sampling there right where the more
likely you are and to interact with
certain people the more likely you are
to see their information so it's the
same thing that when you go to work but
you're interacting with a certain set of
people and it's important that you be
able to kind of keep in touch with them
and find out what's going on in their
work life as well that also brings so in
the enterprise well you've often thought
about that is auditing and that Trent
that concept translates almost into this
notion of an activity stream right where
all the other resources and the people
that you interact with are all sort of
interrelated and sort of being able to
keep track of that and and again with
workspaces and content the idea of
sharing not only with your with a
specific individual but different types
of permission and rules right that
borrow from social where I'm sharing
with my clothes working group plus you
know the people in my department plus
people that they also are working
closely with people that might have
might be interested in this topic or
this piece of information so a lot of
this is again trying to borrow from
these very successful concepts and make
them available to the enterprise
developer or when they're developing
applications so they can to their
employees can can leverage that
information
another aspect of this is sort of adding
services and capabilities where it allow
you to federate user account so not so
much Facebook more things like LinkedIn
right where you're bringing a whole
social context about the people who you
interact with even on a business level
right there's tons of folks who you've
worked with in the past who might be
able to help you out in your current job
especially if you're a sales guy we all
know those guys but also you know people
who you've worked with but they might be
able to help you out on consulting or
you know some development task so being
able to to leverage that information
that's in your social accounts and join
it with the information that's in your
enterprise data so you can you can
selectively choose to share that
information with venter prize when it
becomes valuable right so you don't want
to give the enterprise your entire
linkedin list but when there are people
who are appropriate you might choose to
to offer to share their contact
information maybe to be a potential
employee or two to help you out on a
particular consulting gig right so what
we're trying to do is make it want one
of the things that we're also trying to
do is enable a normalized resource model
right so we provide you with a data
model that represents a typical social
model so the things that Mike was
talking about earlier things like users
and groups and workspaces social content
activity streams these things are all
available in our resource model we
provide a standard block mechanisms for
for consolidating those so you can as
we've all been familiar with join a
bunch of different user accounts for
instance so that when you do searching
and matching for for contact or for data
or content you can easily you can easily
integrate that into your application and
then have I again a cut a employee can
choose to to share the some of that
information and again capturing this
notion of the difference in the way
permissions work right so in enterprise
it's much
over top-down permission a model whereas
in social social enterprise style
applications or talking about sharing
the great typical example is I want to
share with friends of friends or in this
case colleagues of colleagues you know
colleagues that I work with in there and
people that they work with as well I'm
you stop for a second is this does this
resonate with folks at all in terms of
their requirements I mean it's sort of a
new and different concept I guess for
most enterprise folks but have
dissipated in terms of wanting to
integrate with some of the social
aspects into enterprise apps or maybe
look maybe worth asking I mean how many
folks have actually tried or are trying
to incorporate any sort of social
capability like any of the ones that we
placed on here in in applications that
they're developing you know today or
will expect to be developing
double hands
any Inklings in your departments about
people wanting this type of
functionality or not no not so much
before you do
this
so the goal is to have normalized yeah
so the question was to what extent do we
support integration with external social
platforms I guess is yes so our the
structure the model that we're going for
is one where again most of these systems
look fairly similar right i mean the
contents i should say the standard data
model around users user accounts work
shared something or other awake whether
it's an album or write a workspace or
whatever you want to call it and so what
we're trying to do is come up with a
common model for that and then sort of
data integration tier where where when
you when you integrate when you choose
to link a user account we automatically
integrate data from those particular
services so that you can when you ask
for for instance my friend lists or my
contact list that information is
consolidated from all the user accounts
plus your enterprise information so the
idea is that you don't as an application
developer you choose to integrate that
or not and then it just you don't worry
about it from there on out right it's
just you're so if you want to cross-post
it would handle that cross posting if
you wanted to write
yep yeah so that that's really the heart
of it right is creating an abstraction
that represents these different systems
and making it so that as an application
developer you can just focus on writing
how you want it to look in the
presentation tier to do other folks and
find have a need to integrate with you
know some of the big external social
data providers like Facebook Twitter
Linkedin is that a common requirement
across projects you working on yeah
let's get to it it's getting this good
info yeah yeah so what we've tried to do
again folks familiar with some of the
existing social kind of EP is they're
out there there's a this one that's been
out for a couple years called OpenSocial
which is more or less as some of the
some of the big bad or provider is
supported but it's not it hasn't really
gained the huge amount attraction there
was also a effort to put together a Java
social jsr that hasn't really gone too
far but our goal is to sort of do
something similar right but the idea is
that again we have Java interfaces that
represent these concepts and a set of
services associated with them and then
we we have a fairly below the social
part of it and the mobile part of it we
have a an infrastructure let you pull in
from Oh from open source various your
choice of you know a web container or
your choice of arrests implementation
and we give you a very simple way to
surface those intervals interface those
out-of-the-box model up constructs
resources or any that you want to extend
or create that are your own so you get
this sort of seamless integration
between what we provide you is from a
basic service as well as ones that you
might want integrate from your
enterprise on top of that you know it's
it's again it's all rest based so
the same set of interfaces are available
both on the server and to your mobile
devices so you can write similar
application code on both places and end
up with a more of a truly distributed
style of application more of a where
your mobile devices can actually
interoperate on the client as well but
I'm not going to get too deep into that
but again I think the key thing here is
that the we have more of a
recommendation style query which is more
focused on not so much the typical JP a
very repeatable SQL type query it's more
of the Google style or quick
recommendation request right you're what
you know if you want to leverage all
this big data information to be able to
make draw patterns and capture capture
better Rex tiles of recommendation then
one of the best ways to do that is to
allow sort of fuzzy responses right so
trying to make it a little less unless
required predictable more less
transactional and more more like like
Google I guess not to be has anybody
tried to work with a recommendation
engine like a madhouse just give one
example
experience with at any time so you say
pretty pretty complex pretty pretty
steep learning curve woman yeah so we
have some pretty smart guys on our team
and our goal is to make it so that when
you write your app you write it in this
very general way and then we have a
pretty cool microkernel that is a
dependency injection framework that
allows you to sort of glue these things
together and we provide a bunch of
services that for instance that trap all
the activities inform all those
relationships and then also that monitor
all those relationships so we capture
all this big data information and allow
you to to create targeted recommendation
queries that make it really easy for
your users to get benefit from that data
right so as an app developer you don't
have to worry too much about how that
data structured but we actually make it
easy for you to capture that in the back
end so again the magnet platform is
starts from the very bottom with just
pure java and on the mobile device it's
obviously Dalek and we have a
microkernel that allows you to
selectively pick and choose which of
these features you want to include in
your application and integrate it with
third party / integrating a third party
external spi implementation so we're
building a library of those integrations
like the LinkedIn and the Facebook and
the and the date of the content report
and content repositories like as through
JC are those types of integrations and
then hooking those into these features
that leverage those basic underlying AP
is and again all of these are designed
in a very flexible way so you can you
can pick and choose which ones you want
in your application and then start
adding your own stuff on top of that
again I think the key the key
information here is that we are we're
demonstrating how you write the app the
app is actually the data is flowing
through the app in a way
and as people are doing at taking
actions like adding removing content
sharing information any sort of calls
through the API we capture those optic
those operations in the knowledge base
or basically in essentially using
association graphs to capture the time
based relationships and then using that
feeding that through a recommendation
engine to enhance the user experience
and because we have this nifty
architecture where we can plug various
components together and filter and
listening on in on what's going on you
can do that after the fact you don't
have to design that begin to your
application right from the beginning
right be make it so that it or have a
bunch of tools and make it easy for you
to do that and again we are very much
sort of embracing mobile right so that
same microkernel that same so same set
of entities that you've described and
right and the where they can pull in
content right those run everywhere
they're not just it's just not a
server-side platform there there it's a
platform where you can write connectors
or providers or services that run on the
mobile device and we have very and you
can see the whole thing is running on
all of these different environments on
the tablets on the on the Android
devices and capturing information
capturing early social interaction so
that for instance you can write a
connector that will actually run on the
device to capture and integrate content
from the Sun available only on that
device when you're in that context we
also make it very easy for you because
we have our rest architecture we've this
injection framework will actually handle
creating services that are location
neutral so or vocation opaque I guess so
when you actually ask for the service
that you can use to manipulate the
entities in the system it will actually
handle proxying redirecting locally or
remotely all that kind of fancy stuff
doing synchronization making it really
easy for you as a developer to focus
mainly on
your business value add right instead of
trying to focus on all this lower level
infrastructure so we're a true
distributed container somebody folks in
the room you're doing development that
is either primarily or at least
significantly involving mobile clients
is that is that really a major sort of
first classes and yours development
requirements these days
universal so how hard is it how much of
a challenge is it for you oh I mean I
want to try to frame the question yeah
like open ass get openly in a more open
way is it wait where do you when you
start to look at that application is it
easier for you to come at it from the
server side or from the client side
where I you used are you looking at
technologies that will let you cross
boundaries so you can write you sort of
write once run anywhere kind of stuff or
you look are you really happy with
native like developing native a play on
the native presentation API sore native
support yes I'm not really phrasing that
well but I guess
and
so we write that application that works
anywhere okay so we actually praised be
solely second toe vacuum is done because
it's already been collected
so people have pretty good luck with
javascript HTML 5 so far or you mean it
sounds like a couple of folks are going
that route
yeah actually just I mean by way of
calibration is anybody in the room a
client a mobile client side developer
like your day job is mainly developing
an Android or obviously javaone it's not
going to be iOS but mean we anybody here
is really really mainly in the client
side or mostly a server side how about
job at me a radio and Java ME stuff yes
yeah you want to see all my presentation
yesterday I probably one of the only
person people in here who actually made
the Java sensor API no one look so you
got me that fork in my java and eat very
good that's impressive very good so
JavaScript html5 presentation mainly
sounds like folks here that's the way to
the general direction and how many guys
how many people here do web develop my
web server development like JSP yeah
which one which one of you guys clean
into right now JSP anyone use any other
templating technologies freemarker no
yeah which one type get tiles late for
work at all yeah Hospital facing web
folder anybody else using play
how about expression language al style
formats at a JavaScript said anyone jsf
anyone know a little bit here and there
if you have to only if they make you
what I saw was that huge ASAP
it doesn't I mean it's that's probably a
foundation own device left
work from
mobile richfaces achievement for data
mobile gsm the projects that try to
optimize for something rendering of the
vile acts by using something like
education here
so that was a branding name they put the
name weblogic pretty much anything yeah
yeah so these are some just we seem to
be going pretty well with the questions
i guess but yeah be running towards the
end here does anyone have like any
specific questions they want to ask or
should we try to like keep trying to
keep the conversation going any
definitely think being able to do in
more notification base you know I
long-running polling you know avoiding
that is important important aspect of
most of these apps right so you don't
want to have to you want to be able to
leave your phone open and having it have
it show you when someone updates the
workspace right kind of information is
really when you're writing apps they're
much more like on real right away for
the feedback so we are definitely
looking very strongly at adding the you
know incorporating those capabilities
into the platform
so if you've been joining have you been
doing j2me projects that you're yeah
I mean our stuff is very very
lightweight and you know if it comes to
the point where we get a lot of requests
for j2me I think we could probably do
something you know it's a matter of it's
a matter of demand right now diving yeah
i mean the the approach we've been
taking to answer your question on the
push notifications is we want to have
the right abstractions in place and then
it's just a matter of plugging in the
right implementation so Charles talked a
lot about the connectors or maybe it was
Mike where we had the connector
architecture so the idea there is that
sort of you design your app you say you
want to have push notifications but you
don't necessarily pick a particular
technology at the onset whether it be
GCM where apns or comment or atmosphere
that's sort of a secondary decision you
just say you want the feature you use
the the common abstraction then you just
get the right one at runtime
good money yeah I mean it's a bit of the
remaining questions here that they we
haven't spent any time on are there any
primitives that you'd like to see in the
platform that could at least loosely
fall under the you know the heading of
social that we haven't talked about is
there anything where you're gone these
guys are talking about a social problem
but why isn't have X or Y or Z thoughts
on that no I mean does this so you know
assuming we delivered a platform that
does the things we described here and
you know ap is to have recommendation
driven workflow be easy to create and
incorporate into your application
development is that idea compelling is
that something you can envision
using you know in your application
development maybe really depends
it's a big worry if I have to get time
the more moving parts are doing or where
like that so if I don't have much
control over that availability in a
sense of just sort of you know I'm not
going off so then also oh yes control i
get over what type of control do you
mean the more i can more can control it
you're marking control the platform have
choices about which services you use in
right here well services like to use how
i can use it i'll do you like to use it
so that this doesn't the raspy things
one expects out of something that
purports to be a platform right
reliability availability skeletal
scalability performance management right
all that stuff which is the reason why
so much the world uses web skiers and
web logics and things like that is those
kinds of capabilities so you're saying
that's all table stakes in order to even
think
also add a dar how much I sister bigger
than you guys have how much I have the
data like that in the picture the
Charles showed earlier with where we're
just capturing so yeah nice and
obviously I if I can use that I can
capitalize on that if I don't
is that those comments resonate with
everyone else as well as a sort of
minimum capabilities in terms of rasp
and management and sort of accessibility
of the underlying learned social data or
those would you consider those sort of
strong requirements for adopting a
platform like this maybe
alright well we're pretty much at
quarter after the hour here so in you
know in respect to everybody's time
definitely thanks for coming out during
during the beer hour and happy hour and
we've got our kind of contact info up
since then we do that yeah hit the wrong
button well good slideshow yeah this may
be a good a 20
so there's our contact info if anybody
wants to snap a shot and then the other
thing that we're offering is if folks
have some free time thursday afternoon
and would like to join us at our offices
down in palo alto and do a deeper dive
you know as I said we're pre-launch pre
GA so there's a lot of stuff that we
haven't talked about here that we that
we can't but we can go under NDA and we
can get we can get our hands dirty a
little bit show you some code and go
into a deeper dive there so just send me
an email and I'd be happy to you know
give you some directions and set that up
we're roughly scheduling it for 2 p.m.
on thursday and depending on who's
interested in what their availability is
you know we can adjust that as needed
but you know just want to hop on the
caltrain and come down to palo alto it's
a 40 45 minute caltrain ride we're close
to the caltrain station downtown palo
alto and we'd be happy to go into a lot
more detail on any of the topics we've
touched on here so with that thanks for
coming enjoy the rest of Java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
