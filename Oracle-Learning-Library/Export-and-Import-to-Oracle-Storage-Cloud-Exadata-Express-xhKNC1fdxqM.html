export and import your clout database
right from its service console this
feature makes it easy to backup and
restore
exadata Express data elsewhere in Oracle
cloud note this process creates export
zip files in Oracle storage cloud
service classic so you must have a valid
account there before you begin get
started by clicking on manage in the
exadata Express service console notice
buttons that say export to cloud storage
and import from cloud storage click on
export to cloud storage then on create
export
now enter required information about the
target cloud storage container starting
with its full URL this URL can be found
on your cloud storage service console as
a convenience if you haven't already set
up a cloud storage container you can
choose to create one automatically the
name of your new container will be
whatever is specified at the end of the
URL
continue by entering your cloud storage
username and password select database
schemas to include in the export job
choose whether to export only data
structures or include both structures
and stored data then enter a name for
the export zip file lastly click on
create export to finish back in the
initial export dialog this export now
appears in the export job log with the
status of requested it may take a while
for the export to finish depending on
how much data is included refresh the
current status by closing and reopening
this dialog
and there we are the export has
completed successfully next suppose we
want to restore this export back into
the Exadata Express cloud database this
involves importing it from the cloud
storage container
start by clicking import from cloud
storage then create import once again
enter required information about the
cloud storage container including URL
username and password
here we see a list of export zip files
that were found in the cloud storage
container select the export zip file we
generated previously note if schemas
with the same name already exists in
exadata Express then conflicting
imported scheme as will be renamed with
a timestamp at the end we can make
further naming adjustments from the
sequel command line later lastly click
on create import to finish back in the
initial dialog this import now appears
in the import job log with a status of
requested refresh the current status by
closing and reopening this dialog
all done the import job has completed
successfully now we can connect to the
imported schemas and Exadata Express as
normal and immediately begin running
queries on them note if you have to find
custom database roles and privileges you
included apex apps in the exported and
imported schemas or you have rest
services running on exadata Express then
there may be some post import steps you
need to complete please refer to the
end-user documentation for information
about post import steps thank you and
enjoy using exadata Express export an
import to cloud storage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
