to mean the same thing for example right
now uses the text US for the United
States country code however Eloqua uses
United States and HCM uses USA all these
different applications need to share
country information so each needs to
understand what the other one means
another example our currency and gender
codes the solution is to create a lookup
that associates values used by one
application for a specific field to the
values used by another application for
the same field
this way you can map values across
applications here we see the lookup
created for mapping country codes you
may have several lookups for one
integration depending on the number of
fields that require mapping lookups are
also reusable and can be used by
multiple integration they're based on
aesthetic definition meaning you create
and populate them during design time and
do not change by runtime activities
these tables are used for looking up
values only as a developer hard-coding
look-up tables in your applications can
be a challenging and time-consuming
proposition but using them an
integration cloud service is fast and
easy when you map data in your
integrations you can reference
previously created lookups with the
lookup value function you simply drag
and drop the function then select the
lookup to use now your integration knows
how to map data coming in from one
application to data being sent to
another application once you create a
lookup you can clone it to create a new
look up quickly and export it to a CSV
file for use in other integration cloud
service
vironment so that's how easy it is to
create and use lookups to share
information between applications in
integration cloud service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
