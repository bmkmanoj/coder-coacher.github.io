and i work for oracle right as you can
see here as a principal product manager
working openjdk i work from germany so I
live in hamburg a beautiful port city
our autumns right now our rainy wet and
cold so this is like a vacation I've
never seen San Francisco like this this
is awesome please keep it for next year
in circle growth all right and I'm here
because I make the future job actually I
help make the future Java updates so
before we get started you've seen any
other presentation gel one you've seen
this slide before if you haven't take a
moment to enjoy I'm sure expect this one
right but you didn't expect this slide
hands up so hands up if you're using
java 7 already excellent very good so in
this presentation are we talking about a
bit about jdk 7 updates how we make them
how they get produced in openjdk so
giving you a bit of a under the hood
peak in the development of the whole
thing and I thought what about a week to
start it off then with a survey of
course and then followed by a demo all
right and of course the demo is in line
with the theme of the conference make
the future Java let's do that so since
deke seven updates are being developed
in openjdk that means you can actually
use mercurial 18 to clone the mercurial
repository screen sizes all right
on job of naps or JD 7 update project
for the bleeding edge the absolute
leading edge of creating a 7-up develop
and jdk 7 you dash dad that's where yo
you want to experience the pain the
latest fixes that they're coming so you
do this right and then it goes off on
our wireless network and requests all
the changes and you see it too fast and
it's updating is done well alright that
sounds like a very tiny but you're the
cake could it be fast let's look what's
in there there is no code in here
alright there's a file get source let's
do that and then that file goes off and
fetches all the other sub repositories
that comprise the source code for the
jdk so korva and exp and jax-ws and
language tools and the jdk and hot spot
known that self in parallel and while
commit a team to watch for all this
happened for a while this is a Wi-Fi
network so let's not do that let's
instead go to something i prepared
somewhere else where i have a complete
clone already so there we go this is
what it looks like once a download the
source code you have the corba directory
of jeddak a directory the hotspot jxp
and so on its own directories you want
to go and look in the source code right
there but we're not see what you're
looking to source code we're here to
build it i make a future update so i'm
gonna make it so i'm lucky building i
make is reasonably easy if I the
coordinates of windows will first spend
the next half an hour setting the whole
thing up but on a Mac all I have to do
is a spit of wooden the beautiful magic
incantation so let's see this so I'll
basically tell the shell of my local is
POSIX and I tell the build system where
to find java 7 built to run the village
cell phone because of course we're
willing to jdk or different things a lot
of Java code which should eat job to
build so all right we've done this guru
and then we make
the future java this is a slow Mac so
this would go off and do all kinds of
tests to see if I set up all the paths
correctly instead senex check past so
that's good it'll go off and you know
start building stuff and compiling and
compiling some more things compiling a
particular Java C Conn pod to bootstrap
itself and this will now go on for a
little while now I could end a tool here
and just spend the next hour so just
telling you what's being compiled but
that's kind of boring right so this is
just to show you how easy it is on a Mac
to get started look at the source code
and see what's happening in seven
updates in the open in openjdk all right
look with that that was the demo and of
course if you like me in the middle of a
talking java one and you just sawed off
a g7 bill you don't have time for that
well you do something else right so you
can go here on jdk 7 the java.net and
you can download our developer preview
bills that they publish regularly on a
weekly robot with a schedule for the
next releases so that means you don't
have to do all this by hand you're
particularly running on windows or on
linux or solaris park or linux arm you
can just go and fetch these downloads
under the Oracle pre-release off
tribulation agreement license and to
rami these things of course you can just
go ahead and do this yourself from the
open judika source code and play with
that or find somebody else about this
for you like some people could need to
do so this is just to show you what's
out there on setting up things to give
you a feel for what you can get right
now if you want to be in the bleeding
edge and with that thing said and done
I'll just lock myself again from network
so my wife doesn't call me the middle
talk since it's it's very late now in
Germany it's a great time to call right
before baby goes to that and I go back
to the slides then was done it worked
I didn't use a raspberry pi that's good
all right so this is we can find the
early access Developer Preview bills
right so why we're doing this stuff so
why is all this stuff out there and open
to the case you can download it and
village yourself and play with it you
know that well if you look on the open
jdk 7 update project's website and like
any other openjdk project it has a
website there is a single sentence
description of what this project is
about the goal is to develop updates to
jdk 7 now you may be thinking all right
so wait didn't you guys have a jdk 7
project that went forever and then made
a jdk 7 I mean what happened here I'll
tell you so that last year own in in
June hemic stole um who's in the product
management team is possible for java SE
i'm going to things announce that we are
moving to openjdk as the official java
SE 7 reference implementation a
reference implementation is the
technical term only the JCP anything
basically means that we were renounced
that we're going to provide a
recommendation for a new java platform
based entirely on the openjdk open
source code and make it fun available
under the GPL open source license and as
you can see the first lot up there that
actually happened right so but how many
says things going to happen they happen
so but a month later we publish to java
SE 7 reference fermentation for download
on java.net and we published it on
Jadakiss 70 java.net / java SE 7 RI
recommendation and this one is based
solely on all this open source code but
with jdk 7 project accumulated over its
couple of years existence and there of
course binaries fineries for Windows and
Linux but these binaries aren't for you
unless you are actually trying to
plement java SE 7 plot from spec
yourself right there there as a
reference implementation there they're
like the golden meter or the gold
kilogram in a museum in Paris you don't
go to Paris to where you fish you buy a
fish or mark or before fri you go and
use a local scale but they are all
checked against a reference thing so
it's a radix plantation it's recommended
for reference purposes only it's been
approved by the JCP but being a
reference limitation it will receive no
updates in particular security updates
right we don't go to Paris and paint the
whole thing you it's the reference
kilogram it stays the way it is alright
so with this dedication project having
completed its work and having delivered
our reference fermentation the binary
there was nothing left for it to do
seriously so we delivered july c7 the
announcement press release last July and
then we have to do something about
updates because we could have a course
set all right we deliver seven let's go
to wait for next two years but it
doesn't quite work that way right you
want to have updates you want to have
bucks fix you want to have features you
won't have improvements so for the first
time we had opportunity to actually go
and look at how we deliver updates if we
could deliver them in the open to begin
with if we could use OpenJDK as a
vehicle to engage your community to
engage participants not just from Oracle
but also from other organizations like
IBM of red hat to participate with us in
development of update releases in the
puck texting efforts so we proposed a
jdk 7 updates project in the OpenJDK and
decided to use that as the basis for our
own oracle jdk 7 update releases so the
oracle jdk 7 updates are in the same
thing but they're based off the coding
openjdk and of course there's the
website i mentioned before on opengl
caleb java net which is all the
information on who the developers are
what roles there are in the project and
particularly how to do development
processes work so what we do actually to
make the step our kinship and make it
high quality and there is this
information on QA so the typical
questions and answers and status updates
where we stand what we're
building towards and what can fix it
over for you can give the source code
like I shown you on a cheat at openjdk
but java.net in got7 you forests so we
have a master forest jdk 7 News sjd 7
you that's where we build releases from
that's that code has gone through
integration testing and we have a
development forest that's the bleeding
edge that's where developers get to
pushed it and there's of course the
mailing list and on this plane with j TQ
7 users tab that's actually where all
the work happens on the updates so
that's where you go to when you have
questions may we have code you want to
contribute back when you've fixes and so
on alright so this is the the general
structure of how all these things fit
together right so in the next session of
the talk I'll go up in a bit more detail
into how it actually all these things
work you know dedicate so that we'll get
out of this you'll have a good
understanding of how to participate and
how these things actually work so first
of all updates don't make themselves
they're made by people right and the
Seven updates project like all the other
opportunity project has actually plenty
of people involved in its creation think
they work their our reviewers so you set
an hour based project we require code to
be reviewed before it it actually enters
the source code base there are
committers so people who have committed
sense you can push source code changes
in 20 repositories the 2 i'm actually
form and then there are authors authors
are special roles so authors can create
their own change sets under their own
names so they offer changes but they
don't have the right gift to push these
changes into the repositories because
basically it takes a bit of time to get
used to how the processes work and to
understand all the things in it we have
put in place it would make this work and
you can see that there are a lot of
individuals involved I've played them in
around with fonts to show a few
different roles you can see the most of
us are commuters actually but we've
grown many
or the last year many people coming in a
fresh and starting to work on updates so
in total more than 200 individuals who
are involved in some of your away with
the project in part of the who we're
involved with j TQ 7 already and then
remain in that role in seven updates and
just haven't done much but that's okay
to you right you don't lose credit and i
currently service project League that's
in my case more of a ceremonial head the
real work is done the life years and by
people like ever been dling people like
shown coffee but people like Pat and
onion who actually act as maintain errs
on the list and who do a lot of the work
around improving changes around
reviewing changes around making all this
that actually flow and happen I get to
be here and talk about data reward all
right so if you want to see your name in
lights here get the start by pouring
changes and opened you to carry seven
updates all fell we've done it jdk 7 and
all that it's actually still a quite
busy project so there is quite a lot of
work going on in updates on a day-to-day
basis there is a website called a hola
dot net which is I think these days run
by black duck I'm not mistaking so what
they do is they go run an analysis with
Q graphs / arbitrary code bases and gets
or in mercurial and so on so if you go
to the link below we can find a summary
for jdk 7 optic project based on the j
TQ 7 u repository and this is just a
picture for the first 12 months you can
see that in the first year of leiserson
project we had around 2,000 for it
commits so that's pretty much breaks
down to about 200 per month now it
doesn't mean that every month we check
in 200 bug fixes right some of these are
things like somebody tagging the
repository for a build that still counts
for all may not be a major change for
you some of these are things that are
automatically creative and mercurial
it's part of the integration process
when we merge changes if you deposit
right but most of them represent real
new changes being made to either the jdk
to the language tools to hotspot or to
xml libraries and like i said this
amount of work takes quite a few people
to be involved in and actively out of
these 200 people with withdrawals in
OpenJDK in the first year more than 100
have participated and continued it a
change in one way or another so there
you can also see that there is typically
more than 20 people in both every month
in the project itself and this brings me
to the real inner mechanics of how these
things fit together so in OpenJDK we
have bylaws which have certain rights
and duties for participants and which
all those expectations on how projects
like the open jdk 7 update project are
supposed to operate so if your video by
laws on openjdk java net / x lols there
is a sentence in there or a couple of
them that says projects are expected to
operate in an open transparent and
meritocratic manner so open transparent
meritocratic that's good and if they
don't their alignment with these
principles will be monitored by the
governing board so to keep us honest so
when we start to to think about during
jdk 7 a place in the open where the
thing quite hard about how to do this in
an open and transparent america cratic
manner because it hasn't been done
before this is the first time it
actually updates to jdk are being done
in the open that means when Edward and I
started thinking about processes we have
to first come to understanding how the
process is for Oracle's jetty case so
far at work so that we understand what
happens on the closed side what the
plug-in deserves but we both to
understand what our downstream users
I steal others had work of needs daya so
we could come up with processes with the
community as part of discussion
meaningless that work before everybody
and we're in alignment with these
principles so we spent quite some time
on that in the beginning in setting up
our various roles in setting up various
ways to make code flow between the
repositories to ensure that what we end
up with actually works well and I'll
going to a few of these process we have
in the presentations which give you a
feeling for dip for a challenge as being
at and how we try to solve them so the
first thing we wanted to do was to set
up some ground rules we had a very good
example in the form of the OpenJDK 6
project led by Joe Darcy Joe had created
openjdk six pack in 2008 by taking the
JD seventh code base and effectively
cutting him down to the appropriate
pieces I'll prepare a pee Ice Baby
deliver a fully open source java 6
fermentation is part of in jdk but at
that time of course sun jdk six at a
time had been in full flight so there
was no real crosstalk between it to a
possible so in some ways Joe had the
liberty and and the joy to be able to
set his own rules in relative splendid
isolation which was great because secret
actual experiment with some new ways of
doing this kind of work with the
community in the open and that was for
us forever to me a good inspiration but
it was something we could take as is and
implement in seven updates right so the
way OpenJDK 6 worked was a good way for
us to learn from but not something to
copy one to one similarly since these
are updates to jdk 7 you will think okay
we can just take the process for jdk 7
and run with those but doesn't really
fit right so a project like jdk 7 RJD
key release project typically stretches
over multiple years say two years so
it's it has a very different kind of
process in place with milestones and
everything's a lot of times
say to correct errors updates on the
other hand we are deliver up the
delicious very frequently effectively
every couple of months and that means
the development cycle is much more
shorter and that means that we have to
put some thought into how we can how we
can work together in a quick way how we
can avoid having mistakes beginning so
let me start it was clear that we needed
some ground rules these expectations
about how we wanted to operate the
project and the first sure they were
ever created was to say we have
processes will develop this in the open
and they will change in the open and
since we created the put it across the
glass place last year we had a couple of
changes couple of small tweaks to make
some things better um but in general
this stuff up really well so it's also a
bit of a talk about this it's also quite
useful as though it's a very attractive
at ideas because you know any of you
have a personal change we'll have to
discuss publicly right so it's a good
rule to have the second ground rule was
about developments how do we have voice
to Asian where we end up having a lot of
fixes contributed to seven updates and
nothing to eight and then being a
situation would be are almost ready to
release eight where there are hundreds
of things left over to forward port and
test right nobody wants that so what we
did was to have another ground rule to
tell developers to get the changes in 28
first eight first and then please beg
for them and that ensures that whenever
there is a bug fix it goes into eight it
gets tested in it it goes into eight
really accessible that George self
mention the keynote so do to try to
model as well and then after a while
developers can bring it back into seven
updates and ask for approval to backport
a change in push it in
so security fixes don't have an open to
decay that wouldn't work right so we
don't know is it open to the cake that
just couldn't happen for it what we have
thought our forests right so we have
these master forest with integrated code
we have developer forest and they all
have maintainer so they have someone in
place who can approve changes who acts
as a gatekeeper who ensures that change
is coming in meet expectations who
ensures that the change is coming in for
example of free of things shouldn't be
there right but also include things it
should be there for example test code so
the maintainer role is there all we kind
of invented for this project as a sort
of a gatekeeper between developers
wanted to backport changes and it fixes
in there and actually ensuring that what
comes in here meets all what we need to
be able to liver a good release in open
source and changes in rule three coming
in 27 updates we want these changes to
be publicly reviewed we want to profit
from having many eyes looking at coping
deck board and the approvals for these
changes also have it happen in yoga and
that ensures that everybody knows when
somebody's proposing and fix that that
fixed action as a proof of updates
or not so that doesn't happen behind
closed doors approval for a fixed
episode you these approvals containers
are done centrally on the jdk 7 ugh
their mailing list that's the main list
we use to work with seven updates but
it's not the only meaningless views to
work with seven updates so for example
for project like the mac OS 10 port a
lot of the work on actually implementing
fixes and actually doing the necessary
reuse and all these things happens on
the mac OS n dash dev meeting list we're
the experts for neck OS 10 ports are and
then once the fix is approved once it's
an eight after a while once it's
basically show it's worth the night it
gets back
seven updates and then the approval
request comes to the maintainer spooge
87 are you Michelle innings and that
ensures that if you're following just
DDK 17 fish that mailing list you see
everything happening batch by batch so
you see all that play you don't have to
watch necessarily all the readings but
you see what's happening for the updates
maintainer since we don't all live in
the same time zones for good or veterans
are pretty much like Germany when Tina's
also can pre-approve changes right so
when you when you know that a update for
hospitals coming you could say all right
I approve this one out of time and you
can also on the other hand ask for
additional uses imitator so if you're
unsure about a change about affect you
can ask somebody to have another look at
to make sure that it all matches our
expectations so in that sense
maintainers act as a glue between all
the different stakeholders as your as a
connection between developers and users
and everybody else and one last rule we
have here or to actually is the changes
coming for seven updates to be plausible
they shouldn't just appear out of
nowhere so they should have something to
read your trail leadership into the
request they shouldn't just appear out
of thin air in the repository because it
makes everybody nervous right and being
nervous is bad wait a woman so these are
the ground rules after a year or so of
living with them and slightly tweak them
I think we're actually doing a pretty
good job of following along with them so
of getting development happening in
transparent and open way I'm getting
using the jdk 7 you touch their mailing
list as a central resource for everybody
interested in following the project to
inform them of everything's happening
we've had to do quite a bit of work over
time we learned quite a bit as we
started we didn't publish information on
say schedules and these things over time
we as we spoke with the community using
gt7 a place
string at conferences like Boston a
little bit more about their needs and
sorry get more about say are these
schedules alright so that's the ground
rules now of course ground rules means
you have rules but where is the code so
i said we want to have code that's
reviewed and for cadre news we have a
bunch of rules as well so code reviews
have to happen in public 47 updates we
do get some code from other projects
likes a hot spot or genki eight or korva
and whatever in these cases we don't go
and pull these them but if there is
coded specific 47 updates that's great
news and updates it gets really there
there is to ensure that developers have
a reason to actually go towards eight
first there is a fast path for approvals
from eight in fixing the case of
unmodified backports so if the code
doesn't actually have any modifications
if it's a one to one comment patch
applying again that's okay right there's
also slow path for backports with
modifications you have to go in and
change a line or two to make the
backward work then we know we need to
have when somebody else look at this
code again just to ensure that what
comes in here actually works and
actually works everywhere and works as
well as we expect it to work and in line
you that we require at least one
reviewer to look at any change coming in
to the mainland horse and once we come
towards the release once we start
ramping down to release in a process so
we keep our mainland forests open all
the time but given points in time we'll
ramp down and saw to raise the bar for
what kind of fix is going to release the
monsters are doing that we create a new
forest Fur Elise for example if you go
to acrylic all stories you will find
seven you 64 s for last release then we
also raise the bar for a number of years
so it's at least to have to look at the
changes coming and also means as a
recent addition that when you're back
coding changes from from eight in the
seven updates we also want you to make
sure that you
I've spoken with your reviewers in eight
in particular if you're back quoting
somebody else's code right we want to
make sure everybody who may know
something about the change is involved
in this process and can voice their
opinion whether it's a good backward or
not because of course we can't just take
anything from eight input of the seven
updates if somebody has a new man at the
string in eight we can't put it in seven
updates that that doesn't work right and
of course this is also part of how we
develop seven our base in the open when
there are questions about the back
porting process we discuss them on the
mainland so a week or so ago we had a
backward request coming in for some
documentation change but your sashing
upon javadoc and we had to discuss first
with a we actually want to have javadoc
changes coming to surf and updates in
something it's either spec relevant or
accommodation detail in more people like
Joe Darcy can do the CCC work at Oracle
to make sure we get a good reply make
sure we get a good solution and now we
are able to include say implementation
note the mutation fixes in seven updates
but that's the job to maintain the job
of the maintainer a modular visits to
bring the various parties together to
bring the various areas of expertise
together on compatibility on leg porting
on development and on the subject
matters and after you are doing this
pretty much all of the stuff that's
happening in seven updates itself is
actually done according to these rules
with public reviews and following the
fast pathing usually there are some
cases when we have new people coming in
who then unwillingly break a rule to
typically to make they mean no harm
right it's just somebody who's doing
more ricola something humans is trying
to push the changes in before the 5pm
deadline strikes for the next build
which is 2 a.m. for me in the morning so
they can treat you all right and then it
typically is a saint change so we can
redirect the vehicle image meditators
and
we have a small check with them standard
rules and love them as much as we do
this is an example request right so so
this is a request that actually happen
rjd2 7 update vilas from somebody oracle
beg porting the fix for a particular bug
into our development forest and list
emil says this fix have been pushed in
exactly same form in 28 the change is
exactly the same for 7 update 10 there's
a link to the corresponding bug report
in our database so that you can actually
get more information about the back
itself if there are any related issues
that should be considered for the back
court for example but something that I'd
like to do is a maintainer to make sure
that the back court has considered all
the related things that may need to be
peg podium as well in case that the bug
is closed we typically ask the submitter
to also go to instead of paws medical
inc give us a description of a change so
we can review it necessary there's a
point that JJ change net in this case
it's in the 2d forest so this is a a
double he change there is a web breath
web drafts are our own for months or yep
tool we use to be able to review code on
our coding view servers CR openjdk and
then in this case there's also review
threat but you can also which is also
public of course that you can go and
look at in our mail are cut and see what
happened with this is proposed so there
is patch have to go through a couple
iterations was a second travel change
was this something that was actually
approved other things that have been
pointed out in the review that I need to
consider when we back toward us into
seven updates are the things that we
need to ask additional interviewer did
it turn out that this patch was only
tested on say one platform will be more
tests here and you also get to know who
really changed in these cases reviewers
and 7-up based project and we get a lot
of these right so like I said there are
hundreds of changes coming into
a change that's coming into forest so we
get quite a lot of this kind of email
and as a maintainer you get to look over
it and you know make a decision whether
to approve it or with it ask more
information ask for Eve use and so on
and so on this used to be slower but
these days thanks to the great work done
by Edward and Sean we're able to usually
process these things say we do not know
yourself except when it's a weekend or
hole in it or a gel one alright but
usually it's about their self because of
course you also want to just slap these
away you want to give people between to
chime in if there's something that they
they want to bring the discussion
alright that's regular code changes but
of course there are also bits and pieces
in the setup of code base that we get
from other projects that I mentioned so
in the seven uppercase that's a hot spot
that's korba that's exp and jax-ws since
they typically are developed in a
different openjdk or glassfish project
they typically accumulate more than one
change so for them we have a bulk update
process about change process and that
means maintain errs get to be the
traffic cops regulating this pod change
traffic they can also ask for additional
reviews in case it's necessary and of
course since these changes can be giving
my significant they require approval
looking at the change but they also have
to build everywhere in the pass all the
tests so we explicitly asks a
contributor requesting about change
approval to ensure that all the tests
have been run and old tests it passed
right because bot changes like hot spot
they concern everybody so if you've
broken hot spot in bath change you've
broken everybody that's bad so that's
why we provide changes at higher load
Hyrule some of accepting what we don't
set to give an example here
this is what a buck approval request
looks on our main list for a hospital
integration so our integrators
requesting to integrate a specific codes
but built into specific jdk 7 update
build there is a pointer again here to
the web red so you can look and see as
anybody on the list of course as a
maintainer what exactly is contained in
separate there is in this case statement
and testing is in progress the
integrated will hold off until our
quality engineering team s basically
proved aggression and it also contains a
list of all the fixes containing this
path integration as maintainer caloocan
see is this what expect to see or is
this something it's are different right
and that means you can follow along even
as hospital is integrated what level of
yarn and how far along we are all right
so in the unlikely case that you have a
fix right and you wondering all right so
I used seven updates and it broke my
hand or something and I don't know I fix
it so why should I go well if you don't
know please ask on the mailing list
right I'm I'll be glad to help you and
the thing is will likely tell you to go
somewhere else it'll said before we want
to fix this you went to eight first so
we would like to tell you please go to
eight or please go to hot spot if it's a
change for hotspot or please go to the
glass this project projects beef of
change in this area and do and computer
fix over there right and get it through
their testing first it fix your fix
except integrated into jdk and once
that's done once a certain time has
passed once your fixes as has acquired a
nice pattern of goodness right then come
back to us later with a backboard and
you know make sure every viewers also
aware of your attention like Porter
change
and that's basically if you have a face
right it's it's not as hard as it looks
it's a bit unconventional because you
will get told to go somewhere else what
actually works so we do get a steady
stream of motivations from people like
and reuse here or from developers from
IBM you're pushing that change into H
energetic it first and then bring it
back into seven updates but of course
not everything is that easy there are
some cases of a splash one of these
special thing is things is integrating a
nouveau / consistent port either to jdk
that happens very rarely and it just
happened in seven updates but we got a
new port 40 is 10 so back in the
beginning in the early early early days
of OpenJDK there was a porting project
for VST platforms for FPS team freebsd
openbsd and all was good and then Along
Came lemon far and continued into the
port abc40 project for Darwin or other
words for the Mac I'm almost even better
right but it was basically it was 611
based so it wasn't quite up to the
standard of say somebody using NetBeans
right so in 2010 apple and oracle
announced a new portal project for mac
OS 10 up based actually on the dark on
the base deport on the starting code
base and we saw the new project open
unike for this with the diffusion from
Apple it abuse of Oracle to bring this
code up to speed to bring it to a level
of where it can be integrated into j TQ
7 now we didn't integrate into seven
proper because it was too late to say
that point but of course that meant we
can look into updates so 2011 we created
a mentoring forest gt7 you dish OSX
where the code from that ghosts n port
migrated into that's the forest we use
to bring the cool in mac OS tempore
in alignment with the code in seven
updates piece by piece and then a couple
of months later in regulars in 12 it was
integrated into jdk 7 you dashed a
forest and it was then forward port it
to eight and you'll see wait you said go
to eat first right what happened here
well an open system port is for
operating system within support before
like OS 10 it's actually quite a bit of
work it touches a lot of code it's not
just hot spot it touches class libraries
and at that point in time we're already
undergone a couple of months um actually
more half a year of development on eight
so a third stampeded on steadily in that
sense it made little sense for us to
make the mac OS 10 porting team first go
to eight implement holding you seven
eight dude lambdas first guide right and
then come back to seven updates Yearsley
we didn't want that we figured if you
wouldn't like very much you get to g7
updates at the same time everybody else
gets them if you're on a Mac so for
ascent port we went to seven updates
first and then brought the code forward
into eight where it is being maintained
now so if you have a change a bug fix
for mec right now same answer is plug
this before go to eight first please and
come back later when the code is ready
and this is also a good example of how
our job and works for seven updates
while the approvals for this code base
are discussed on jakey seven dash you
disturb my English most of the
development work actually is discussed
on the corresponding extent port mailing
list right so that's where people were
coming with mac OS 10 questions and get
networks and answers and that sort of
helps keep conversations containing two
different communities
so that's a lot of effort so what I get
for this well we got a couple of
releases so far that have been developed
from the beginning till the enemy
OpenJDK the first one was the
opportunity case adapted to release and
like I said the first ever update
release it was done in the open it was
released in December last year and
contained among other goodies a new
hotspot version so we're Jadakiss sex
the sixth state on the hospital 20 i
think seven updates have since moved
along to newer newer versions bringing
performance and reliability improvements
then of course with it we did bring in
support for a new operating system for
orca solaris 11 but it was just in your
revision of solaris just right it was
the whole new thing like wasting words
we had since this was the first normal
release after seven we had some bug
fixes for interesting 7 features so
project coin Rosaleda who know it in
seven had some really nice has some
really nice language changes that are
simple and small but even if it's simple
at smaller case I have bugs so there
were two bucks I've actually fixed in
the first OpenJDK 7 update release and
then of course all all kinds of other
bug fixes and updates to information we
carry as part of the JDK for example the
also on time zone database the
development period for this took from
approximately six months from about july
until december to give you an idea of
what i mean that when i say that the
processes have to be different from a
jdk release the jdk several weeks ago at
45 years it has to be much positive it's
it's a meat grinder for patches it's
okay this worked well we're the first
update in the open hey let's challenge
ourselves let's integrate in your
existing so we did that right so we did
eurasian of a newport the new bring
system in the open so digits are the
neck West End port all this stuff with
bringing them when you forest dragging
the code from one forest to the other
was discussed
man this was discussed and the forest by
created was approved all of that process
ran through to bring the port over from
echo s10 porting projects in 27 updates
and the seven updates proper and we
released in april this year we also
started to publish the source code for
update releases 7.4 and lighter 756 and
source code bundles on java jdk 7 de
java.net so that's if you're for example
packaging openjdk seven updates you
don't have to go and try this out of
mercurial yourself like I show you
before you can just go ahead and take
the zip file and use that instead we've
integrated the micro sim port at that
time as a developer preview of jdk we
integrate the new hospital 23 and the
usual instead of updates like the all
sometimes on database out page XP have
introduced a new support garbage
collector so we 7 update for garbage
first became a supportive culture
collection option and that too is
something that requires a lot of testing
I love care to make happen and to
conclude the first year we had a third
release down open to the k 7 update 6
that one was released in August this
year and since we had you know done the
first weeds in the open into a new port
in August we basically had nothing left
to changes with so we had a normal
release just regular stream of bug fixes
we completed the work on the jdk injury
support for OS 10 so rounded off the
corners made it magical and
revolutionary as it should be we
introduce an alternative hashing
function into spin 27 update code which
is in seven you actually disabled by
default but there is a system property
you can use to enable it and eight we
enabled by default and that shows up at
how we in 7 update proceeds to
sure that there is very little
disruption for users updating right if a
new functionality can cause the service
we prefer to be conservative and update
release and then do the revolutionary
thing in regular wiggles and then of
course time never stops running in
particular time zone change is never
stop running with the more than I think
200 countries in the world somebody
always has a good reason to change
daylight saving time so of course as
every other release this one also had an
old sometimes on database update and
various other bug fixes and I hope this
has given you a bit of an answer into
the mechanics behind the sausage-making
that goes into a good tasty 7 update
release in OpenJDK so if you want to
help us make the future java 7 updates
better please get involved please
download our developer preview builds on
jdk 7 java.net and use them to test your
code use them to you know use the early
access versions and run them against
your own I don't know whatever you're
working on because the thing is what we
can test with is just a tiny just a tiny
part of the iceberg with all the code
out there it's above the water holes
they are a dark matter of code we don't
have access to it you do so you you have
to let us know when something is going
to seven updates has issues and codes
regression for example for you in your
testing and by doing this in the open by
allowing you to see the work on seven
updates as it's happening patch by patch
changes by chance sir you have the
opportunity to participate in a way that
lets us find out such issues as soon as
possible so we can go and fix them as
early as possible and we can live high
quality updates to you and of course if
you want to go beyond just getting a
binary trying it out and submitting nice
issues of bug tracker which is always
appreciated the first step is to become
participant in the jdk 7 up a project
and that's actually as easy as
subscribing to the g---seven you that
mean this and starting to listen to the
conversation and starting to participate
in discussions the change is being
backported and with that i like to thank
you
all right how do we choose which should
be fixed so since we have the pleasant
since we have a pleasant set up where we
ask people to go into eight first right
we actually are able to avoid having
most of that choosing and responsibility
by having the aid project service our
Petra dish right so if a physical is
controversial it gets discussed in eight
first it gets flying around in eight
first and then hopefully it gets you
know to be a good piece of code
integrating 28 well hang out there and
by the time is proposed for seven
updates it's the long controversial it's
been out there from four weeks or four
months everybody is okay with it it
becomes a much in the process right so
we don't have to do so much taking
ourselves to seven updates we do that
work for eight of course and that really
depends on what one you know what one is
doing so I'm not sure how are you for
example to choose your issues you want
to fix a tit redhead
and we typically have the similar things
for us as well and the thing is due to
the various different parties coming
together in open source project like
this then we have different areas that
you more about the others meaning that
you know if you say find an issue with
iced tea which is based on openjdk seven
updates are running on fedora or rail
six a thing and follow back to get there
it will eventually hopefully into a fix
it shows up in eight and seven updates
redhead team if you file a bug tracker
without white checker you know somebody
in our team as we look at it and decide
if it's something that we need to fix it
right away or there or something else so
in that sense in a puzzle of this there
is no central authority to make a sort
of priority decisions because nobody
signs up for that everybody signs up for
fixing the code they care about but in a
pleasure to that your view you have many
people who gave up many areas of though
and that's what we are starting to see
well I'm glad left you'll speechless so
this was a magical revolutionaries
entation thank you all so much for
coming enjoy our lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
