supervisor at Red Hat title by
supervisor what I do is I manage the
openjdk group over at Red Hat so this
talk is about well as the title says
openjdk pulse open-source enhancements
the reason I wanted to have this job is
because I see a lot of talking about
openjdk but I feel that one of the
reasons why openjdk adoption is not as
or one of the things that affects
openjdk adoption is the fact that it
does not have everything that the
proprietary GD k is given now that
doesn't necessarily record etiquette
also includes what the IBM proprietary
GDK has so this talk is to shed light on
what we we as in the Red Hat and the
community as a whole are doing sort of
bridge that gap to make open dedicate or
more complete distribution that looks
very familiar to what the proprietary
JDK is provide this talk is not
specifically about what red hat does
it's about what the community does it's
not specifically about iced tea it also
includes things like projects that are
hosted on openjdk java.net it's just
about projects in general that are
outside of openjdk but that help
complete open jiading need to make it a
full distribution like the proprietary
travel providing to the case so this is
just the usual side i have there's an
index on the left side if you want to
follow it if you're falling asleep you
know how long you have to stay here and
okay so let's take a look at this is a
very simplistic picture off from the JDK
but if you take a look at they generally
what you have in you jdk is you have
your hotspot virtual machine which has
the interpreter in legit you have your
tools like Java Sea javadoc etc and you
have your class Lavery's looking at what
the proprietary JDK cubes in this case I
am referring to the Oracle JDK because
you can see that on the right side in
the red there that says five percent so
if you look at the mix that oracle jdk
has about ninety-five percent of the
four places open five percent of it is
close based on whatever add-on
andorra JDK also if you download it from
the web it gives you a departmental such
as you get the Java WS and the plug-in
and there are also serviceability tools
for developers they're not part of the
sander jdk but they're sort of expected
by developers want to a profile and
monitor and instrument their
applications so that's what that's the
wheel for what jdk is and it's
difference I think between developers
and users for developers some developers
care about deployment tools but that's
only if they're writing outfits or java
web site applications for the most part
developers care about the virtual
machine the tools like Java C and Java
doc the class sizes that are there and
serviceability tools looking at it from
home users perspective all users don't
care about serviceability tools they
don't write applications what they care
about our deployment tools because a lot
of uses you java through their web
browser through the plugin home users
don't strictly care about the Java
Virtual Machine but it's what's really
running their application than the need
and the class every support support that
home users don't care so much about
tools because there again then after the
writing applications they don't need the
compiler and Java doc which is why the
JRE does not contain those things either
so let's look at each of those items
impart items that are not available in
OpenJDK first of all there is the closed
source code what's in there is unknown
because of course it's closed source
code some of things are involved such as
for example of the arm that's part
of your crew jdk is closed it's not
going to be open anytime soon there are
no plans for looking at deployment tools
are there is a plug-in and there's web
start with these are part of the IBM TDK
has this and so this you're already
looking at serviceability tools Oracle
the jrockit JDK has zero emission
control iBM has health center I'm not
sure with the counterpart for
what is but I'm sure there is one but
this is that in the open source
community there are lots of things that
are for example platforms that are not
in OpenJDK currently OpenJDK supports
your Intel 32-bit emt 64 and spark but
there's a whole host of other platforms
that are not supported by OpenJDK that
certain other jdk is due for example of
the Oracle jenneke supports our IBM JDK
supports BBC ppc64 s390 s390x so that's
basically a lot of them these are just
some of them itanium probably not as use
it anymore but our pcs use file a lot by
businesses System z is used by a lot of
businesses arm is what businesses are
going to use in the future the way
things are going right now this is a
whole lot of other ones as well so we
want to complete OpenJDK we want to add
these pieces that are missing and we
want to complete it to make it compete
with proprietary JD case but to open
source right now you have OpenJDK but
OpenJDK is not set up especially at the
very beginning when it was when the code
was put up on a cheater java.net there
were a lot of barriers to entry and
certain things were needed to make it
possible to add these things to openjdk
so what are those things well first of
all you need a bug tracking system now
I'm not going to go into the details of
how the tracking system should be
provided because that horse has been
beaten to that in other meetings all day
but it's needed right it's missing and
it's in you can't write high-quality
good soft for especially large projects
without a proper but tracking system so
it's needed you need a system to patch
things openjdk initially the barrier to
entry was extremely hot adding a patch
and getting a pattern to OpenJDK was
non-trivial which means that if someone
had a performance patch if someone had a
security patch that Oracle didn't like
or if someone had some kind of bug fix
patch that Oracle didn't like they had
no other way they had no real way to
maintain
other than maybe inside the specific
spec files and this was from a community
perspective the community might have
accepted it but Oracle might not have
liked it so it didn't end up going in
this process I should point out has
improved very significantly now the
barrier to entry has gone down
significantly there are still issues
that remain a lot of them were brought
up at the governing board meeting this
afternoon and hopefully they will get
resolved shortly you also need build
infrastructure currently the OpenJDK
build system is not the greatest in the
world it's where you rigid it's not very
configurable and when it comes to adding
things especially like other platform
support like being able to plug in
another virtual machine like jambiya
more cacao or something like that it is
extremely difficult again with this one
as well the billion for project is
looking very very promising and I'm
hoping that a lot of these problems will
be solved by build in pro so let's take
a look at what the solutions are for
these problems that are currently being
used by the community first of all for
IC for buck system we have I see their
class by drug stash bugzilla this is
where bucks currently go that are
related to the deployment tools that we
use to the serviceability tools sorry
the deployment tools that we're working
on the serviceability tools that we're
working on the zero stuff the arm stuff
that's our bugzilla it's working we
control it and it works well where this
is now in the future of course the hope
is that this can all be moved into a
proper open dedicated java.net domain
when the JIRA is up and working next
step is what is going to know okay an
excep is being able to add patches for
IC 6 we had a patches directory where we
kept all of these patches that are
referred to earlier which may have been
bug fixes or actually there are no see I
shouldn't say security fixes cuzzo
security fixes are taken are done by
Oracle quite regularly and quite well
but more like bug fixes or performance
enhancements that don't necessarily
apply to let say Oracle customers back
in the days of 6 it was extremely hard
to get patches in so they
in the patches directory with OpenJDK 7
we still have a patches directory in the
IC 7 directly but it's extremely small a
majority of our patches are now actually
in a hybrid forest which include which
is pulled from the OpenJDK upstream
forest and then we patch it the reason
why it works in seven and not in six is
because the patch count is significantly
lower in seven we worked on getting a
lot of those patches upstream as much as
possible and in fact going from seven to
eight we are working hard on getting all
of the patches out of seven and putting
them all into upstream OpenJDK as the
barriers to entry go down so the hope is
that in the future everything will be
upstream on openjdk and that's what
distributions will be able to pull and
build from they won't need a surrounding
infrastructure of iced tea which
actually brings me to the next part IC
does provide one other important thing
it provides support for things like
being able to hook in system libraries
being able to use multiple virtual
machines like jam BM and cacao and for
those ones I actually can't think of a
solution so we'll have to maybe next
year we'll have something for that
hopefully it will infra will be able to
solve some of this so this is the
foundation you need a proper buck system
you need a system where patches can be
stored patches that don't want to open
jada Kate and you need a highly
configurable build system so that you
can do things like plug in different VMs
for different architectures so the next
step you use all these tools that we
currently have and we start filling in
the gaps so but still with them one at a
time the first is the closed part well
whatever is closed in terms of
performance we can't really fix it
because we don't know what is closed but
things like for example the arm port is
closed that we can now work on through
other means so these are the platforms
that we would like to support just some
of the platforms actually we would like
to support a lot more the first step
towards that is being able to provide an
interpreter I should have removed that
middle line sorry Andrew aha so 0 is a
C++ based interpreter
currently the interpreters that i use in
OpenJDK have assembly in them which
means that you can it's non-trivial to
port them to other architectures but
zero is written in pure C++ which means
that it is quite easy to actually port
it to other architectures basically if
you have GCC on an architecture you can
build zero if you can build zero you
have interpreter support and you can run
all java code that's out there and with
zero we have gotten a PPC to pass TCK
and it's not that hard to get it passing
on other platforms either it gives it's
obviously it's an interpreter it's not a
jit so it's not going to give great
performance but it is passable
performance and there are the things
that we can add on top of it for example
things like shark which is an LVN based
 which will give even better
performance in the future next the arm
did a lot of this work has been done by
Andrew Haley who works for Red Hat and
it's based on an old port that was done
by Ed Neville for the Sun to jet but
Andrew recently for the past many months
actually has been working on it non-stop
he's gotten into a great state works
with OpenJDK and a seccc six completely
dicen que 7 doesn't fully pass it but
that's because of there are some things
that are missing in 0 related to jsr 292
which was quite a big change so we're
hoping that by November will have all of
these issues resolved and we have a
faulty ck7 pass as well the object that
we have is a c1 type jit so it doesn't
do see to time kind of high-level
optimizations it does see one level the
performance is actually quite good
especially compared to pure 0 which is
an interpreter only it's handwritten
assembly interpreter so like I said
works fast because it's in assembly as
opposed to like pure state machine like
interpretation 20 does it's been shipped
in fedoras inspiratory 17 because we
have full TCK pass we can ship it it
works fairly well we have a lot of stuff
building in fedora with disarmed it and
it works it builds fine it runs fine as
well the last time there is interesting
because i just added that a while ago
actually we are also working on an arm
see forgit to our knowledge this is the
only arm 64 jit in existence this will
our plan is to eventually make this open
source as well but there are nds and
things so it can't be done just yet but
this will be the first time jit and will
be fully open source are sorry the first
time 64 jet and again a lot of work
being done by Andrew Haley and also
helping him is Andrew Dean who works for
Red Hat as well so other parts outside
up OpenJDK so that takes care of the
closed source part we also have the
deployment tools which is plugin and
webster for that we have a project
called iced tea web which provides a
plug-in provides website and provides a
configuration to to be so to be able to
control the configuration for those two
tools so the last part the settings tool
is very similar to the control panel
tool that you'll find in the oracle jdk
for instance the plugin is very feature
phul it's it has feature parity with the
orca plugin it has full the iconic
support it works with multiple browsers
we tested off this list here I know we
tested with Firefox with chrome we have
tried it with the Midori and we also run
tests on epiphany and they all work
great so WebKit and gecko based browsers
both work well the other interesting
thing is that it works in architecture
is that wherever zero works the plug-in
has nothing assembly specific this is
interesting because if you download the
and jdk from oracle it does not have the
plugin or web start whereas ice-t web
will work on arm and website actually
posted on my blog a few months ago
working fully function plug-in on arm
first one I've seen website as well it's
on feature it's a almost feature parity
with Oracle there are a few things
missing that we know that we're working
on we hope to get them done soon has
full headless support and again the only
website that works on or range of
architectures we're proprietary Jadakiss
do not currently work and IT website
things which is our deployment settings
configuration tool this tool provides
everything that control panel does
and in the future we wanted to provide
more than what control panel does right
now provides full certificate management
it provides proxy configuration cash
management and security configuration we
also wanted to provide more fine-grain
security configuration for cases where
you may want to trust an absolute only
with certain things for example you know
like if you're using illuminate or black
border one of those things you may trust
the vendor to a certain extent to do
certain things but not everything you
may not want them to access your file
system for example so you want more
grand in the permissions even for
trusted certificates and that's what we
intend to provide eventually as well so
that's ice to grab it has a browser
plug-in website and settings tool though
idea of icy web right now it exists into
the ice tea umbrella but we wanted to go
into OpenJDK proper there are steps that
needs to be need to be taken before this
happens android a great idea the other
day when i was talking which is why
don't we propose this as a jap and have
it as a separate project under the
OpenJDK umbrella which is one step
closer so that's what we're going to
work towards there are a few things that
need to be worked on design-wise which
is the reason why we haven't done this
right now there's a patch sitting on the
mailing list right now for refactoring a
large chunk of the code so that takes
care of about fifty percent of the
refactoring that we want to do the other
fifty percent is related to class
loading once these refactorings are done
we intend to propose it as a jab put it
under the OpenJDK umbrella and then when
it's complete and when we have consensus
from everyone including openjdk members
merge it into OpenJDK because this is
one of the things that should exist in
the OpenJDK tree itself and not outside
of it is a separate to the other part
that's outside of JDK is serviceability
tools right now as I mentioned earlier
Oracle has be j-rok admission control
iBM has its health center openjdk has
nothing right now which is why we're
working on that if for those of you that
attend the to Roman and Mari over here
are two of the primary developers for to
thermostat that we're working
so what is Simmons had provide it
provides you the ability to profile
instrument and was it that therefore
things that are obviously profile
instrument manage and monitor that's the
one thank you those four things at an
application that will for your
application but you may want to go
deeper you may want to see what the JVM
is doing and thermoset provides that as
well you can dig deeper into the JVM see
when garbage collection happens and all
other kinds of garbage collector
statistics you may want to go one level
lower you may want to see what's
happening at the lower level libraries
maybe see how long the matter call it
takes for you know allocating a gigabyte
of space of something you can do that as
well are you may be an expert on the
Linux kernel you may want to see things
related to let's say the scheduler you
know for those of you are familiar with
you of one scheduled for example they
punish the CPU bound tasks rewards I
Obon tasks so depending on how your
application is behaving you may want to
monitor that see how the current
suggesting priorities and maybe manage
your application threads internally
accordingly to make it even more
efficient so it provides that this is
that the one machine level there are
another really nice thing about
thermoset is that it's killed it can
actually go to an arbitrary the
arbitrary number of cluster of machines
so you can have a cluster of one machine
or cluster of two machines can have a
cluster of two hundred machines and
thermoset can monitor all of them
simultaneously and give you data from a
single interface and we're working on a
lot of interfaces for it as well right
now we have a swinging interface and we
have a command-line interface which
makes script ability really easy I
intention is to also provide an eclipse
plugin which we're actually working on
right now as well which will allow you
to profile monitor instrument and the
other folks thing from eclipse itself we
also are working on a web client which
will allow you to do it from the web and
another interesting thing that Roman and
Mario mentioned is that because the
thermostat agent and the agent that
writes the database are separated and
you can write an arbitrary kind of
interface for
can also write interfaces for mobile
phones for example like iOS or Android
or something making monitoring really
easy Summerside the architecture is
extremely pluggable you can it's a lot
like visualvm if you've used it where
you can add in any kind of plug-in you
want to monitor any kind of data and
have that behavior show up in thermoset
so i'm not sure quick demo but years
with the screen more this looks like you
can do i can't see on this i just
shooting in the demo but that's what the
swing client looks like right now so
demo for thermostat this is going to be
a very short one I hope a lot of you
attended a Mario and Romans presentation
if they did a much better demo why I
hope not okay so step one worth it
starts up so you can see here that I
monitor my machine espresso is just my
machine name I'm monitoring you can see
the various processes that are running
on my system right now there's the
thermoset itself the services the agent
you can see you from the command line
that that was running there you can see
that it after the plug in Maine is
running this is the ice tea plugin so I
probably have an instance of the plug-in
running somewhere that I was working
with earlier and the other is the GUI
client itself so you can see that the
agent and the client are separate they
start to separate our processes so you
can have like 50 agents running on 50
machines and you can have a single
client running on a monitoring machine
and monitor all of those from that nice
simple interface so let's I just wrote a
couple of very simple applications
so this is just called it's a short-term
memory demo all it does is it really
allocates memory and then it D allocates
it so you can see needn't space girl and
then shrink row and then shrink you can
see the s0 space eventually grow and
shrink as it gets written down to one
eventually s1 shrinks and it gets
written too old I won't keep this
running for long but if it runs on and
if you'll see that eventually things get
deleted from the old generation and it
goes down the nice thing about this is
that you can see well you can see how
long the garbage collector how the
garbage collector ones as well so i
won't go into details of this demo was
originally written for another
conference that i gave a talk at but the
idea of the program is that it creates a
lot of objects very rapidly and then
lets them all go but doesn't let them go
before things get pushed down to the old
generation and in the demo what the way
it's running right now is that it starts
with a small with a small s zeros are a
small ratio of these various survivor
spaces so what i was trying to show with
the demo was that a lot of these garbage
collector causes can be almost
eliminated if you simply change the
ratios like if you're seeing this kind
of profile in your application where
things get pushed down each generation
and eventually degeneration just
collapses you can adjust the ratios to
make it so that it never gets pushed
down to those generations so garbage
collected and garbage collection doesn't
really need to happen on your generation
and the other app is to show so i'm just
going to stop this app this is to show
what i think is very well it looks very
pretty which is the thread monitoring
that mario added he was working on it
very hard before javaone I know so Ted
monitoring is not enabled by default
because it's a very expensive operation
and one of the things we want to do with
thermostat is keep the overhead as low
as possible right now I believe my you
ran
spec spec tests on it and we found it's
about anywhere between one to three
percent and we want to keep it at that
level as much as possible which is why
we don't enable things that we know are
going to be expensive so for example if
you look at heap memory over here which
is under over here it doesn't do
real-time keep monitoring because that's
a very expensive operation what you can
do is you can say dump the heap this is
as Mario mentioned earlier stop the
world operation so it's expensive which
is why we don't do it all the time but
if you want to at some point if your
applications type or if you see a weird
memory profile you can dump the heap and
then you can see this is a simple
histogram of what kind of objects are
allocated you can certain besides you
can sorted by instances and you can also
search for objects and go down all the
way to the roots and look at the
referrers or the references to the
object or what the object refers to
rather but anyways and this one what I
wanted to show you was so this is the
very simple application what it does is
it has two threads only one thread can
be active at a time while the other
thread stops so you can see things like
this timeline statistic which is lead
from here well this is not a good thing
to show up as this projector can't
really show the colors that that over
there so maybe you guys should use more
contrasting colors it shows a fine over
here if I pull it onto the screen so
normally it's supposed to be are not
nevermind yeah the demo gods are not
being nice so there's something wrong it
it should have normally shown you a
while thread one stops thread one is
also about thread two stops thread one
is going well thread one stops threat to
is going and so on and so forth I can
start doing on command line near as it
prints it but I know it's not showing
them anyways so that's the Mossad and of
course this is where your machine is all
je viens on your machine show up here
you can add much pollutions that if you
have a cluster of them and you can
monitor them all at once so go back to
my presentation here so that's what what
I meant when I said we need to complete
the JDK to make it more appealing to
sort of home uses and these are the
projects that are currently being worked
on by the community that is the IC
project which provides a sort of the
build infrastructure and the patch
management infrastructure we have I see
web which provides deployment tools we
have the arm jet which provides a jit
for I'm 32 and also arm 64 coming soon
we have 0 which provides a support for
Java on any arbitrary architecture as
long as you have GCC it works quite well
and we have thermoset which fills in the
gap of serviceability tools and these
are really I mean these are good in the
future they may even be more projects
which I was actually hoping for audience
participation on this part are there any
projects that anyone is aware of or
anyone is working on that you guys think
make a better fit for GDK that should
exist on the OpenJDK dotnet site ok well
for the most by these fill in all the
gaps that I had said in my original
diagram over there they fill in the post
source gap which is they provide the arm
did they film the deployment tools gap
VA I see and different the
serviceability tools gap via thermostat
the hope is that eventually iced tea
will not be needed currently of course
that's impossible because there are
barriers to entry you can't even come
into a hotspot and the yeah it's just
not possible right now eventually though
it would be really nice and that's our
goal as well to work with OpenJDK
upstream to get rid of it same with iced
tea web as well there's no reason why to
exist as a separate project it would be
best if it gets folded into a
communicator thermoset will continue to
remain a separate project because
serviceability tools don't really belong
in the JDK itself and that's fine but
they are one step towards getting more
complete JDK that use
and developers are used to and of course
zero and arms eat as well eventually we
want them folded into OpenJDK proper so
that everyone can benefit from it
without having to go to the specific
distribution of it a trying to go
through ice tea and whatnot and that's
it really are there any questions so AIX
hp-ux know there is effort going on
currently to get PPC in PPC jet and
actually I believe local is right here
he's one of the people working on it
and I know the bsd guys are building it
as well so it has work on certain
operating systems outset of what our
mainstream OpenJDK is used in product we
have customers who are using it in
production systems it it works quite
well I'm in the shared code that's the
code that's closed source between
hotspot and OpenJDK are not bug fixes
there are sometimes related things that
Oracle customers specifically need they
may be related to serviceability tools
but not necessary performance so as far
as production use of OpenJDK goes it is
this stability i would say is pretty
much on par with what the proprietary
GDK offers so yeah it's out say it's
ready for production use right bug fixes
if you as a customer have bug fix with
open so that's one of the biggest draws
of open so first of all the court is
open if tomorrow Oracle decides to stop
distributing the proprietary GD can you
built your entire stack on it you're out
of luck essentially you have no choice
if they make it paid you have to pay
them whatever the chart whereas with an
open source version the coil is open
it's under the GPL license so even if
they decide to take it offline you can
simply for kit but the bigger power is
really just the fact that it's open you
have a lot more you have a lot more eyes
on it essentially it's open code it's
code that you can see unlike the
proprietary GDK which is postcode with
open code you can do bug fixes if you
find if your developer finds a bug in
the JVM based on your application you
have to go through oracle you have to
wait for them to fix it and hope that
they fix it whereas with OpenJDK you can
apply the fix yourself even if OpenJDK
community refuses to take to fix yeah so
it's always it's the general closest
versus open source advantage it's full
you open you can do your own bug fixes
and you don't have to worry about if the
vendor stops distributing it tomorrow
yeah any other
true so Andrew saying that there are
parts of that five percent that I
mentioned earlier they do have open
source groans and that's true the only
thing is I don't know what the
percentage is because I know some parts
of work okay yeah so it's probably even
closer than PI personal yeah all right
any other questions yep i will let
andrew hill you answer that you can come
of Leandra it's important to realize
that arm 64 is only in name it is not in
any way related to the 32-bit ARM
architecture its wholly new a wholly new
instruction set it doesn't really share
anything with the existing arm code base
and it will be entirely done from
scratch and yeah it will definitely been
openjdk projects I wouldn't want to do
it any other way and it will certainly
be the first new courts of openjdk done
in public
it'll stay in iced tea I it would be
nice if it were developed further but to
be honest I don't really have any
interest in it it's fine it works you
know whatever the future is definitely
going to be 64 bit yes in the 64 bit and
I'm going to have that conversation in
public I think on the mailing lists at
the moment I simply don't know whether
we want to write AC 1 compiler for arm
64 because it's separate job I mean
there's no reason why the c1 and the c2
compiler couldn't be written entirely
independently as separate tasks by
different people but I suppose you want
c14 fast startup and I suppose there's a
lot of talk about tears compilation so
it might be advantageous to have c1 in
order to do tiered compilation I don't
know and maybe see one would get
vendacious as well because it'll be
quicker to write and we'll have
something that we can ship more quickly
i I really I really don't know I've
you didn't both of c1 and c2 or just see
to only see two yeah so you don't really
know how much easier it is to do seem to
the heat c1 and c2 no okay well I don't
know either I mean yeah it should be I
mean you can tell we kind of learning as
we go along but
I'm hoping that we'll be able to get
oracle engineers involved to advise and
help and kajol and all the rest of it so
we might get there a bit quicker all
right any other questions so what do you
mean by service what you mean what does
chamber support java suppose OpenJDK
that's distributed in rel yes and it
supports the Oracle JDK as well it
supports everything that we distribute
in realm so that includes the IBM Oracle
and OpenJDK all right any other question
all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
