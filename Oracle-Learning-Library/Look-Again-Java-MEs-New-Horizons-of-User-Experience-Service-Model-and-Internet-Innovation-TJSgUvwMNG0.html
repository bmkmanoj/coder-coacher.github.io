Java me really I thought I would start
by asking this question that is what is
series 40 so does anybody any of you
know and what is the relation between
Nokia and Java ME ok ok so I'm talking a
little bit more on the higher level so
nokia for smartphones for example we are
partnering with microsoft and we have
the Lumia range so there is this other
market which is the feature feature
phones which are becoming more and more
smarter and there we have a nokia OS
which is called the series 40 now this
this has been existing for quite some
time so it was it started in the early
2000s and now it has evolved quite a lot
and then it started with these candy bar
kind of a form factor and then we
evolved to qwerty and now very recently
we launched the full touch and we also
launched it we rebranded it and we
called it a shot and that there are
quite a lot of devices which are coming
up with our show the latest ones that
were launched was asha 308 and 309 which
were launched last last week and these
come in again i know that they are not
available in the united states but they
extremely popular in the developing
nations and this is one market which
nokia is still pretty strong and the
series 40 is a java based platform so
now then the next question is that we
are building in more the smarter
capabilities into Series 40 and why is
that so so we did a lot of market
research and we understood that though
our phones I mean I mean of course given
a choice all our consumers probably
would like to own a iphone or an android
but in the markets that we are talking
about not everybody can afford it
so hence the aspiration is there but and
these users and consumers want to use
the same kind of features for example
they want apps they want games they want
good social experience they want
location enablers so although all those
things they want in that kind of price
points so when we are talking about Asha
phones I'd I do have a few here so these
are phones available for less than
hundred dollars and few of them have a
one gig processor they can run
applications like whatsapp and diverse
you name it and then even for example
JFK now calls these as smartphones
because the kind of lines between these
feature phones and smartphones are
constantly blurring so again this this
is what I kind of thought of covering as
an agenda so I wanted to talk a little
bit about these the trends in in the
core Java ME markets and then if you are
planning to develop applications
enterprise applications or any any other
kind of Java ME applications for these
kind of markets than what are the few
things that you need to keep in mind
then I would like to talk a little bit
about the series 40 offering that we
have in terms of api's in terms of the
tools in terms of documentation
resources that we provide for developers
nokia also has a store i'm going to give
you some statistics there on the kind of
demand there is for applications for
these kind of devices so you will get a
fair amount of idea about of course the
reach as well as the demand and then I'm
going to talk a little bit about if you
are planning to build a service and then
you want to make that service available
for these kind of phones then how you
are going to build it so again I'm going
to take a few cases and then go through
them and then finally are there
will be a demo so I'll be demoing in-app
purchase so how you can build in premium
models in into your application so
anything I mean since it's a very small
audience up do you think there is
something else you would like me to
cover for example it need not be very
servant I've I guess it's the stage ok
so I will start a little bit on the
opportunity side so series 40 so how
many devices so 6 75 billion devices is
what what we think would be the active
devices in the current world right now
so it's it's a huge potential if you are
thinking in terms of reach and in in
terms again in terms of the store
downloads we have 17 million downloads
daily and now fifty percent of it is
driven by Series 40 so hi welcome yeah
you can please sit in the first row so
we just started since it's a very small
crowd so I'll just kind of summarize for
you so that so what we are talking about
here is just the opportunity that series
40 provides so series 40 is the nokia OS
platform for and it supports Java ME so
coming back to the store so nokia has a
store which gets some 17 million
downloads daily and fifty percent of it
is coming from series 40 then 80 percent
of the traffic gets converted into
downloads we have a healthy developer
community there are five hundred and
five developers with apps that have
crossed 1 million there are three
developers who have apps which have
cross 100 million one is a developer
from india one is a developer from
mexico then we have 52 markets where
operator billing is enabled
traditionally I mean series party the
kind of markets that we have been
targeting we have seen that credit card
penetration has been low but then even
in markets where credit card penetration
is really high people prefer to use
operator billing while paying for abs
because then you have to don't you don't
need to give any of your credentials so
I'm going to give you an example I am
going to demo an app where you are going
to pay again it's a demo half where you
are going to pay with credit card
billing and you can see how simple it is
so again go going from the numbers to a
little bit around the trends so what are
the key trends in the Java ME markets
and as developers if you are targeting
for these kind of devices what is it
that you need to keep in mind so as I
spoke about these are aspirational
people but then constrained so if you
are developing an app traditional models
like paper download typically is not
seen to be so successful so when you are
targeting these kind of markets you
would probably go for more different
revenue models like the freemium models
the ad models the try and buy models
subscription models so these models have
been seen more successful than the
traditional paper download and the other
thing which is um quite um interesting
is this micro transaction so now if you
price something pretty high then people
will typically not go for it but then if
you break it down and price smaller then
people would actually go and buy that so
that is one of the trends that we have
seen then the other thing is the hyper
social aspect so the context is slowly I
mean pretty soon it will change from the
who to the where so who as in the
facebook but then I think after who the
next context would be you know where for
example where are my friends where do I
want to go and hence nokia sees the look
and the maps as one of the strategic
differentiators there so again we have
we provide Maps API for Java ME we
enable developers to use and build these
kind of experience into their
applications and we I am NOT just
talking about you know the fun and games
part of it I mean I know there are
enterprise consumers I I mean I am based
out of bangalore and I know companies
who want to develop these kind of order
management systems and inventory
management systems and integrate the
maps aspect and they don't want to do it
for smartphones to address those kind of
markets because finally these are the
kind of phones which will go to their
channel partners for example or the
sales force and they don't want to give
them a two-hundred-dollar phone they
want to give them a basic phone they
don't want any fancy you I they just
want a regular form with the maps so and
hence you need to see the opportunity so
it's not just the fun and games part but
also more serious stuff like the
enterprise's the connected apps so since
some the main thing is that they want to
keep all the information in the
enterprise servers and then whatever is
needed you have you build insecure
elements into your app and then access
it so then again around the hyper social
aspect so the other thing which also
evolves is mobile commerce so all of us
know about snap deals of the world so
building those kind of experiences on
mobile the other trend is the
disintermediation so what it really
means is that for many of the consumers
especially young people I mean here in
the developed countries the the pc
everybody has access to pc and then they
have the pc access and the mobile access
but in a lot of our developing countries
the mobile is the first point of access
to the data to the
wider world so what what you really need
to do is I mean as developers you need
to make easy to access information and
you need you have to you can't always
make an assumption that people will have
a browser or a pc interface to build
this kind of firm to have another way of
access of information so over all these
these are the key trends that we see in
the core java mia markets that we are
targeting yes yes
exactly exactly and it is and another
thing you need to see is if you are
targeting an android phone I mean there
are so many applications already
available that if you have an app idea
probably it will exist somewhere whereas
in this case I mean it is not so
widespread and then also the other
advantage that we have is we have a
single store which is the Nokia Store
and if you want to download your
applications we have that Nokia Store
which is embedded on on all handsets so
you know that if somebody is thinking of
apps and is somebody is thinking of
downloading them then they are probably
thinking of getting it from the store so
absolutely right absolutely exactly so
compared to our competitors again
compared to android this is also one of
the differentiators that we have we have
a very wide range of operators whom we
have these billing partnerships and it
has been seen in statistics that if
operator billing is enabled in the
application then people will most likely
use operator billing instead of eighty
percent of the time instead of credit
card billing so these are
differentiators that you know it's
really that so again giving the example
of the Indian market so we we cover the
three largest operators in India which
covers almost ninety percent of the
market so again huge huge opportunity
and waiting to be tapped so here I get a
little bit into what is it that we are
offering in terms of API is in terms of
tools again we had a couple of sessions
before this during the day where we
spoke in great details about the tools
and the api's however in case you are
interested um I can cover parts of it
but this is more supposed to be a little
bit higher level overview so in terms of
we provide
so what we really have is we have the
MSA subset so we support these standard
jazz arts for quite a lot of these
standard jrs we have CDs potty specific
extensions so for example jsr 179 so not
these phones which are sold for 100 less
than hundred dollars so they don't have
GPS but then we still want developers to
develop you know location kind of an
application use maps on these devices
and how do we enable that we enable that
using the salida based triangulation
which in urban areas has been seen
pretty accurate in rural areas in the
accuracy varies but in urban area it can
give quite close some accuracy and then
we provide that access to the developer
so that developers can start you know
building apps using these cellid based
positioning so I have one app which uses
this 179 and I'm going to show show it
to you on their be later actually it's
more visible when you run it on the
device but then I will show it on the
emulator how it really works and in
addition to the standard offering we do
have the nokia api offering and we a
part of refreshing our platform has been
to enhance and increase this api said
because what we really want to do is we
want to provide developers more and more
access to the native elements so for
example one of the complaints that I
often heard was that it's not possible
to build cool UI stuff with Java ME so
now with the latest SDK we release this
nokia you I API 1 dot 6 which exposes
quite a lot of native elements so
whatever the native apps like camera etc
so whatever native UI elements the
native app apps have access to Java will
get quite a lot of those app element
access then we have the in-app purchase
so going back to my previous slide so
around monetization I think
as a developer and if you are I mean
targeting these kind of markets I mean
you would be interested in how to make
money so we have currently the in-app
purchase API which is available as part
of the platform and I am going to talk a
little bit more about this in-app
purchase API and show you how it works
then we also have enough advertising so
what in-app advertising does is you can
build you can make your application free
and then you can register with we serve
or interactive we are partnering with
both of them and you can they are
basically add mediators so what what
they will put or what you have to do as
a developer is you have to insert a few
lines of code and you have to get login
access from them and then from from day
one once you publish then your apt
starts making money so again we had a
session by interactive earlier during
the day when they spoke about mobile
advertising so again I have a app which
uses this some in-app advertising which
I am going to show so again coming
coming back to the Nokia API so we we
also have the Maps API offering which I
spoke about so what it does is it
provides access to some of the Nokia
Maps services like routing searching etc
so in in terms of the I spoke about the
API so in terms of tools what we are
providing is we have a nokia sdk which
and which provides the whole of an
emulator access and it emulates the
whole phone so you have i mean you can
see the look and feel of your app on a
phone kind of an interface and we with
this version the sdk 2 dot 0 we also
included the ide so it's an
eclipse-based ID however we fully
completely support NetBeans as well so
the nokia ID for java based on eclipse
it has nokia specific templates code
examples etc
that you can quickly load and start
testing it provides emulation like
sensory Malaysian if you are using maps
api then it provides nokia maps based
emulation it has on there is a non
device debugger and there is something
called device SDK manager again pretty
similar with them you know to what our
competitors are offering so what it
really does is as a developer I mean
especially if you are new to mobile so
since none of you are Java ME developers
so something which is very very
important is the display resolution so
whether it is its qvga weather is 240
400 240 320 whatever so that's the first
thing especially if you are building
apps with rich you I then that's the
first thing you need to know and then
the you people often have that question
that there are so many different form
factors so how do I find out what API is
supported and which as DK I should use
so we have the SDK manager which will
help you do an easy selection of the
tools so again talking a little bit more
about in-app purchasing so currently we
have the support in these these devices
and then all all new devices which are
coming out are having in-app purchase
API support and there is an end-to-end
emulation that we provide with the test
server so you can run your application
in the test mode and test how the
application is working and how you know
how this in-app purchase is some
implemented in your app and then you can
test it before you publish so again then
you can go to developer nokia com and
all the all the details are there but i
am going to show this to you as well in
one of the demos so before getting into
this kind of in-app purchase details do
you have any questions
oh I mean numb and anything that you
want to ask because okay I continue then
so I'm implementing in-app purchasing in
your app so what you have to do is you
have to choose the method of content
protection so you can use nokia drm or a
third-party drm all this you don't have
to bother putting all these things in
your app so the nokia store takes care
of it so how it really happens is that
the api structure is pretty well defined
and then when you are up going to
publish so for using this in-app
purchase you you need to get some kind
of resource ID so what how you get it so
you have to first register as a
publisher at nokia publish and there is
just a one euro fee of all our tools are
free but then if you want to publish
then there is a one euro
once-in-a-lifetime fee it's not per app
and for that in-app purchase app you
have to actually enter you know what is
it that you are wanting to protect so
you you have two little bit define on
whether you want to build it the try and
by type or is there some game level that
you want to protect her those kind of
details you need to know and then you
will get some information from the the
store that you need to put back in your
app there is a developer guide there's a
lot of documentation which gives
information around this and then again i
will show you how you know you can do
that and then how you can purchase your
resourcing files etc and then you can do
I end-to-end testing with the ax me
later publish in store there is a 70-30
revenue sharing which is like standard
across the industry so again for in-app
advertising as I mentioned we support
interactive and we serve so you just
need to decide on the placement of the
ads in your app and typically it has
been seen that if you embed too many
apps during the application experience
it it's not been so successful as
opposed to if you put it at the
beginning and the end
so again I want to talk a little bit
about this inode entertainment so they
just clocked 100 million and it's a it's
a company which was started in Mexico
and these guys have seen a lot of
success with in-app advertising they are
using interactive they have their
application which spans across so they
have developed a java application which
is supposed to be like Sudoku it's
similar but not so Dooku and again they
are building they are having more and
more games and they have been associated
with store for a long time so now the
next part is when I talk a little bit
more about how you can build a service
element with Java me and then a little
bit more details around that so any any
questions at this point okay so a
planning service element so what I'm I
mean this is just to cover the different
aspects i mean if you want to develop an
app and if you have a kind of service in
mind and if you want to build support
for these kind of devices then what is
it that you need to do on the device
side so i'm not really going to talk a
lot on the server side but mostly on how
you can enable that kind of service on
the device and i have taken up a few
cases here so one of the cases is the
Nokia Maps itself so the Nokia Maps
offering was initially I mean we are now
providing an API for all developers so
how is it being implemented on Java ME
devices so Nokia Maps supports all these
different kinds of services like routing
geocoding and reverse geocoding so what
this is is basically from a lat long you
can get a address location and from an
address you can get a lat long then it
supports routing location sharing
etcetera so for when they wanted to
extend the support of this service for
java any phones so how
the implemented it was that what you
typically do is you have the core
functionality as a library or a jar file
which can then be added to to your
classpath to your application class path
and then what it really means is in the
app you will just package that library
and then start calling the AP ice and
how you can protect your service is
through some kind of authentication
mechanism which is typically standard
ssl which is being used so supposing i
want to as a developer i want to use the
maps offering what i have to do is first
i go and create this app ID and token
and then this app ID and token I put it
in my app and then I I include I mean I
call whatever api's I want and then I
package this library along with my app
and then you can start using it so just
so you know Maps API I mean the Nokia
Maps there are two I mean it has a
business model associated so there is a
standard offering which is free under
certain limits and then it becomes
chargeable if somebody is interested I
can talk a little bit more around that
and show you what are the differences
between the two models so whoa so again
the service is there what we are just
enabling the same kind of experience on
this device by using this kind of
concept and typically people use
standard ssl to authenticate and you use
web service to interact with them with
whatever data or dynamic data that you
need what you really need to think about
for example the maps cakes is that if
for every route calculation or something
if you have to go and ping the server
then it's not a good experience so you
need to think and you need to optimize
their and the other thing which I have
also often heard is I mean quite a lot
of times these devices are being used in
markets which do not have continuous
data connectivity so you need to think
of building in that offline element
so what to keep a static static data and
what you keep as dynamic that you will
use web services to fetch is a decision
which you need to kind of think and make
the other example which is a company
called appt 42 so these guys are a
developer who are based in india and
they are offering this a platform as a
service offering so it's relatively new
and what they do is again they they are
also providing the job Java ME
application can access their api's and
how they have done it is they have their
own SDK or a library which needs to be
packaged with that and with that with
the library they are providing almost
300 api's and it really reduces I mean
if if one is a developer it really
reduces the effort of the developer
because quite a lot of the common things
like for example if you are developing
a&amp;amp;m-commerce kind of an application the
authentication part you have to develop
and it takes a quite a lot of time to
develop so these these guys provide that
as a service so you have just one API
and the whole authentication is done of
course it will go through their back-end
so again they provide this kind of Java
ME library which can be integrated with
any any app and the footprint is also
very low so these kind of devices that
we are talking about they have
restrictions on the heap size and the
charger sighs so it's important that you
think on that aspect that you build
connected app so very little information
which you need to have on the device and
most of it you try to retrieve so again
they have a native SDK available which
can as a library which can be included
in any Java ME app so typically when you
are defining these kind of services so
as I mentioned the most important or the
challenging decision is what to be
ecstatic and what to keep dynamics
so and then so the client which will be
running on the Java ME side it will be a
very pretty much thin client which where
you can pay more attention to the UI
logic the look and feel etc so this is
the kind of high level how you would you
would enable these kind of service
experience with these Java ME devices so
again for getting the diner getting that
or accessing dynamic data typically
there are two popular format so you it
can either be XML and the parser is
available as far as jsr 172 or the other
method is I mean now which is becoming
more and more popular and relevant is
the JSON so again we don't offer any
JSON API as of now as part of a platform
offering but then there are quite a lot
of JSON API again code which is
available on the net which you can reuse
so maybe after this I do a little bit of
demo on this in a purchasing and in-app
advertising and then perhaps get back so
any questions
ok so if no questions then again what I
am going to show you is an application
which is called the battle tank so it is
a simple game and what it will do is it
has some it's a it uses the in-app
purchase API and I will so or the code
for this application is available for
free at developer nokia com and then you
can have a look so this is how our sdk
looks like and our emulator looks like
so it emulates the phone behavior and
the phone UI pretty closely and so if
you if you can see this is a simple game
I mean this is just for demo purpose so
and if you if you can see this is a
trial version here so this application
is using the in-app purchase API and
supposing I try to get the full version
so I need to run it again because i
think the network is a problem
so network is a little bit flaky here so
normally when I do a full version yeah
so this is what I was expecting so using
the in-app purchase you can actually
fetch the price that what is the price
that one has to pay for this application
so here again since um i have chosen
india as the country so it's giving me
in indian rupees but then you using
tools and preferences you can actually
change your operator and then hence
change the country on the emulator so
one of the things which is quite unique
to our store is for example we give
complete flexibility to developers how
they want to price the applications in
different markets unlike our competitors
so they can price it differently in
different markets they can make it you
know free in one market and maybe may
you know in purchase enabled in some
other market so all those commutation
combinations are possible you can fetch
this price the local again as a
developer one does not mean to have
bothered that ok how my application will
be priced in india vs finland or any
other country so what the store takes
care of it so you kind of just define
what is the global price point and they
take care of all these things so and
using the api for example you can fetch
this price and they then there is a
nokia account which you need to have so
this is a test ready here
so okay so then it will so here I am
demonstrating this operator billing case
you can implement credit card billing
also in your app but here I have input I
mean this app implements operator
billing mainly to show how simple the
experience becomes and the more you ask
consumers to enter the credit card
details the more people will leave I
mean typically I mean this is seen from
surveys so I need to enter so then so
payment completed and then you kind of
get the full experience here so in this
application if you see I mean here there
is the all the ID all the content that I
am protecting using the in-app purchase
API is defined under this the resource
resource files so these resource files
are nothing but images that I am
protecting here and this resource ID is
important because when you kind of
define that okay then I want to enable
in-app purchase in my application then
you will get a resource ID from there
and then you have to put it in your app
there is quite a lot of documentation
available this code is available for
free you can download this code so for
example the ID has I can show you that
so there is a lot of code examples which
are available for free
so which you can directly load and then
you can view it so here so nokia series
40 code examples so this so since not
all of you are now you know for people
who are new to Java ME development so it
gives them all this is available and
there are a lot of templates also for
example when you so once you load these
applications into the workspace so they
should run as is you don't have to do
anything then even when you are so say
for example I have an existing midlet
project and i want to say create a new
file there are templates which are
available which can be used okay not
here so supposing i am creating
something else and so you can actually
use a midlet template here so there are
game templates which are available so
for example typically games run on the
full canvas so all these templates are
also provided for kind of easy coding so
this was an example of in-app purchase
then there is a weather app which uses
the cell ID based positioning and it
also uses the interactive ad so it is
the behavior of course ideally should be
seen on the device but we can try it
should be fine so what it does is it
just fetches the location fetches the
weather information from a server
and so what you can also see is that
this ad so if you are using the
interactive SDK so they will actually
put the ads here so they are the ad
mediators they have their ad inventory
what you have to do is just include a
few lines of code and they depending on
your application type and time etc they
will put the most relevant ad based on
their inventory and you get paid based
on there are multiple factors some which
again very little bit between our vendor
to vendor but it is typically things
like your click-through rate and
basically how many people are going and
how many views of the ad you are showing
and how many times the user is clicking
on those ads so these are the two
parameters typically so this is so ads
by in an actor so this was the kind of
demo that I had again want to talk a
little bit about more innovative use
cases where people have used Java ME so
this is again a case from india where
rom Java ME phone is used to control a
remote a water pump so in India there is
this electricity problem especially in
rural areas so here a person has
developed a Java ME application which
will connect to the water pump so this
is a good example of this m2m interface
so what it will do is it has a ivr so
what it does is it is a very it's more
that the application is being used just
to convey the message and start the
motor so the person who's the person or
the farmer who does not have to go to
the water pump to turn it on so he can
use the application and it will directly
communicate with the water pump so this
was demonstrated in Java one in India as
well so and then there was this this
also we showed in Java one India where a
RC or remote controlled car was being
controlled by one of these
phones so it was a touch interface so
you you can you know kind of control the
card and what was I mean this is very
this is not something very new but the
the thing is that it shows the potential
of Java I mean I mean this has been
there for quite some time but what is
really important is the kind of use
cases that can be built on top of Java
ME on top of these phones so that that
is the key so the other thing was this
when Nokia was working with the Wildlife
Fund so to monitor the white-tailed
eagle nest so this is a quite an extinct
bird as I understand and they are
endangered species and how it worked was
that there was a java application and
this series 40 phone was placed very
close to the nest and to monitor the
activity and once there was any activity
around the nest it would start uploading
the images to a server server which was
hosted so again these are interesting
use cases which can be built on top I
mean one does not always have to limit 1
selves to the angry birds or I mean
there are much more I mean of course
that is a very compelling game I love it
but you know you can think of these kind
of use cases as well so that brings to
my last slide so again as a summary
there's a huge demand for application
and there is a lot which is available in
terms of API is in terms of libraries in
terms of support from developer Nokia
and so we would like to request you to
start developing if you have any
questions view that there are email
addresses within the developer nokia
site you can go check there and again
it's just the beginning so that is a lot
of innovation which can happen here and
considering the huge treat so that's all
so thanks a lot thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
