going to demo how to start mission
control and then the general tab group
for Mission Control so here I've got a
little demo program that you can get in
with the samples and demos off the Java
website it's a free download this is the
little graphics program I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna start that and it's
just a 2d graphics demo so you know just
show some pictures like so add a couple
more here and we're gonna leave that
running and now if you have the latest
version of Java Java 7 update 40 or
later installed and you have the Java
bin directory in your path should be
able just to type JMC and that should
start Mission Control you can see there
we're using version 5.2 and it should
start up like this and then you should
see the JVM browser that's what we're
interested in and it shows all the
running JVMs on this system and in this
case so this is of course one is the
Mission Control JVM itself and the other
one is the demo and that's what we want
to monitor and so I'm gonna right click
that and then choose JMX console the
console is the live monitoring tool with
that Mission Control and flight recorder
so once I start that up you should see
something like this and this is of
course the general tab group and that's
the group because we have two tabs here
I have the overview tab which we're
going to talk about a little bit more
detail then we have the server
information tab here which just shows
you about the hardware the general
system information and JVM specific
information like here's the virtual
machine arguments that were used to
start
you know what programs running you know
all that sort of stuff how many
processors etc but the main thing we
want to look at here is the overview tab
you can see at the top here we have a
dashboard with a number of dials we have
this one showing the Java heap memory
used this one here is showing the CPU
usage for the JVM then here we have the
live set fragmentation for the heap and
this may at first show up empty a lot of
cases it does and it takes a while
generally a few full garbage collections
it takes to populate this but eventually
this will be populated and and look
exactly like what you see here in this
example and then down below here we've
got a couple of charts so these are
dials at the top and then down here we
have charts the first one being the
process a processor chart showing CPU
usage so the the darker line is the
machine usage and then the the lighter
like the purple color is the JVM and
then down below here we have a memory
chart and it's showing once again heap
usage along with physical memory usage
so all this is customizable you can
actually go in and customize this let's
go ahead and do that let's say we want
to add the Machine CPU usage to these
this dashboard we want to dial for that
so to do that I can if you have a mouse
over all these little buttons up here I
can see what they actually do and what
I'd like to do is add a dial so I'm
gonna use this green plus I'm gonna
click on that I get a dialog here for
the dial properties I'm gonna add an
attribute and that basically is all the
information that Mission Control is
collecting about a particular java
virtual machine so I'm gonna scroll down
to it's all grouped by various areas I
think there's an operating system area I
want
here and we want system CPU load which
is this one right here so I'm going to
click that I'm gonna click OK and then
that fell so I'm gonna just take the
defaults for everything else and then
that should add a dial to my user
interface and there you go you can see
it'll get a little scroll bar here cuz
we got a let me see if I can shrink this
I'm gonna just shrink that a little bit
all very customizable there we go that
looks better and so let's say I also
wanted to add a new chart so we've got
these two I can do that as well if I go
up here to the top notice that that
green plus is actually to add chart so
I'm gonna click that and notice my
interface didn't really change but it
added it it adds it to the bottom by
default you notice the scrollbar grew so
if I scroll down there's my new charts
it automatically gives it a name why
don't we add a graph of the eaten space
to see what's going on with that and it
should automatically pick a scale here
once we actually put data in it so time
is at the bottom as you can see all the
way with all these so I'm gonna go in
here I'm gonna go to the java.lang group
and then into memory pool then there's
our various garbage collection areas I'm
going to go to the Eaton space when I go
down to usage and then I'm gonna go to
used I'm gonna go ahead and click that
and then immediately you see here I get
a new scale on the y-axis that looks
like bytes which would make sense for
eatin space since it's a memory space
and you can see here that our eatin
space is growing and shrinking as we
would expect for an even space to do so
much like you know right along with our
heap memory graph above so anyway so you
can make your own charts this is totally
customizable and really cool stuff you
can do pretty much whatever you want
with it now let's say we didn't like the
changes we make and we want to get back
to to how we started
if you go up here you see this yellow
arrow up here I can actually reset
everything so if I just click that and
then I get a confirmation dialog that I
would really want to reset I click OK
and then my interface is reset to the
default so that's it for the general tab
group for Mission Control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
