Oracle and I have tired with me from our
systems hi here
hello region so tell me more about Mars
systems what is my assistant yeah Marc
systems in is an IT services company we
do a lot of implementations in a grade
of enterprise systems for example Oracle
EBS GRC Identity Management and so on
awesome so let's talk about the CVS
deployment that we have over here walk
us through this architecture please
right so we had an on-premise system for
this customer which was not performing
as desired so we decided to take the
whole system and lift and shift it into
Oracle cloud for that we built a
standard EBS architecture in the cloud
using standard best practices and then
how many servers are we talking about
the way we had altogether eight servers
participating in the in this EBS
architecture four of them were
application tier nodes
two of them were responsible for
parallel concurrent processing and the
other two were were supporting web and
form services these servers were
connected through a load balancer and
the users would connect to the load
balancer and they would get access to
the EBS we had redundant network and all
of these nodes were connected to the to
the network using Hospice bus adapters
we also had four RAC nodes each of them
were 16 cores CPU and 256 GB of memory
and so that is quite a bit of
computational power over that's that's
the computational power that we needed
to make sure that our performance is
better than on Prem great and then you
had a challenge of moving all that data
of the massive amount of data that you
had on Prem to the cloud right we are
talking about terabytes of data
somewhere between 10 to 12 terabytes of
data so if we were to to migrate or
transfer this data or the network from
on time to the cloud it takes days so we
used oracle data guard technology here
too in the cloud we put it here and we
made sure that this oracle data guard
was in sync up to date with on prime
database and from here we carve out our
reg database and this of course happened
multiple times during the course of the
the project has been through various
cycles and various iterations so we
ended up with our final product of e BS
PR d which was ready to roll out and
then once it went live you moved oracle
data guard out of those right once we
went live we had two stacks in the cloud
which was EBS PRD and EBS qa1 in the
cloud and we had three more supporting
instances EBS patch EBS deaf and EVS
tests that were on Prem so since all
these three supporting instances have
the same amount of data we had a
challenge of moving back backwards 10 to
12 terabyte of data every time so we
moved this oracle data guard to on-prem
and we use this to continuously getting
updates from a production system and out
of that we will build or clone our
supporting instances and we also use
this oracle data guard for disaster
recovery here so our disaster recovery
system was on prem great and then you
built out the SSO and the GRC stack as
well right so the need for SSO stack was
because the customer required single
sign-on for the customers even though
our Oracle EBS providers own
authentication and login mechanism but
single sign-on means that users can log
in using the windows credentials so we
make this work using the Oracle
technologies in conjunction with
Microsoft Active Directory and using
Microsoft Active Directory and
credentials the users can log in to EBS
as well see
Leslie and the user experience sign-on
experience is much better great and then
the GOC stack yeah
GRC stack is used for governance and
risk compliance and this is used for a
lot of Sox compliance and FDA and so on
and so forth that's a great
implementation of EBS on OCI Oracle
cloud infrastructure thank you so much
for sharing your architecture winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
