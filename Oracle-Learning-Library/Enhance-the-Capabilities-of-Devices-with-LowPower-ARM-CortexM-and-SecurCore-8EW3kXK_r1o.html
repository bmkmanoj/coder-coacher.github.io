manager for arms cortex m3 and cortex m4
products and I'm here today to talk you
talk to you about some of those cortex-m
products and secure core which is based
on the arm cortex-m processor range so
if we start off with what arm does arm
is essentially a licensing company of IP
so we don't manufacture anything or we
manufacture very little we manufacture
some development boards but our main
business is in licensing IP to over 900
companies who then create their own
special products based on that IP and
the whole range of arm semiconductor IP
available ranges from small
microcontrollers so sub 50 cent's price
point operating it perhaps tens of
megahertz right up to two gigahertz
processors at a much higher price point
multicore and soon as you've probably
seen announced we'll move into a 64-bit
ARM cores so a really quite wide range
of products available from arm in terms
of soft IP so if you look at what arm
does as a as a business you can sort of
think of armors almost like an
outsourcing company so many of our
semiconductor partners find it more
efficient to take an arm design rather
than
doing their entire design in house and
in fact in many cases many of these
companies have got their own internal
design teams designing competing
products so perhaps two parts of the
same company one with an arm based
solution one with a non arm based
solution and within that business model
there are a variety of licensing models
so going right from an architecture
license where a licensee is able to do
their own implementation to it to
support the arm instruction set through
subscription licensing so they're able
to take it's a sort of a all-you-can-eat
model where they're able to take any
number of pieces of our MIP through
individual licenses so a license a4a
cortex a9 or four cortex a15 the cortex
m4 etc and part of that business model
is they play an upfront license fee for
the license in the first place then when
they're actually shipping product they
pay ongoing royalties on the number of
of parts that they that they ship based
on on our IP and there's really quite a
long pipeline if you like in this
business model so right from early the
early research for a for a new new core
from arm through development we're
really looking at several years before
we start seeing our my P are a
particular piece of arm IP appearing in
the marketplace to give you an example
that some of the early designs arm 70
DMI arm9 is still a substantial royalty
provider for arm wit we're still still
taking royalty in very large numbers
and you can see from this slide here
that the growth in recent years has been
quite phenomenal so there were over 8
billion ARM chips arm-based chips
shipped in in 2011 and over the last
five years that represents more than a
twenty-five percent year-on-year growth
so I'm actually began in Cambridge 22 23
years ago with a group of 12 engineers
and from that base has grown to the
world's leading semiconductor IP company
with offices pretty much throughout the
world in the state on the west coast in
Austin in India in China in Japan and in
Europe and pretty much every
semiconductor company which manufactures
chips to go into the mobile phone
industry has adopted the ARM
architecture we've got more than
ninety-five percent of the mobile phone
business but as you'll see in later
slides that isn't the only those aren't
the only markets that arm processors go
into and in fact not only is armed
licensing semiconductor IP four
processors but also the libraries which
go to make those processes tools
services and so on
and over the last year if we look at the
growth in the markets that army is
shipping into you know growth pretty
much across the board but just trying to
pick out some interesting points from
from this slide you'll see there that
embedded so anything ranging from
processes that go in coffee machines
there are there are coffee machines that
are based on cortex m3 through cameras
washing machines fridges point-of-sale
devices so anything where the core
itself is it is not apparent has grown
seventy percent in 2011 so really quite
a rapid growth in the embedded and very
sickly yes yes automotive we count in
embedded and so this is somewhat
arbitrary split of segments within the
company so there are teams looking after
each of these segments and automotive
appears in embedded and the interesting
point to note on the licensing and
royalty slide is that traditionally arms
been seen as a mobile phone chip company
and indeed in terms of royalties from
2011 mobile still represents the lion's
share of royalties but if you look at
last year's licensing activity you can
see that the licensing for embedded is
pretty much identical to licensing for
mobile so we'd expect to see that in
future years those royalties will become
more evenly split between embedded and
mobile
so if we now look at the inside of a say
a typical smartphone in terms of ARM
processors arm technology within those
phones we're not only talking here about
the apps processor being an ARM
processor but also arm technology going
into a variety of other devices in the
in the mobile phone so for example Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth chips have in fact one of
the widest shipping cortex-m devices is
actually in a Wi-Fi Bluetooth combo chip
that I'm ships in mobile phones the
baseband processor often based on
currently on cortex are four and as
protocols become more complex will see
the adoption of cortex are five and
cortex are seven into cellular modems
and many mobile phones the touch screen
controller is based on a cortex m0
perhaps or on a cortex m3 some of our
partners are producing power management
devices power management chips for
mobile phones based on perhaps cortex m0
or cortex m3 running the dvfs policies
to ramp the voltage and frequency of the
of the main processor the sim is often
gotta secure a core arm-based processor
in so within a typical mobile phone or
smartphone certainly you could find
maybe no seven or eight arm devices
which explains to some degree the sort
of the sheer size of the volumes of
volumes of shipments of arm of ARM
processor
but the important thing to note is it's
not all just about about mobile so for
example in automotive it's one of the
big growth areas for forearm in fact
we're already becoming a dominant player
in some of the some of the components of
a car so there are many cortex-m devices
in air bags in chassis control some of
the higher-end cores are beginning to be
used in infotainment systems so and
indeed as the consolidation of
functionality increases there's a need
for more and more processing power
within the car within one device so for
half perhaps where you previously had a
core that was dealing purely with an
infotainment application you know maybe
it's now also driving the rear camera
for reversing on a on a larger car and
that's all driving a need for
standardization and safety and
reliability and so arm is very actively
involved in adhering to standards such
as iso 266 to which will become an
increasingly necessary part of the
automotive industry i mean turning this
towing our attention now to java so
there's really been quite a long history
of java support in within the ARM
architecture so Java has been running on
our arm 7 and arm9 range of processors
right through arm 11 up to cortex a8
cortex a9 and those cores have hardware
acceleration capabilities for for java
so you're able to execute
you bytecodes directly in the hardware
for example on the on the arm 926 and
that technology has been carried through
onto the cortex a family of processors
I'm sure there are many more reasons why
Java is important to arm than the ones
listed on here but just picking out a
few examples you know Java is critical
in a number of the application areas
where arm is dominant so in mobile
phones in high-end digital tvs in
blu-ray so a were able to execute java
apps on those devices but increasingly
as i say at the bottom of this slide
we're seeing java move into more
traditionally sort of deeply embedded
applications on arm-based MC use coming
from our from our silicon partners so if
we look at how the industry is moving
towards 32-bit cortex-m devices 44 MCU
so that the idea of this of this slide
is it shows how traditional 8 and 16-bit
architectures are no longer able to cope
with the sort of complexities needed in
in the MCU marketplace so whereas you
once just had you know a serial comms
Channel you now you've now got USB
Bluetooth SIG be a whole range of
communication protocols which need a
more powerful processor which neither a
32-bit processor in terms of display you
know we've gone from seven segment
displays to more complex displays
needing more power from the underlying
processor to
to service those those displays in terms
of motor control you know something like
fifty percent of the world's electricity
is consumed by some sort of electric
motor so being able to execute more
intelligent algorithms to control those
motors through field oriented control
algorithms or being able to efficiently
implement park and clark transforms to
to to monitor and to control the
operation of those motors leading to a
more efficient energy consumption is
something that's becoming key and
talking about power consumption you know
being able to have more complex
algorithms running on a microcontroller
able to intelligently control the power
usage of some of some larger device as i
mentioned before safety is becoming
increasingly important and it perhaps
it's not such a sort of well known fact
but the cortex-m processor range is
incredibly reliable it's the cortex m3
was launched in 2005 six we're now on
revision two of the processor it's
currently the cortex m3 and the cortex
m4 have just one very minor defect which
is never seen in compiled code running
on the on the on the cortex em cause so
incredibly reliable history for cortex
and process considering that there are
two billion of them in the world we'd
have known by now if there was a serious
prob
I think and going from a world where it
was all about you know low level control
of a of a device to sophisticated
libraries that get you quicker time to
market and just in general this
transition from traditional 8 and 16-bit
processors out to 32-bit is all driving
the need for for cortex-m cause and so
I've tried to sort of do a bit of a mix
of business side and technical side so
if we look now a little bit more at what
those what that technology brings you
can see from the graph here that there's
really a significant growth in the last
three or four years in 32-bit MCU with 4
8 and 16-bit remaining reasonably flat
over that same period much of that spike
and much of that growth is based on
cortex arm cortex-m process is released
by our our silicon partners and so I
just like to go through a sort of why
that trend is happening so cortex-m
processes deliver exceptional PPA so
high performance low power consumption
small area so perhaps surprisingly
programs compiled for 32-bit arm or
often physically smaller they take up
less memory footprint than many 8 and
16-bit architectures and we're now down
to single-digit microwatts per megahertz
in terms of dynamic performance on
cortex-m and down to nano watts of
a power consumption for foot when the
when the process is in in sleep mode but
those are still delivering you know what
1.25 d mitzvah megahertz on the cortex
m3 and m4 and nor point ninety Mitzvah
megahertz on cortex m0 so very powerful
processors consuming very small
quantities of power a very wide
available clock frequency range so we've
got partners who are running cause it
may be 10 megahertz right up to being
able to run in a say in a 40 nanometer
process perhaps run the core at 600
megahertz so so a very wide range of
available clock frequencies and coming
with the core there's a very rich debug
and trace capability not found in many
MCU devices so the ability to control
the processor through jtag or through
serial wire debug so just to pin
interface to control the core and a very
rich trace functionality which is
non-intrusive on the execution of the of
the target application so you're able to
collect trace data without interrupting
the operation of the core it's a large
flat single address space so for
gigabyte address space no need for the
sort of old world of segment registers
and the like it's 32-bit many of the
internal operations are work to a 64-bit
precision and they deliver a fast and
low fixed overhead in terms of in
responding to to interrupt so for
example on a cortex m3
there are just 12 cycles between when an
interrupt happens and when the first
instruction of your interrupt handler is
being executed since most of the work is
actually done within the core itself so
all of the intra prioritization stacking
of registers unstacking of registers
when you exit from an interrupt handler
all handled by the core itself and so
over the last just over the last year in
2012 we've seen a very wide variety of
cortex-m cores come to the market so st
with their stm32 f 0 f2 f3 f4 products
so building quite a substantial family
of processors you know where each member
of that family has its own particular
range of capabilities the beginning of
2012 silicon labs launched their
precision 32 cores based on a process of
families based on cortex m3 so they
bring a rich set of that their rich set
of peripherals which they were
previously using on 8051 onto arm
cortex-m cause so atmel recently
launched the Sam for based on cortex m4
so going together with their cue touch
technology so for for touch applications
energy micro so you know very low power
cortex-m implementations infineon with
their ex MC 4000 range based on the
cortex m4 sand now going more into
industrial automation on Japan fujitsu
with FM three so also based on cortex m3
they brought out you know a wide family
of of course I
210 new individual devices based on on
cortex m3 and of course freescale with
their kinetis family using the cortex em
devices but also in viibryd where they
have a cortex a5 running you know rich
operating system perhaps and then a
cortex m4 for more real-time critical
operation so so far this year and these
slides get very quickly out of date
because these numbers increase but there
are more than 350 new cortex-m based
devices out this year again this this
next slide slide 14 speaks to that MCU
broad MCU portfolio so these are the
logos of of our partners who are
currently actively shipping cause Bass
Pro submit microcontrollers based on
cortex-m cause and the numbers in
brackets are a sort of snapshot of the
number of available family members in
each of those those MCU families so you
know you can currently choose from I'm
sure that number is now begging you know
more than 1400 products that are based
on on cortex-m and that silicon partner
community has shipped a considerable
number of MC use over that period so
this is just MCU shipments based on
cortex-m so this is not counting
cortex-m devices that he used as
companion processors so you might so
this doesn't count you know oh map or
whatever which uses a court exam as a as
a companion processor to offload some of
the work from the cortex a this is 0
the shelf MCU shipments which now
cumulatively have reached around 2
billion for cortex-m devices and those
the shipments of those devices is
growing in in all segments and I've
mentioned the names of these processors
please just show them as a sort of
coherent set of of processor cores so
they have one that the the whole sort of
message behind this is that they have
one architecture with a up with
compatible instruction set all with the
same programmers model ranging right
from traditional a typical 8 and 16-bit
applications right up to higher-end MCU
requiring some sort of digital signal
processing capability single instruction
multiple data hardware floating-point
and so on but all based on that single
architect yes yes yes that's so it comes
sort of a few slides or on as I
mentioned instruction set so if we look
at cortex m0 cortex m0 is pretty much
entirely 16-bit instructions working on
32-bit registers so it's still a 32-bit
processor but the size of the individual
instructions held in your memory are
mostly 16-bit and then building on
cortex m0 is got sm-3 so cortex m3 has
all of the instructions that are in m0
but it adds a whole load of 32-bit
arithmetic operations bit field
manipulation
and the idea here this is the thumb to
instruction set is that an intelligent
compiler can find an appropriate blend
of 16-bit versus 32-bit instructions
depending on whether you're optimizing
for size or for performance and then
further the cortex m4 adds a whole bunch
of saturating arithmetic of simdi
operations so being able to perform a
number of arithmetic operations in a
single instruction across multiple data
and also an optional hardware
floating-point unit to accelerate
applications that need a fast and
accurate floating-point capability so
across all of these cores there's the
thumb to instruction set they'd all have
what's called an ST vectored interrupt
controller so so this is an interrupt
controller that's built right into the
core whereas on older arm cause our
partners would need to build an
interrupt controller basically of their
own on the outside nest effective
interrupt control is built into all
cortex em cause they're all operating on
a 32-bit address space they all have a
number of sleep modes which I'll explain
in the moment and all have a
sophisticated debug and trace set of
features based on our coresight debug
architecture so this eventually
interrupt controller deals with
interrupts from a variety of sources and
so interrupt requests coming from
peripherals or a non mask will interrupt
or interrupts coming from the built in
cystic timer
and I mentioned just briefly before that
all of the setting up of the Machine
state after an interrupt is handled in
Hardware allowing you to write your
interrupt handlers entirely in CC or in
a high-level language so you don't need
to have prologue and epilogue assembler
which loads registers and saves
registers back to to memory that's all
dealt with by the hardware as well as
prioritizing one interrupt over another
allowing a higher priority interrupt to
interrupt service routine currently
executing this servicing a previous
interrupt the memory map because it's
the 32-bit core is four gigabytes of
linear address space and that address
space is split up amongst code SRAM
peripherals up the top is the system
region for debug so that's actually
split up by what's called the bus matrix
that that's built right into the the
cortex-m core in terms of sleep modes so
all of cortex-m cause provide this range
of sleep modes implemented within the
core itself and then we allow basically
hooks for our partners to add their own
power management and sleep policies
around those sleep modes and these are
all built around the concept of clock
gating and power gating which is built
right into the design so parts of the
core can be entirely powered down the
clock can be only operating for part of
the core so that hence the word gating
oh so you're controlling the clock
signal going to parts of the core or
power going to part
the core and even if you have what's
called state retention capabilities you
can have special flip-flops that are
retaining the state of the of the system
even when it's powered down allowing you
to wake up quickly through the the wake
up interrupt controller just to sort of
finish up on the on the low-power
features another feature of the core is
sleep on exit so the blue square on the
Left represents the process of running
you know at full frequency it then
executes a wait for interrupt or wait
for event instruction goes into sleep
mode then perhaps an interrupt happens
the interrupt service routine is
executed and if you've got the sleep on
exit bit said the process are
automatically goes back into sleep mode
on exit from the interrupt handler so
further saving you power and indeed
because it's the 32-bit processor you're
able to do more work in less time so
actually your your need to be awake
during the interrupt handler is is
shortened and so I just briefly
mentioned the wake up interrupt
controller says this allows you to have
basically two power domains so an always
powered domain where the wake up
interrupt controller sits and perhaps
the rest of your core held in a
low-power state retention mode allowing
you to bring the processor up from its
state retention road through the wake up
interrupt controller but I will get to
the secure cores in a home so built on
that technology are two cores that I'm
product manager for one is the cortex m3
one is the cortex m4
and built on those cores are a further
set of of arm MIP called securicor so
we've noticed the need for smart cars
that need to you know keep data safe
keep your biometric information safe pin
the save passwords safe and normal
processors don't offer protection
against sophisticated hacking so they
don't protect against someone who's
actually able to monitor the power
consumption of the core and draw
conclusions about what instructions are
being executed or being able to
physically tamper with the core so the
secure core range of processors is based
on the cortex-m architecture but it's
tamper resistant so without going into
the details of how that work it's
essentially that built right into the
RTL is the notion of not being able to
observe from outside which instructions
are executing based on the
characteristics of the of the core and
that's servicing a smart card market
which you know is rapidly growing
historically it was dominated by non arm
architectures but now arm is certainly
moving into that
area ah that's an interesting suggestion
so I guess all I can say current
cortex-m cause don't have a trust zone
like capability that doesn't mean that
they never will yes or in or or
something that achieves the same goals
as trust loan so being able to operate
in secure and non-secure mode yeah yeah
so yeah we've thought the same the same
thing so secure core family is it's
called scsc 100-300 triple zero the 100
based on arm 70 DMI sc300 based on
cortex m3 SC triple zero based on cortex
m0 so
now talk a little bit about
standardization i mentioned that all of
these cores have many similar
characteristics and to promote this sort
of commonality arm has worked with a
number of partners so those are listed
there so they're silicon partners and
tools partners to develop a a number of
abstractions if you like on the on the
Corso sim sis they can cook the cortex
my controller standard the software
interface standard is essentially a set
of header see header files which define
a set of common capabilities across
processors and across tool chains
regardless of which vendor those those
processes all those tool chains come
from and from the it's not always
popular with with some partners because
they want to sort of create some mock
into their to their core but from an end
user point of view it's very valuable it
allows you to move very easily between
cortex-m based microcontrollers and many
OEMs are themselves creating software
standard platforms of which a couple are
seen on these on these two slides 31-32
i just wanted to say a little bit about
the much used term Internet of Things so
essentially machine-to-machine
communication that this this slide 34
shows is the idea is that this little
girl is brushing her teeth there's some
sort of image recognition in the mirror
that realizes it's her and you know give
some sort of feedback as to what how
long she's been brushing her teeth for
and and so on an entirely sure that's a
particularly realistic example but it
shows a sort of possibility of lots of
losses of connected devices and I guess
the next slide which is a bit of an eye
chart confirms that really the Internet
of Things is many many many different
things to different people so for
example you may be talking about sensors
so intelligent energy management
security monitoring in a motor control
application you may be talking about
preventive maintenance so being able to
actually sort of essentially maintain
the motor over you know over the air a
monitor the performance of that of that
motor in medical applications you know
with on body wellness tracking monitors
asset tracking in hospitals in large
organizations and then all of those
things that are currently not connected
so you know anything from sort of street
lights to traffic signs to dare i say to
parking meters to to vending machines
you know all all now being connected
together and requiring some level of
connectivity and indeed you know there's
there are suggestions that over the next
few years will go from the current 12
billion or so internet-connected devices
perhaps to a trillion by within the next
13 years and why arm is a sort of
favored solution in this sort of area is
that as software complexity grows and
the need to execute more complex
algorithms
but still maintain low power consumption
then arm is very well placed to to
provide solutions that that give that
capability you're able to run more
complex protocol stacks on the 32-bit
architecture that we've got a very large
ecosystem of partners who are providing
the solution software solutions on the
arm cortex-m cause i'm so looking
briefly at some microcontroller
applications you know it's all about
energy use reducing costs increasing
safety and efficiency and in terms of
energy consumption you know if we could
increase the intelligence of the
appliances that are in your home you
know making sort of smart choices of
their own there's not only going to
benefit the consumer but it's also going
to you know benefit the society as a
whole and currently there are only
around eight percent of meters which are
automated certainly from discussions
that we've had with our partners you
know this is an amazing business
opportunity many of our partners are
going into this area of intelligent
meters
I'm also in medical I jotted down some
sort of statistics here apparently in
the u.s. there are currently 34 million
senior citizens that's projected to be
74 million in 20-25 apparently 1.2
billion seniors worldwide so the
requirement for sort of health
monitoring and intelligent devices for
with in medical applications are
certainly growing and creating
opportunities for for arm arm devices so
another set of possible application
areas so servers is an area that perhaps
you know with the emergence of 64-bit
ARM you could see servers powered by arm
64-bit processors but also actually
performing the power control all of
those servers so some of our customers
are interested in using not only ARM
processors for the server technology
themselves but smaller cause you know em
to use for controlling the power usage
of those of those servers now I'm sure
you've seen in some of Oracle's some
presentations the the launch of Java
Emmett latest version of Java ME
embedded for arm-based MC use so that's
something that's real now you know our
our partners that I listed on previous
slides are now producing products that
are capable of supporting Java and the
whole Java environment has been
optimized and shrunk to a size that now
you know now really make sense for
for entry into those into those MCU
markets and obviously this is all backed
by Oracle's long-term history of Java
yeah yeah big little young so big little
as we're using the term currently
applies to the cortex a cause because it
because they've got all of the snoop
control capability so you're able to
have coherent caches across different
processes there are cortex-m partners
who are producing sort of a big little
setup with cortex-m so there's a there's
an nxp part which has got a cortex m4
and a cortex m0 they're not quite
executing in the same way as a big
little cluster in the cortex a space but
the concept is the same so you're able
to you know maybe run a complex DSP
algorithm on the cortex m4 and you know
I don't know maintain some peripheral
through cortex m0 so there's certainly
the same concept it's not necessarily
using exactly the same technology yeah
yeah
so in Oracle's Java ME they're targeting
a a target system which looks very
similar to those cortex-m systems that I
showed earlier so an m3 or m4 and then a
number of peripherals and there's still
plenty of scope for scaling up to bigger
platforms I did say arm doesn't actually
manufacture anything but one of the few
things that we actually make that
physical and tangible our development
boards so for example is one that's
based on the stm32 microcontroller so
that's an evaluation board that comes
from arms kyle division it's got quite a
large two megabytes of ram 8 megabytes
of flash a number of of interesting
peripheral so touch screens
accelerometers joystick gyroscope etc
which will become a you know a really
powerful platform for for java
development if linked to you know a
tongue set like like the java sdk so
we're now seeing realistic cases of
people developing java applications and
being able to load them onto a
microcontroller board to to trial their
their application honor on a development
board such as the one from from kyle so
i sort of rushed through it to the end
there to fit in the available time and
we had a couple of questions as we were
going along have you to take any more
questions
ah so so arm has its Molly GPU
technology which goes along the side the
cortex a cause I I didn't mention that
anywhere in this particular presentation
but there's a whole family of arm-based
GPUs called Molly which are developed
along with our intelligent interconnect
so that you can take a cortex a core and
connect it to a GPU and that's being
done in many current top-of-the-range
smart phones for example
well thank thanks very much for your
time thanks for coming along happy to
talk to anybody afterwards but thank you
very much anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
