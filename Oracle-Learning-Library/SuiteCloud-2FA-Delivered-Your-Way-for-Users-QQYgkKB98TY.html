delivered your way in this video we are
going to demonstrate how a user sets up
to a PHA by using an Authenticator
application using SMS or voice calls or
using a backup code after a role has
been designated as to FA authentication
required a user sign to that role
receives an email the first time they
attempt to login to the to FA role the
email contains instructions and a
verification code for initial login
simply use the verification code from
the email and click Submit after
completing the initial login to to FA
roll a pop-up window opens allowing the
user to select their preferred to FA
method to FA by Authenticator app or to
FA by phone users are allowed to dismiss
the prompt to set up to a face five
times before they are required to do so
during this video I'm going to show you
how to set up an ascent occator app as a
primary two FA method and then text
messages or voice calls as a secondary
method install an ascent occator app
click the link in the pop-up window if
you need a list of eccentric ater apps
in the setup two-factor authentication
window leave the recommended method
option selected and click next install
one of the o'the TOTP compliant
Authenticator applications for your
device using the Authenticator app on
your phone scan the QR code displayed in
the pop-up window or manually enter the
string of characters shown below the QR
code the offense Gator app will generate
a verification code types of
verification code in the field provided
and click Save now let's set up text
messages or voice calls as a secondary
or backup to FA method so that we can
still log in if our primary method fails
in the setup to F a phone number pop-up
window select the country where your
phone service originates and type the
phone number on which you wish to
receive your verification code from
NetSuite or simply enter your phone
number in the international format using
a plus sign then click send code
depending on the delivery method you
selected you should receive a text
message or a voice call on your phone
with the code type this code in the
entry verification code field in the
pop-up window and click Save
when you first set up your two FA
methods
10 backup codes are displayed in the UI
these unique backup codes can be used to
login to a two if a role when you are
unable to receive a code using your
Authenticator app or phone each backup
code can be used only a single time
treat backup codes as securely as you
would treat a password this is the only
time these 10 unique codes are displayed
in the UI
you cannot retrieve these from the
system after you close this window now
that I have my two that they set up I
want to show you how to use it let's log
in again to log in with the role that
requires two FA you must first enter
your email address and password after
this information is verified you are
prompted for a verification code use
your sent to cater app to obtain a
verification code we've set it up as our
primary two FA method or switch to use
your phone to request a code by text
message or voice call we set it up as a
backup to of a method
or use one of your backup codes let's
enter the verification code generated by
the Authenticator application and mark
this device is trusted so I will not be
presented with two of a challenge for 30
days when logging into NetSuite from
this device use the Settings portlet
whenever you need to reset your 2fa
settings generate new 2fa backup codes
or manage your trusted devices thanks
