applications using simple and uniform
web service interfaces rest or
representational state transfer is an
architectural style that defines a way
to make uniform API calls through
restful web service interfaces this
allows for easy access of api is
implemented at the server end via the
HTTP protocol client server applications
developed in any language such as Java
can support rest to implement the
Uniform web service interfaces but do
the Uniform web service interfaces work
well in rest consider a traditional API
library associated with customer and
orders data let's say you have for AP is
one to add new customer details one to
retrieve the existing customer details
one to remove the existing customer
details and another to modify the
existing customer details these four
api's have to be exposed by your
application this makes your API is
difficult to use and less compatible
with external client applications with
rest the interfaces are designed so that
the external user or client application
can easily call the restful Uniform web
service interface with less
compatibility issues for example you
could use a web application to web
enable those same for AP is to the
external world by defining flash
customers as the restful web service
interface any of the CR UD operations
would be invoked at the client
application URL in association with the
prospective HTTP verbs over the
customers uniform web service interface
with res representations of the
resources that are transferred between
client and server can use XML or YAML
the most commonly used JavaScript object
notation or JSON format JSON is simple
lightweight data representation format
with less metadata this can be used to
exchange data between software
applications
here the structure of the json snippet
specifies the HTTP methods HTTP protocol
post server and resource URL followed by
payload with data values data objects or
both and here for JSON payload the
details are encapsulated in the JSON
body tags this JSON payload can be
designed to be processed accordingly
with the respective REST API call and
sent to the host server in combination
with any of the HTTP verbs the different
HTTP response codes are based on the
type of HTTP request used to create a
new customer let's make a post request
and send to the web application instance
via the restful web service flash
customers with the specific annotations
along with the JSON payload the JSON
payload contains new customer details
the restful web service application
returns a status code 201 to confirm new
customer created to retrieve existing
customers let's make a get request and
send to the web application instance via
the restful web service flash customers
with the specific annotations the output
has the requested customer details in
JSON format the restful web service
application returns the HTTP status code
200 to confirm the requested customer
details are retrieved in the JSON format
to delete any existing customer details
let's make a delete request and send to
your web application instance via the
restful web service flash customers with
the specific annotations the restful web
service application returns a status
code 204 to confirm the request a
customer details are deleted in the
backend
hence nothing showing in the output
console rest is an architectural style
that defines a way to make Uniform API
calls through restful web service
interfaces via HTTP protocol along with
the suitable HTTP verbs to learn about
cloud standards such as s CI M o auth
and open ID connect check out the other
