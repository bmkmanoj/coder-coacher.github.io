cloud service comes with a hello world
application it's simply a web page with
a welcome message and a page view
counter
log into the container console using the
credentials and URL you've been given

you can choose the deployments name the
pool of hosts on which to run the
deployment and the number of containers
to deploy and how to choose the hosts on
which to deploy them let's accept the
defaults the deployments page shows how
the deployment you just created is
progressing to begin with the hello
world image is pulled from the docker
hub registry after the image is
downloaded it started as a docker
container and shown with the status of
running click the name of the host for
details of the host running the
container verify the application is
running from the hosts public IP address
copy the public IP address then paste it
into a browser append port 9000 which is
specified as part of the example
application service definition when your
browser loads the page the page shows a
message like hello is it you're looking
for
since this is the first time the newly
deployed page has been viewed the
counter at the bottom of the page shows
one reload the page in the browser and
the counter now displays two
congratulations you've successfully run
your first docker container and use the
actual application to confirm that the
pageview counter is working correctly to
