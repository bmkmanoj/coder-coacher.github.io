control today we're going to be taking a
look at ex logic management from an
engineered systems perspective we're
going to examine how Oracle engineers
hardware and software in this case the
management of the Excel objects compute
storage networking and virtualization to
work seamlessly from within Enterprise
Manager Enterprise Manager enables the
room organization to have visibility
into the state of your high key assets
to resolve problems in the most
efficient manner and to do so with the
lowest possible operational cost so
let's begin here at the Enterprise
Manager summary home page in order to
navigate to exa logic management I'm
going to select from the targets menu
hexa logic this page provides me a
high-level summary of all the ex logic
brats within my enterprise I can see the
various members running on this ex
illogic rack there up-and-down target
status and any corresponding incidents
if I'm interested in managing or
monitoring this rack at a lower level I
can simply click on the name and drill
down here in my ex logic system target I
have an integrated hardware/software
view of my ex logic rack starting with
the overview section I have the up and
down status of various component targets
including my network switches the
integrated lights-out management cards
the integrated ex logic storage and
continuing to the ex logic schematic I
have a schematic level view of these EXA
logic elements placed within the rack
their corresponding host names and the
temperature for each of those elements
navigating to my tree I can expand all
and see an integrated hardware software
view of these components including the
various compute nodes the underlying
virtualization my and Kanban network
switches and both of the storage heads
for my storage appliance finally I have
the EXA logic InfiniBand fabric each of
these elements provides me with a target
home page on my ex logic InfiniBand
fabric target page I have an overview of
all the switches compute nodes and
storage nodes
attached my hexa logic fabric than their
up-and-down state furthermore I have
information on the average lowest and
highest throughputs both on a switch to
note and switch the switch basis just as
I have a hardware schematic for my exa
logic rack the switch schematic provides
me a physical view of the various ports
on my X illogic switches whether those
ports are currently in use what the
throughput state and error condition is
of each of those ports in addition to
available unused ports that can be used
for wiring in the notes section I can
see all of the storage and compute ports
that are connected to my switches again
with various information on throughput
errors and state connecting both my
Hardware elements to my infinite band
network switches and finally in the
incidence region I can see all of the
incidents for these network components
now let's take a look at how we manage
Excel objects integrated storage and
virtualization and then let's conclude
by taking a look at how we manage each
of these three elements the storage
network and compute as an engineered
system here's the homepage of my
integrated X illogic storage appliance
in the summary section I can see how
long the storage appliance has been in
the Upstate the disk i/o operations per
second taking place over the past 24
hours and the corresponding disk i/o
kilobytes per second over the exact same
time frame I have a report on the top 5
shares consuming space and the incidents
and problems for this integrated storage
appliance job activities over the past
seven days
is visible here on the right now let's
take a look at the exa logic integrated
virtualization management with our
virtual server homepage I can see the
host the corresponding virtual who the
job activity the CPU utilization is for
all of my VMs along with their
corresponding memory utilization and if
I scroll down here information
about the underlying hardware including
the number of sockets the number of
cores for each of those socket
individually and the number of threads
per core furthermore network activity
and disk activity is clearly visible
along with the underlying software that
is powering my virtual server now let's
take a look at how Enterprise Manager
manages storage network and compute as
an engineered system and let's start by
taking a look at exa logic system view
here at my X logic system view I have an
up and down status of all 49 members
that comprise my exa logic system one of
these members is currently in a Down
State this member is an Oracle VM guess
if other 47 members are currently in an
up state which included my InfiniBand
switches various hosts and virtual
servers this is a hardware software view
of my exit logic system and I can
further drill down into this view by
taking a look at the routing topology
the routing topology is a graphical view
of various X illogic members and their
relationships to each other here I have
two InfiniBand switches both of which
are in the Upstate and with no incidents
I also have two x illogic storage note
each one has incident that I can drill
down and look at further but now let's
take a look at the compute node and the
software running on this computer
in this instance my WebLogic admin
server i see the host name the vm guests
the particular WebLogic domain name in
various web logic metrics i can further
drill down and see my metric history or
this admin server instance here with my
metric history I can see the
availability over the past 24 hours in
addition to key metrics
free memory total disk space and total
processes running on this web logic
admin server furthermore I can choose
additional metrics from my metric
palette and add those metrics as a graph
on this palette thank you for taking a
look at exa logic management within
Enterprise Manager 12
