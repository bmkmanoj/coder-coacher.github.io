cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to use
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
to clone an Oracle Fusion Middleware
domain by using an existing domain
provisioning profile by using Enterprise
Manager to provision domains from
profiles you ensure that new
environments adhere to IT best practices
and standards and also reduce operation
costs this video is applicable to Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
release 4 with Fusion Middleware plugin
release 12.1.0 0.7 this demonstration
assumes that a WebLogic domain
provisioning profile was previously
created from the source domain i also
assume that one or more hosts targets
are already present on which to
provision the new domain this process
performs like - like cloning
which means that if the source
provisioning profile uses two hosts then
I must provide two hosts for the
destination environment as well
furthermore if this domain requires a
database then a database target must
exist and contain any required schema
and data to ensure consistency between
my data and middle tiers Enterprise
Manager allows you to create and
provision database profiles for this
purpose but this is beyond the scope of
this demonstration and lastly I assume
that any web or LDAP server targets that
I want to integrate with my new domain
already exist
in order to clone a domain from a
provisioning profile I will log in as an
administrator who has been granted the
provisioning designer role
navigate to the middleware provisioning
page this page provides a summary of all
of the middleware provisioning profiles
and deployment procedures available to
the administrator
in this example I want to clone a domain
that was running Oracle so a suite 11g
patch set 6 so from the profiles region
at the top of the page I select an
existing WebLogic domain provisioning
profile to use as my source and then
click the provision button in order to
begin the provisioning process this
profile includes the cell binaries
patches and the domain configuration
notice that the source domain was
deployed to a single host so therefore I
must identify a single destination host
under which to provision the new domain
I must also provide the credentials for
this host
you
in the middleware section I accept the
default Java installation directory
which in this example is already present
on the destination host targets in
addition I must provide administrator
credentials for the new WebLogic domain
in the database section I select an
existing database target that was
already discovered in Enterprise Manager
cloud control and I supply its
credentials this database target must
contain a clone of the schema used by
the original source domain
you
in the web tier section I select an
already discovered web server target
like Oracle HTTP server and then provide
its credentials
you
in the schedule section you can choose
to either run this procedure immediately
or at a later time you can also
customize the notifications such as
email messages that you will receive as
the procedure executes and finally you
can optionally run the procedure in a
special analyze mode in this mode
Enterprise Manager will run all of the
prerequisite checks for the procedure
but not actually provision anything
now I'm ready to submit the procedure
after submitting the deployment
procedure I can track its progress from
the procedure activity page
you
and for troubleshooting purposes I can
view the details and results of each
step involved in the cloning of the so a
domain
so that concludes this demonstration on
the use of an existing WebLogic domain
provisioning profile with Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c now
you can quickly clone your WebLogic
environments throughout your enterprise
including those running Oracle Fusion
Middleware thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
