applications to share data but I don't
want to code or install and manage
infrastructure Oracle integration cloud
service or ICS enables me to perform
integrations between cloud and
on-premise applications I create the
integration between Salesforce and s AP
systems an Oracle integration cloud
service I start by creating an s AP
connection for my integration using the
s AP connector in the wizard as I
provide the connection name the
identifier is automatically generated
based on that name after the S ap
connection is created I configure the s
ap endpoint connection properties such
as connection name application server
client language and system number
because the s ap endpoint is password
protected I add the required credentials
once the S AP connection is configured I
test the count activity and verify that
it's successful
once the S AP connection is marked as
configured it's ready to use within
integrations on the connections page I
create another connection this time I
use a Salesforce adapter just as before
the identifier is automatically
generated based on the connection name
after the Salesforce connection is
created I configure the connection
properties to the Salesforce endpoint to
do this I use a wisdom file that
contains the endpoint details this
wisdom file was created when configuring
the object outbound message in the
Salesforce system the Salesforce
endpoint is password protected so I add
the required credentials once the
connection is configured in ICS I test
the connectivity and verify that it's
successful the Salesforce connection is
now marked as configured on the home
page I continue with the creation of the
integration but
the Salesforce and si P connections I
provide information about the
integration putting a name and an
identifier I can optionally provide a
package name and a description the
version number is automatically
generated the integration canvas is
displayed with all the available fully
configured connections I start the
integration by setting the ASAP
connection as the integration target I
enter some identifying information for
the si P endpoint I select the business
object by filtering the si P object
types and Groo I want to change the
personal data of a customer on the si P
system so I set the function to complete
this operation I review the default
properties of the connector these
properties include stateless interaction
and activated schema validation finally
I verify that the selected si P object
is the RFC function to change the
customer data the SI P connection is
created and configured as the target
connection now I continue configuring
the integration by using the configured
Salesforce connection as the source I
provide a meaningful name to the
Salesforce endpoint reference because I
want to receive notifications about the
account object I select some of the
account fields from the list I build the
field conditions based on the account
number I also want to receive
notifications when the account gets
created so I configure the event
notification I want a crowd business
operation to be performed when my
response is successful I verify my
selections for my Salesforce cloud
connection configuration the
configuration summary displays the
account object and its selected fields
as well as the event notification the
integration between Salesforce and si P
is configured and ready for activation
