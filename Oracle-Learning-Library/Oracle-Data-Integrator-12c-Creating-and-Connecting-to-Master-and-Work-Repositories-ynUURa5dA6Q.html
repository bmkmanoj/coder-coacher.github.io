Friedberg and this Oracle Learning
Library live is a demonstration of one
of four trainings
there's today and then there is two
three and four will be presented on
Monday Wednesday and Friday of next week
so today is going to be the master work
repositories creating those repositories
using our Cu the repository creation
utility and then on Monday we'll be
making projects on Wednesday we'll be
agents and on Friday we'll be making
scenarios so that's kind of where we're
going to be going with this this is
general disclaimer that says this is
actual live code and this is this is
shipping code but there's nothing in
here switcher facing we assume that you
have a database out there of some sort
this particular database has to sleep
it's a perfectly well with other
databases including non orifices it also
assumes that WebLogic server is out
there somewhere if you have a license
for it it will use it if we don't have
web of logic installed installing ODI
will cause web logic to be installed
though you don't have to be familiar
with it but it is out there is used by
studio and then we assume you have some
familiarity with sequels if that's the
underlying architecture for many of
these presentations so as we mentioned
we're going to be using database 12c and
we'll be using data integrator policy
data integrator shifts just about a
couple weeks ago and hopefully you all
saw the presentation last Tuesday this
past Tuesday announcing formerly a 12c
per ODI as well as for building so it's
a GUI tool there's all kinds of
drag-and-drop
we'll be able to see it in action the
demonstration happens to be under Linux
but it would work perfectly well under
Windows as well and we're not going to
do too much with the tool itself today
we're going to be preparing the
repositories for Monday Wednesday and
Friday and then Monday Wednesday Friday
we'll be spending a lot of time in
designing for quality and then
you run the scenarios we'll see it under
operate so those are the pieces parts
okay hopefully you can all see that this
particular demonstration is a live
demonstration of the oracle by example
training which is included with the
product if you install ODI and go to the
ODI start page right on the start page
is a link to the Oracle Learning Library
that contains this particular old OBE
Oracle by example so after watching this
presentation you could do the you could
re watch the presentation because it's
taped or you could do the OBE yourself
by going out there and follow through so
I'm going to be working through the OBE
itself and if you happen to be following
along I'll tell you where we are in the
OBE as we do it so we already covered
the prerequisites that database is out
there just to show you that there's a
database out there we've got people
developer running and as we mention it
happens to be 12c Podesta spoons
eventful WebLogic server is out there as
well
if we look at what's installed under the
middle we're at the WebLogic server
performing install ODI is already
installed so we've already gone through
that process and we're getting ready to
jump in and actually do the thing so the
first step in the OB step number 1.1 is
running OCU itself so what we're going
to do is figure out what directory we're
in we're in the home directory and I
found it useful to define a bunch of
environment variables
right found a useful to define a bunch
of environment variables and so you see
that I have them out here and this will
make it easy for me to navigate back and
forth still to get a RC you started we
can go to the Fusion Middleware chrome
which is based off of the Oracle home
and then further go to Oracle underscore
common and then bin and then from within
there we're going to fire off our Cu
repository creation utility
and when that launches it will start a
welcome page saying welcome to our CEO
and this is the appropriate version for
this particular version of ODI not a lot
to do on this screen so go to next and
what we're going to do is create
repository you can create multiple
repositories but at the moment we're
just going to create one we'll come back
later and drop the repository just to
show you what that looks like and we'll
come back later and create a second
repository as well this is a look that
will evolve alright so we're going to
simply hit next at this point take the
pulse the hostname that we're running on
we've happened to be on the same post as
ODI so that's really the defaults for
Oracle is 1521 though your yours may be
different and then there is an herb name
which is different than the instance
room and you know that the default is
Oracle and our host is us or balm again
yours is going to definitely be
different and at this point we're going
to put in a user who has DBA privileges
now keep your eye on the role down here
as I start typing the role changes and
so I'm going to say sis for purposes of
this demo every password is going to
simply be welcome what you won't see
them gonna display like that but for
purposes of the demo I decided to make
all of them the same that way we'll make
it easier for me to keep track of things
in real life you would not do that but
this works well for purposes alright so
then we go next
there's some housekeeping that happens
it's telling us that we are not using
Unicode and it says you really ought to
be using Unicode with this true we
really should and so the next time we
set up the database will properly
appointed using Unicode at the moment
we're going to ignore that it finishes a
housekeeping pretty quickly so we
continue and click OK and at the
point is ready to create a repository
you can name the repository using one of
several prefixes I can name one called
dev for development one called product
for production one called junk one
called test one called East one called
West you can make a bunch of
repositories we're going to just simply
leave the default and you can click
either date integrator or master pepper
if every one you click will cause the
appropriate things to be selected so by
clicking this one it filled in all of
these others so we go and click on next
and it does a verification form or
housekeeping to make sure that
everything is possible we click on next
again
and we we could either make one password
for all schemas which is nice for proof
of concept but probably not a good idea
for production but simply for a proof of
concept we'll put in welcome water for
all of them
realistically you would probably do
different passwords for different
screens but this will set up the schema
in particular the ODI repo scheme on and
we'll see that show up in a second all
right let me catch up here
now there's going to be passwords for
the OD I use or so the supervisor and
the name is going to be restricted to
supervisor though it's going to be
called google vacuum that has a password
as well for purposes of demo we'll say
welcome loan repeat it again and then
you have a choice of a couple of
different kinds of repositories we can
do
we can do development or execution and
so we're going to simply do development
while putting the D and then the name of
the repository we would be creative will
be not creative and simply do what they
suggest a work repository and then
that's got a separate password from the
supervisor but again for purposes of
simplicity we'll make everybody have the
same password and really violate
security I'll probably write it on a
little sticky note and paste it on this
friendless moves and everybody will know
right then we continue and hit next
the prefix that we have specified with
dev and you see the dev refix setup here
so these are the schema owners the dev
ODI repo is the one where you spend most
of the time working on and that goes
into a tablespace called devil ODI user
creates some additional table spaces if
these table spaces do not exist they'll
be created if they do exist it'll simply
reuse them so we'll go ahead and hit
next there's the message it just told
you what I discover
if these don't exist we'll go ahead and
create them so we say short go ahead and
do that and that part's fairly fast
creating the table so obviously to
create a tablespace the user who's doing
this needs to be a DBA
which is why I pick cysts if you have
other users that are DBAs but not sis
you could do that as well so you should
take about 20 seconds yep nurse not all
done and so this is just a summary of
what we're about to do haven't actually
done anything yet we've created the
table spaces and we haven't we haven't
yet created the repository but we're
about to
so in summary it's on host localhost the
default port for the database the
service name of the database which is
different than the instance I'm
connected assist not shown is as
successful yay and the operation is not
I'm going to create and load the
repository at the same time and it be
fix is dead so we say create and off it
goes this stays takes quite a bit of
time takes about four minutes to do this
whole failed while that's running just
to let you know the master work
repository aches about four minutes to
create meanwhile the master and worker
paska are being created and populated
it's populated with number of
technologies for instance all of the
knowledge modules for how to operate or
a database sequel plus etc those are all
being populated and there it is it took
about four minutes right on the nose if
you're curious we can if you're curious
we can go and look at the logs of what
was created and the one that we're most
interested in is the master and work
repository and that works pretty much
the way you'd expect we're interacting
that directly all right so that
completed OBE step 1.1 the repository is
now created
if you're following along in the OBE the
next step is deleting the repository
however we're not going to do that right
now
because that would undo the thing we
just did so we're going to skip one
point to deleting repositories and we'll
come back and do that later once we're
completely done so we will skip down to
one point three which is verifying
schemas using sequel developer this is
optional we've already done it but I
thought you might be curious to see what
that way so if I connect to the database
using a DBA
EDA account
connecting to the database waiting for
the connect
you
give me give me a page here
you
okay we can see a couple of interesting
things if I look at schema version
registry
if I could spell correctly
and at this point is not helping here we
go
gamer version registry
you can see what got created in
particular
there we go in particular for ODI we've
created a master work repository with a
prefix of dev ODI repo is name and type
dev ODI repo is a schema name version
valid all that kind of good stuff
so there's a number of interesting
things that we can see from that if
you're curious we also could do
something like select count from all
tables where owner equals dev ODI repo
and that may give us an idea of what
other interesting things are out there
turns out there's 220 tables that were
created as part of this repository so
they're all out there in the database it
doesn't have to be an Oracle database
work perfectly well in my sequel
database but with all that stuff out
there we can back it up using import or
export making an Oracle dump file or we
can back it up using XML two different
ways to do that and we'll see that a
little bit later in the demo okay so
that completes section one let's just
leave that in the background one and now
what we want to do is we want to go on
in section KU which is connecting to the
repository using studio so we'll leave
that RCU just where it is and we'll go
to studio so looking at a I home again I
have a variable defined ODI home it's
not required to create this variable but
it makes it handy the GUP and then from
there i can go to the studio and from
there I can launch ODI shell script and
we see that
lovely little splash screen now the very
first time that you run this and only
the first time you run this it will ask
you about previous ODI installations and
we haven't got any but it doesn't know
that so it will ask us anyway and so
it's going to ask would you like to
import preferences from a previous ODI
well here's the previous ones it's got
which is none so we'll say no thank you
this the subsequent time you run you'll
not you not and see that pop-up so it
continues to load continue to build
things
you
again verifying is 12.125
and here is the welcome to load yard it
turns out right on the splat page
creating connecting so di masterwork
Padres this is what we're doing right
this meant this is what we're gonna do
on Monday this is what we're gonna do on
Wednesday and this is what we're gonna
do my pride so you can come back in and
see these after your leisure and then
when you're done you can say thank you
don't bother showing that that anymore
so the first thing you need to do in
every case is connect to a repository if
you look at the designer or the operator
or the topology or any of those pages it
says before we do anything else we've
got to connect the repository so we will
say fine let's do that so we're going to
connect your repository the first time
it doesn't know where it is so we're
going to start with the plus technically
these two things the edit and delete
should be grayed out because there's
nothing to edit and nothing to delete
that well we'll just humor them I'll
click on the plus and this is the
information that we put in from the RCU
that we just finished the republic
recreation field so remember the login
name is tab ODI repo that's the scheme
will be created the user is supervisor
and the password we said was going to be
welcome one for everybody the schema is
dev ODI repo actually I lied to you this
this must be WR people this could be
anything however a good convention is if
I create a repository with schema name
of that then I'm going to login to ODI
it would just be convenient to log in
with the name of the schema so this does
not have to match that but it ought to
so this is from our CU this we make up
out of our head but one few simple so
we'll continue on with the password
the driver list this is the kind of
database that we're talking to so you
can see here these are the supported
databases or using repository
and ours happens to be or Oh the URL for
JDBC is of this form
and that's actually our only choice so
we'll say yes and again this match is
what we did for the arts you so the host
is localhost now it's very hard to see
but there's a colon you need to make
sure that you don't get rid of the colon
the board is 1521 again there's a colon
there and the SID is portal so it's very
hard to see but there's two colons
separating the quartz there and this
information matched what we did in your
field lastly we're going to attach a
master work repository to a mass
repository to a work repository you can
have several work repositories for a
given master for instance the master may
define the pathology saying I have
physical servers one two three and then
the work repository might be dev and
Prime so at the moment we're going to
simply only have one work across board
so there's not a lot of Units go home I
click on the magnifying glass the only
one we created was work rep we're going
to create a second one in a minute so I
select it it fills it in and if I had
multiple work repository if I could pick
which one of these is at the pole so a
particular connection has a master and a
particular worker passport we naturally
want to test this to make sure that
everything you type in followed
so it's going to go out and see that
that schema exists will password is
valid by the way you notice there's
stuff happening in the background so we
say okay you may want to keep your eye
on stuff happening the background there
we'll look at that will then stay okay
and it saves us an information that
we've just created and we have the
option of storing these passwords in a
wallet while it's have been around for a
while but they're now in a lot more
fashion in 12c GoldenGate users wallet
so di you can wallow databases with
wallet and the passwords in the wallet
is going to be the same one that we're
using for everybody else welcome one
type it again and just going to store
supervisor user logon in the wallet I
had the option of doing it without the
wallet but why not use the wallet so I
hit OK and now supervisor and the
password for it in the wallet and after
I sign into the wallet the supervisor
and password will always be
pre-populated on this login so I only
have one choice against them but I could
make a second one and derreck's so I
click on OK it creates a connection and
then it's going to populate all this
stuff over here ok so now that this has
been populated via how physical things
in my apology nothing has run yet but if
they do they're here nothing's been
designed yet but when we do it's going
to show up over there
ok so that is connecting through the
repository that completes 2.1 let's
create a second repository into that too
so what we're going to do to create a by
the way this is all you have to do so
from a mandatory standpoint we're
basically done in an optional standpoint
let's go back to our sequel developer
here and we want to create another youth
so I'm going to going to still signed on
as DJ
create a user names dev ODI repo
remember I had devil yacht repo McNab Oh
di repo - m25 by my favorite password
and when we run that we now have a new
user created okay
and then just to simplify things we're
going to give him full privileges to do
everything obviously you would restrict
that in real life to something a little
bit more subdued but that's that's good
enough for our purposes they do need
permissions to access all of the tables
that you're going to be moving from
source to target so it's if it's not a
DBA it's certainly something pretty
close to everyone okay so now the devil
di repo too exists let's flip back to
data integrator and we're going to
create some additional report okay so if
we go back to topology and we look at
repositories we already have a master
repository which we decorated not a lot
to see on that
of the master of high score we have
created if we look at the work
repositories we've got one called work
rep and it has an ID associated with it
its development as opposed to execution
and it's got a password okay so that's
what exists what we like to do is we'd
like to make a new repository and maybe
this one instead of development might be
production so we click on new repository
and it's going to ask us very similar
questions to what we had before it's
going to be on the same database so
we'll stick with Oracle same JDBC driver
it remembered the URL so that's fine the
difference is right here we say that
it's devotee I repo - and that matches
the user that we created the password
happens to be the same let's test that
ok so it can reach dev ODI repo - that's
good then if we continue on it says that
the host that we're connecting to is
using a something that is not
universally recognized meaning it's not
our actual IP address in localhost and
it says that's not a great idea because
if I try to do this from some other
place some other clients come in not in
Ravello hook correctly so this is a
valid warning however for purposes of
this purposes of this test we can ignore
that but it is something to think about
in production alright so we have a name
for this thing the work repository we
can call it whatever we want we'll call
it actually let's call it work rep - to
match everything else we've been doing
the password needs to match what we set
up for the schema and again it's of type
development or execution you pick what I
want and then when we hit finish you'll
see stuff happening in the background
and chug-chug-chug creating a repository
since we're only making a work
repository and not a master repository
du will go much faster than the four
minutes we saw before want to create a
log I'm sure we use the same idea you
can make it anything you want but it
would be logical to name it the same as
a scheme huh and it's going to store
that login in the wallet along with the
other login and there we go we now have
work rep to work up to so work rep has
some sort of an ID work grep to
as a different ID and we don't really
care what the ID is this long zipper and
now the next time we log in we can pick
which repository we want to use so just
to show you that real quick
we will disconnect oops we will
disconnect
we come back into the net
by the way this here is the exact same
thing as this here so we're going to
connect the wallet password is welcome 1
and in my wallet I have a choice of repo
or repo - now I'm going to pick repo I
mean why not and then all the passwords
are stored in the wallet it fetches the
information from the wallet and we're
back in ok so that completes topic to
topic 3 is importing into these
repositories so you have several options
if I look at the designer you see
there's currently nothing in any of the
projects and similarly there's nothing
in any of the models I might have
developed some useful projects and some
useful models from some other previous
repositories similarly if I look under
my technologies I look under Oracle look
under Oracle
you
would be right here there would be
databases showing up if there were in
and since there aren't any it would be
useful to import some so what we're
going to do is we're going to ignore all
of this for a second and topic 3.1 is
how to report us into a master
repository from the previous repository
so the way we do that is we go to here
this is at the top bar the topology and
we'll pick import because they import
what from an import a master repository
and so you'll see we're going to do work
apart phonetic we can import subsets of
that so to import a master repository we
could import from a zip file
alternatively since all this is doing is
really putting stuff into the database
we could do a dump file and do a import
using the database tools we're using the
ODI tools and it will accomplish the
same thing the difference is the zip
file contains XML versus the database
import/export would contain a dump file
so it turns out I have some from a
previous experiment that I would and so
I have a ODI master repository zip Bowl
will give you the details about
it's kind of biggish it's two men but
that's what I'm going to import this
good mag pile so I'm going to say open
and this doesn't come with the product
this would be from a previous install so
you would have this after you have
successfully installed ODI you can
export to a zip file and this is the one
I want to bring in so I'm going to say
import and then it goes off and it does
it since this is 2 Meg this is fairly
lengthy it takes about 2 minutes to do
this right and then the import is
probably almost done as we saw it was 2
Meg of XML so if you have a bigger or
smaller import that will take longer or
shorter it turns out that the database
import using the dump file is much much
faster the problem is if you dump from
an 11g database and try to bring it into
a 12c database it might be a different
format and so the import export through
XML zip file is recommended in cases
where there's a mismatch of version type
when we get to the importing of the work
repository that's much much faster let
me just see if there's any questions
still out there
uh can the ideas or working present in a
contained effort and creative the ideas
are they eat the ideas used to be picked
by you in version 11 and verse and 12
they use something called a GUI D global
unique ID and those IDs are picked by
the system so you cannot change them and
the system will try to keep them neat
however the names can be changed as far
as changing the names that I know for
sure what you can do is export it and
import it into a new name but that's one
often I'm not sure if you can alter the
name in place the issue is that there's
all kinds of referential integrity going
on in terms of projects that are using
those names and scenarios and musical
projects and so changing changing a name
would be a rather horrific process but
worst case you can always export it and
then import it into a new name
effectively duplicating the structure
and then getting rid of the first one
import from 12c to 12c or 11 feet of
policy when you say import again there's
two flavors have imported import using
the database dump file and import using
the XML it turns out that what I happen
to be doing here is using XML on
importing from an 11g ODI into a 12c OBL
so it's doing the conversion necessary
for that process problem um the other
thing is that if you are watching this
import here which is equivalent for
watching paint dry there's no there's no
click here to continue once it's done it
just pops immediately into the concerti
summary screen so I have to keep your
eye on it
and should be done no this is like
watching water boil here like I say it
should be done that it's going to take
on there we go okay so let's see let's
dismiss the poll in and see what it is
that we brought in so we brought in a
bunch of logical schemas and a bunch of
physical schemas and I can't there we go
and if I look down here we can see the
various things we brought in by the
physical schemas there are appropriate
logical schools and all this stuff
should show up if I go back over to
physical architecture here let's dismiss
this I go back over to physical
architecture here
now something showed up that wasn't
there before I don't know if M BER but
there were only initially data types
actions in Dec that this was one of the
things we imported okay so that's how we
import a master repository similarly we
could import a work repository which is
going to look like the exact same thing
except it's different stuff so did
master before now if you work instead of
the M rep we pick the W rep this naming
convention you can do whatever we want
that's certainly a good name from a zip
file ready set go
this should take much faster since it's
much smaller and importing fewer things
so these would be things like particular
mappings which used to be called
interfaces particular scenarios
particular procedures in fact up
similarly the master work repository are
both just database tables so we could
have done it using the XML which is what
we did or we could have done it using
the database both work equally well
okay so we imported a bunch of marker
groups which are used later on we'll see
those bunch of knowledge modules by the
way there's a bunch of built in now it's
module some quality so use those left
people bunch of data stores which refer
to the pic to the table so we've brought
in a bunch of stuff
okay so that was a concluding topic 3
the last thing topic forest testing
repository can often if I go to look at
repository loops repository connection
information it will tell me in a display
only way that I am connected as ODI repo
supervisor to the Oracle database at
localhost 1521 cetera and my work
repositories work well so this presumes
that I've already got an active
configuration and because it's active it
cannot continue I can see similar things
in that dialogue box if I wanted to edit
it what I could do is I could go back to
where we were before I could disconnect
no longer connected and when I come back
to connect and I open up the wallet
instead of just connecting I can click
on the pencil and this gives me the
option to look at all of the parameters
and painful this is the same screen we
saw before with two significant
additions one is that contains them and
two is I can test stuff so for instance
if I were to make a mistake and then
click on test
it says bad credentials and it will tell
me why but that really says is the
supervisor woman says so then I can go
back and fix it and test it
and it works so this is a a possible way
of testing the RCU connection informal
will say okay
and lastly if you look behind this when
you do testing you'll see that there's
other information going on and in
particular there is something about weak
connections I'm not exactly sure what
that means
but something about this particular hose
is only a warning it's not an error but
there's other things that you'd want to
test you might want to look behind the
studio for those messages to see if that
other stuff you need to do it okay so
that concludes the mandatory part let's
disconnect as we actually we're already
disconnected let's go and do a removal
we promised we would do that and we skip
that before so the last piece that we
skip with moving on our school if I look
at the OBE it was step 1.2 that we skip
which was how to delete a repository so
we come back in and we restart our Cu
but instead of doing a create where I'm
back in to do a delete welcome now
obviously you wouldn't do this in
production because it's going to get rid
of everything so you couldn't back it up
or you could have done an export to it
as if file or dump it or something fed
but if I want to go in and do a drop a
little cosplay
it's the same localhost 1521 this is the
same process that this okay so this is
the exact same screen we saw before
making sure that that's legit
and now it says you have a choice of
prefixes if one creepers out there named
dev which has these following things in
it and if I had a prod or junk or test I
could pick which of the RC you believe
and so I'm going to delete the debt of
one which is going to take out ODI
master work without going as well as the
security services so I'm going to say
yep go ahead let's remove that just so I
see what it looks like
validates that everything I app or is
proper and then it's going to actually
do it
this is what I'm going to do I'm going
to drop everything with a prefix of
doubt and so I click on drop and the
drop goes much faster than the creative
good effect let me just take a peek at
the time it should take all told is less
than a minute
the longest one is opss and that's only
22 seconds so we can wait we can wait 30
seconds to let's go the reason you might
want to do this is if you had a bad of
repository that you created incorrectly
or a project you're no longer using
there might there might be reasons to
get rid of it or more importantly if you
were doing a test machine and you wanted
to just clean everything off without
destroying the database RC will remove
the pieces of the schema and the table
faces that need and of course if there's
dependencies in other words I had a bad
event
prod it would be smart enough to leave
the table space investing moveable
tables if I was removing death and
retained pride in this case there's no
other repository so it will go ahead and
drop the paper faces as well and there
we go
so reparse you in a minute and a half
cleaned up after itself and we have
removed the dev repository if I want to
prove that to myself I can go back in
here
I can click on the schema registry that
we've had
and and when we run that we see that
it's empty so in fact I did in fact
remove all of the pieces of our seal
okay lastly if I want to completely
clean up the machine I did the RSU let
me just show you what a Dee install of
ODI looks like with the Xperia Oracle
Universal installer binaries and the D
installer is pretty quick
you
this would be used if you were going to
from the scene before you gave it off
back to something else the reason you
would do a D install instead of
distantly wiping out subdirectories is
that there's an Oracle inventory file
aura inventory and this properly updates
the inventory to reflect that the miles
been removed as opposed to simply brakes
so we'll wait for that to open up next
you
next next next
there we go okay so it says these are
the things I found if if the WebLogic
server was out here as well that would
be an optimal thing to do install so I
can go ahead and do the D install from
or it's going to update or inventory a
connection from Oracle home so we go
ahead and click the install and it runs
pretty quickly it takes about 15-20
seconds and then once that's done we've
cleaned up after ourselves
the optional things to do you can see
them in the background the optional
thing is that in your home directory dot
o di
a hidden directory contains the wallet
you can remove that as well
and then there are some log files you
can move as well
so those are optional if you're
interested in in completely cleaning up
as finished as doing its the install
will give you a chance to answer that
while the deinstall expansion by the way
you'll be a little curious it will say
100% and not actually be done yet that's
kind of bothered me a couple of times so
even though now it says next but I don't
know if you noticed there is about a
five second lag between hundreds and
next so we'll click on done successfully
D install though di and then the last
thing we need to do clean up after
ourselves is we said we were going to do
a get rid of the wallet and then we're
going to put rid of the directory that
contains some other lock files and then
last but not least it created a
directory for today and we're going to
clean up after that okay all right thank
you
all right well just conclude their web
cast thank you all for attending and
have a great rest of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
