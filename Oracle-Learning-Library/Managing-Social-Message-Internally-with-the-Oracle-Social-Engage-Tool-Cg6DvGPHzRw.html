engagement and monitoring welcomes you
to managing messages internally engage
lets you complete internal activities
such as assigning and archiving messages
and submitting an issue so to get
started choose engage from the main menu
drop-down click a message from the
message panel let's take a look at this
message similar to an email message
there are familiar actions you can take
but there are some important features
included in this interface that allow
you to manage the message internally you
can assign the message to someone on
your team and write them a note
explaining why you assign this message
click the drop down to view other
actions you can take on the message many
actions are for responding externally
and our self explanatory but I will
describe a few internal actions if the
message had previously been assigned you
can reassign it you can choose to
archive it and you can mark the message
as unread or mark all messages as unread
send to right now sends the message to
your service provider you would do this
if an urgent issue has been discovered
and requires quick action for now I will
close this drop down by clicking on the
drop down arrow again or somewhere else
inside the message you can add labels to
a message similar to what I show here in
this message as described in our
navigating the message stream demos
labels are a great way to sort your
social conversations by category and
subject for easy searching your team
should agree on the names that you use
for your labels ahead of time but once
the correct one is used others will be
able to select from labels already in
use in addition some labels are
automatically assigned by the listen
tool
click the internal activity link to see
what action has been taken on this
message this message happens to be
assigned to me so if I complete my
assignment now my actions will show up
on the internal activity log and the
team can see all actions that everybody
has taken on any given post if you want
to close the message without replying or
if replying is not appropriate click the
X in the top right corner or click
anywhere outside of the message so
that's how easy it is to manage messages
internally in social engagement and
monitoring see our documentation at the
URL listed and go to the Oracle Learning
Library to see our other demos that
describe how to navigate messages and
how to manage content on owned social
properties thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
