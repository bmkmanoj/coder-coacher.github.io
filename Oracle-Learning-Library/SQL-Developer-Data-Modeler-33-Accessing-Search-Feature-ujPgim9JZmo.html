we've made a lot of enhancements to our
searching feature in this demonstration
I'll show you the various ways that you
can access the search I'm currently in
the data model product if I go to the
browser tree notice that I have two
desires that are currently open I have
the OE design and the HR design now if I
wanted to do a search that spans across
both designs I want to use the global
search to access the global search go to
this upper right hand corner and in this
field type in your search pattern I'll
type in C US and notice as I type the
search results tab will automatically
open up and the results will be
displayed below in the results it'll
tell me what design and what model the
pattern was found in so in the first row
it found the pattern in the HR
relational model it looks like it's
located in the locations table and
within the comments property it's found
see us as part of customers in the
comments in the second row it also found
this pattern in the OE data type model
the C us is part of the corporate
customer type so if you want to do a
search that spans across all the designs
that are currently open use the global
search
let's close the results you can also
search
then a particular model right here I
have the OE relational model that's open
and packed in if I go to the icon menu
at the top and select on this binocular
icon it will go ahead and open the
Search tab a notice in the Search tab in
the name it says relational that's part
of the OE design and this is where it
tells you that it's going to do a search
within this model in the pattern field
go ahead and type in your pattern I'll
type in customers and again as I type
the results will be displayed below and
in the results he'll show that customers
was found as an index that's part of the
various tables that are in this model
you can also open up the Search tab
again by going to the View menu and
selecting find and since the OE
relational model is open overhead and do
a search within that model it remembers
that customers was your previous search
so it will go ahead and persist that
now if you want to do a search within
another model you can go to the browser
tree let's do a search within our
logical model right click on logical
model to open up the menu and select
find the search tab will open up and
notice that in the name of the tab it
says so a logical model so it's telling
you that it will do a search within the
logical model again it remembers that
customers was your previous search the
difference is that in the results below
it now is doing the search on the
logical model so it will find customers
as part of the attributes and entities
in the logical model so that's how you
can access the various searches in data
model 3.3
