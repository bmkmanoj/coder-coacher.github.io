of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet in this part you'll learn how to
optimize performance in your jet
applications jet applications are
client-side html5 applications most
performance optimization recommendations
that relate to client-side html5
applications also applied to oracle jet
in addition some jet components have
performance recommendations that are
specific to that component in general
you can optimize an Oracle jet
application the same way that you would
optimize performance for any client-side
html5 application there are many online
resources that provide tips for
performance optimization for example the
Google developers website describes
processes for among other things
optimizing caching optimizing round-trip
times between the client and the server
minimizing the payload size in other
words the downloads responses from
cached pages minimizing the requests
overhead improving browser page layout
and optimizing performance on wearable
devices among a range of other tips and
tricks most of these recommendations are
up to you to implement but jet itself
includes features that can reduce the
payload size and the number of trips to
retrieve the jet application CSS the jet
developer guide contains a list of
performance optimizations applicable to
jet applications you should definitely
take a look at this long list of tips
and tricks for example in the JavaScript
section you'll see that jet provides
minified versions of the jet library as
well as the third-party libraries when
available you also learn which aspects
of performance optimization jet has
control over and which aspects it
doesn't in the CSS section you will read
about how you should only send the CSS
that your application actually needs and
also again about minification and
obfuscation of CSS
performance optimization insights that
relates to jet components directly
include the fact that you should only
use the jet components that you actually
need build your page in HTML and
and only the jet components that you
need if your application only needs the
component briefly add it and then remove
it as soon as your application no longer
needs it also follow the jet component
best practices consult the API
documentation for each jet component
that you're using and check if there are
not specific performance optimization
tricks and tips available within the
JavaScript reference for your jet
components something else is that you
should limit the number of jet
components to 50 per page and for
optimal performance limits the number of
jet components on your page to set
numbers for the type of component that
you are using for example five
components per page are recommended for
a jet tab and a jet toolbar two
components per page for OJ chart and so
on so take a very careful look at the
performance optimization section and the
related references in the jet
documentation in this part you've been
given a range of tips and insights
useful for optimizing performance in
your jet applications for your homework
for this part use one of the existing
applications that you have been working
on during this course and try to trim it
down to be as small as possible you
should be able to get to something quite
a bit smaller but just deleting unused s
CSS files component libraries and CSS
themes and as a bonus tasks if you are
familiar with CSS you can try trimming
the default outer UI CSS seem to only
include what your application actually
uses as well and with that we thank you
again for taking part in the oracle jet
course and see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
