in this demonstration I'll show you how
to test the healthcare so a composite
application using the b2b simulator this
is pre-installed with Oracle's sole
suite for healthcare integration and
simulates external systems sending and
receiving hl7 messages on mllp pause
before running the simulator you need to
setup the hl7 config dot properties file
this tells the simulator the exchange
protocol the directories for the
incoming and outgoing files the
listening port which is the one defined
in the outbound endpoint that the
simulator will listen on whether you're
using functional acknowledgments and the
port number of the inbound endpoint that
the healthcare is listening on now let's
look at the script that we'll use to
start the simulator we need to set up
some environment variables first then we
run the b2b simulator and utility
specifying the hl7 config dot properties
file and then at the end we'll show the
end of the simulator log file so let's
close that and now we'll run the script
okay we see that the simulator has
started and some of the log files now
let's drag this ADT message file from
the desktop and drop it into the in
folder which the simulator is polling we
see the file disappear which means the
simulator has picked it up and we see
messages appearing in the log along with
a small report and now we see a message
appear in the out folder so we know the
healthcare sowe're application is
working correctly
now let's open the healthcare console
and we can see on this system dashboard
that the status of the endpoints is
running and that there was one message
to the outbound outpatient laboratory
endpoint and one message from the
inbound outpatient admission endpoint
let's go to reports and here we see the
two messages again one in bound to the
outpatient a mission endpoint and one
outbound from the outpatient laboratory
endpoint and we can see that the state
is message complete for both of these if
we select one of these say the inbound
message and its closes pain we can see
the business message details we can also
click these other icons for example why
a message and here we see the wire
message details we can also look at the
application message and see those
details here as well so that's it
simulating the external systems with the
b2b simulator and then viewing
healthcare dashboards and reports is a
very useful way to test your healthcare
so accomplished at applications for more

healthcare integration please visit the
Oracle Learning Library and watch other
videos in this series and also visit the
Oracle technology Network thanks for
watching
