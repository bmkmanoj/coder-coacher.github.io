account page to monitor services using
my account you can monitor the services
assigned to you for which you are the
account administrator these services can
be in different data centers and
identity domain my account displays
information such as the service name
what identity domain it resides in what
type of service it is what type of plan
and the status of the service click on
the details icon to find more
information about a specific service so
the overview tab displays detailed
information about the order ID
subscription ID account see a sign
number or data center plan we scroll
down you'll find more details about
information such as SFTP details you use
SFTP details to help you export data
from your database service click on the
utilization tab now I just signed up the
service at the moment there isn't
anything to display history wise I'll
show you another sample on the moment
here status you can look at a calendar
view of the status of your service
administration tab shows you who the
administrators are you can add new
administrators to help you manage your
account
so let's click back on the back services
button take us back to our list of
services there's a filter option which
you can use different check boxes here
to filter your services accordingly
whether it's active or inactive services
or both or a Java service or database
service you can also use the search box
here enter in specific values for
instance if i wanted to filter on data
for database service that would return
only the services that our database
service and as you can see it places
some tags here or i could change that up
say java and then i would expect to see
only java services returned in my
account so they sure enough right now i
have one job of service i've signed up
and if i remove that filter tag all the
results were pear and click on status
history so it shows me again a
historical outlook of when i signed up
for my services okay so now what I want
to do is show you another account then
has some more useful utilization data so
in this case someone is changing account
name to LA Dodgers as opposed to Oracle
so there are things that can be done to
change the account name service name
this right now I only have database
active I have a couple of requests for
java and database services the services
are pending at this moment so if I click
on the database link
reveal the details but what I wanted to
point out to you was the utilization tab
which will show me utilization for the
specific database service now in this
case this is a service that is being
used to full capacity and then some this
storage percent is actually a reflection
of what the service account would be
allocated the reason it's one nineteen
point sixty percent is because it's
actually exceeding the allocation for
the account and so this would be an
indication that as a user of the service
that I would want to go ahead and reach
out to Oracle to add another service so
I could reallocate some of those
resources to the new service and then
bring down the percent utilization here
and it tells me something about the
storage use including maximum and
average storage percent also gives me
information about the objects a number
of objects the average object count
table count and so on now the difference
between this utilization tab is a
specific to one service or to click on
status history then what this shows me
is a high-level overview of all the
services available to my account in this
case this database is up and running
it's been up and running there was a
brief outage over this past weekend and
then it was back up and running again on
Monday these other services say na
because I just put in requests for them
they're not up and running yet let's say
this shows me all the services under my
account and of course you have options
to change your view whether it's daily
weekly or monthly view alright so let's
go back to services click on database
again click on status real quick so
here's a nice colorful calendar view and
again this makes it a real clear view
that over this past week and I had an
outage for this service but otherwise
was up one hundred percent of the time
since last Wednesday and then back up
again on Monday and of course you have
the option to scroll through the
calendar if you want to view
historical information about your
service then they on the administration
tab again this this will show you
information about your buyers and your
account administrator so buyers have the
ability to purchase services on behalf
of your account so that's the person you
would reach out to you if you decided
you needed to add services to reallocate
your resources say in our case where
resources were over utilized and then
there's account administrators and these
are the folks that can add users to
various services so you may find that
you're going to want more than one
account administrator to help you manage
the various services under your account
and that that's really about it you know
other than when I've shown you already
this is a case where the account is
being over utilized and you would want
to reach out to add services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
