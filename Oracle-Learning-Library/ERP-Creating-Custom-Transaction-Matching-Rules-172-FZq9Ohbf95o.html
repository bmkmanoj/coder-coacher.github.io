would want to create a custom matching
rule and how to do it step by step to
give you some context for this video
when you import a bank or credit card
statement file into NetSuite
the intelligent transaction matching
feature automatically matches the
imported statement transactions with the
GL transactions in NetSuite NetSuite
identifies matches by running the system
default rules which cannot be modified
after observing how many transactions
are matched by the system rules and how
many are left to match manually you
might start to notice some patterns and
want to create some of your own custom
matching rules so let's see an example
of how to create a custom transaction
matching rule with multiple conditions
in this scenario I want to make a rule
that will automatically match
transaction IDs to IDs in memos ignoring
any prefixes like leading zeros or
letters and the transaction dates within
two previous days I also want the
amounts to match before we begin you
will need the matching rules for online
banking permission enabled with a full
edit or create access level to access
the reconciliation matching rules page
speak with your account administrator or
see the help topic NetSuite access
overview for more information on roles
and permissions so we begin by going to
the reconciliation matching rules page I
click transactions bank reconciliation
matching rules here you see the current
list of matching rules so far I only
have the default rules and no custom
rules yet to create a new custom rule I
click new role under the custom rules
heading the custom matching rule window
pops up this is where we're going to
define all the conditions for our rule
in the custom rule name field enter
match on memo and dates within two
previous days I want to make my rule
name as descriptive as I can the first
row in the grid is going to be the first
condition for my rule keep in mind that
all custom rules will automatically
include the criteria to match on equal
amounts or the amounts sum by default so
I don't need to specify that condition
here from the transaction type list I
could specify a transaction type but I'm
going to keep the default selection of
all imported my selection here will
determine which options are available in
the primary field and the other
transaction type lists it also restricts
what you can select in this list for any
additional condition lines below
remember I want this rule to match the
transaction ID from imported
transactions to the IDS in memos from
NetSuite transactions so from the
primary field list I select transaction
ID this further filters the options that
are available from the rest of the
fields as we make selections the
description automatically updates from
the operator list I select equals ignore
prefix
I want the system to disregard any zero
spaces or letters that might be in front
of the number in the memo so for example
if the transaction ID is one two three
and the number in the memo field is N
one two three or has other text around
it
NetSuite still makes much notice that
because I'd selected all imported
transactions of the first type the
system automatically selects all
NetSuite in the other transaction type
list on the other side it's the only
option in the list from the compare
field I select memo
I now finished with my first condition
line and the description at the top is
updated for the condition
I want to create a second condition for
this rule so I click the Add icon okay
now you can see that there is a second
row and the system is still updating the
description the transaction type options
are restricted based on why it's
selected first in the previous condition
row I'm going to keep the all imported
selection from the primary field list I
select date again this selection
determines the options that are
available in the rest of the fields I
want to specify a date range for my
match so from the operator list I select
within X previous days of with this
option a matching date can be the same
as or up to the specified number of days
before the other date so I've selected
an operator that requires a value
because I want my rule to match
transactions on date within two previous
days I enter two in the value field
notice again that because I'd selected
all imported as the first type the
system automatically selects all
NetSuite in the other transaction type
list on the other side it's the only
option in the list also because I
selected dates and within X previous
days the system automatically selects
dates in the compare field for me I'm
now finished with my second and last
condition line
now that I'm done creating my rule
conditions I click Save now I can see my
new rule on the page under custom rules
NetSuite always runs the system rules
first in the order that you see here
then NetSuite runs my custom rules in
the order in which they appear I can
create more custom rules and then drag
and drop the rules in this list to
specify the order in which I want
NetSuite to run them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
