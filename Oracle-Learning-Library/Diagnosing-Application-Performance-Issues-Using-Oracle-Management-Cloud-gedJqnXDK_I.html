As a DevOps Engineer, you can use Oracle Application Performance Monitoring Cloud Service to
gain detailed insight into production
applications. You can monitor the
performance of your application from the
end user's perspective, understand your
server-side workloads, identify problems
in associated tiers, and drill down to
operation-level details. You can also see
how the performance of your application
resources relates to the workload. Drill
down to see how the user experienced your
application, by viewing information such as page load time and page errors. If a
page is loading slowly, review the server
requests related to the page. Look for
high loads, errors, or high response time
metrics. If server requests are
abnormally slow you can also examine
memory usage and garbage collection.
Modern web applications regularly
leverage Ajax to deliver a dynamic user
experience.
Examine the Ajax calls to ensure that
the average response break down time and
errors are within acceptable limits.
Examine a specific server request and
drill down to see its response time, calls,
and errors. Diagnose code level issues
and see the performance of operations
over time.
Drill into specific instances to see an
instance of operations that was slow or
failing. Inside the instance you can see
exactly which operations were used in
the call tree, and where time was spent
across the application requests
transaction flow. In APM, there are
multiple automatic log integration
points, where users can examine the
application logs for dependent
infrastructure resources. We hope this
video helps you understand how to
monitor your application performance
using Oracle Application Performance
Monitoring Cloud Service.
