groovy and javafx session we're going to
show you grizzy which is Bertrand's very
own version of Prezi written and groovy
effects all right some i'm steven chen
javafx evangelist for oracle now long
time open source contributor hacker on
javafx stuff you can check out my blog
stephen java calm or follow me on
twitter my co-presenter and I'm their
targets man I work for Lazarus image as
a Java to architect and lettuce image is
a software company specialized in retail
industry and and it provides solution
for point of sale software for royalty
for and sales promotion and each year
laser CMAC Putin's market new and
innovative solutions I also work for my
own company auditor technologies I offer
training on groovy and grails and I also
create website with a powerful CMS
Drupal
alright so let me let me give you guys
the quick introduction to Java Thicke's
and groovy effects in particular this
will this will be javafx hopefully is
not new for anyone so there's only one
slide on that groovy effects is
hopefully new for a couple people who
are learning about it other than the
groovy effects contributors sitting in
the audience like you Dirk and the
grizzy should hopefully be new and
exciting for everybody and you're
actually watching a presentation in
grizzy right now so the application
we're using for the presentation is the
grizzy presentation framework so John
effects 20 this is the high-level
overview it's a desk rich desktop
framework you can build animation
graphics integrate media in a great HTML
do 3d graphics in it it has hardware
acceleration for all of your graphics so
it takes advantage of your GPU for
accelerating 2d and 3d graphics and you
can use all of your favorite Java IDs
and tooling so as of JavaFX to JavaFX is
all written in pure Java code so you can
take advantage of NetBeans EFX clips
there's a nice plugin for Eclipse or you
can use this straight out of the box
intellij as well or j develop or anyone
else have a favorite ID alright we
probably covered the gamut next javafx
is also now open source so you can go to
the OpenJDK project download all of the
controls code check it out jemmye
effects which is a test framework is
also open source and if you were at the
keynote on Sunday Hassan VP of Java
engineering announced that the rest of
the javafx project will be open source
by the end of the earth so you got
something to look forward to how many
people here are OpenJDK contributors all
right so we got it we got to fix that
all of you all of you should be open JT
JT k contributors and if for some reason
you hit an issue which it doesn't quite
I'm pointing in some in the audience it
doesn't quite build or you can't get the
code working or it's hard to contribute
patches let me know and I'll find the
people and I will make their lives
miserable until they resolve your
problems goodness and it's going to run
on embedded devices so the Java embedded
javafx embedded developer preview for
beagleboard was released Saturday I
believe very very very recently if
you've been walking around the
conference if you've seen the nice
schedule kiosks I helped build that and
that's all running on a panda board
actually Jim and I both helped build up
and rich and Jasper did image already
the work yes question yeah so we'll talk
later just open the large checkbook and
we'll take care of you yes you
everything is for sale for the right
price oh you're talking about the
electrons by kiosk yeah so I can I can
direct you to the suppliers which self
and awards not not at the conference I
would actually for a development
platform you're probably currently
better off with beagleboard XM which is
what we support that's what the release
which went out was for so if you get a
vehicle board XM you can use a Developer
Preview raspberry pi is the other one I
would recommend support for that should
be forthcoming disclaimer disclaimer no
future looking statements etc okay next
alright javafx with groovy so you're
here for a groovy session I don't think
I need to convince you why groovy is an
awesome jvm language as of recently it's
both dynamic and strongly typed you can
actually do strongly type stuff right in
groovy which is cool and it's the
easiest JVM language to get started with
if you can write Java code then you
you're early a groovy hacker just rename
your files to dr. Ruby and you know off
you go well almost but change a few
permissions and then you're off to go
alright next and you might you might be
wondering what does what does groovy
effects code look like so i have quite a
bit of java code on the left and groovy
effects code on the right and if you
guys have binoculars or telescopes you
can you can learn all about groovy
effects on the slide but now this
seriously this this slides not meant to
be read it's just a comparison of next
it's a comparison of the how small it is
to write Java code verse groovy code so
the Java code for the sample application
was 40 lines this is a vanishing circles
application from the from my blog and
from the job effects SDK 40 lines 1299
characters the groovy effects versions
29 lines and 671 characters so you're
going to be a much much happier coder
coating with groovy effects than you
would with straight Java all right all
right so let's let's look at an actual
Ruby FX application next all right so
first you you create your scene graph
builder to construct your grief Eckstein
graph here is how you create a stage in
groovy effects so you can use named
parameters to pass in exactly what
arguments you want next you can do
little property definitions this is
setting random locations for the the
circles the written then setting the
radius to 150 and a stroke of white
next and you can also do binding this is
one of the there's two different bind
sin taxes and groovy effects so this
this is showing the example where we're
it's using the string version to grab
out the property hover and then has a
converter to go from Val whenever
whenever you hover it's going to make
the the border larger and then when you
uncover it will hide the border by
setting it to 0 and the last one there
is he's showing the loop creation so you
can also use all the groovy features
this is an example of a very quick way
to do it eration in a fixed number of
times with groovy if with groovy if you
did the equivalent Java code you need a
for loop and a counter variable and mobo
is that what do you what do you guys
think are you sold group effects all the
way alright
yeah that's that's that would be nice I
guess I guess I should I guess I should
update my code and then reduce the line
count on the previous slide shouldn't I
Thank You Derek all right animation in
groovy effects so groovy effects also
has a built-in animation syntax I think
I think I have a built for this girl
next slide so for T dot s is a it's
actually calling the function s on the
number 40 it's an extension method and
it creates a duration object so you have
a properly typed duration object for
your javafx code normally in javafx you
have to do duration seconds and pass and
40 as the parameters this is much much
shorter and easier to read also it's
using a little dsl here so at starts
your your set of keyframes click Next
the little keyframe dsl where you can do
change property to value and then set it
to a different value and this is one
immediately update it's going to create
the animation and the keyframes so that
this will execute with your application
thanks and you can also add tweeting so
in tweeting and javafx is you can speed
up and slow down the rate of animation
and there are some built-in tweens which
are convenient for easing into our out
of an animation to make it more smooth
thanks alright event listeners in groovy
effects so here's an example of an event
listener and again it has a little
animation inside of it click Next it's
using a closure syntax so you a very
compact method body if you did this in
pure Java code you'd have an inner class
you'd have like those big monstrous like
implement the handle method get all
these parameters ignore them because you
don't really need them etc etc no but in
groovy you can optionally have the event
primer you can actually leave that off
and goes next
oh yeah okay so anyway that's that was
animation I thought I'd one more build
and there's even more grooviness so this
code is the way this rest of this
presentation works is I show you some
ugly Java code and then we show you what
looks like an groovy effects so go go
back go back for Seth mmm so in case
you've never most people don't actually
show this code because it's it's ugly
and it's monstrous but you know javafx
has all these classes with properties in
them oh yeah I just you know I get this
property and I use it and it's so easy
and no if you look at the implementation
every single property has chunks of code
like this to define the getters and the
setters and you have to initialize the
property and they used to check
conditions for null and actually this is
not the fully optimized version there's
some other little tricks you need to put
in here so that if you get the value
when it's null and returns default value
all these little things you have to do
to to fully optimize the property
pattern in your code and it's it's it's
just you know it's it's it's it you have
to do it in Java like you know getters
and setters and beans it's required but
it's so much easier in groovy effects so
you just at FX bindable and it uses the
AST transform feature and groovy and it
actually a code generates a version of
the code at fully optimized version of
the code in the previous slide and it
even handles go to the next slide it
even handles in the initializer case so
you can initialize it and it properly
sets the initializer is in the right
place next
and you of course can use very elegant
groovy syntax for getting a setting
properties you don't do all those
setters and getters etc etc yes question
these properties are not read only but
you can create read-only properties
what's the is there a syntax and gravy
effects for read-only properties ok and
then it generates the Thank You Dirk
they
so I believe it's a normal property you
can just add an invalidation listener or
an update listener to it and it will
dark just like a javafx property it
actually code generates the JavaFX
property code alright next and you can
also do binding off of these properties
this is the other bind syntax where it's
actually using the property rather than
the name of the property you could do
either next okay so in case you guys
haven't noticed questions at any time
are perfectly valid so feel free to
interrupt myself or or birch run and we
will answer questions as they come
binding and groovy effects this is an
example of binding a whole class if you
put up expandable on class all the
properties all variables in the class
become properties which is very
convenient and this is an example of
part of a clock where your binding
different variables look together to
update the hands of the clock as the
time changes thanks all right so next
one java code table view everyone
together this the the table view in java
the control is wonderful and the type
safety is awesome it has all these
generics and it makes sure that you can
never ever do anything wrong with the
but it's it's a pain in the neck to
write I had the first time I thought I
thought I was pretty good at generics
but then the first time I read a table
view I didn't quite have this in text
right for like where the angle brackets
go after the dots and funky cases for
specifying generic son it's just yeah
okay so let's not do that next there
groovy effects table view collum collum
column and super easy
alright next slide layout in Java so
layouts layouts actually they're not
quite as hairy but there's this this
awkwardness with the constraints in
layouts since they wanted to make it
very easy to add your own layouts
without modifying the base note class
since constraints you really want to be
on the containing elements for maybe the
margins or the padding or the width and
height they made the API a bunch of
static methods on the layout class so if
you create if you had something to an H
box you have to do H box set H grow and
then pass in layout and then passing the
value of the constraint same thing for
margins and other layout constraints and
internally what that's doing is it
actually there's a there's a special map
on nodes where it dumps in all these
constraints into a big hash map and
stores them all the background and it's
yeah anyway jamas typesafe so they had
to work around it's not easy to add
extension methods it's not easy to do
this stuff but it works and it makes
lets you add your own layouts but in
groovy we can hide all this and just let
you specify the constraints in line and
take care of all that funk for you so
you can actually naturally specify
layouts without the hall yeah so that's
layouts and review offense
and that's that's the web web view is a
great example if you're doing a demo of
JavaFX and you want to do a three liner
pop a web view and then put a fancy URL
in and then your app looks really fancy
and then of course you know put cool
javafx stuff around the edges so it
looks even better next this is a grid
pain example in groovy effects as well
if it you've used the grid pain control
it's very powerful it's one of the the
most flexible layouts in javafx but it's
not as easy to use without groovy
effects it's quite it's quite nice to
use with your reflex next and then
that's the example of the layout on the
left is without the grid lines and the
right is with the grid lines grid lines
are useful for debugging your grid your
grid Lapan layout so very useful to try
out yeah I go back go back for a sec I
think I think it was there through the
back one more back not cooking back
okay this example doesn't have it but
it's um I think it's called grid pain
grid grid lines like grid lines is the
property and you set it to true and then
you get the grid lines but very useful
for debugging next next all right so
groovy effects supports and just keep
clicking as I talk so it supports you
know animations and binding and next
gradients layouts f XML you can load up
XML definitions using groovy effects so
you can use seen builder with groovy
effects tables charts
trees
and media this is an example of Dean
Iverson who is one of the founders of
groove effects he he helps run enough
team for the first robotics competition
so this is a nice little if you if you
get our Pro javafx book he is a video on
the actually you need to buy the book
you just download the code and there's a
video in the code samples okay thanks
and it also supports Griffin where's
Andre when we need him but Andre has
been spreading the good word some of our
attendees noob at Griffin's so that's
good good okay you liquor so if you did
the default template for Griffin you
would get that javafx application of
course you can you can keep customizing
it from there next all right and before
I turn it over to my co-presenter i'm
going to shamelessly plug you're
probably wondering why I'm dressed up in
all this motorcycle gear so part of it
is that's how I got to the conference
but the other part is i'm actually going
to be touring around europe right before
devoxx october 29 to the november 11th
of this year and i'm going to be
live-streaming the interviews and the
the visits and you can go to the website
night hacking com it has a ustream feed
where you'll see the live URL sign up so
you get notifications when I go online
and offline and i think i'm even i'm
visiting um basel switzerland do you
guys know anyone in basel so some of the
you might even get to need you might
even get to meet some of the groovy
effects team or the at least the javafx
team at canoe while i'm out there
virtually well I'm actually I'm also set
it up with them social chat so you guys
can chat and I'll have a little screen
up and then as you guys say things I'll
poke I'll poke my the folks I'm coding
or hacking with her interviewing ins and
get them get them to answer all the mean
questions you guys come
with okay
yes that's that's it all right
but so let's continue with grazie what
is grazie grazie is a project I wrote
and it it is based on the groovy ethics
project and and as Stefan said movie
ethics is groovy binding for java ethics
to so crazy facilitates implementation
of zooming user interface so what is why
it's difficult to say that's why is
simply simply said as why is the 2d and
graphical environment in which the user
is free to move and change the scale of
the roofed area to see more or less
details so with the gracie project what
i call the great UI presentation it's
simply a groovy script and so I use the
grassy library in order to run grazie
presentation
so we i will show you some demonstration
in a moment so what the user can do with
Grace's a user can move and change the
scale freely in the virtual 2d space he
also can automatically zoom in one
element of the presentation and you can
also define a prayer definite pass for
for a presentation Reggie also
implements bruising history and you have
the possibility to reload the
presentation grazie presentation it's
useful if you want to tune your
presentation so grazie use the powerful
rubia fix dsl in order to build an
interactive jealousy and so you have
special groovy groovy valuables
available the first one is the map
closure it's a it's a variable that is
monetary to to build the Java ethics
seen you also have the within closure if
you want to deal with sin object you can
use also the spatial viable path if you
want to to create a pretty finished path
it just a simple list of nodes so you
can add as you want notes2 to the path
and then you have focus on node it's a
special clothes you that you can use in
your great presentation in order to
automatically focus I mean zoom in on a
specific node
and now let's continue with some crazy d
moves for that I will use a simple text
editor with which I can run a result ask
Radha liz is a powerful building tool
that is part of the groovy ecosystem so
here I just use a gradual task to run
grazie with the current file so the
first presentation is is a simple slide
show I would like to show you my fractal
collection and thaw that I'm i will I
use a great representation so in action
he also goal is to to put on the scene
image is coming from a specific folder
and with grazie I'm able to navigate
between nodes that that that are added
to the prolific pass by pressing the
left arrow key I move from one image to
to another now you go back
I can also freely navigate under grace
representation and so I use the zoom so
we'll mouse in order to to the mount and
the right button mouse to to move around
my sin as you can see I can zoom in and
zoom out I had it also a shadow effect
on each images
and I can also in this specific
presentation click on on text like this
to have an automatic zoom in and Gracie
take care of the rotation of object for
example if i press this text
back in return
so how this presentation is made
I will made some comments on the code as
I said you you must have a first Matt
viable that define your your sin it's
here the first thing is to build a sh
box container that will contain another
ash box panel in which we will create
image image view so here we are using we
are using a groovy loop that is headed
to the five class it's each file match
so the idea is to to Bruce images rubble
from a folder here images and 22 Bruce
JPEG images so you can in the loop
create image you with images inside and
as you can see here we we use our focus
on node closure injected in the script
and once the imagery created it is
headed to the path this is why we define
a predicate pass in the greasy
presentation then here you have the
creation of an javafx to effect a drop
shadow as it will be applied to all
images because the effect is defined in
the ash box container and follow follow
it
and following the H box container we we
create 22 labelled balances for the
second one as you can see here we define
a rotation so i will put another level
with the text javaone and I just change
here
and use the focus on node closure
in order to want to use a click will
click on the labelled so the focus will
pass will be passed to the first image
in the past I save the file and I return
to my presentation and I just refresh
the scene by pricing the the f thing f5
key I go back
and then you see he'll see see how did
level I click on it and and I focus
directories in the first images so this
is the way you can build easily grassy
presentation
so let's move on to another crazy
demonstration
and this time we will use aggressive in
combination with graph this graph is is
a software graph visualization library
that damaged two to build to build a
graph as drug rams and so with with
graphics you can execute command and use
specific layout in order to produce
diagrams in different output formats
like SVG or a PDF or image and so on and
here we just we will just use graph face
with its text format the idea with with
the text Hawaii is to do interpret what
we what graph is will always put because
in the in the text format we will have
all the information in order to to build
nodes and edges of the jetta grammar so
this graph is the first thing is to
define the graph as you can see here
with we have a simple graph we defined
node like run Colonel zombie and
relation between node just with this
characters
and as you can see it's some sort of dsl
and so in order to build the grazie
presentation a graph is command will be
executed by misrepresentation I don't go
I'll i will not go into details but I
here we we execute the CL coke amount in
order to to put nodes with a certain
layout so let's see it in action
so the presentation as interpreted the
output of graphviz command and we are so
able to to build of this kind of
presentation for example he here I can
zoom in on the run snap and I put also
some animation using timeline and you
can navigate here
so so you'll get the ID so it's really
it was a powerful combination in order
to build sophisticated a great
representation if you have data coming
from database or something like like
that and then we can go a step future by
adding more interactivity in the crazy
presentation into preceding crazy
presentation we started from a static
graph here we will build as the usual
bill will be able to seal the graph for
poster presentation
yeah I create some notes
each other one
grooving
so here where the user is able to to
connect notes together and so we apply
with the help of gravis we apply a
specific layout I can add some other
nodes like for example Stefan
oops
i will put
at last note
so here we are
so after this interactivity
I can continue with another
demonstration that use a webview
component this is one of my favorite
components of java ethics but before two
to launch the demonstration i can show
you a simple representation and i can i
with with some comments here I we simply
had we simply have a webview in the
grassy presentation and and I will don't
I will not go into great detail but the
ID is here we are loading some content
in order to to to load and to build a
page for our web view as you can see we
have a script a javascript function here
and a body here so what is interesting
with the webview components from Java
ethics is the possibility to to have a
two-way communication between new Java
ethics application and and JavaScript
inside a web component this is what we
do here we have the possibility to
execute JavaScript so when once the
document is loaded we this this code is
executed and then here we execute set
message in JavaScript with a string
hello and we written document so what
set what set message does it send Lee
change the innerhtml of the dome element
here we are we have a paragraph tag with
Heidi message so once the page load it
is loaded we simply change lorem ipsum
by hello ok for that this is one way and
for the other way we are able to to add
a listener for example here when when we
will click on the button on the button
and so we can react by executing some
code here we we will simply display even
through saved
ok
so so the set message javascript
function is well called because to text
appears here and when I price click me
as you can see we have the we can we can
see that the event is is received okay
so I show you this crazy presentation in
order to to show you a more
sophisticated example that use to web
views and and the in in this
presentation we use something like as we
will show
so here you you have a first web you
component that choose to bubble tree
javascript library and the healthy web
page is built with groovy from data is
coming from json file so you can with
with this we you can build a powerful in
presentation
so what what we what I'm going to do is
to click on the special character and
and then I can display a second web view
that is also another html5 the
presentation I can navigate between
slide and then I by pricing exit button
I return to my first web view
so this is what what I point at its with
javafx and by using web components you
can really build a powerful presentation
and for and to finish i would like to
show you two to film demonstrations the
first one use the g box2d physics engine
and and as as its java library of course
you can use it in grazie
I start the presentation
so you have both that that are dropped
on top of the of the screen and and they
Boone's on walls
just another time and as it is crazy you
can zoom in and zoom out like this
last one
recently in javafx too so there is a new
canvas confident the that we that that
was added to the components soon so i
can i can show you a demonstration with
a convent canvas components
in fact this example is a reemployment
ation of of a fan html5 experiments that
you can fight and you can you can find
it on the a-teams website Hakeem is a
web developer and there is a very
interesting experiment in in html5 and
the use of canvas and it was a challenge
for me to reimplement it is the same
example in javafx so in the in the
original code you have an html5 page
that use a canvas object and the idea is
to see a wave simulation we with bubble
that permits to to show tweets and the
end in this demonstration in the
original demonstration you have you have
some code that that queries a ph PHP
server part in order to in order to
fetch latest queries on a specific term
so I do the same with grazie
when I move the mouse there is some
effect on the wife
and the idea is to click on button in
order to show twits
anyone know who
anyone know who javafx expert is no
nobody knows here ok so in the in this
crazy example as as we are in the
desktop sighs I used the HTTP build the
groovy HTTP builder in order to to query
tweets using the rest api of twitter all
right so it's uh let's give Bertrand a
big round of applause last effect here
as we are on Twizy you can do this
excellent so Bertrand flew all the way
here this is your first Java one ah yes
have you been in the US before just of
Atlantis is it is this your first visit
to the u.s. is a second second yeah okay
but it's his first very first Java one I
was very glad to meet him we met at the
the great conf and I knew all the great
work he done on grassy and invited him
to to come co speak with me so thank you
very much and he I'm going to come back
and I'm going to visit him i'm going to
stop by as part of the night hacking
tour i mentioned earlier and we'll do
we'll do some more grizzy hacking in
your in your hometown can you can you
pop to the j fennel
yeah alright and I just wanted to to get
a quick shout out to the the J pedal
folks so the PDF verte portion of the of
the talk or the slide portion of the
talk was done with j pedal using pdfs
inside of javafx and they have an open
source solution for this and they also
have a commercial product around this as
well which has some additional features
but it's a it's a nice library for
taking advantage of doing pdfs inside of
your job FX application and the guys the
guys mark stephens and the other guys
