next round of scrip Wow how many of you
have been to the script ball before I
see some familiar faces all right okay
and how many of you knew just want to
make sure how many of you are asleep no
that's good so what we're going to do
here is you know change it up a little
bit okay it's going to be a very fun
oriented session but a lot of content we
have really the Guru's of the respective
languages that run really well on the
JVM and they're going to do two rounds
and at the end you the audience I gotta
pick the winner okay hey all right I'm
gonna do some you know I'm going to make
some stupid comments but but the
speaker's themselves you know will will
also say you know big things we will
also say stupid things again and
essentially what they'll do is you know
we are going to make it like a you know
election drowned or something like that
so there will be a rebuttal ground for
each of the speakers okay so we have two
rounds at the end of the third round we
are gonna pick a winner okay last year I
chicken out and I picked two okay but
this year we're going to keep clapping
until they pick one winner okay so it's
up to you guys soon yeah all right so I
am are you guys ready right this is
Parliament these guys might need to go
up because people can't see them sitting
down talking all right yeah that's there
they'll get up and do something all
right okay cuz cuz bigs a good-looking
guy and the people the back want to see
d okay so my name is rock is raghavan
srinivasan I'm not going to say more you
go by rags yeah there's my hat you know
a good question we'll talk about it
later so I'm not gonna introduce myself
but we want to color represents
a next request I'm standing there we go
oh yeah I my name is dick wall I've been
working as Karma for about almost four
years now partner with Bill venez
escalates software where we do skarmer
training and consulting and ghost karma
so it's my screen out are we doing this
now or are we doing the intro intro
sorry all right the general of the next
representing gob is nick williams dr
nick williams inside out yeah my name is
dr. blooms i work at an engine yard we
primarily where a hosting company or
platform as a service of that fancy new
word that you and the java community
haven't needed to know about for mostly
Ruby and PHP and so one of the things
we've been working with is jayru because
it just makes Ruby application so much
more awesome but first we have to
convince you to build Ruby applications
so the next half hour that's what we're
going to do so gentlemen to the right is
an embezzler represented closure so
fedra our group on where we use all
kinds of different java technologies
java groovy closure jruby i think most
of the most of the things here actually
but you know closes my favorite all
right and last but not the least
representing buoys Kim LaForge
thank you so I'm young and I've been
working on grief for the past eight or
nine years and i'm working for spring
source don't hesitate to comments high
on our booth and well i'll be
representin groovy obviously all right
so gentlemen you know the rules right
but just for the benefit of the audience
we have about four minutes for each
round okay so I'm gonna want them the
gauntlets in a series of emails between
the screw that number has changed seven
times all right Nick you have a problem
with me hi so it's going to be four
minutes you know stretchable up to five
minutes but essentially I will give them
a warning at three minutes and then any
of you speakers will have a opportunity
to either comment compliments are
criticized or do whatever you want you
know about the other the speaker just
reserved you know your judgments for the
best because you will be given only to
okay or maybe three all right so one air
show four minutes each round the first
round is the language around the second
round is the community around so pip pay
attention and you will pick the winner
okay so just as you show of hands you
know how many of you have already picked
a winner you guys get out
alright let's get started you ready I am
ready alright representing skala dig
well let me make sure I get the right
testing test oh it works well scary okay
so every year I represents Carla of the
scripting Bowl it's always interesting
because I don't really consider scholar
to be a scripting language as such it
can do it but it's the only statically
typed language that's represented here
so every year I do the same thing which
is to emphasize the scripting like
nature that scholar can have so this
year we're going to look at something
that has long been the domain of
languages like Ruby and rails we're
going to set up a website real time so
I'm going to use the play framework for
this i'm going to say play new I have
nothing just in this directory I have no
J 1 PR creative long as they play nu J 1
PR and you're probably wondering what
this is I've just created the
application and made it a scarlet
project j1 PR is short for java one
party review i figured that was a good
thing to have at javaone so that next
year everybody can benefit from your
wisdom of which were the best parties so
i created that i'm going to change into
the directory and i just say play run
and that's going to grind away a little
bit it does take a few seconds to
download the the internet the first time
but i will show you some of the code
while we're waiting so very simply it's
a Model View controller setup play
there's a application that sits at the
top of everything that's your main main
place main point of entry index is just
an action in this case and that's what
gets hit when you go to the homepage
I've got an HTML page that's also very
simple there's a wrapper around it that
does a bit more so you'll see that in
the eye candy that comes up
configuration file and the routes and
basically that's the application that's
been created so if we have a look at
this thing now it's running on localhost
9000
and hopefully I see what it's doing down
here yeah it's cranking away and there
we go so your new application is ready
we've already got an application up and
running very rails like you might say
now what's really cool about this though
is again remembering that skarmer is a
statically typed language is compiled if
I can come in here you can see my page
it says your new application is ready
well my self-esteem is a little low
today I think it was the party last
night so I'm going to say you look
fabulous today and just save that and
let's come over here and reload Wow
how's that for a statically typed
language so what's going on here is that
and while it while I'm talking to make
the most of the time I'm going to run my
first script this is the scripting bowl
so in order to save time i actually
created a script called cheat which will
copy a bunch of holes open but is my
next version of this application don't
don't worry i'll dig into it so what's
actually going on here is that play
embeds the skarmer compiler inside of it
and it uses the fast form of the Scala
compiler which is aggressive at
optimizing away what at work that it
doesn't need to do so it as as time goes
on this gets faster and faster and you
get scripting like turn around for
developing your web application and
throwing balloons three minutes okay
throughout this application I won't be
restarting the web server at any point
this will all be live changes so okay
let's see what this is made of my
application now i'll talk about what's
going on here but the first thing is
I've now created an object model and
amongst that I've created an evolution
sequel script and when I hit the site it
says you don't have a database for this
I've found one I found a evolution
script do you want to run this so I'm
just going to say apply the script and
then i can actually this is my
application running on the same thing
and i can put in the java posse is the
organizer of the party i'm going to give
it a 5 this year because there was no
buff try harder next year
yeah it is my fault actually so anyway
that's that's not the code now not a lot
of extra code here and I think it's
pretty readable so we've got a new form
Party forum where we've got an organizer
a rating and a review we've gotten an
action to actually add the form when the
post is submitted our index HTML now has
the form elements put into it and
there's some helpers it's not pretty but
it's functional we added just a default
database driver so these two lines here
are new just to add the database driver
and then we've added one new route which
is our ad party post request and that's
really all the all the changes that I've
got the other things are the sequel code
which is the thing that runs the schemer
evolution and then data access ER and
this is this is a lot of code I'm going
to come back to this one in the second
second scripting thingy when I have more
time so that wraps it up for my first
part of this I will hand it on to thank
all right ogre dick so gentlemen any
comments questions just bowled over well
speechless that's what I was going for I
can see you're absolutely awed by the
academic a statically typed language can
be that reactive idea minds me also a
frameworks like Grails oh I completely
agree I'm showing that we can do it too
oh I was surprising to God by administer
compile their exactly and and actually
seriously it does come down to most
changes take two or three seconds to
actually show up it's it's a fast
enough cycle that it's not painful
what's a so for small classes um it's so
the way the increment no that's
seriously to answer the question the way
the incremental compiler works it is
very aggressive at not re doing any work
so it will actually avoid even
recompiling
entire class if it can get away with
just recompiling a single method in
there so it really is working hard at
keeping that time down so transitive
doesn't take additional time than right
usually usually okay moving on um Nick
you ready I'm ready God dhoni so the the
reason you're here is because you want
to see jruby and I appreciate that and
it's really nice to be show up and and
bless the others with some attendance
and I think that's right I the I just
want to give us over the status or one
of the powerful things about JRuby is
that you get access to now the others
might be able to tell me this is this is
not correct but I mean one of the things
jruby brings is all of the Ruby universe
so you've got all the wonderful java
stuff that you already know but then as
it says here 45 thousand different
projects and gems that people have put
up all versions over time the we're
almost cracked a billion downloads so
every time someone goes in production
every time someone creates a new app
downloads a new gym and i don't know if
that's good better and different so i
went back to last year where i actually
showed a very similar slide which which
i would never normally have such
preparation but i feel like i'm actually
really prepared this time and it
actually is tripled since then so in the
last year it's really impressive the
amount of new projects that are coming
out in that Ruby community so one of the
great things about this come in JRuby is
that you get all these innovative ideas
and new spaces that people going to and
combining them with obviously the
wonderful integration that the JVM or
the Java universe has vice versa if I go
to a ruby conference I talk about here
the incredible integration that we get
through java the tool that we have is
for describing absolutely what you want
without there being any variation to it
it's called bundler and allows you to
both say in a sort of high-level this is
the projects i want but when you freeze
this going to production it actually
explicitly describes everything you get
so when you go from development
production there are no description see
what
ever and because we you know in the Ruby
community we have a couple of different
ways to go into production one is which
is what I'm going to show you how to
create a while file the other reason
just shift the entire source code and
then in production it gets compiled
three minutes really simple way of
turning it into a normal Ruby app into a
gel Ruby app there's a couple of small
differences this so if you've ever heard
of rails and everyone is going to do a
demonstration of how wonderful their
thing is compared to rail so I don't
need to do that i'm going to show you as
a micro framework which is really quite
popular which has been copied into other
frame where it's called Sinatra it also
shows really nice syntax that you get
and then obviously the reason you're
here is because all these scripting
languages have nice syntax and syntax is
what makes us as developers feel good
about what we're doing and comprehend it
really simple way of you know as you
already know packaging and parallel each
running each in parallel each different
app so i just want to show you and I'm
not going to pretend to type look my
hands are in the air this is the magic
the JRuby has it's called scripting so
what we're doing here is this quickly
pulling together a really small micro
app and so this bundle gem file
describing what dependencies we want and
then pulling those down bit like maven
you can actually bring in Java jars and
describe them in this bundle experience
there's a mapping between Ruby and the
maven universe and you can sort of
pretend that a maven package is a ruby
gem now we're just going to build out a
real one you know one page script I
think it's great to demonstrate the play
firmer I think it's a really impressive
piece of technology sometimes you do
just want to create little things little
endpoints a little script that perhaps
you run inside with the rest of your
main app and can talk to it locally if
it produced a little endpoint and this
if you could just pretend that this
could be talking to your database this
could be talking to the rest of your
Java wrap and so Sinatra is a really
powerful thing to know about the
downside is perhaps you have to agree
with me that JRuby is the best and but I
mean we could all do that so at the end
when rag says who's the best you say
JRuby and I will laugh at groovy who
normally wins
yeah I can I can see that Daniel you
prepare do you know this time as
compared to the last year right I think
there's a spectacular isn't it are
really really simple way of getting a
while file loading up you can run it
standalone obviously as a wife I could
throw it into tom cat or row any of the
other ones jboss etc so right thank you
very much for letting me have a turn and
now I appreciate the opportunity to let
the others have their turn all right
good job so gentlemen any comments yeah
good um yeah I i hear you on Sinatra and
I have actually used a very similar
framework in Scala called scarlet aura
which again does a very similar job of
kind of light weight just put something
out on the web so as you actually think
in all seriousness those libraries are
fantastic I've used them for all sorts
of stuff yeah i think that idea of a
little micro thing you express things as
a great for just you know i think most
languages most run times have you know
flavors or like that and they're really
resolve let them go about them I can't
believe you guys are being nice to each
other we love each other man look I
don't know IAM any questions fall no it
isn't nothing particular all right yeah
it's milan moving on to the next one
which is closure and aaron let me make
sure I get the right one up there that's
an work let's connect it up does it work
here goes all right
I said pleasures good attitude we can do
this all day alright so what I want to
talk to you about today because we all
have web frameworks and and they're all
really cool is something completely
different I want to talk to you as about
music is data and visualization is data
basically art as data and code closure
has a couple of libraries called over
town and quill overtone as a wrapper
around a library called super collider
which is a audio synthesis library and
much in the vein of the processing
library there's quill which does video
and graphics OpenGL rendering things
like that and so I want to show you how
to create kind of live art with closure
so i'll do another chest here make sure
everything is working here come and come
and come hopefully get louder
it sounds like the light bikes I'm trong
it is but it's really the THX them ah ok
but unfortunate the mics love quiet so
actually this this bunch of gobbledygook
you see before you is actually the
makings of what what you here's the THX
noise when you when you boot that up and
your hair play this is the overtone
representation which is just basically
the supercollider representation portage
/ gin that actually makes the THX noise
so you see actually you just go down
straight to the the saw waves and all
the other elements of making making
audio and get you free juice it that way
and so that's all good and well but you
can also take other things and sample
them so you can take audio files waves
whatever you want to play them back
create more interesting noises maybe
I'll bought my volume up a little bit
just so we can there we go look at that
so we can make these really weird funky
noises and this is like all of the same
traffic from yeah we know we can get
this really cool stuff going so this is
very enterprise-e no electronic music
demo would be good without some dubstep
so what I've got here is actually
basically a bunch of different
frequencies sounds noises that all play
together to make myself some dubstep and
I've got a nice low beats per minute
thing but you know I think that I might
want to speed it up just a little bit
and you know get closer to dance party I
maybe add some Skrillex into it we could
actually get Ricky like a dance party
going on and I start making some live
music so that's a couple bit
visualization is also really important
three minutes so what I'm going to do is
bring in quill and so behind my screen
it's a transparent window I have this
this quilt session started already so
i'm going to show you my sphere my
spirit is cool and it's an opengl and
all i really have for my sphere is just
a few different things are basically the
math to make us fear as all it really is
but you see this really cool thing
called vault app i'm actually tapping
the volume from overtone
so I'm going to make my sphere dance so
if we come back here and maybe we'll try
let's see come back here and try our
noises again let's get some coins my
spear is dancing so we really want to
make this work we can actually make a
little java one dance party let's let's
make our beats for a minute even higher
now and now we have audio you have
visual and we can have Java one dance
party so now i can take message to start
evolving it and really what is done here
just out with a blank screen and start
with nothing at all and code this all
live right you start with small noises
you have all the noises you have all the
pictures and you end up making just live
art right this is a really cool thing
it's actually quite a few people doing
this you might see slides all over the
internet people doing these live
performances and making this art but you
know if you don't want the the other
stuff you can actually make kind of a
static background so let me hide my
sphere and do this right so I could have
a static background this won't respond
to the the beat but we could actually
change the frame rate on this so we
might want to say your art of time I'm
sorry they made me make me I'm sorry but
you said you can you can respond you can
change the frame weights around you
might you might make your frame rates
the function of your beats per minute
and make sure that kind of your your
visuals line up with your audio but we
have this nice this nice kind of
framework to do this stuff so go out and
make really cool art with closure
there's all kinds i think great things
you can do with closure but sometimes
it's fun just kind of detour off from
the generic enterprise web framework
stuff and do something kind of out there
cool
I just heard that pearl jam is not going
to show up tonight because they just
can't compete with what can I say all
right moving on any questions I babe I
have one comment which is that I think
erin has created this new art form it's
going to be like deadmau5 on stage for
people as long as they don't mind lots
and lots of / ends another thing their
code hugs they're just hugs for your kid
okay yeah um how many pounds really
undercooked you know actually much
actually view I think if you look at
some of the other code you might find
less per ends there just in a different
place rearranged I just put them in
different spot that's a different
different different for her yeah that's
all do many comments if I could last you
for the people who here I did I did a
demo the second talker gave was was
given that 2 of Ruby's biggest successes
with groupon and livingsocial I showed
how you could how you two could go home
and build like a group coupon site and
get rich since one of my learner's
panelists chose to work for groupon i do
find amusing that he would then go and
talk about something novelty like not
selling coupons which is obviously a
core business you know there was no
question for the panelist he's
interested in winning the script ball
yeah moving on Jim and gooey yep we got
four minutes thank you if you okay
that's me you hear me well okay cool so
I'm gonna speak about groovy tune to in
some more details this afternoon so join
me for that session afterwards so just
wanted to make a little out for my other
session so for this first round i'm
going to show you several aspects of the
language for domain-specific languages
the new features regarding static type
checking and static compilation in
groovy despite being a dynamic language
you can statically compiled stuff as
well and still also
dynamic nature with the Ruby be others
so who's playing who's playing chess
here ok a few you also you probably know
that notation all ready for you know
expressing the the moves on the on the
chessboard so in this example I'm going
to try to create a DSL a bit more
verbose so this those moves there
generate that kind of just bored states
and I'm going to show you how you can
create plain English sentences using the
dynamic other the domain-specific
language capabilities of groovy so it
some way more verbose version but you
can imagine that apply to your business
domain and so this kind of calls method
calls can be made by using what we call
come and change so it's a way of
dropping dots and parents so some
languages like parentheses but some
others like to drop them and it's a way
of cheap shot ah yeah I never forgive
everyone and so when you see something
like that pull request on get up it's
actually equivalent to mixing method
names and parameters so you have an
alternation of method names and of
parameters you can also use groovies
named parameters which is in the end
equivalent to that can of coke so it's
really changed method calls but where
you can remove dots and Terrance and you
can also use named parameters you know
check that margarita tastes good that
reads pretty well and this is a named
parameter okay and on top of that so
when you create a DSL you may wish that
your users are a warrant when they make
some mistakes on typos and things like
that and remember we added the static
type checking to groovy todaro so i
won't go into details much there and i'm
also mentioning that you can also
statically compile your code to gain the
same performance as java bytecode
and yeah some numbers with Daddy
compilation but I'll go deeper into that
in my session this afternoon so let me
show you some code ok so what I want to
do is be able to define such sentences
there so I've created several things
like some ways of representing the
squares of my chessboard the different
piece x colors of the pc's etc and
different other classes for the piece
for the different moves and so on and
also how to define the initial state of
the chessboard and end and how do i do
the the actual moves it's because I have
some methods like white and black are
methods which take piece type as
parameters which returned yet another
move and which I can call from so where
is the move class the the from method
and to method and in the end I'm able to
call things like that like that white
poem that's a method call on which which
return something on which I go from E to
which which is something on which I go
to e4 ok and then anomalous ok thank you
and then another aspect is that I'm
going to use that in the end the the
Builder which is a way of representing
hierarchical data structures so if i run
my little whoops my little script here
up reach sdsl it's going to generate
that so let me reload well it's the same
one so it's already the same one so I've
got some CSS and so on and it's
generating that kind of chess board and
what I forgot to say is is that as you
noticed there perhaps there's a an
annotation here called tide checked
which does the type checking so if I
made a mistake there like eeyore
something or yeah whatever when I try to
run that or I should compile first but
it's up it should be complaining oh yeah
that's not the right place well anyway I
think I'm running out of time that so
you'll get a compile errors for when you
make some mistakes so I'll have to
figure out why it didn't do that and
then you can see it so back to the
slides you can see the hierarchical
structure of the HTML thanks to a nested
method calls taking closures which in
the end generate the same kind of
hierarchical structure and that's it so
you'll notice the Java friendly syntax
like the how I define the in arms and so
on that looks like Java it's very easy
to create domain-specific languages for
with groovy for your own business domain
and you can even type check your dsl's
and you can also get java like
performance view static compilation as
well and that's it for my part thank you
that kinda reminds me of the first
program I wrote in Fortran you know when
I did the night store I guess just like
fashion you know computers also it comes
back around in 20 years or so anyway
Greg's I think it's a bit rough to
associate greeley with with for train I
think that's rough Tosh you should
ignore what he said not vote for it
anyway okay I didn't mean that any other
useful comments no I I just want to ask
if from writing chess dsl's makes you
any more popular in high school than
being in the Chess Club makes you that's
a good question music does it does it
get does it get you beaten up at chess
club all right you guys ready for the
second oh yeah everybody LAX door
alright um gentleman are you all ready
yeah all right let's bring it bring it
to closure here oh I mean there's no I
need the screen ya later x ok so what
are you guys thinking my application so
far really hospital again us begin what
do you think of my what do you think of
my application safer personally I think
it sucks ass I mean look at that which
would you use a site like that I liked
it better when it was telling me that I
looked fabulous today but anyway this is
the community round so before I start
anything else I'm going to do something
very quickly here which is to say i git
push heroku I'm doing this because it
takes a little while to get going on
this so then I'll keep talking ok so
coming back to this like any good
software engineer in the time in between
I've done a little bit of work because
you know you don't always wait for the
demo to get stuff done one of the things
I did was checked in my code to get
because I didn't want a loser because
frankly wouldn't you want to keep a gem
like that and anyway as I also
initialized a hero coo what they call a
what do they call that thing the Dino a
Heroku Dino which is a lot home for
and at the moment it's actually pushing
my application up to Heroku so it's
going to take a little while it does
take some time for her okay to do its
thing in the meantime another thing that
our application was brilliant effort was
you could put data into it we can see
that application now being a kind of
community guy I didn't want to just put
a list of stuff up on a webpage I wanted
a whole JSON back-end server thing that
people could hit and find out in their
own programs what the best party to go
to so I created this new method called
list parties and it uses a library and
this is one of the great things about
scala that you really do come to
appreciate is for a statically typed
language the amount of effort that the
libraries go to to make you comfortable
is pretty staggering and i'm using this
library called dirksen which was written
by coda Hale it's based on the jackson
library and what i can do now is take a
list of parties that I've got this is
from my database handler I'm taking the
list of all parties sorting it by 10
minus the rating so I'm getting the
ratings in best to worst for the parties
and then I can just say okay and then
generate the JSON of that list of
parties has application JSON this is a
good chance to demonstrate something
else here which is that I am not using
an ide for this I really wanted you guys
to have the Fremen arresting the full
scripting experience so no IDs allowed
here so I'm using a text editor for this
if I if I deliberately make a mistake in
this and go back out to here and reload
it actually gives me a compile error in
the in the web so I can go straight to
that and fix the fix the problem it says
ask is not a member of simple results
string so let's change that back to AZ
and run it again okay so let's see how
our it's launching so we're almost there
so what I've been doing is I've actually
put this stuff up on to Heroku while
we've been talking so now we're in the
in the community space anyone can use my
application so here's
my is my URL let's get it going on there
okay oh I could do that oh yeah you know
I'm going to do this because I'm not
sure which browser it's going to open
and I'm not sure what's in that browser
that it's going to open so i'm going to
keep keep to my script so this there we
go okay so here's my wonderful
application that i can put some data in
it and say scripting bowl it was a 10
because scholar one this year that's
fantastic so yeah that was a 10 out of
10 for me and there you go oh there is
no oh there we go just took a just took
a little second there to compile
something behind the scenes so there's
my application now I got to say I still
think that kind of sucks and in the best
minutes in investor demo style here is
one I prepared earlier that sucks less
so I got a little bit of help with this
one this is my pimped up version of the
party thing for one thing I can hit
party on dude I've got some validation
in here now some HD html5 validation so
I had to fill it in and I can say
scripting bowl the rating is 10 again
because amazingly enough scale of one
yet again wins yay and hopefully there
we go so there is my demo 02 deployed
Heroku application in Scala without a
single web restart in 10 minutes
actually eight minutes I think I you
know you're losing point if you say
eight minutes right you should say four
minutes well there are four plus four
yeah all right okay
all right any comment gentlemen can we
can say what I come in yeah does anybody
want to comment yeah we can open it up
to you know if you can keep a chart no
comments Wow just checking I honestly
don't know if that's a good or a bad
yeah I'm moving on um Nick you ready yep
all right let's go I was just checking
some of these submissions to your app
and I noticed that that's a couple of
people of learning ford a river which is
great i invented snick No so I wanted to
take an opportunity to teach you
something so we had actually the busy
thing was pretty cool for all those
smartass remarks I made but if you're
running production systems and more and
more people are in charge of at least
the developed part of being responsible
for your thing running production it's
not just throw it to someone else and
say here's some fun for you so being
aware of what your systems doing so you
can code it differently is really
important so logging is a certain thing
so something that's come out the last
couple years and is growing popularity
the people who can't afford to buy spunk
is logstash who can't afford to buy
splunk who doesn't know what's blanc is
that's because you can't afford it so
it's better that way you see you're
already happier and so I wanted to show
you a thing called logstash which which
obviously in this context runs on java
and JVM has been written in JRuby
gabbana witches I used to be PHP app is
now a ruby app running that looks kind
of like the splunk interface for a rough
for searching your logs and this is so
what this system is is for all the
machines that you've got the service of
guy running a little little agent on it
to collect logs and events that are
happening to put them through into
elasticsearch and then allow you to come
back later on and look for interesting
things that are going on really get an
understanding of how your systems
performing it or not if that's the case
a couple of visualizations i said thats
a log stash does come with an attempt a
user interface and so cabanas really
quite nice and log stash not so much but
the point of log stash is more about the
collection of events and putting them
into elasticsearch so just so and again
really i'm doing this mostly due to
something so you go away you've said yes
JRuby excellent i voted for them because
the guy was just very funny although a
bit egotistical and then on the last log
stash they look really interesting the
music thing not so much and so defense
could come from anywhere logs you could
have middle middle sections like
reticent and queuing systems the the
core genius i think is elastic search
mean you theoretically is plug-and-play
you could put other things in the last
exert really is a nice piece of
equipment for you to have and different
ways for you to view it so what's
interesting is why he chose ruby now
that for the two different projects
because well the log stash it was just
the thing he liked writing at the time
and so that was kind of his choice the
the cabana was actually written in PHP
and he ended up rewriting an in part
because part of that that'd be caused a
log stash so he could get more
contributions because you're what you
write it in can affect yeah for all the
what we talked about the choice that you
choose the how you choose to write your
app is going to affect who's going to
come along and work on it either for
employees or if it's open source we're
going to get contribution so that
language choice important so he chose to
rewrite and rubies
get more contributions three and a half
minutes do we have with them or another
crap out of me every time you do that so
loud just run naked or something I'll
get the gist naked rags three minutes
all right but why you chose jruby which
is perhaps an interesting questions
because of all the things we know in
Ruby you don't get real threats you get
this of funny threads so what you get
you get real threads except you can't
run Ruby at the same time so whatever
that's used before so jruby is a really
great for that but the the debugging
tools are just brilliant that you've got
and one of the things he was able to do
when he put it in Jeremy was also build
a monolithic red jar file which included
everything for a demo essentially which
included elasticsearch so you can put
this run it and get the gist of what's
going on and sort of then buy into the
whole system and then start wasting time
trying to set it up and the java
universe again it's you get this hybrid
of libraries and that you know some of
the libraries were better again so i'm
trying to sell you on log stash don't be
under any confusion what I'm trying to
do I think large stash is fantastic and
you know save a truck ton of cash and
get a lot of appreciation of what your
systems doing twenty thousand events a
second on a single the amazonian one
extra large that equates perhaps 22 to
24 thousand dollars a year of elves
Blanc you know fees plus equipment so
really is a great piece of software and
a great thing that someone's built and
being open source obviously you can
contribute to it though you will need to
first vote for JRuby and then right Ruby
and but you'll be happy about it and I
really think your life would be better
for it and yeah so quick real simple go
there and always be keep on the lookout
for new and interesting tools that make
you better because that's the profession
we're in partly about language choice
was also the things we run around our
production systems and so I think this
is a great one hopefully you have a play
with it all right they need any comments
on the demo more clapping
I hang on hang on stop stop all right I
I apologize that wasn't definitive
enough you weren't sure it's time for
clapping I'm going to do it again I'm
going to be more definitive and we go
Alice all right we good for that we can
do this again we're professional
attendant in its people well I mean you
paid to come so that your professional
all right there are any any comments
from the gentleman my music has logs can
you log those Nick yes yes you could I
don't know if you could play back the
noise wow look at that probably good
great that'd be fun all right anything
else all right let's move on to the next
which is Aaron enclosure or any more
music coming up no more music so the
things I skipped over because I wanted
to get through the demo part was to
actually explain what closure was for
those of you who may not have ever seen
it before closure actually is a dialect
of lisp that runs on the JVM so it
actually takes its roots from common
lisp most of the influence come in the
in the style of list comes from common
lisp it includes a common loews macro
system or something similar and a lot of
the choices that were made inside of
common list versus scheme but since that
doesn't all matter all that much the
real interesting parts of closure are
actually aveda structures closure
chooses immutability by default and has
persistent data structures so this is
actually the foundation for a lot of
really awesome work especially when
you're working in current environments
there's a lot of things you don't have
to think about anymore closure also
includes software transactional memory
so just you know that next step of being
able to deal with immutable data when
you have to and make the right choices
but what really what really packages it
all together is actually harnessing the
power of Lisp right I don't know if
you've ever heard if you've ever worked
in list before or worked with somebody
who worked in Lisp in the past they're
always going on and on about the
expressive Nisshin the syntax of list or
the lack of syntaxin list there's some
really amazing things you can do there
and when you couple that with the jet
the JVM interop or the Java interop you
can use libraries many of any of these
languages as they can consume stuff
enclosure you really get this really
nice power of abstraction over top of
anything you're doing your end up being
able to create these wonderful
domain-specific languages are actually
even new languages
this book gives you the power of the
compiler kind of at your fingertips you
can actually kind of with Mac system and
everything else writes your own many
languages inside of your programs and
quite often you do to kind of get the
most the highest level of expression you
can out of it and that idea of
abstraction kind of follows all the way
through the library's enclosure it's
kind of the idea of composable
abstractions and really what this is
what I showed you today was just a set
of composable abstractions these are all
built on closures core primitives but
what you don't see end of the hood is
all the stuff that's happening with that
music is highly concurrent there's all
kinds of things happening behind the
scenes and the author of overtone
actually just took advantage of what
closure had to do all of this work he
had to think almost not at all really to
make this work it was just a very small
amount of effort to coordinate cuz
closure to the work for it so there's
some really really powerful things that
you can get from kind of diving and
closure and reaching in and and
exploring what it has to offer these
libraries expend out everywhere right
it'd be practical libraries follow too
we saw Sinatra there's the same same
copies their enclosure you have ring at
your core you have composure the same
thing as kind of Sinatra there are any
rails clones but three minutes you know
there's that part of the the web layer
is different because we have closure
script right we have the front end when
now closure compiles to JavaScript there
are other backends now that Buell added
closure will compile to lua compiles to
objective-c to gambit scheme which
compiles to see to Python all these new
backends you can actually write closure
code and haven't spit out a whole bunch
of other languages so the closures grab
project kind of moved it forward and
that was something that was really
interesting I think I demoed it last
year if you were here for blast your
script full demo enclosure script and
now there's been a lot of advancement so
that combination of being able to write
closure and actually all of your layers
is really compelling and being able to
share that data across the wire because
close your data structures can actually
travel as a wire protocol so you get
some really powerful abstractions when
you have the closure data structures
travel straight over the wire this is a
reader built in so these the community
enclosure has its young right it's only
a few years old there's been a stack of
books lots of great learning material
and just some really amazing people that
have shown up
we have embedded prologue enclosure just
all kinds of really great stuff that's
come along to kind of change the way
your programming not just make it a
little bit better but really change
change everything and get a lot more
power all right so any comments on the
demo no demo the general haven't already
did you notice the subliminal messages
while the sphere was moving that's right
anything pregnancies have you how hard
is it to if you're not used to
functional programming how long is the
type before you become a functional
programmer and you can think and soul
that's a great question so I think
functional programming is just a you
know there is definitely some different
stuff there I think dick will also agree
you know Scala has a lot of functional
concepts too it's a change in pace you
can learn closure and not learn all a
functional programming and still be
effective in closure but to be maximally
effective enclosure adding that
functional style that functional
thinking helps improve your programs an
awful lot and helps in your abstractions
awful lot too if you learning closure
should you be led anywhere near a
production code base or as only bad
things going to happen no I actually
think it's ok you know especially if
you're working in smaller teams it's all
right i think the abstractions give you
a lot of leeway you can definitely shoot
yourself in the foot as you can with any
of the languages but yeah you can you
can get into a production system on day
one and actually be effective even if
you're learning all right moon on you
guys ready do Oh didn't you know after
the last demo here right you know please
don't leave the room until we crown a
winner all right I'm keeping track and
I've asked the monitors to seal the door
ok the over games outside or active now
do not leave so I'll continue with my
example from the the first round but
this time telling you about well the
community community aspect of groovy
which is essentially its ecosystem
there's a very rich and major ecosystem
of projects and two pretty prominent and
successful projects in that ecosystem
our grad
all built solution and Spock for your
testing needs so the groovy ecosystem
some of the most well-known projects
like Grails Griffin etc and we'll just
focus on grotto and spoke phone now so
growth yeah first Gretel so it's a bit
of automation solution using groovy so
you write your build definition using
groovy it's got the flexibility of and
you can script if you will anything and
it's got all the dependency management
so there are some typos and conventional
approach of maven so it's the best of
both worlds without the worse of those
two words anyway and they are it's also
a very extensible platform because they
are plugins for different things you can
use grotto although it's a groovy dsl
for your bill you can use grotto for
building your Skala or C++ project there
are some very handy tools like the
rapper you can define create a rapper
round build solutions so that people who
haven't installed gretel on their
machines can actually lonesome batch
script to go to the bills etc etc and in
big because of its flexibility gravels
been adopted by key well there are also
some lots of companies using it but I'm
just mentioning the the the open source
projects for example the the Android
project is adopting grotto so that you
can build the different flavors and
different kind of deliverables of your
Android projects other projects I have
that hibernate the spring framework and
obviously growing girls have moved to
grad all things too well for for its
flexibility if you want to get started
with growl you just need a small groovy
script so I'm going to use the groovy
plugin for compiling groovy code I'm
defining the dependency Luka
make a mechanism I'm going to fetch the
dependency from maven central three
merits and I define the the dependencies
and up there was it it's here so there
are many tasks that I can launch and for
example just to show you so earlier in
my so these are all the things you can
run and earlier my mistake was that I
had forgotten to saved to say the the
changes i had made that's why you didn't
get a compilation error but for example
i'm going to launch gravel bill tool to
build this project and here i made a
typo because i remove the note the
number of the the square and it's going
to tell me because it statically typed
that okay there are some some errors the
this variable is undeclared so it's a
compile-time error and not a runtime
error and well okay that's pretty much
it I need to fix the error before moving
on up to e4 and then the other thing I
wanted to speak about so no xml etc and
the other interesting project I wanted
to mention was spot for your testing and
specification needs for groovy for java
projects etc you can write your
specifications in groovy and also adopts
the the principles of the behavior
driven driven development well the BDD
approach it's fully compatible with
Janet so you can run that in your IDs in
your build tools etc and what's nice is
it's very expressive for example in
groovy we adopted the feature which was
from Spock which is the what we call
power assertions or power a cert when
you have some asserts you have a very
nice tree view of the things which are
going wrong and you see the the values
of each sub expressions came up and and
the last thing I'm going to show you the
this example for real that's so what we
call data tables
so where's my test it's here so here i
define so when we do something okay i'm
going to to do the the virus moves on
the chessboard then i want to check
those expectations and you can also
define the values of the different
variables which appear there's four
square is here and peace is there etc
and when you run that up rattle test I'm
almost done so I think I made one or did
I fix the test or not let me see okay
compiling and testing I think I the yeah
so you see there's a failure when I go
to the nice HTML report here it's going
to show the the nice power assert and
well you see that instead of I had to be
a bishop but it was a pound that I had
moved so i have this this kind of
outputs and that's it i think so for a
nice readable test and you can use spot
for your java project you don't need to
have groovy in your production system
you can use spoken groovy for your test
for example thank you and that's it
thank you all right before we crown the
winner you know I just really want to
thank all the gentleman here you know
they put in a lot of preparation so a
big round four
we we even managed to do it without any
bloodshed this year so yeah we're not
over yet it's not over yet that's true
there are only four of us this year all
right so let's all right let's let's
start from the left okay I'll from the
right for you guys ok so gluey and give
how many people died Adam enclosure
all right all right let me more on the
dick dawg Nick and Jay Ruby yeah pretty
good pretty good but not quite as the
other two so I'm coming first of the
losers at the moment I thick and scholar
it seems like i have a problem this way
at this time it may be a three-way tie
all right let's yeah that does not
surprise me at all the other side all
right let's go back again from the other
side Dickens kala
ok i had an enclosure
I'm sorry out on your cried okay all
right dear man grohe
okay with my completely unscientific
evaluation I think it's dick wall and
Scala yeah
thank you thank you all for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
