hi this is Matt with the Oracle
Primavera curriculum team today we're
going to look at using Oracle Enterprise
Manager to apply a patch to Primavera p6
e ppm Enterprise Manager or e/m can be
used for monitoring p6 servers
starting with p6 15.2 eeehm can also be
used for applying patches to p6 in order
to follow the instructions in this video
the integration between a.m. and p6 must
already be established with the p6
server added as a target host in
Enterprise Manager you also need to be
running e/m version 12c have the patch
saved to the p6 server and have an
account in e/m that can create and
execute library and activity jobs to
apply a patch you must create a library
job in Enterprise Manager go to
enterprise job and select library here
the list of existing library jobs is
displayed once you have created a job to
apply a patch you can use it as a
template to do so use the create like
button to create a new job by copying an
existing one to create a new job ensure
OS command is selected in the create
library job list then click go on the
general tab of the create OS command
library job window enter a name and
optionally a description for the job
ensure host is selected as the target
type then click the Add button select
the p6 server where the patch is to be
applied then click select on the
parameters tab change the command type
to script scripts are provided with the
documentation for a patch enter the
script for the appropriate operating
system in the OS script filled with the
required details filled in on the
credentials tab select or enter the
credentials that will be used to connect
to the server select the named option to
choose credentials that are already
present in
or use the new option to enter new
credentials when finished click save to
library on the job library page a
confirmation is displayed that the
library job has been created to run the
job and execute the upgrade select the
job and click Submit be sure to select
the target host then click Submit again
a confirmation is displayed that the job
is running click on the name of the job
to view the status expand the details
section to view information about the
job as it is running use the refresh
button to update the results any errors
will be reported here or a confirmation
will be displayed when the upgrade is
complete thank you for watching this
