of the three weekly lessons about Oracle
yet in this part you'll learn how jet
supports internationalization and
globalization of jet applications you
will be shown how to configure your jet
applications so that they can be used in
a variety of lockhouse and international
user environments jet ships with support
for multiple different languages and
locales built in the workflow of
internationalizing jet applications
consists of three steps firstly
understand internationalization and
localization support in jet secondly
internationalized and localize a jet
application and finally add the
translations to a jet application to
understand internationalization and
localization support in jet be aware
that internationalization is the process
of designing software so that it can be
adapted to various languages and regions
easily cost-effectively and in
particular without engineering changes
to the software meanwhile at the same
time localization l10n is the usage of
locale specific language and constructs
at runtime oracle has adopted the
industry standards for
internationalization and l10n
such as the world wide web consortium
recommendations unicode technologies and
internet Engineering Task Force IETF
specifications to enable support for the
various languages writing systems and
regional conventions of the world jet
includes Oracle national language
support in LS translation support for
the languages listed in the following
table
specifically cows are defined by the
IETF bcp 47 standards you can find the
supported locale bundles in a jet
application as shown here you can
configure your application to use jets
built-in support for
internationalization and localization
formatting for numbers dates and times
is defined by the unicode common locale
repository' cldr jet includes a
translation bundle that translates
strings generated by jet components into
all supported languages you can add your
own translation bundle by merging it
with the jet bundle in this part you've
learned how Jets approach
internationalization and globalization
of jet applications for your homework
for this part try adding the RTL
settings to an existing page and see
what happens to your components if you
have a page who has a date/time picker
in it try changing the language in the
Lang attribute to different languages
and see what happens to the values in
the date picker and as always we thank
you for participating in the course and
we'll see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
