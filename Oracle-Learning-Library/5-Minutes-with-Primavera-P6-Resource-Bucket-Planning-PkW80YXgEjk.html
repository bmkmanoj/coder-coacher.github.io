today we'll see how to perform resource
bucket planning in Primavera p6 this is
a new feature in version 15.1 that
allows you to manually distribute
resources Simon work resource bucket
planning provides a more accurate
estimate of future work than a resource
distribution curve resource bucket
planning takes place on the assignments
page of the resources tab in this
activity view I filtered all of the
activities for the resource John Brunner
for this example let's assume that John
Brunner needs to adjust his planned work
for the electrical wiring activity he
cannot work Thursday or Friday but needs
to finish the activity this week instead
of adjusting distribution curves or
project calendars I can use resource
bucket planning to make my changes with
resource bucket planning you can
manually edit planned and remaining unit
fields for any activity that is in
progress or not started I'll drill down
in the timescale and manually adjust
John Bruner's planned units at the daily
level first I'll open the customized
view dialog box I'll click the usage tab
and then change the time scale from
months last week to week slash day and
then I'll click OK according to the
linear distribution curve John Brunner
plans to work on the activity electrical
wiring for 40 hours which is spread
evenly over the week of February first
since he can't work Thursday or Friday
I'll enter 0 hours for those days
to make up for the rest of the planned
40 hours of work I'll add time to the
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday buckets
after the work is entered I'll save my
changes the allocated units now reflect
the changes I made manually also note
that by manually editing buckets the
curve has changed to manual which
indicates that a distribution curve is
not an effect for this activity
