about Oracle virtual compute appliance
in short ovc a an Oracle Enterprise
Manager 12c and how you can use these
two products together to build a private
cloud within your data center where we
see a is part of Oracle's engineered
system family it comprises of compute
storage and InfiniBand network all
inside a rack as you can see on the
screen we have a sample machine that we
are using for today's demonstration
there are two administrative nodes in
this rack and there are eight compute
nodes included inside this on the
administrative nodes we have Oracle's
virtualization solution running on it
there is a manager that manages these
eight nodes as virtualized servers I'm
going to show you our virtualization
manager console that runs from this
admin note on ovc a rank the compute
nodes within the rack are registered
here as virtual servers which are used
to provision subsequent guest virtual
machines this is how you build a
virtualized form on ovc a now how Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c uses this
environment to create a private cloud
for you so I'm going to show you an
Frye's manager 12c cloud infrastructure
home
as you can see I have registered this
ovc a OPM manager into the
infrastructure cloud within a crisis
manager let me show you how the
registration of this of your manager is
done here we provide the console URL of
oviya manager and an agent of Oracle
Enterprise Manager Tulsi is pushed on
that admin node that has a VM manager
running on it you provide monitoring
credentials and and administrative
administration credentials for o VM
manager and you register that with an
enterprise manage it well see as soon as
the registration is completed and press
manager discovers all the artifacts that
are part of the OPM M as you can see OPM
has got one server pool that has eight
nodes registered in it the guest VM
should have been already provisioned are
also shown under each of the servers
where they are running now I'm going to
show you how you can set up
infrastructure as a service within
Enterprise Manager based on this ovm
form that we just registered here we
define machine sizes that are allowed to
be provisioned within this OPM form
there are out-of-the-box sizes that are
provided small medium large you could
also create your own size of the machine
so I have created one for this
demonstration were first called
DV cloud VMs the sizing of this includes
two virtual CPUs 8gb memory and 50 GB
storage you could create your own
machine sizes depending on your
requirements the next step in setting up
infrastructure self-service is how far
in advance a user can make a request can
be set up here is that you can leave it
unrestricted or you could restrict by
saying the reservation cannot go beyond
seven days or a month in advance each of
the requests that gets provisioned how
long can they persist how long can a
virtual machine persist can be defined
here you could have a maximum duration
of one week or a month based on you know
your requirements in your data center
every virtual machine that gets
provisioned can automatically have an
e/m agent running on it so that any
software that gets provision in that VM
is automatically discovered and promoted
to Enterprise Manager as a target so it
can be monitored and managed the next
step in setting up the self-service are
the roles which roles are allowed to
access this infrastructure cloud and
what those users can really get in terms
of service as well as CPUs and memory
and storage from this role so if you
have a sub service user who is given
this role these would be the
configurations that would be permitted
for that user it is in other words
called quota system for those users
let's talk about software components as
part of this sub sorry set up as you can
see I have four components defined here
Fusion Middleware Oracle Enterprise
Linux assembly of two kinds two
different versions and I have a database
non ASM assembly and assembly
his software wrapped up in a open
virtual format essentially it is one or
more VMs wrapped up including the
configuration between the VMS you can
also define which roles have access on
each of these assemblies so that
concludes how you set up the
infrastructure service now let's log out
and login as a self-service user I have
a user by name John Smith who will be
our self-service user for today
what comes up is a self-service portal
essentially this has four regions in it
as you can see these are the already
successful requests listed here in this
region and you have the previous
requests that have been processed on the
left hand side bottom you can see that
the quotas that we define for the role
are listed here this user is allowed 50
servers of 50 guest VMs and 100 virtual
CPUs and the memory of 100 GB total and
a storage of close to one terabyte on
the top left hand side corner you would
see notifications meaning the virtual
machines that have been assigned or
successfully given to this user some of
them will be expiring in seven days so a
list of seven of them are provided here
and there is also new software that is
published for this user software meaning
the assemblies that this user can
consume so there are four new assemblies
that have been published to this user so
let's look at how you request a guest VM
or how do you request for provisioning
and assembly that we talked about
earlier so first we specify which zone
this request will be provisioned in zone
is a virtual concept that we have users
can belong to a particular zone based on
the geography or the organization
division they work in so let's look at
the assembly setup that are accessible
to this self-service user so here he has
access to all four of Thorne's that we
published earlier so let's pick one of
them
so this assembly is a single VM assembly
that will have Oracle Enterprise Manager
Oracle Enterprise Linux version 6 u 2
running on it so let's give a name to
the instance that we're creating for
this assembly and then it shows you what
this assembly comprises of it has one
tier that runs Linux p vm software on it
operating system on it you can configure
this VM by providing the root password
and the size that you require for this
VM I'm going to choose a custom size
that we already defined for DB cloud VMs
so you can see that the memory has been
changed to 8 Meg 8 GB and I'm going to
show you the storage that has been
assigned for this custom size we have
defined a total size of 50 GB as a
requirement for storage so that's how we
do it
after we configure the VM we go to the
next step where we can define the
schedule when you want to request for
this virtual machine you could ask for a
reservation which means it will be
provisioned later or you could say
immediately which means it will be
provisioned right away you could also
choose how long this virtual machine is
going to live by choosing an end date
and giving that date or you could say
indefinitely
click on next where all of the
parameters that you are provided will be
listed here and you can click on finish
to submit this request so that concludes
how you can set up and
request infrastructure now that is not
the end of story for cloud in Enterprise
Manager 12c and price man is a 12c
allows you to create platform a service
as well one of the examples of platform
s service is database a service so I'm
going to show you how you can set up
database the service on this vo BCA
please recall the infrastructure service
homepage that I've shown you earlier
where we are provisioned virtual
machines using SSA requests into this
ovm form these are the various VMs that
are available so for the purpose of
setting up databases service you could
provision virtual machines running
oracle homes with orca homes created on
them using is requests let's go to
enterprise menu cloud will do air in
database home
this page will show you how you can
create your middleware or database cloud
let's talk about getaway database cloud
today here is the zone that I have
created for database cloud there are
three hosts that will be part of my
database zone and these are the three
virtual machines that I have provisioned
using is a self-service in the
infrastructure service once a hosts are
defined you can define software pools
that can be part of this zone the first
pool that I have created is a set of
Oracle homes running on these hosts and
the version I've chosen is 11 204
database version for single instance
databases these homes are already
created on these three VMs and
configured so that we can create
databases on top of them I could also
create another pool for creating schemas
on-demand using self-service users so
that requires not just the Oracle home
software but also databases provisioned
already in it so I've created a pool
that has two databases already running
now as you can see on the right hand
side it clearly tells you how many zones
that have been created how many software
pools have been created here now let's
go and set up the self-service user for
database cloud setup cloud click on
database a screen that looks similar to
infrastructure service setup comes up
here and this is what is used for
setting up database self-service as you
can see the first one is database pools
and this is where we created those pools
that we saw in the home page earlier I
am going to talk about profiles and
service templates here
cerise templates are copies of
production are already existing
databases that are in the data center
which can be used to provision copies
for system testing or he could create
sparse copy of the same databases for
functional testing based on the service
templates so you could create a service
template for an arm and copy of the
production to conduct your system
testing or you could create a sparse
copy of your production or functional
testing using snap clone as a storage
technology you could create a service
template for creating schemas for
developers that may include seed data
within those schemas or it could be an
empty schema based on the requirement
you could also have a service template
that creates pluggable databases on top
of 12c container databases so this is
how you setup the database self-service
once this is done you can log out and
log in as self-service user for database
again let's use John Smith as our
self-service user similar to
infrastructure service elf portal
software is portal this has four regions
- you have the existing instance service
instances that have been already
successfully provisioned we have the
previous request data here and you have
the quarters that have been navigated to
this user and the notifications let's
try and request for a new database
only one service template has been
allowed for this user that allows him to
create an empty database but that has
configuration similar to the production
database so let's select this the wizard
appears where you provide more
information for this request such as
which zone this database should be
created in since there's only one zone
that we have access to we will leave it
there and similar to IAS you can also
schedule your request do you want it in
future or do you want it immediately and
for how long you want the service to be
alive we also need to provide
information about which user controls
stata base that will be provisioned
let's submit this request
as you can see this is the latest
request that we just submitted and once
this is complete the database will
appear here in this region so that
concludes the database cloud
self-service demo so let's look at the
value of the entire solution here using
Enterprise Manager 12c on top of ovc a
you could successfully set up a private
cloud within hours rather than weeks ssa
users do not need to know the underlying
configuration either hardware or
software
everything is Apps is abstracted for
them resources can be scaled by adding
nodes one at a time in OVC a based on
the utilization data by the cloud
administrator what we see I can take up
to 25 nodes and one node can be added at
a time it can support multiple ovc racks
in the data center what I mean is and
press manager 12c can support multiple
where we see racks within the same
console you can provision application as
a service using our IAS assemblies or
you can have databases service
implemented like I said earlier in hours
rather than weeks
thank you that compute system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
