demonstration my name is Maria Billings
I work for oracle server technologies
curriculum in this demo I show you how
to restore tablespace with a password
encrypted arm and back up this Beckett
was created in a previous demo and uses
the same technology stack in the
background we did what you should never
do we forced the database into a
recovery situation to show you how to
perform a recovery from an encrypted
backup we choose availability backup and
recovery and perform recovery Cloud
Control caught up with us and found out
that there is a data file with error and
that the current status is mounted so
since we know that we are trying to
perform a recovery of a tablespace which
was this and they also choose to crypt
backups so we provide the password and
we provide host credentials then we
click recover this is for the current
point in time recovery of our test
tablespace this is the table space that
we want to recover we want to restore to
the default location our job and visit
me
you can refresh the page until you see
the successful completion let's have a
look at this crib the recovery script
that was used as you see the recovery
script uses the provided password but
for security reasons it does not
disclose it when you look at the screen
so this is how simple it is thanks for
watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
