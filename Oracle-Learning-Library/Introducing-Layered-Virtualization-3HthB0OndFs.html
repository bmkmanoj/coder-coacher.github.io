deploy and manage Oracle Solaris
non-global zones within Oracle VM server
for SPARC logical domains using zones
this way enables you to isolate your
applications for example you can run
different versions of an application in
each zone or run different applications
in each zone when you need to update the
operating system for a zone you need
only to consider compatibility with one
application versus many a simple layered
virtual environment and ops center
consists of an enterprise controller a
proxy controller a discovered and
managed oracle vm server for SPARC
virtualization server a logical domain
on the virtualization server a
non-global zone within the logical
domain storage resources and at least
one network the enterprise controller
must be running oracle solaris 11 and
have its oracle solaris 11 software
update library synchronizing with an
Oracle Solaris 11 image packaging system
when you create a non-global zone
opscenter installs it from the Oracle
Solaris 11 software update library using
the default software group named Solaris
small server this group uses less space
than when you install from an operating
system image the virtualization server
must be provisioned as an oracle vm
server for SPARC control domain with an
Oracle Solaris 11 update one operating
system it must also be running version
3.1 of the elder management software
which gets installed during provisioning
any logical domains that you create on
the virtualization server must also be
provisioned with an Oracle Solaris 11
update one operating system the logical
domains operating system acts as a
global zone for storage you'll need to
consider how you want to store the
operating system and metadata for both
the logical domain and the non global
zone for the operating systems you can
use network attached storage also known
as Nazz static or dynamic sand storage
which are fibre channel or ice
Ilan discs virtual disks exported from
another service domain which are
referred to as local devices in the
opscenter interface and the local file
system for an IO or root domain you can
also use direct io disks belonging to
the IO or root domain for the metadata
you can use nas storage or the local
file system
for networking you can use one or more
networks for the logical domain and non
global zones one of the advantages of
layered virtualization is that you can
put each zone on its own network
therefore adding a strong layer security
now let's talk about two agents that
control the layered virtualization
interface an OP Center first is the
oracle vm server for spark
virtualization controller agent which
resides on a control domain it enables
you to create manage and monitor logical
domains including i/o and root domains
second is the zones virtualization
controller agent which is automatically
installed on a logical domain during its
provisioning it enables you to create
manage and monitor non-global zones
running within the logical domain
suppose a virtualization server has
direct access to san and nas storage
it's directly connected via fibre
channel to a SAN storage device with
luns and network to a network file
server for shared storage on the
virtualization server solaris i/o
multipathing is enabled so that op
center can see and use the luns for its
and storage libraries when a
virtualization server is provisioned as
a control domain op Center creates a
virtual disk server on it when you
create a logical domain that uses a LUN
the virtual disk server creates a
virtual disk on the logical domain to
provide that domain with indirect access
to the line you select the virtual disk
is listed in the OP Center user
interface as a local device for the
logical domain when you create a zone
within a logical domain and want to use
a LUN you first need to add storage to
the logical domain the add storage
action allows you to select a LUN and
then it creates a virtual disk on the
logical domain when you provision the
zone you select that one an OP Center
provides the zone in direct access to
the LUN
now let's take a look at a networking
example there are three types of virtual
networking components that op center
uses to enable communication between the
virtualization server the logical domain
and the non global zone the first is a
virtual network switch when you assign a
network to a virtualization server
opscenter creates a virtual switch for
that network on a selected service
domain on the virtualization server for
example on a control domain at that time
you can also specify an IP address for
the service domain the second device is
a virtual network device or v-net when
you connect a network to a logical
domain say for example a guest domain
the service domains virtual switch
creates a V net on the logical domain
this action is the equivalent of
plugging in a physical neck on the guest
and connecting a cable to it opscenter
named savina as net x say for example
Net Zero each v-net has exactly one port
and that port also has a name for
example v-neck 5148 803 you must then
perform an attached network action on
the guest to plumb an IP address on the
v-net after that the virtual switch
enables the guest to communicate with
all the other guests on the same network
most importantly though for layered
virtualization is that you must
provision the guest with solaris 11
update 1 so that when you attach a
network to a guest opscenter will also
assign 10 alternate MAC addresses to the
v-net sport it is these mac addresses
that ops center will later assign to
non-global zones within the guest lastly
the third device is a virtual network
interface card or v-neck and it gets
created on a non-global zone by a V net
during zone provisioning during
provisioning you specify an IP address
for the v-net sport an OP Center
automatically assigns one of the
alternate back addresses that concludes
