welcome to the Oracle Enterprise Manager
cloud controlled 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to
customize the performance summary page
in enterprise manager Cloud Control 12
see the performance summary page shows
you all the relevant performance data
for a particular target using this page
you can ensure your oracle fusion
middleware and weblogic deployments are
performing as expected and meeting your
targets and you can customize this page
to monitor exactly the performance
metrics you want you can access the
targets performance summary page in a
couple of ways that Enterprise Manager
Cloud Control in this example run the
home page of a weblogic server we can go
to the weblogic server menu and select
monitoring performance summary or if we
go to the routing topology page here we
can simply right click the server and
select monitoring performance summary
here you see the default performance
summary metrics it shows the
availability of the server general
metrics such as active sessions request
processing time etc memory metrics such
as memory pool and garbage collection
data source metrics host metrics and
lastly metrics for servlets and jsps
let's go back up to the top you can
customize the default settings for this
page in a number of ways this allows you
to monitor exactly what you want you can
add additional performance metrics and
remove default metrics using the metric
palette so let's click the show metric
palette and say we don't want to see the
metrics on the garbage collection so
we'll uncheck those
but we are interested in JVM threads so
let's expand that and we'll select JVM
threads started since startup now let's
scroll back up and we'll scroll down and
here you see that the garbage collection
metrics are no longer shown and now we
see our new threads chart so you can add
the metrics you want to see and remove
the ones you don't want to see you can
also change the time frame from the data
displayed by default it's the past day
you can change it to the past two hours
the past 15 minutes select from the
calendar or use the slider by clicking
the slider link let's make it the last
12 hours so we'll just slide this bar
and now you see just that data you can
also overlay another weblogic servers
performance data on the current service
data using this overlay menu or you can
overlay historical performance data on
the current data let's overlay
yesterday's data on today's now you see
metrics for both yesterday in red and
the current data in blue and you can
compare the two let's remove the overlay
in 12 see you can now also create a
baseline of this performance data to be
used in performance comparison
operations as a benchmark let's create a
baseline okay
and now we see it in the drop down menu
now you can use it to compare against
historical performance data to do this
we adjust the time period to what's
being displayed to a period in the past
we use the calendar
and we'll show yesterday's date
now we see the data for yesterday and
will overlay the baseline that we just
created you can also use baselines
created previously for example during
load testing to compare against current
performance data let's remove the
overlay and we'll set the display back
to the past day then we'll overlay a
load testing baseline that I created
earlier so you can see this is very
useful for performance comparisons and
lastly you can save any customizations
made so that the next time you access
Enterprise Manager these customizations
are still available you do this simply
by clicking save charts and we'll save
it as the default name so that's it for
customizing the performance summary page
