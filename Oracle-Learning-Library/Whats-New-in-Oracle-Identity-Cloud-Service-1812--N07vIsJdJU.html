new features available in the 18 1/2
release of Oracle Identity cloud service
in this video we take a look at these
features and examine some of the changes
within the identity cloud service
console our Oracle Identity cloud
service now provides you with a
navigation drawer to maximize what you
can see in the identity cloud service
console to display the navigation drawer
click the Action menu in the upper left
corner of the console you'll see a
listing of all folders and pages that
compose the console select a folder to
see the pages associated with that
folder then click the menu item that
represents the page that you want to
display in the identity cloud service
console one new feature of Oracle
Identity cloud service is the ability to
create secure form fill applications
using a generic template in the app
catalog this functionality allows Oracle
Identity cloud service to store and
encrypt user credentials so users can
sign into the application automatically
without having to enter their
credentials each time they access the
application from the my apps page
another new feature of Oracle Identity
cloud service is the downloads page this
page is a centralized location where you
can download software development kits
for Java nodejs or Python or the
e-business suite to Surtur to integrate
your web applications or Oracle
e-business suite with Oracle Identity
cloud service click download to the
right of the software development kit or
application that you want to download
let's now take a look at some of the
other changes made to the user interface
for Oracle Identity cloud service 18:1
to the delegated administration page has
now been renamed administrators also
there are three new features added to
the security menu identity provider
policies sign on policies and network
parameters let's first take a look at
network parameters a net
Perimeter contains IP addresses IP
address ranges or masked IP address
ranges after creating a network
perimeter you can prevent users from
signing into oracle identity cloud
service if they use one of the IP
addresses in that network perimeter this
is known as black listing you can also
configure oracle identity cloud service
so that users can log in using only IP
addresses contained in the network
perimeter this is known as white listing
after defining your network perimeters
you can assign them to sign on policies
the sign on policies feature allows you
to define rules to allow or prevent
users to log in to Oracle Identity cloud
service you can then configure your
sign-on policies so that if you're
trying to sign in to Oracle Identity
cloud service using an IP address that's
defined in the network perimeter
you'll be prevented from accessing
Oracle Identity cloud service
alternatively you can configure this
type of policy so that if you're trying
to sign into oracle identity cloud
service using an IP address that's
defined in the network perimeter you can
login to Oracle Identity cloud service
you can also allow or deny access based
on the identity providers that will be
used to authenticate the user the groups
to which the user belongs whether the
user is assigned to administrator roles
or with specific user accounts you can
even prompt the user for an additional
factor to sign into Oracle Identity
cloud service you can also indicate
whether the user is required to enroll
in multi-factor authentication and how
often this additional factor is to be
used to login to Oracle Identity cloud
service another new feature of Oracle
Identity cloud service is identity
provider policies identity provider
policies allow you to define which
identity providers are visible in the
signing page of Oracle Identity cloud
service either when they're accessing a
specific application or attempting to
access Oracle Identity cloud service
protected resources Oracle Identity
cloud service also uses ident
to provider policies to determine
whether users authenticate into oracle
identity cloud service where their
usernames and passwords or through
identity providers there are three types
of identity providers that you can
assign to identity provider policies
sam'l identity providers social identity
providers and a local identity provider
sam'l identity providers are used to
establish trust between a sam'l
compatible authoritative source such as
Active Directory Federation services so
that users in your organization can
access resources protected by Oracle
Identity cloud service social identity
providers allow users to access Oracle
Identity cloud service using their
social network credentials such as
LinkedIn the local identity provider
allows users to authenticate with Oracle
Identity cloud service locally by
providing their username and password
let's suppose you've created several
social identity providers and sam'l
identity providers and you want to
configure which of these appear in the
Oracle Identity cloud service sign-in
page without identity provider policies
you will not be able to configure this
so if you had all of these sam'l and
social identity providers activated and
set to appear in the signing page they
would all be displayed if you would like
to know about the other new features in
this release please visit the what's new
documentation thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
