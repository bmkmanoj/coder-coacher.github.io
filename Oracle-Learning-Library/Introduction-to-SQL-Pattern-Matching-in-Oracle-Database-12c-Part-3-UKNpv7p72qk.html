in this series on the new
see sequel patent matching feature my
name is Keith Laker
I'm a senior principal product manager
for data warehousing and big data at
Oracle and if you have any questions
about sequel pack matching then please
feel free to contact me via my blog in
the last of this series of three
podcasts on sequel pattern matching
we're going to examine three real-world
use cases for pattern matching and show
how the new 12c match recognized clause
can make your life so much simpler
during this podcast we're going to
examine three scenarios scenario one is
the session ization for armed user logs
the second scenario is the analysis of
called detail records and the final
scenario is the tracking of suspicious
money transfers so let's start with the
first real-world use case which is the
analysis of the session ization of okay
let's start with use case number one
extracting session information from use
logs one of the most popular use cases
but patent matching is to analyze user
activity on a website that matching is
used to identify each session within a
series of clicks and then track user
activity that typically involves
multiple events such as click activity
moving from page a to page B and
responding to recommendations but what
do we mean by a session typically in
terms of pattern matching we'll define a
session as a sequence of one or more
events with the same partition key where
the inter time stone gap is less than a
specified threshold to do this we need
to determine the user ID within the data
set and then we need to join multiple
events and determine if they belong to
the current session or a new session and
this can be achieved by defining a value
for the inter row times
yeah in this way we can determine for
each user when a particular session ends
and a new session begins so if we take a
raw log file the first step would be to
identify the sessions by user then the
next step would be to aggregate that
data to determine the total number of
sessions per user in this case we're
using a built-in function to return a
running total of the number of sessions
per user and here you can see that mary
has logged three separate sessions and
Sam has also logged three separate
sessions so let's look at the sequel
match recognize statement used to create
this output when you've bucketed the
data by user ID using the partition by
Clause and then sorted the data by time
now patent requires us to match one or
more instances of event s as shown in
the patent clause where s is the current
time minus the previous time it must be
less than or equal to 10 and this is
shown in the define clause our output
table defined by the measures Clause
contains the session ID which is
calculated using the built in feature
match number and we reviewed this in the
second podcast along with the other
built-in function called classifier note
that in the site Clause we can still
refer to columns in the table events
such as time and user ID event even
though these columns are not included in
the measures course assigning numbers of
the detail level is just the start of
the analytical process the real business
value in using pattern matching for this
type of analysis comes after aggregating
the data by session to give a high-level
picture and typical aggregations include
summarizing the events per session along
with the total session duration the
output from the previous statement can
be viewed as a starting point for
further analysis and illustrates the
the pattern matching is an evolutionary
process once we've established that the
pattern is returning the expected
results we might want to move on to
aggregating those results and adding
additional data points such as how many
events happened within an individual
session and what was the total duration
of an individual session in this slide
we've reduced the output from our
previous table by using the one row per
match clause which we'll see in a minute
and adding some aggregations to count
the number of events and duration of
each session and the sequel to a twig
achieve this is shown here where you can
see we've added new measures such as
chemstar and calculated the duration of
each session by subtracting the first
instance of a time stem from the last
instance of a timestamp within our
pattern matching features such as last
first and the use of aggregations such
as count were discussed in the second
podcast in our series and you can get
more information about these features
from the sequel documentation so here
we've shown how you can analyze session
logs and create both detailed and
summary aggregate data from those logs
so now let's move on to second use case
which is the analysis okay now let's
look at our second real-world use case
which is the analysis of call detail
records one of the most important
metrics for telecommunication companies
is call quality they typically track how
often a caller has to redial during the
session because the call was dropped the
business issue here is that low levels
of call quality ie high instances of
drop calls increases the likelihood that
a customer would defect to a competitor
this is known as churn it's an expensive
process to recruit new customers so many
telecommunication companies want to
ensure that customers remain loyal
tracking core quality requires
to analyze events such as call start
time call end time caller ID call Eid
and now let's look at how the match
recognized command can be used to track
call quality the following example finds
the sessions where calls between two
people are grouped into a session if the
gap between subsequent calls is within a
threshold of 60 seconds max threshold is
specified in the define clause the
measure Clause returns information about
each call such as how many took times
calls where we started in a session
total effective call duration and total
interrupted duration as you can see from
this code the syntax is relatively easy
to understand and both most business
users would be able to take this code
and confidently reuse it within their bi
workplace even modifying it to create
additional metrics let's compare the
simplicity of the maths recognized
syntax with the pre C pre 12c sequel
code needed to extract the same
information first we should note that
prior to 12c it was actually possible to
use sequel to support pattern matching
requirements however it was not easy to
write the required code and/or make
subsequent modifications the simplicity
and elegance of the 12c match recognized
clause will be welcomed by developers
DBAs and business users because it makes
designing and implementing pattern
matching requirements so much easier so
in the next real-world use case we'll
look at tracking system okay now let's
look at our final real-world use case
which is about tracking suspicious money
transfers many companies are looking for
simple and more efficient ways to
identify and track forward the ability
to search first suspicious financial
patterns is becoming a primary
requirement an Oracle sequel pattern
matching is the perfect in database
sequel method for doing this as it
offers fast and efficient processing
the richness of this sequel feature
allows developers to define unusual and
suspect patterns of behavior that are
unique to their industry or particular
circumstances for example you might need
to search for a behavior that seems
suspicious when there's a transparent
transfer of funds the typical suspicious
transfer could be defined as three or
small money transfers less than $2,000
within 30 days followed by a larger
transfer of a million dollars within 10
days of the last small transfer using
the pattern course it's relatively easy
to define a series of statements that
first identify the small transfers
determine if the small transfers
occurred within a specified time period
in this case 30 days and lastly catch
the last transfers and then ensure that
those transfers occurred within a
specified time window of the last small
transfer in this case that window is 10
days now let's enhance our statement to
look at little closer of where the
money's actually going and let's track
transfers to different accounts based on
the size of those transfers here we can
see that we've expended event x to
capture situations where the small
transfer of funds is to different
accounts and where in total those
transfers are less than $2,000 so you
can see we're developing a very
sophisticated pattern to capture
suspected fraudulent activities but the
code is relatively easy to read and
understand and that's always a good sign
of great code and that concludes our
look at
and that is it for this podcast on use
cases in this series we've looked at the
basic concepts of pattern matching we've
reviewed the new 12c mapped recognized
clause and we've looked at some
real-world use cases overall I think
you'll agree that with the new in
database pattern matching capabilities
it significantly reduces code complexity
while providing all the flexibility and
sophistication of non-sequel declarative
languages such as Perl using sequel
pattern matching you can further
maximize your investment in Oracle
database technology for more information
