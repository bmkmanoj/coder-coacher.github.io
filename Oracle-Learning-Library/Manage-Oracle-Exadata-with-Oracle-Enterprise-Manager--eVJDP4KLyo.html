in this demonstration we will show you
enterprise managers integrated software
and hardware management capabilities for
exadata we begin by looking at the
hardware schematics of the Exadata
blocks this is a physical representation
of how the rack is set up in which we
can see all the components for example
we can see all the storage cells compute
nodes InfiniBand switch and kvm the
green dots here indicate the health of
that component so for example if
something was wrong with the system you
see that green dot turned into red I can
also examine the temperature of each
component and if I wish to drill Jenny
components such as Network I can do that
as well here we see the overall status
of the infiniband fabric we can see the
network throughput we can see all the
switches the ports and whether the ports
are being used or not and how they're
connected to computer storage more
interesting is how this machine is being
used so let's go and find out what's
running on this machine and how the
resources are being utilized let's start
with compute resources what we see here
is that there are four databases running
on this box and we can see the relative
resource distribution across them as the
green band indicates we seem to have
ample free CPU resources so we're
certainly fine as far as computing
resources are concerned now let's take a
look at IO resources here we see a
completely different story as you can
see we don't have any more Headroom we
can also see that the data warehouse
database is consuming most of our i/o
bandwidth whereas the CRM database which
is one of my oltp databases servicing my
customer service rep doesn't seem to be
getting its due share of Io resources
let's see what we should do about that
let's first make sure that this is an
actual problem after we drill into the
CRM performance database page we do
indeed see that there are an awful lot
of I oh wait so we do have a problem
since the cause of this problem seems to
be the data warehousing database let's
go see what that database is doing
I'm going to use a new feature of
enterprise manager 12c called active
session history analytics it's basically
a multi-dimensional performance
analytics engine we can see here that
the database is indeed doing lots of i/o
question is what is causing this i/o to
answer this question I'm going to
analyze it by one of the available
dimensions and analyze it by service I
can see here that I have three services
running and a big chunk of my i/o is
coming from my monthly forecast process
it's the beginning of the month so it's
a legitimate workload here is my
conundrum I've chosen to consolidate put
my oltp and data warehouse on the same
platform they seem unfortunately to be
stepping on each other's toes however
given that both of them are legitimate
workloads I cannot do something simple
like killing one of the processes so I
have to come up with a more innovative
solution fortunately Exadata provides a
new capability called io resource
management
which will allow me to control how the
resources are distributed across all the
database workloads we can not only
manage resources at the CPU level but we
can also do it at the storage and IO
layers so here I am on the storage
server grid page we can see all of the
performance details about hard disk
flash and similar we can also see here
that I owe resource manager is currently
not enabled so let's go ahead and enable
that from the IO management resource
page I'm going to enable the resource
manager by activating one of the plans
this plan says that our CRM database
should get forty percent of the
available resources and the rest of our
databases should share the remaining
sixty percent I'm happy with this and
I'm going to activate it now that we're
back we can see that I our resource
management has been enabled it should
start throttling my data warehouse let's
refresh and see we can see now that the
CRM database is in fact getting the
lion's share of resources hopefully this
will fix our problem let's drill down
and make sure back in the crm database
page we can see that I awaits have now
gone back down and hopefully our
customers will start seeing normal
performance again in this demonstration
we showed how to efficiently identify
resource management issues and how
oracle enterprise manager was able to
utilize Exadata capabilities to
automatically shift resources in order
to ensure that my processing needs were
met thank you for watching this
