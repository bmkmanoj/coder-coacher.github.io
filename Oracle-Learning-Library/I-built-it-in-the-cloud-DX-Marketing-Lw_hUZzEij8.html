Oracle and I have with me Jerry from the
X marketing hello Jerry hi so tell me
more about DX marketing what do you guys
do we are a data-driven targeted
marketing firm that is headquartered in
Savannah Georgia so everything we do is
depends on our data what we do is we end
up doing predictive analytics to
identify prospects that we end up
executing both offline and online
campaigns so I'm looking at your
architecture over here and you're
running quite a few Oracle applications
on Oracle cloud infrastructure correct
correct we currently have our consumer
data warehouse and our analytics
platform running and the Oracle cloud
info infrastructure we also utilize the
Oracle data cloud and the marketing
cloud to help execute our campaigns so
let's talk a little more about this
architecture and how you're using the
infrastructure layer to host the Oracle
applications so we have currently in our
consumer data warehouse we have 280
million consumer records with up to 800
different attributes about each of those
so we host that again on the Oracle
cloud infrastructure we utilize Oracle
advanced analytics to do the predictive
analytics that we utilize to identify
the prospects what ends up happening is
we take our clients CRM file into this
consumer data warehouse identify
prospects the most the prospects that
are most likely to buy our clients
product or service then we take that and
send that to the Oracle data cloud where
they match cookie and mobile IDs to that
data and we send that to the Oracle
marketing cloud for layering on up to
45,000 different
segments and then we utilize that data
for our online campaigns so Jerry in
this whole architecture performance was
the key as he was selecting Oracle cloud
infrastructure correct yes
Oracle advanced analytics is a pretty
resource intensive application when we
move to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
we saw an improvement of 5x in our
analytic processing time so that was big
for us because that allows us to do our
analysis quicker and optimize our
campaigns with the results of those
analysis another great use case for
Oracle on Oracle
yes we have been very happy with our
Oracle platform it's exceeded our
expectations well thank you so much for
sharing your architecture we thank you
and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
