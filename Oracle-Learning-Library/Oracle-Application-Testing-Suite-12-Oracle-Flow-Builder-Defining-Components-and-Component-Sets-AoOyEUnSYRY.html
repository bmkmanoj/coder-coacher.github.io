in Oracle flow builder a component
represents a sequence of keywords to
perform a transaction now we will see
how to define a component for all the
fields in the header section of the
requisition form let's move to Oracle
flow builder click on components link
navigate to the release product family
product and to the feature in which we
want to create the component right click
on the feature and select create
component enter the component name
create a risk or requisition underscore
header enter the tags tags are used for
ease of search of confidence within
article flow builder enter a relevant
description for the component being
created here we will be entering to
enter details in header fields in a
requisition form click on save now the
component is created to our details we
can select the component and click on
the attached code button or we can
navigate to the component in the
componentry right click on the
confidence created select the option
attach code
enter the number of rows required for
the component click on add rows here the
first keyword to be used for any
component is such a pipe in Oregon
applications we have different
application types like ADF forms flex
forms jtt telnet and web here we are
writing the component for a forms
application so we will select it as
forms next we would enter the set window
keyword the window name would be
requisitions and the window attribute
now we would enter the keyword and
object for the operating unit field as
it is an edit field we would you set
text and edit let us select the key
works a text as the object is an edit
field we would select edit display name
would be the label of the field
operating unit for the attribute value
let's move to the application go to
diagnostics examine we will pick the
block and field values from here the
Block in field values together appended
by underscore 0 would be the attribute
value similarly we would enter the
keyword and object pairs for all the
different fields in the form we would
enter 4 type
they attribute value for the type field
next we would use set x rated again for
the description field label description
and the attribute value
after entering all the details we would
click on save for that we would use the
keyword menu select the object would be
main menu display name would be file
save attribute value can also be given
as file type save next we would verify
the transaction message function call we
would select the corresponding function
library generally provide a display name
status bar message select the relevant
function name form verify status
after saving we would pick the
requisition number that gets generated
we would save it to a variable we will
be using get and the object type is edit
as it's an edit field we are using the
object i presided we need to give the
variable name in the output parameter
field here wreck number is the variable
name the field label would be the
display name number and the attribute
value will be picked up from Diagnostics
this variable can be used anywhere in
the flows when we want to refer to the
requisition that is created using this
component click on save
click on submit this is how we can
create a component in Oracle flow
builder now let us see how to define a
competency in Oracle flow builder a
competent set is a logical grouping of
individual components generally to
define a component set we group the
components from similar business
entities in a particular order now let's
move to Oracle flow builder here in this
demo we will see how to define a
compensate for creating a basic
requisition with a single goods line
click on the link component sets
navigate with the release product family
product and to the feature way we want
to create the comprehensive right click
on the feature select create component
set enter the name for the component set
enter the tag packs are used to ease the
search of confidence it's in Oregon flow
builder enjoy the relevant description
for the comprehensive
confit
the confidence it right click select
update compensate highlight the
component set in the compensatory
navigate to the component tree and
select the components which we need to
pull to the component set select the
release navigate to the product here in
this confidence that we will add all the
components that are required to create a
requisition with one single goods line
we will add a component to fill in the
header details for a requisition right
click on the component and select the
option move we would add a competent to
fill in the details for a good line in a
requisition form next we would add a
component to add the distribution
information for the goods line added we
can add the components by drag-and-drop
we can have the component to approve a
requisition while adding a confident we
can also use the options of move above
and move below now this is our
confidence eight goods line requisition
this has four components to enter
details and requisition header component
to enter the good line details a
component for distribution details for
the goods line and to approve the
requisition now our component set is
ready to be used in any flow in any flow
where we need to create a requisition
with a good line we can add this
component set instead of adding the four
individual components this helps us to
reduce the flow development effort this
is how we define a confidence it in
Oracle flow builder

any queries or additional information
thank you
