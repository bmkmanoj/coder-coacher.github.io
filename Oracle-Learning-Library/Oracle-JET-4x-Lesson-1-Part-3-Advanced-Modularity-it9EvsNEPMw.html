first of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle yet in part two you were
introduced to requirejs
which is included in Oracle church to
provide solutions for lazy loading of
application resources and modularity in
this part you will be introduced to the
requirejs configuration file which is
used to configure oracle jet
applications
the main Jas file which provides the
entry point discussed in the previous
part in other words the require block
provides something else as well when you
look at the top of the manjae's file you
see a section called requirejs config
this is the configuration block which is
defined by requirejs here you define the
paths to the libraries that are used in
the application notice that there is a
reference here to libs
knockout libs jQuery and so on however
when you look inside the source folder
you will not see an ellipse folder here
to see those libraries what you need is
to build the application when you run
out yet serve the application is built
and it is also opened into the browser
if you don't want to open the
application into the browser but simply
build it what you would do is you will
type a jet and build this simply builds
the application what that means is that
a web folder is generated you do your
work in the source folder while when you
do a jet build or a jet surf
a web folder is created this is your
staging directory and in that folder you
will find an elipse folder generated
based on the fact that you have a list
of libraries in the main J's file so you
can see here libs knockout is libs
knockout and then inside there is a
reference to the debug version of the
knockout library which is found within
that folder all the references you find
here are references to the Jas libs
folder in the web folder which you will
see when you build the application in
this part you have learned about the
requirejs configuration file the
required areas configuration file is an
important file in any Oracle jet
application it lets you configure the
location of the libraries you will need
to use in your
courgette application for your home.look
exercise play with the code related to
this part try changing the path for a
library to something incorrect and see
what errors are shown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
