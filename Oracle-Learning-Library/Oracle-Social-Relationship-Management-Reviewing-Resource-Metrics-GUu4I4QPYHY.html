presents reviewing resource metrics hi
this is cindi and in a previous demo we
gave you a quick overview of the listen
and analyze tool this video takes a
closer look at the type of information
available to you for your social
properties the high level data in the
dashboard shows the growth in the total
number of fans fan demographics fan
sources reach impressions engagement and
posts in the left navigation the fan
section has two topics overview and
demographics the fans overview section
shows a chart that tracks the growth of
your fans how they have reached your
pages and it tracks if they are liking
your pages the dropdown lets you view
different types of charts the fan
demographics gives you detailed
information about who your fans are you
can learn where your fans are coming
from by looking at the city and country
and what language they speak and then
their gender and age if you hover over
the dots on the map a pop-up reveals
data points and this feature is unique
to the Oracle SRM analytics tool some of
the important statistics are listed
below the map so you can scroll through
to see some of the other data points in
the engagement overview section you find
data that is similar to data found in
the fan section however this information
is about fans who engage with your page
by liking commenting or sharing
information about you the drop-down has
many options such as page stories people
talking about this and other graphs you
can see any negative feedback that you
have received negative feedback could be
people marking you as spam or unlike you
you can scroll down to see the list of
your top 10 engaged users based on user
comments and referral sources are listed
here the engagement demographics section
gives you the location language and
gender of your fans who like your page
and interact so don't be surprised if
your engagement demographics are
different from your fan demographics the
visibility section gives you information
about impressions of your posts your
reach and your reach demographics the
post section shows all of the posts that
you sent out from the native tool and
the Oracle SRM tool this section shows
you the number of hosts for a certain
day content types and the top engaged
posts all posts show all posts for the
specific network and this example is all
Facebook pages the insight section gives
you the best time of day to post as well
as the worst time of day to post in
addition we have charts that show how
many times you've posted at a particular
time of day so that's been a closer look
at reviewing your analytics using the
lists and analyze tool you can find more
documentation and demos at the URLs
lists thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
