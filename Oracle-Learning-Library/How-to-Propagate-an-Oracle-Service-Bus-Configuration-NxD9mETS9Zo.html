curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I'll show you how to
propagate an Oracle service bus
configuration from one domain to another
at some point you want to move service
bus configurations to a different domain
for example from development to QA or
from staging to production
using the service bus console you can
export projects and individual resources
to an external jar file this file can
then be imported into another domain it
could also be used to archive service
bus configurations note that you cannot
export users groups or roles created in
the service bus console use the WebLogic
server administration console to do so
in this demonstration will propagate
service bus projects from a staging
domain to a new production domain using
a configuration file so let's get
started here we are in the oracle
service bus console in our staging
domain could OSB domain to export a
configuration we go to system
administration let's scroll down and
click on the system administration link
and we'll choose export resources on
this page we choose what we want to
export here we're going to export
projects as opposed to individual
resources so we'll leave it at the
default when exporting projects you
can't select include dependencies this
only applies when exporting individual
resources and in the resource summary
we'll choose which projects to export
for this example we'll export order
management and shipping projects so
we'll deselect the system project which
contains global operational settings and
we'll click export
and we're going to save it to a file so
I'll click OK now let's move the browser
window over a bit and you can see the
file here it's called SB config jar and
it's placed in the default download
location for your browser in this case
it's on the desktop note that we didn't
explore Twitter session if you do so
you'd be exporting session resources
which may be incomplete or have
conflicts so it's best to export outside
a session to export complete and
validated configuration data now that
we've exported the configuration file
that contains the projects we want from
the staging domain we'll import it into
the production domain now we're in the
service bus console for the new
production domain called prod domain if
we go to project Explorer you can see
there are currently no service bus
projects apart from the default so first
let's start a new session and now we'll
go to system administration by default
it's on the import resources page so
let's choose the configuration file we
just created which was on the desktop
could SP config jar and click Next
the projects we want are selected and
you can expand these if you wish to see
what resources will be important
you can even deselect individual
resources if you wish that you don't
want to import it but we'll import
everything here now we'll click import
and you can see the import was completed
successfully
so let's activate the session and enter
a description
and now if we go to project Explorer we
can see that the projects exist in the
new domain with all the resources so
it's that simple to propagate a service
bus configuration from one domain to
another thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
