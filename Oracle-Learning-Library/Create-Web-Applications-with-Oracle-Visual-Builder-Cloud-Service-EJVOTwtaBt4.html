web application using Oracle visual
builder cloud service I'll create an
expense tracking application first I
choose a template look-and-feel for the
application the next step is to define
the main navigation components in the
application those are going to be the
top pages in the menu once I create
those two pages I click finish and I'm
taken into the visual editor a visual
builder here I can choose items on the
page and change them for example here
I'm adding the logo to the application
there's a set of components that I can
drag-and-drop to place in the visual
editor I split the editor into two areas
I add a table in the first area I'm
creating a new business object that will
host the information that I'll put in
the table this is gonna track expenses
so I define several fields that I want
to monitor for an expense including a
name a cost and a date field to record
when the expense actually happened I'll
add one more field this one is the
approval field this is a boolean field
to indicate whether this expense
requires an approver I can define the
operations I want to create on the
business object and which unique
capabilities I want to add to the table
capabilities like sorting and searching
now I can run the application I have a
full cloud-based application allowing
the user to create read update and
delete data about expenses I have a page
that allows the user to insert new
records a page that allows a user to
browse the current records and a page
that allows a user to edit a specific
record and change values for fields for
example I can change the expense amount
now that I've tested the application I
go back into design mode I'll add
another component to the user interface
I'm adding a chart from the data
visualization component it's easy to
bind a chart to the business object the
chart will show the costs for each
expense as part of the overall cost
right now I only have one expense that's
what the chart displays I click to go to
the create page where I'm going to add
another field this is a combo box to
identify
the type of expense I'm defining a new
list of expense types this is gonna be a
look-up list i define some of the
possible values here expenses can be
related to lodging there can be related
to food or travel I also add type other
I can reorganize the fields in the order
that I want
I run the create page again and add
another expense report this one's for a
hotel I specify the cost and date now I
can use the combo box to choose the type
of expense that's how easy it is to add
another field to the table and add a
chart into the user interface to
visualize data for more information
