on demos that you see of actual
applications that are created on top of
the NetBeans platform what the NetBeans
platform is and details about that
that's not being covered here there's a
session about that from 2:00 to 3:00 in
continental ballroom seven eight nine
sessions code getting started with an
epic splat firm this is really all about
people from different countries in the
world Holland Sweden us showing what
they're doing within that means platform
all the different contexts where it's
being used my name is herion the
speakers are Timon Sam Rob Henry and
Steven from various organizations they
are introduced themselves they'll show
you what I've been doing and at the end
hopefully there'll be some discussion
and questions and and also feel free to
shout out any question you might have
it's it's quite a small group you can
keep this relatively informal so if you
want to interject at any point feel free
to do so so let's begin with steam um
I'm talking about Agora cents yeah here
is I will give you a demonstration of Oz
persons which is a fire management
software we will start here and it's a
Jukes Choice Award winner this year so
it's really cool
of course it is our centerpiece is a map
because everything what's happening on
the farm is geographically related so on
the left side we have we have a farm and
you already created one and there's all
kinds of data you can really drag and
drop onto the map so here I have a
shapefile which I exported from
geographical software and you can just
drag it onto the map and I see the full
extent of my of my farm we just created
a random color generator because it
looks a lot more cheerful than Oh blah
field we have some nice color here on
the map earlier after the the layer list
which you can use to navigate through to
things you want to do so if you are lost
and you can't find your farm anymore you
just click on it and it will zoom to the
content to remove it again
we also can display machines on the map
here I've created a tractor I can also
drag it on the map and zoom to it and in
here I can see where my tractor is
currently moving we implemented a dummy
GPS tracking we all already create an
app for Android which you can activate
and you say which machine you are on and
it will use the GPS from from the phone
to connect it so if I enable it you will
see it starts running on the map and you
can see you now have to call the fire
department because it will run into the
water so I already have a question why
isn't this application running in a
browser this should be a web application
Wow no no it shouldn't we actually tried
to do something similar in a web
application and it would just crash it
at the browser because there's there's
too much going on and if you wanted to
do this on a browser and you want to
have a real-time GPS tracking you would
have to refresh the data every few
seconds which will be used to train for
your browser's JavaScript parser or in
the no that's not not going nicely well
we also have support for various types
of sensor data i one example here this
is a crop circle file I opened it here
as well I can make it make it a bit
little bigger this is the data it's
actually in the file it's just a very
simple CSV format and we can also have a
ship visualize it so you can see what it
looks like
I can also put it on the map so I can
now see it relatively to the rest I can
zoom to it
I can change the palate because all the
sensor data all the sensors are attached
to spraying beams and they're making
pictures of the soil and they calculate
the amount of green pixels that are on
the picture so here you can see the
lower part of the field is doing better
than the higher part of the field and
well I know this farm I've been there
and this water here this is salt water
and there is a dike here and you have
the saltwater going below the dike and
you are a salt in your soil which
affects the growing of your crop so now
this farmer can see that the crop
growing is falling behind in a northern
part of the field so we can do maybe
apply some extra water or some agents
which will remove it reduce the amount
of salt we also have support for tasks
and tasks you are able to export to your
actual machine so you can you can create
an advance and finally grant a spraying
plan and you can put it on a USB stick
and put it in the terminal of your
tractor and it will execute it
automatically you don't you can read a
paper while you're on the tractor you
don't have to drive Ethan anymore I will
also show you now another application we
have created for acronyms which is a
machine manufacturer they make the
spraying devices and it looks very
similar because it reuses a lot of the
modules from from agro sins because we
use a combination of the NetBeans
platform and Nathan it's very very easy
to reuse modules so we have exactly the
same map we have the same farm fields
and so forth okay no one here this is
the San Francisco Airport and
well let's pretend to hate um mr. farmer
and he has this field here and he what
he wants to do something with it and he
thought well I'm I'm a customer and I'm
a huge NetBeans fan and I go to head
young and say well I want to pay you a
lot of money if you can do something
with a NetBeans logo on your field so
that's what we are going to do so I
imported a BMP file and you can open it
it's just an image I took one from the
internet and convert it into black and
white and saved it as being P so nothing
fancy here then I have created the field
I can display it on map and you can also
already see it let's create a new field
now I spoil the surprise good I can drag
it onto the map and it will enter in
edit mode so now I can draw my field on
the map and say well this is finished
and now I want to apply this logo to the
fields so I drag it to my field it
starts to process the image and here in
open terrain arises but should not
affect the processing so this will take
a few seconds and now it will enter a
special edit notice where I can adjust
the size and rotation of the image so it
fits into the fields rotated a bit
further so now I can see it fits so this
one will already turn green I click
finished and now it has created the task
which I can display on the map and this
has this task I can actually export onto
the plane planting device and it will
only plant on the parts that are black
and the white it will leaf implanted or
I can plant another crop on the white
part and if I for example have some
green crop on the black parts in a
yellow crop on the on the white parts
you can see the logo from the sky which
is pretty cool I think
yes I think that's about it for me
yes we use out of objects
yes yes we are we are already looking
into ways we can implement Java effects
and obviously obviously they are charts
but we currently focused mainly on data
entry and at the time we are also
implementing reports we will definitely
use the JavaFX charts we want to create
some custom charting for crop planning
so you can create something like swim
lanes that you drag a field into a swim
lane and then you can drag a crop to the
same swim lane and you can see all the
tasks on a time frame or something like
this so we are looking for it it will be
quite some work I think to create that
it will be really cool and Java effects
I think some other people in the on the
panel as well will be talking about the
Java FX integration that there they've
been working on ok this is very cool
let's switch to Sam and Sam is the is
kind of different to the rest of the
people on the panel because everyone
else here was present at NetBeans day
where we had this the same panel with
the same people except for Sam so we are
interested to see what what Sam is going
to contribute to the session over to you
hello hi I'm Sam Hartwell I work at
tunnel vision laboratories and I'm also
a student PhD student at the University
of Texas at Austin what we do research
for both work and at school as I do
custom IDE development the people that
rely on us
commercially are in-house languages you
got a lot of businesses that use
scripting languages from very small to
very very big you'll have a little
scripting language that's used only by
one company but they got 10,000 files in
that language and they've got a hundred
developers working with and on a daily
basis they have some special IDE
requirements the other group is emerging
languages which is one that I've chosen
for this particular demo somebody comes
up with a great new language it's
supposed to be very productive but in
order to learn it and to use it and to
evaluate it in our workplace we expect
tools to be available that work similar
to what we're already using otherwise
it's not very helpful to us what we need
in order to get this done is a familiar
interface we need a platform that
performs well and especially one that's
scalable because we work with real
projects at real companies we also need
an extensible platform because we get
customer requests that you know somebody
didn't really plan for this one in the
past but if the platform is expensable
we're gonna be able to handle it and
it's gonna be affordable our demo is go
works we chose to go big with this one
as far as the language its
general-purpose
it's implicitly typed which is a
particularly interesting challenge for
an IDE the source file of the project
we're using is the standard library as a
whole it's over 1,200 source files and
it took us less than eight man weeks of
development time to put the whole thing
together from a language specification
starting with just our framework and the
NetBeans platform we finished ahead of
schedule and we went through multiple
iterations of UI testing and feedback
and improvement to come up with what I
am going to demo so this is one file out
of the go standard library and when I
look at things like this function
signature the
DST SRC what I see is I see a function
that was written by a team that wasn't
using an IDE at all they didn't choose
these names to be descriptive or easy to
read they chose them so they didn't have
to type so many characters as they're
working so what we do is we give it a
responsive IDE that can keep up with
somebody that's typing and they can type
the same method but instead of using
shortened names I'll just go ahead and
put in destination source we use
full-length names and you can see what
this would look like if I was going to
continue typing and so this is where it
starts to get interesting I is less than
lana SRC SRC is what they named it above
well they picked SRC cuz it kind of
looks like source is just missing the
vowels well this one picks up on it and
because it picks up on it really really
fast I don't have to wait or press ctrl
space or anything else like that I just
press over patsies SRC closed
parenthesis and then keep going and so
this is this was our general approach so
for block I'll just use B okay that's
easy to type o uu is out used and so it
learns as well from from what I end up
using on that particular session so it
will start to simply keep up with me as
I start doing so so this seems faster
than I'm used to in NetBeans IDE I must
say the way the way you're typing though
yes what's what's the reason for that so
this is where it becomes it's really
interesting how extensible NetBeans is
we got this request to handle a code
completion for an imperative bar for an
implicitly typed language it's similar
for a dynamically typed language where
it starts to get a little fuzzy on what
exactly is going to be allowed where we
were actually able to replace the code
completion modules rendering section to
allow us to display a little bit of
extra information in cases like this
where a person has the ability to type i
colon equals for a new declaration we
were able to modify this box to include
that
and information at the top without
removing their ability to scroll through
the list of suggestions if they were
going to reference something instead and
so by having both of them available all
the time well that allows me to type
very fluidly with very predictable
results and most of the time almost all
the time I'm not actually looking at the
thing popping up I just know it's gonna
be there if I need to look at something
I'm typing in a new file or something
like that but for the most part it
flickers a little bit but you get used
to it because mostly what you get used
to is you get used to this ability to
type shorthand without having to press
extra characters you just type shorthand
and outcomes what you meant what you
were thinking so it's really an
enjoyable development experience once
you get to use one that is that fluid so
is this a reason why this isn't a plugin
for NetBeans IDE
because you've actually got your own
implementation of the editor so oh so
far we've been slowly we were using a
platform that was a separate application
but we had some requests to pull it in
as can we get support for go in our
regular NetBeans boom that we're doing
with some other stuff and so we started
migrating modules from custom builds
over into the just being regular plugins
and the only one left is the use some of
the UI for this code completion module
isn't compatible with that so they will
either will either get it migrated so
we've been working together to get a
patch that preserves existing
functionality for everybody that's using
that API right now and if we get that in
we'll be able to use you'll have the
option basically for any for any
language that's implemented in it it'll
have the option of using this style of
user interface or the other one which
looks very similar but there's just a
few behavior differences for the
learning characteristics and in addition
to this you also have another one and
flow works well the new implementation
of antler works right can you tell us a
bit about that so and what it is maybe
for those who don't know antler works is
an IDE for a a DSL that I use on a daily
basis antler is a grammar description
that I used to describe programming
languages so when I started working on
this project I first took the language
specification and wrote it in antlers
language so I have an IDE to help me on
a daily basis work with that language
and it's called antler works it works
similar to this although the language
doesn't have very many expressions and
things like that that this one does so
it's it works like this but it's not
nearly as exciting because there's the
complexity of what you type is much
smaller so you got a one that we in
general we can throw one together for
something that's a really make a trivial
language I mean it's it's not trivial in
practice but the language is very small
we can put one of those together in two
days so does this mean that that's at
some point when someone interested in
antler goes to the antlers progressed
and org and downloads the antler works
IDE they'll be downloading the the NFC's
platform based and cloris yes for antler
works too which is about we've got a
beta version up as antler works as
antler for is finalized we'll be moving
everybody to encouraging them to use
antler works too and it will be one of
the NetBeans based environments mmm
fantastic and when is that gonna happen
oh you can download it right now there's
a bug in it if you want to use it to
work with version 3 grammars which is
sort of a legacy mode it doesn't work
right now so but other than that yes you
can go download it from the television
website and this demo that I'm running
the project and the demo is on our site
I'm running it into one mystery office
site perfect thanks switching to a whole
different use case we're going to go to
rub with two different scenarios two
different applications also with an
interest in Java effects all the way
down there that you see being used so if
a stock trading application and also a
freight management
software
you're unemployed with the ethernet cord
alright alright I'm I'm Rob table ski
and I'm an applications architect for a
freight logistics firm called Linden
incorporated based in Seattle and
Anchorage and also in my copious free
time I developed trading strategies and
write software to implement those
trading strategies so I'm going to demo
a couple of applications that are
written on top of the NetBeans platform
that's the first one here is called
freight management system FMS for short
and this is an application that's used
internally at linden buy two two sets a
user user groups the first one is
customer service agents when they need
to look up information about a customer
shipment that calls in they're able to
to go into this application and and find
that information detail about the
customer and any shipments that they
have pending and then also our warehouse
managers use this as a planning tool so
it gives them visibility as to the
freight that's inbound to their terminal
and also the freight that's outbound so
they can plan their nightly shifts and
figure out how to best position trailers
at at the warehouses so they can get
unloaded and then loaded into the
delivery trailers as efficiently as
possible so this is the first iteration
of this application actually and it's
going to be going through some pretty
extensive refinements and I see that my
menus of gotten chopped off there so
hopefully I'm able to to do this so in
the planning application let's so Linda
actually owns about 50 operating
companies that each operated in their
own sort of niche market the five big
ones though are listed in this drop-down
and they're the primary users this this
application so Linda international is
one of our air freight forwarders so
I'll go ahead and pick a say I want to
be looking for Linda international
shipments and see since we're in San
Francisco why don't we see what Freight
is
coming and going and there's actually
the search button all the way over there
on the side and there we go so it's
going out there and querying our
database through Web Services
this application is backed by a universe
database and I always like to ask this
question just out of curiosity how many
people out there using universe okay you
know that's Doug I work with Doug you
are so I guess so I should rephrase the
question has anybody heard of universe
no okay that's too bad because my
manager authorized me to hire anybody on
the spot that answered yes to that
question and nobody has had answered yes
to that question so the the application
goes picks up the data from the database
and organizes it by destination this
table here is by guide soft which is a
third party commercial library for swing
applications and it gives us a little
more flexibility over the regular J
table in that you can sort by multiple
columns you can filter so it allows the
user to kind of drill down and only see
the information that they they want to
see and then also the the table gives
you the ability to nest other tables
inside of it so if the if the warehouse
manager wants to see all the Freight
that's outbound to Honolulu they can
expand the Honolulu table row and this
is showing them all the shipping
containers at that location that are
heading for Honolulu
then they can drilled into that further
to get actual information about the
shipments themselves a shed Minh can
have multiple pieces of freight got
multiple boxes for example or multiple
pallets and so the user wants to then
see more details about the actual
freight that's part of the shipment they
can double-click on the the shipment and
it brings up some various pieces of
information about the shipment or the
the freight on that shipment as well as
any scan events which we're using these
barcode scanners in the warehouse but
this application ties into that so that
the user can see the history of that
particular piece of freight the the
customer service application or moduli I
won't get too much into that because the
user interface looks very similar it's
just organizing this data by customers
rather than by locations so now that
kind of showed you how this UI looks
we're gonna be completely changing it in
the next revision of this application
and we're gonna be implementing all
these components with JavaFX rather than
using the tables that we have here the
the feedback that we're getting is just
an overwhelming amount of data that the
users are looking at especially when
they're at a really busy facility that
has you know hundreds or thousands of
shipments going in out of it every week
so we're we're gonna try to condense the
data and make it more clear to the users
by only including the absolute minimum
amount of information that they need to
make their decisions and then I go ahead
and demo the trading app so I've been
reworking the user interface on this and
so I wasn't able to demo it on Sunday
when I had hoped to and my hypothesis
was that the amount of progress I would
make this week on refining this
application was going to be inversely
related to the amount of beer I consumed
and that was actually actually the case
so I'm
I'm I don't have the actual automated
trading piece of this particular
strategy up and running yet but I was
able to incorporate some JavaFX charts
and some other widgets to kind of polish
the UI up a little bit so what this
application does is I can write a
trading strategy as a plug-in and then
have it imported into the application
and I'm using Interactive Brokers as the
trading platform provider for the market
data and executing the trades and I'll
just show you what their UI looks like
so they have this is a this is a Java
desktop application that they've written
and it's going out there and showing
real-time prices on some various
financial instruments including crude
oil corn swiss francs so this
application has a Java API built in and
so we can write programs that interface
with this application and then this
application that goes ahead and actually
places the trades so this application
that I wrote which is called arbitrator
because it initially wrote it to take
advantage of some arbitrage
opportunities that mean a the other
people I work with have identified and
each one of these sort of plugins are
implement as their own netbeans plugin
so potentially we could have different
market data providers I only have
Interactive Brokers just listed here but
you could have a plugin for Yahoo data
and for Google Finance as well and
there's lots of other data providers out
there as well has ability so each node
that you see in the project's window is
a separate module for its so each
top-level node is own separate abstract
plugin and then the things that you see
once you expand me like the market data
that's an interactive brokers
implementation of the of the market data
module
and so there's there's other various
pieces of data that can be used to
construct these real-time trading
strategies so some of them need
historical data so that can go query
Interactive Brokers and say give me the
prices of British pounds for the last 24
hours which I'll I'll show here so so
the only strategy I have had since I've
Reap and reworking the UI that's
actually in the UI right now is a
strategy that I've worked very hard on
for this presentation called
buy low sell high so depending on what
brokers and market data providers are
configured you can have the the strategy
subscribe to any one of those so the
really cool thing about the NetBeans
platform is there's this loose coupling
between all the plugins which is really
cool because I can throw another plug in
there for mug in in there for market
data and the application will discover
at runtime
what implementations are available so I
have two implementations of the market
data provider here for example so so all
this this basically initializes strategy
and then the GUI will come up and
hopefully so I'm saying I want to
monitor the British Pound exchange rates
the trade size is 25 British Japan
25,000 British pounds and the name of
the strategy called gtp strategy and
cool I came up
so yeah the resolution is little crying
just looked a lot better before I was
running it on this thing here so this is
a JavaFX chart right here and the rest
of these components are just plain old
swing swing components so the real-time
prices are displayed up here this these
are just hard-coded labels right now but
when the when the application makes a
trade the time the trade was closed out
the amount of time that it was in that
trade for as well as a profit or loss is
just displayed there so I'll go ahead
and connect to the two Interactive
Brokers and it's really cool if I could
see the rest of this chart but it's
basically using a these are called
Candlestick charts and they show it in
the ensemble demo and it made it appear
that it was actually one of the base
charts in the Java effects library but
it's not it's a custom chart so it took
me a little bit to actually get this
working so and then you can see up here
the prices are being updated in real
time from via the the Interactive
Brokers API so the next step definitive
finish this off is to actually have it
place the trades and then update this
trade window here so cool
so this is something that you planning
to use for yourself or you want to yeah
the seeker was a this is something for
myself and a couple other people that I
develop trading strategies with so it's
supposed to it's to make you know cuz I
have a day job though so this this
places the trades automatically and yeah
we it's not something we want to want to
publish because it gives us somewhat
competitive edge in trading so I got
thanks a lot
let's switch to Sweden and Henry yes
Henry from Sweden with Thomas from
Sweden with the Thomas from Sweden here
and we've been working for quite a while
on a product called BL economy it's a
small business solution for people
wanting to do their accounting invoicing
salaries stuff like that and what we're
looking at on this page is like an
overview for there for this made-up
company and I think what we're looking
at right here is probably where we will
start to inject JavaFX
instead because I don't know if you
agree but I think your swing has taken
quite a beating this week and and it's
obviously it this page doesn't represent
a certain problem that we need to have
solved but having to to sort of walk the
JavaFX way is something in itself that
if we feel that we must start and this
is probably where we're
we'll begin so it's quite probable that
I'll come back next year and and and do
a presentation on how it went because
what we have here is a this this is a
client the data itself is it's a hosted
solution we have a server we use spring
GPA hibernate all the expected stuff and
it's offered as a subscription and we
have a little more than two thousand
subscribers right now doing a monthly
subscription it it's it's increasing
quite rapidly so so that too has to be
taken into consideration when when we
start messing around with a platform
because our customers tend to be quite
conservative as far as changes and what
to expect I mean if they know what they
have now but they'd you know so that has
to be taken into consideration as well
and yeah you can enter business events
just made-up numbers and it's entered
into the list of events that you later
on can browse and see how your company
is doing pretty much and I'm not gonna
go into detail about the program's
functionality but I will say this that
if you look at most of the showcase
applications it is my opinion that most
of them are made to to fit the needs of
the large organizations most likely
in-house products or at least made to
fit a certain organization's needs
whereas we we actually sell this product
for all three major platforms and users
that may or may not know what Java is
may or may not know what you know how
any any installation related incidents
will most likely show up on our radar so
radar as sooner or later so we have a
quite skilled a a couple of guys and
girls that work with the supporting
those people it's not it's not yet it's
not a huge challenge but it's it's it's
still it's it's there
other than that well
you can just click around a little bit
so so this would be a good candidate for
or not so much this but but your browser
for replacements with with with the
JavaFX WebKit implementation yeah so I
think so and also a very common question
is why did we not make this a web
browser solution to start out with
because most of our competition did and
that actually can be answered a has a
lot of answers to do that but the
browser we feel is like the jack of all
trades master of none so unless you are
willing to put enormous effort and we
built this on the equivalent of about
two full-time people a little larger
team but about two or three people built
this and so we we we profited hugely on
the on the platform one that was already
done and to where we could build this we
feel very dynamic user experience you
can click here and it updates here and
there is a very fluent experience we
feel and we could do that with
very little effort compared to a lot of
other solutions and and so we would
either get stuck in if we were to take
the same team size and and go the web
way we could either end up stuck in
static real old land or else have to
have a much larger team this because
even though you can do stuff with Ajax
and and I don't know Google web toolkit
and all the other frameworks it takes a
lot of work
this conference
I think the question
the end of the desktop
well nature
we is talking about that a lot and my my
opinion is that if everything is to be
consumed through a browser and there
really isn't a difference between an
operating system in the browser anymore
and so you could omit either one which
would end up being the browser in my
opinion and then you'd gone full circle
so you're back to the difference between
a very well the difference between an
application like this and a browser base
based application doing the same stuff I
think I think we want to have this
conversation in three or four years
because it's not gonna be we've seen the
tools this week you can you can compile
native installers for most stuff we're
talking about and so the browser's role
as infrastructure for these kinds of
jobs I don't think I don't think it's
gonna be considered important in a
couple of years just my false
yeah sure I generally find that in the
stuff that I work on extremely high
performance responsive interfaces is
absolutely crucial for the stuff that I
do and right now the browsers can't do
it
but then there's questions of are they
gonna be able to do it give it a little
bit more hardware give it a little bit
more time are they gonna be able to do
it maybe but at the same time as they're
able to do that I'll be able to use the
desktop enter a desktop program do the
same thing and save you CPU usage which
will give you a better battery life on
the go which will still be just as
relevant then as it is now well I don't
think html5 is mature and it will not be
for the next couple of years I think and
well in our case we work with farmers
and farmers do not always have a very
good internet connection and with the
rich client application they are able to
walk on the field with the laptops and
enter data and as soon as they if they
have a fully working application even
the map just works and they just enter
back to the farm and when they have a
connection again it will synchronize
with the server and well that kind of
functionality will be a long time until
we have that in the browser and what why
would we want to have that in the
browser not everything has to be the
same just difference in effort
everything has its place that also
similarly the liquid robotics demo by
James Gosling this morning he was using
world wind in south swing and he seemed
perfectly fine with that and he was
actually saying this is a wonderful
combination and not everything in the
world is HTML based and I think I think
there the question is whether this is a
niche and and how large that niches and
if these cases are all exceptions and if
but then if you add up all of those
exceptions if you then get to a larger
hole then you're not in an issue anymore
I think the the swing world is
bigger than it seems because the web
people are just making more noise yeah
it's true okay I'm just gonna wrap this
up if I just wanted to show you what
we've done with customizing the look and
feel I have two instances running it
looks black but you can come and watch
it on my computer as well later on if
you want to see it we just customized
the Nimbus look and feel so we think it
looks quite nicely
and we also added another experimental
looking fee let's see if I can get that
running as well just to sort of showcase
that you can do a pretty nice stuff in
swing as well it's restarting and it's
come on okay just like that so there are
ways to make swing look nice as well
thank you thanks let's switch to the
family Speaker Stephen and Garrick is in
the audience with an application in the
reservoir management in the oil and
shale gas business
I need the HDMI are standing in there no
I got plugged in I just need the read
button
you don't
I press the thread
Charlie their cochlear
yeah but now I can't see my screen
I have the other school now
this is gonna be interesting because I
can't see it unless I'm stood on a ski I
was the chief application architect at
object reservoir and just this last July
object was what was was acquired by and
by Halliburton so now look the
Halliburton employees so good so let's
skip here the product that I'm going to
talk about today is called limits will
blow up about it basically it's a
legible engineering tool and we're
trying to help estimate the uncertainty
and the future performance of the wells
let's go ahead and see if I can get the
demo okay
so this is the tool here and that means
fun the numbers platform and as you
notice when the first if I can get my
mouse there we go
when the app first comes up we have a
few workflow steps an idea behind this
is we start with the simple step and get
more complex as you go foo so the
initial thing we load in production data
which is loaded into a database Excel
spreadsheet other stuff like that
and then we pull up specification data
and into that and each step gets more
complex as it goes and gets more
information out and some things about
these workflow steps each one is a
module suite they have their own
persistence entities in them their own
UI definitions and everything is the
Foley pluggable you can add in new steps
take out steps I think the the version
that jerk showed earlier had a few more
steps in there and
a lot of that was we working the ones we
had probably took about a week to be
able to customize all that and I can
show you in NetBeans this is the layer
file that we're using to define those
steps one of the workflow steps that we
have and it's all declarative in the UI
told you where the data is coming from
where it goes in the UI and everything
so it's just one layer file that you can
edit and change around and that will you
know we define what is in your workflow
step mmm and a couple other things we
have that's unique in here that haven't
seen any well this is the way that we're
defining our entities we'll go over just
some more interesting ones over here it
said I can't see my screen so what we
have here is this is an individual bean
and these are the properties are the
attributes that are on that beam because
we have a scientific application we
needed to actually add units to those
values so to be able to get the value
and the unit to go with the attribute
and with the bean is what we did is we
took each attribute from the bean made
it its own being with different
attributes one being the label one being
the value and one be in the unit and
displayed those in an outline view with
the actual bean being on the table and
then a couple other beans that don't
really exist being the values in there
other things that that helped us do if I
can get
a tooltip is not coming elf because my
tooltip is coming up on the other
monitor we have range validation on here
that's also defined in the beans and
that is actually defined one into two
one in two different ways we have added
annotations for attributes for the beans
that you can put and you can actually
add in the ranges in that or if I can
find the other way we did it is what the
resource file so in the resource file we
actually have this line by here which is
defining what the min and Max values for
these in these attributes and our beans
and if I come in here and one of these
see if I can move that so I entered in
an invalid range it pulls up a dialog
box telling me another invalid range
have the ability from the style log to
either specify a minimal value you know
the value that really I wanted or what I
can also do is accept this valid is in
this value as correct even though it's
comes invalid and what that does is that
cancels the veto event that was thrown
to pull up the dialog box and lets it go
through as if it wasn't vetoed and then
get set now we know the value is outside
Elaine so able to display that this
might be a problem they did something
weird
they've specified a value that's outside
range shows up those you know
highlighted with little exploration bar
that says watch out about this
the last thing that I think is pretty
unique about what we have here is as I
mentioned about the workflow steps each
workflow step has its own module suite
and it defines its entities that were
using in the database so we have one
database for the project one entity
manager and a whole bunch of different
modules that we don't know until one
time what entities are going to be in
there so we're using Eclipse link to
three in the composite
was it the composite entity factor we go
managers don't see on that so yes so
we're using the composite entity
managers to actually take each one of
these individual persistence XML files
and combine them into one entity manager
the only thing that we kind of had to do
which is a little tricky on that is we
don't know what jar files to use when
the app is built we only know when the
app is run by what modules are loaded so
we had to actually create own persistent
unit info add the jar files at one time
and then create the entity manager and
it works really nice of getting a lot of
dynamic persistence coming in there and
stuff like that
but in thanks
you know I want to answer how many
seconds it took how many yeah it was
very easy and one of the first thing I
wrote the Twitter about it but it was it
was so easy that developer I have no
reason anymore to not write help for the
uses and we actually we migrated all
documentation to the help and the whole
user manual is now in the help as well
and it's really easy to link the help
with the GUI component so you have a
really good interaction with and you yes
yes so in the in this session that's
coming up from 2:00 to 3:00 in the
getting started with the NetBeans
platform we'll be sure to include that
if you come
don't inhale yeah just add what we're
doing this project is run by a book
publishing company and so we have tons
of people that know the domain and want
to contribute to our help like that but
they ended up not wanting to edit it
within this tool so we ended up actually
setting up a wiki for them to attend to
the data and/or the information and then
we wrote a project that pulled the data
out of it out of the wiki and and you
know compiled time in and added it to
our source so that's how we ended up
getting it about making it available to
the ones that actually knew that the
stuff that we wanted to include and he
yes
good decisions we make
devices too
well that if you can't include job
effects you are going to have modules
that are off JavaFX enough swing the
problem is in in the domain because you
have domain objects you want to attach
listeners to listen to data change but
swing listeners are different from
yourself effects listeners hmm so you
will have to include Java effects in
your domain modules as well which is a
bit weird because beans are beans and it
doesn't really matter if they are gel 5x
beans or sweetened beans or they're just
data containers but that's a bit orkut
indeed and I think we will have to end
up chaining and listeners to support
both swing NGO perfection
everybody everybody
exactly
no no the our tutorial is describing how
to get started and Paul and Gail have
done a session tutorial session this
week showing you how to integrate JavaFX
charts into you into an application and
there isn't an official standard way of
how to do these things but there are
different solutions of people are
working on and maybe that can percolate
up to an official approach at some at
some point right well it's it's patch in
the sense of how do you put JavaFX
charts into a jfx panel and that's the
standard way of integrating java effects
into into swing
No yeah but I think I think but part of
the answer is also that different people
are working on solutions and and once
once that have been discussed and and
and blogged about and whatever does can
percolate up to two becoming some a
special kind of standard yes
yeah
to make
you know right now the bridge is purely
the JFX panel that's that's it
probably everybody yes yep yes we are
yeah I think that's one of the key
reasons why people use the nettings
platform in the first place we had
currently support three kinds of sensors
but it's very unlikely a farmer has all
three
so we disabled them all by default and
the farmer can just pick whatever
hardware here yes we've gone slightly
over our time are there other questions
at this point if not feel free to come
up afterwards and also remember that
there's a session which will be pure
coding no slides showing you how to get
started with the knitting's platform
from 2:00 to 3:00 in continental
ballroom seven eight nine thanks for
