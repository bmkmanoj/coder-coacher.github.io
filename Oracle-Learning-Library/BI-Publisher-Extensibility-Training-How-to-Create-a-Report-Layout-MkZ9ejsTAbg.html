extensibility training in this lesson I
will demonstrate how to create a report
layout including creating some sample
data copying them the Mendham and
existing report and then creating and
uploading a new RTF layout first of all
navigate to the catalog on your VIP
server
next navigate the web catalog hierarchy
to find a data model for the report that
you wish to modify will use this data
model to generate the XML for the sample
data
when you have navigated
model click on edit
once you have opened up the data model
click on the get XML output button
located in the top right hand corner
this will open
Greenwich allows you to run the data
model into appropriate values for all
the parameters select the number of rows
that you wish to be returned and then
click on the Run button
in this lesson we are choosing the
option export XML which will save the
XML to a local directory allowing us to
use it later with the RTF template
builder alternatively if you wish to use
the online template builder you can
choose the option save as sample data
choose the local directory where you
wish to save the XML then click on save
now that you have saved the XML the next
step is to make a copy of the report to
do this navigate to the catalog navigate
to the report
once you have navigated a report click
on the icon to select the report
once the report is selected click on the
copy button
then click on the post button to copy
the report
click on the newly created report and
then navigate down to the rename link so
you can change the name to something
more meaningful
in the pop-up window enter the new name
for the report and then click on the
rename button some reports are
configured to view only through an
external application or through the
Oracle Enterprise scheduler if you wish
to view a report online while you're
customizing it
click on edit to change the report
properties once the report is open click
on the properties button check the
options run report online and show
controls and then click OK
once you have created your custom report
in the VIP catalog the next step is to
create your custom RTF layout to do this
open up Microsoft Word a prerequisite
for this step is to ensure that you have
the template builder forward adding
installed once installed you can
navigate to the template builder forward
add-in by the Microsoft Word menu if you
did not already have the template
builder forward adding installed you can
download it from the home page of your
VIP server
the first step when creating a new RTF
layout is to load some sample data via
the bi publisher add-in select the
sample data that you created earlier
once the sample
data has been loaded you won't see any
visible changes to the RTF layout but
now you can use the sample data start
adding in headers and other fields so
first of all we'll add in a header which
will store the title for the report
in this example we are just adding a
plain text header we're not actually
using any other fields from the sample
external data
have a navigate
back to the main body or the RTF layout
you can now start adding fields and
tables by the bi-polar add-in and this
example I've chosen to add a table you
can drag and drop any fills or groups
that you wish to see in a report from
the datasource side to the template side
the preview window shows you how the
reports going to look for the purposes
of this demonstration I'm just going to
create a simple customer listing
therefore I'm going to drag the group
customer across to the template side
there are some fields under the customer
group that I didn't want to appear in
the report therefore have deleted these
from the templates I'd leave in just
three Phil's customer number puts my
name and personal that reg number
haven't clicked there okay you can now
see the changes reflected in your RTF
layout once you are happy with the
report layout you just save the document
it's important that you save the layout
as an RTF
you
once you have saved your document is
possible to preview the report using the
sample data that you loaded earlier in
this case we're previewing the report as
a PDF Microsoft Word will then generate
the PDF document using the sample data
that you loaded once you are happy with
your report layout you can upload it to
the VIP server under the new custom
report that you've just created
once you have uploaded the report is
possible to run the report and view the
output in the new layout in the run
report screen into appropriate values
for all the parameters
you can view your new report by clicking
on the tab corresponding to your new
custom report layout if you would like
your new custom report layout to be the
default chosen you can do this by
navigating to the viewer list link the
top right hand corner
you
once you've checked the default layer
option save the report there's the end
of the demonstration on how to create
some sample data copy the mend an
existing report and to create an upload
a new RTF layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
