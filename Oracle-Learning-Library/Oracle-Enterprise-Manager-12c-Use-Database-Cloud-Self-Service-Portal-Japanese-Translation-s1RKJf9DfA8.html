use of database cloud self-service
portal by a self-service user the
self-service user has a special login
into enterprise manager none of the
global menus like enterprise and set up
are visible to the self-service user and
they are exposed to only the
self-service or cloud capabilities of
enterprise manager to get access to
additional Enterprise Manager
capabilities the self-service user will
have to request additional privileges
from the self-service administrator to
request a database ensure that none of
the coder limits have exceeded and click

the desired service template by looking
at the description and the details
provided like version memory CPU and
other options by default a unique
request name is generated for this
request select the desired zone and
click Next provide a username and

database to two weeks and click Next
review the request summary and click
Submit to submit this request note that
a new request is now visible under the
my requests table also the coder limit
for number of databases has gone up to 2
the memory and storage coder limits
would be updated once the database has
been provisioned click refresh to update
