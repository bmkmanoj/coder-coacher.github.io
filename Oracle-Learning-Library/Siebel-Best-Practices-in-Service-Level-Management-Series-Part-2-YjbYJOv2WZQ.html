cloud control 12c demo series focusing
on the best practices for simple
applications management this screen
watch is part of a series on service
level management or SLM for simple
applications this is our second screen
watch in our series on civil service
level management in our previous screen
watch we showed how to recursively
synthetic transaction using open script
in this demo we will create a service to
execute our synthetic transitions at
regular intervals to evaluate the
performance of various business flows as
these transitions are run periodically
it is possible to determine the
degradation in the PDS function by
evaluating the performance of the
synthetic transactions here is the
several steps in creating service using
synthetic transactions first step
provides basic service configuration
such as naming the service choose the
appropriate time zone and associate the
service with a proper system the second
step provides configuration to define
the availability based on system or
service tests third step has the
configuration required to define or
recur service tests fourth tab offers
the required steps to create new beacon
targets or advocate Argos to this
service target 5th step offers how to
configure performance metrics based on
service tests or system components sixth
step is similar to Phil step to define
usage metrics for a service based or
system components fifth step and six
steps are an optional step that you can
configure later roster shows the final
review of the entire configuration
before actually create the service in
the third screen watch of this series
will show you how to mind her and make
the service that we created in this
screen watch so let's get started all
create a service in enterprise media
call control once you launch the
Enterprise Manager crowd control 12c go
to Sara
at Target and select a generic service
our first step is to set the general
information so name our generic service
as SIBO service and choose the time zone
that match my local region Pacific time
and if you want mitre the system usage
we need to associate the system with
this service a system is the
infrastructure used to host one or more
services it has components such as host
databases in other targets in case of
civil monetary it is recommended to
associate the Sybil Enterprise as a
system for this service now pick Sybil
Enterprise as my target type and choose
the one that my Sheba enterprise is
configured click Next in this step we
define the availability of the service
based on either system or service test
we choose service test because we want
to monitor the availability of the
service when users are able to access
the service target service target based
on service test provides the way to
monitor the service in various locations
which will be covered in the next steps
here we define the service test by
choosing the test type as a test
transaction and name our test a civil
test and collection frequency I will set
as a PI minute and here we need to
upload the zip file that we exported in
the previous screen watch once you
choose the zip files that you can export
it in the preview screen watch click
continue and it will upload that zip
file that we created and once the file
has been uploaded you can see the detail
steps of our transactions down in the
script information also for our ATS test
type metrics such as
total time conduct time all of these
metrics are collected as well click Next
in this step we can add or create the
beacon can add button week on is the
location where an user access the
application from if the customer access
the application from multiple locations
you may want to monitor the behavior of
BT's flow from each of that location in
order to execute and data transition
periodically from any given geographical
location at least one become must be
deployed in this demo I'll choose New
York office as my beacon click select
once beacon has been added and if you
want to add more because or if you want
to remove the existing because you can
do that after the service has been
created as well click Next since we
added beacon to our service now we can
create the matrix the following choose
desk profiles matrix and you city matrix
are optional step and you can configure
after the service has been created as
well to create a preference matrix
lesson select based on service you can
just based on system but in this demo
I'll choose based on service test
because I want to mind her the
performance of my service click go and
choose the metrics that you want to
monitor out of box we have status total
time connect time first by time by the
download time forms total time from
server time forms database time and DNS
lookup time as a matrix per performance
for this demo I'll choose a total time
total time is the total response time of
my service and the beacon is my new
office in case you have a multiple
because it'll show down here and you can
choose the multiple beacons as well
click continue after I select my
promised matrix I need to set the dress
hall for my metric for my total response
time my warning threshold was set for a
seconds for critical threshold our cell
for 10 second the next
here will define the usage matrix
click Add for usage a matrix
I'll choose civil server as my target
group since I want to monitor to my
system usage on CB server level and
collecting metrics for both of my Siebel
servers I will choose the metric for
city usage continue once we set the
usage metrics need to set the threshold
for the metric I will set 85% for
warning and 90% for critical threshold
my CPU usage click Next last step is
reviewing of our configuration of the
service tests it shows all of my
configuration to review and if you're
satisfied with this configuration you
can click finish button now that we
complete our configuration of the
service we can see that our service has
been created on the service page click
our service civil service this brings
the home page of our service
this shows the performance and usage
killed test summary key components
review summary and all the service
instance let's click system tab it will
show our key components information down
here as I mentioned earlier if you want
to add more preference metrics or usage
metrics you can do so by going
monitoring configuration click
performance matrix and you can add or
delete or edit of your performance
matrix similarly you can do that for
usage metrics as well and if you want to
add more beacons or remove the existing
beacons you can do at the service
testing beacons 10 and if you want to
verify the service that we just created
click the verify service task and choose
the beacon in this case we have only one
beacon your office and click the perform
test this is the result of our service
test it shows our total time conduct
time for spite time and the rest of the
data click continue
in this demo we show how to create the
service based on the synthetic
transaction we created in the previous
screen watch
in summary modeling service tests
provides the way to monitor the penis
flow proactively Rani's in territory
nation periodically and from various
location provides a direct way of
measuring the rear and user experience
for multiple penis services also the
execution of center a transaction
provides the user perspective of the
service availability and performance
which can be used to determine the
service level agreement between the user
and the service provider so now that we
create a service based on hours in
direct relation and define all the
performance and usage metrics we will
demonstrate how to create service level
agreement in our next series of demo our
next demo will also show the various
kinds of SLA based dashboard and report
this concludes part 2 of civil best
practices on service level measurement
