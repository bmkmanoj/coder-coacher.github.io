Oracle's K splice technology this
tutorial will demonstrate using Oracle's
unbreakable Linux Network web interface
to subscribe to the case splice channel
using the yum utility to install the
case ply subtract software package using
the up track utility to install case
splice kernel updates and also the use
of the case splice web interface for
this tutorial I'm using a virtual
machine in Oracle VM VirtualBox
I have Oracle Linux 7 installed on this
virtual machine I'm currently logged in
as the root user and the system is also
registered with uln if I type in yum
repo list it says the system is
receiving updates from you all in refer
to the uln video tutorial for
demonstration of registering the system
with uln you can also see that this
system is subscribed to two channels the
unbreakable enterprise kernel release 3
for Oracle Linux 7 and also the Oracle
Linux 7 lightest Channel
I'm already logged on to you all in I'll
open up my browser window here and
you'll see that I have a system that's
registered it's called uon - video -
demo I'll click on my system name to
manage my subscriptions so down here in
the middle you can see that I'm
currently subscribed to two channels the
Yui k released 3 for Oracle set Linux 7
and also Oracle Linux 7 lightest I'm
going to click manage subscriptions and
you can see that I have some available
channels here and one of which is k
splice so I'm going to subscribe to this
case vise channel by selecting it here
as an available channel click the arrow
key to move it over to my subscribe
channels and click Save subscriptions
and it will tell you up here at the top
that the subscriptions are saved so now
I'm going to click channels and this is
a list of all my channels but I just
want to see the channels for Oracle
Linux seven so I'll select Oracle Linux
seven from the drop down box and you can
see here that the case splice channel
has 20 packages so I'll click on this
package link you'll see the available
packages for this channel one of the
packages here is a client for case by
subtract reboot list kernel update
service this up track here version 1.2
20 20 - 0 so this package needs to be
installed and now that I'm subscribed to
this channel I can install this package
just using a yum command so I'm going to
minimize my browser window
now I'm back to my terminal window and
if I run yum repo list again you'll see
that I now have three channels that I'm
subscribed to the K spice channel is has
been added so I can install that up
track package just by saying yum install
object
so this goes through a little effort to
find that the dependencies and it's
going to install the up track package
but it's also going to install three
dependent packages so I'm just going to
click yes
so you can see that the package was
installed as well as the three dependent
packages I'm going to open up my web
interface again to the uln
and I also want to point out some other
packages here there's all of these
reboot lists updates for case fly
subtract reboot list kernel update
service so there's all these packages
here for different versions of the
kernel there's some 310 0.1 23 versions
there's some 3.8 13 - 35 versions
there's also some 3.8 13 - 44 versions
I'm going to minimize this again this
window and run a command you name - are
this tells me the version of the kernel
that I'm currently running and it's 3.8
13 - 44.1 dot 1 and if I open up the web
interface again you'll see that I do
have reboot 'less updates for this
kernel 3.8 dot 13 - 44.1 dot 1
next I'm going to access the K splice
web interface I'm going to open up a new
window on my browser URL is HTTP colon
slash slash up track k splice com so the
oracle case by system status window
appears says this interface is now using
oracle single sign-on accounts for
authentication and i have a single
sign-on account so I'm going to click I
am ready to log in with my Oracle SSO
account so I enter my username and
password
click sign in
now I have you'll see on this screen
your email is associated with multiple K
splice accounts this probably won't be
the case for you but I do have a couple
a couple of accounts so I need to select
one and I'm going to select this one
down here and hit submit the system
status window appears the access key is
blacked out for this example but you can
see I have one active machine is out of
date and this is my machine down here I
have zero installed and there's one
update available auto update is set to
no this is a configuration parameter in
the app track comm file if you set this
directive to yes then k splice will
automatically download and install the
updates using a cron job it gives you
the kernel product you ek3 the original
kernel the effective kernel and the
version of the up track package that we
installed there's a couple links down
here installations instructions and
removal instructions you can also setup
groups you can create a group and then
put machines into different groups just
for management purposes so I'm going to
go ahead and click the link to my system
here
and now gives you the status window and
you can see here that there is one
available update and no updates have
been installed some information here on
the Left also hostname IP address last
reported the version whether auto
install is set to be on kernel
information about the kernel those type
of things you can deny a machine from
from receiving updates currently it's
set to allow updates so it says there's
one update available I'm going to bring
up the terminal window and clear my
screen here and I'm going to run some up
track commands I run up track show it
says there were no updates installed and
that corresponds with what's shown here
on the webpage no updates installed if I
run the same command with a dash dash
available flag
it tells me that there is an available
update which again corresponds with
what's on the webpage to install that
update I run up track F grade and I can
use them - wide to go ahead and apply
that upgrade immediately tells me it's
going to install this remote denial
service CVE and it's installing it right
now
it's done it did not it did not change
my effective kernel I'll show you that
my original kernel version and my
effective kernel version is still the
same but that's because there was only
one update if there was multiple updates
that were applied then the effective
kernel would be would be updated as well
if I minimize this now and if i refresh
my screen now it says there are no
updates available and then one update
has been installed I go back to list my
machines it gives me the same
information here my system is up to date
one has been installed
I'll open up my terminal window again
and clear my screen if I run the up
track show available it says they are
not available if I run up Jack show it
shows me that there's one that one has
been installed if I show the kernel
version with au name minus R this is the
original kernel version if I run the up
track you name - our command this is the
effective kernel version again if there
was a lot of updates applied the
effective kernel version would have
incremented as well you can remove
updates if I still
I notice it says please specify an ID or
use the - - all argument to remove
everything so if I want to remove that
specific update I would have to include
the ID which in this case was c wy 8 4 9
XP
and then you're prompted if you want to
go ahead and I'm just going to say now
so this concludes the demonstration of
que splice it's a method of allowing you
to apply updates to kernel without
having to reboot thank you for taking
the time to watch this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
