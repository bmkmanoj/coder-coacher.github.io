on on the beans and today I would like
to talk about how we can use servers to
make it easier to develop large
applications or at least see if he can
do that so first of all I Oh show this
slide and buy it for a short time but
I'm sure you you have seen it many times
today and now let me continue with this
motivation for for looking at into into
service and big projects and so on like
into for motivation in for looking for
simplifications for large applications
well today I see that we are facing big
projects the inner beans have like
85,000 car seats in the like coronet
mean suppository now I'm anymore in
netbeans contrapositive a there are many
more petrol out throughout the world in
a bean pole in the beans modules in
jdeveloper let me say days at least
160,000 classes but it's not not quite
clear if that is the whole jdeveloper
it's sam profile that that we are using
in openjdk in a bit of open GDK that you
can make there is more than 26,000
classes and if you would get the
co-surgeon k it will be even bigger so
the project's people working on a pretty
big but each of these developers is not
working on the whole project all the
time like
not not not every develop developer is
editing one cause in this part of the
project and one class in another
typically develop s work on some small
part and they work on that for a long
time and actually the developer may not
even have some deeper knowledge about
about the rest of the system he may have
some vague idea that that there are
other parts of the system but not
nothingness in karaoke and think that
even even more complicated when you
consider external clients external
plugins because the like is a core
developers may not even actively know
that there are there is a particular
plug-in and folder for the developer
it's pretty difficult to search code or
two to think about or to work with
school that is outside his his basic
work inside but sometimes at least at
least while working on on the marker
parts we need to see the whole
application or whole project and analyze
the big project s SS s 0 for example we
may look at an API method that is that
does something that we don't completely
understand it may not be documented
perfectly so we would like to see who is
using that method and the user of the
method can be module we never heard
about if you look up puke up the users
of the colors of the metal we can decide
whether we want to buy during the method
or deprecated and hide the clients to
some different way or we can find out
that the method is is used on
two thousand places and almost all of
them look through in the very same way
so that we can get a utility to simplify
to simple i calling the method or to
simplify the work of the kind developers
and to decide whether the method should
be deleted deprecated or whether we need
to create a utility fog for this we need
to analyze the whole project another
example is that we can have an interface
with a metal and it's documented that
the metal should should never return now
and suddenly someone is satanic now some
other module we may be never heard about
but the problem is that we actually
don't know what is the class that the
tatums now you know days someone where
it turns out but we don't know who and
be easier can add some logs and wait
until until the problem happens again or
we can try to hook up all all the
surprises or all these subtypes of the
interface and analyze them and in my in
my experience it's sometimes enough to
find out whether method is used on two
places or two thousand places of often
among doesn't need to actually read the
actual actual occurrences or colors of
the method often it's it's enough to see
idea a lot of users so don't touch this
method it would be very bad to break
this and to to support on one side the
developer who typically works on some
small part and need to see the big
application the big view of the
application in some cases we can use you
can use server that can protest
let me say offline and Stella tively
slowly the whole project and then we can
ask the test I wear blue are the colors
of the method and so on what Idol show
here is used by me and my co developers
on the beans basically on daily basis I
use it quite a lot but it's still
somewhat experimental and I I call it a
romantic support so let me let me show
you what what what it can do so in that
means you have hip this class it is
called fell object that is widely used
and the object basically models a foul
maybe on disk maybe in jar something cry
days and each file has a name sao paulo
Jettas also metal get name which it does
the name of the project and we can try
to see using using this fine table 2 g's
where is it the various this method
called so i will say find usages and in
a few seconds you see that this method
is used on in quite a few modules inside
NetBeans so I I don't have these modules
opened in my ID my ID never heard about
these modules in theory I I may may not
even have resources on my desk and still
get get some results of where this
method is used for comparison let me let
me pick a different method and let me
pick this one and I'll ask the server to
determine various des metal tools and
this this is a pretty old deprecated
metal desk that does something
strange and it is for practical use it
it isn't there but we still see that
there are some some modules that are
using that for example this this code
collaboration module and using this way
we could look up who is using this
method and fix the usage because that
basically every usage of this method is
is at least suspicious and aunt very
strange oh so so what does the server
support at a disk at this time it allows
us to to find classes method methods and
fields by by simple names there a fix
and so on similarly to what can be done
in my beans by either go to type and go
to a simple future it can find the
usages or the places where class method
or field are used it can find subtypes
and overriding methods but this this all
works only in Java so now let me give
you an over how how this works the
survey part is integrated into the
hudson continuous integration server and
hands as one of the builders so when the
project is being built the index ID
indexing path takes the source code Kate
some index and then there is a web
front-end that provides that ipi that
that is the index and answers the grains
and any the clients for deep for this
Web API is either you I on web that that
is then accessed sewer browser or
an ID now let s SS you seen in the pale
slide the index index a sauce co and let
me talk about vai Vai butter with
indexing the source code because the
other alternative is to take the project
artifacts that basically means the jars
and analyze the class files from the
jars but work working on the sauce level
has some advantages first there are some
small part of of source code that I lost
in the translation to class files that
this for example social annotations
these are completely stripped off in
some cases if you type arguments are
installed in the class files and used
imports also are not modeled in the in
the class house in any way also the in
many projects are part of the source
code that do not match to any any part
of the resulting project artifacts this
this is often true for tests the we
build tests are not not part of the
hazel typically or it can be some module
that that is not being built for further
standard solution and so on but we still
want to search even through these these
parts of the source code that I am NOT
not being normally built and probably
the most important feature of running
over the source code is that it allows
us to introduce new features that cannot
be done on the classified level and I
will talk about some of them later the
biggest designer disadvantage of working
on the source code level
but then is that the indexer needs to
have understanding of the project of
what is the cost parts of the surfaces
and so on so it requires some care to
set up the indexing prepare a so this
this bring brings us to what is
supported SS projects that can be
indexed to be honest the indexing on the
server is basically NetBeans without and
UI so basically anything that can be
cleanly opened in netbeans is fine and
both the most common for this would
probably made on as long as the
dependencies for the belt i downloaded
the plugins and and ed Jax the project
depends on had a loaded then the index
we should be able to handle that and of
course if you have nadine's project
either run based or other it should work
as well so now I would like to quickly
quickly say how can we set up the cigar
and i will say how can we set up the
client and then I go to demo showing
showing the setup and how this is used
so basically setting up a cellular
basically means adding the plug in 2 to
Lee Hudson and Vance Vance Hudson is is
a started it automatically downloads the
indexing tool and starts the web
front-end after that and then for a
job that that should do the indexing we
add special belt stab that has the
indexers and the important part again is
that at any point the indexes ironing
the code must be possible
and in the cayenne and in this case in
this case I basically netbeans the
process is maybe even simpler one
installs modules that that support is
this parenting support then there is
necessary to Kate a mapping between the
index and delicate check out currently
and then you can use this the server
side support so let me show you this ok
currently only in the beans I will get
to that at the very end but but the
short answer is no just like this at
this pile or order all right yeah ok so
I I will do that inside inside Hudson
from scratch so I will install the
plug-in and then we need to rest our dad
son ok and it's ok i think it should I
didn't I but if if he doesn't and you
will take me in mail I think I can fix
that but I built against pity alteration
of at some so it should tell about
engineers p well right now it's it's
like downloading in in this case an
ohmic from my desk to the indexing to
and started the web server now letting
Kate educate a project and type I wanna
took to copy the the URL for the
repository from this year
going to run
so
didn't copy enough and this this demo
project is basically a very simple main
project so to build it all almond is to
invoke million three and two index that
we basically do this run indexers and
give it some nice display name so for
example this and when I render built now
it the check out the project build eight
end and ran the indexer and let me use
this time to show the demo project it's
very very simple there is one API class
that has some implantation here and
that's that's basically all this this
implantation is in different name of
modules so dissipated and we can up more
implantations in more maven modules so
the build is done now now the survival
yourself the answer depends if fee if
you will ask so now inside this night
means i have already installed the
plugin that suppose this is a mode craze
so all i need to do is to add them a
pink and i forgot to to copy the past
make it faster okay so
I to specify the the Polka check out
dando then the in the race to the index
can be tunneled through the Hudson cyber
so what you can use is the Hudson URL /
index and that that's the correct rel to
connect to d to the web api for the
index so i said i set up the mapping
between the remote index and i'll go
check out like this this sub-index combo
shows all the poachers that I be indexed
on on the Hudson server so if I would
have more processor to do the indexing
we would see all of them in this in this
combo and after that I can go it's it's
a little boring in this case I can go
and search for the subclass but what was
better now imagine someone else comes
and kate's a new mayor on module and
gets a new implantation of the API cars
so I F escape that does this for me and
this simulates my colleague doing doing
the work creating new implantation of
the of the API interface now if I will
switch back back to add song we see that
the indexing is hanging and once it
Hmong is done and yeah
that day I certain overhead two two to
Ike tie the indexer so for small
projects it takes let me say a little
bit too long but for bigger projects the
actual bark the indexing is bigger than
then starting the index file and now I I
don't have the check out from which this
this API interface comes that doesn't
have the remote change it's not updated
its the the original version that I had
so my IDE has no idea about about this
new class created by someone else and
where else but if you ask the seller it
it shows shows us that there is some
some sub cars that is impact that it
that it doesn't have Oh clay and so we
know that we should we should go to our
working copy and update and after that
this this weekend we can pay under the
remote way and we will get both the old
and the new subclass now there is there
is also a simple web interface today's
well I can select in which projects or
which builds I I want to I want to
search and then in this case this is
this is an index that contains the whole
netbeans and I can do like the object
and it finds all our classes
which we just did you have simple name
which profiles this pattern and we can
go to the file object okay we can't and
I apologize because I don't have network
here and this is depends on on the on
the jQuery nobody from the internet so
I'm sorry okay okay I apologize for this
week we could we put on in the inside
the browser we could search further for
the usages of object and it would get us
the list of files that that use follow
jay now let me go back to the
presentation to let me say my favorite
part and that is what more we can do
with this so one would think we could
achieve this with the server is that we
could have both think that would be
fully a mold we wouldn't require a local
check out it should be good because we
could we could browse through pouches
that we basically never heard about that
are using some of our api's we would see
that the project we never heard about is
using our API we would see how is it
using the API and so on because this
this index Inc works on the source code
level we can relatively easily search
for complicates based based on ashes
because also am
Patrick varies on the server so in
abeyance ef ef language for custom
decorative refactorings and using
basically the same language we could ask
questions like who is using a false
something to disable poll so i will i
will show that like this this is a
really cool demo we can really ask hue
netbeans is disabling code to be false
and get the result that is its these
these people we can ask with enabling
code so if to so it's a different set of
files and we could ask a lot of other
other questions similar to this for our
code we could also find fields that are
globally unused in data analyst in any
any project because sometimes it is
difficult to get it off of a public
field because we are not completely sure
if if it's not used in some very strange
module plugin or whatever so using the
server we could detect that no one we at
least at least heard about this is using
is using the field on a mod like
technical technical part it will be good
to support pine and projects without
without NetBeans metadata because there
are some interesting projects that that
use only playing ant
and also to supper development inside
teams it would be good if we could just
register hot Sun for example internet
beans and get all the configuration for
the project automatically done so
through the Hudson now we are getting to
to the other IDs and eclipse Oh as I
said that deck scantly no eclipse apart
but if you would be interested and would
know how to add this to eclipse it will
be Kate the web api it's easy to call
easy to pass the de result and if you
would be interested in such project
please let me know on this email and do
ang and something so let me let me
conclude this even for pretty big
projects each of the developers is
working on small part typically but
sometimes needs means the context of the
whole project means to see what's
happening in the rest of the project
which is not not very easy to do on on a
month-on-month laptop always so we could
reduce the server to answer answer some
queries for us to help us with these
days bye bye indexing the whole project
on the server and then asking the server
to to answer to answer the place for us
and then there is again a wiki page that
that describes the project and from
where its darlings to the Hudson plugin
and legends begins
so thank you and you have questions or
suggestions oh ok excuse me I oh yeah in
in Hudson Derrek days like the dome
Aidan builder that builds it
I am not sure if that I understand the
question that means is able to directly
open my own projects so yes but yet the
belt is mel and si it's Thunder Hudson
it's I i basically downloaded it from
the Hudson home page
well I'm not sure that it it's about the
passion of negatives do seven ok maybe
pay 72 I I think there are some like
books in into the local maven repository
in infant usages but I don't know much
about about this this part
thank you
I know about gate code and I don't know
either more well I know only about cap
code and I think they're like running
indexing only class files or they are
doing the indexing over class house
which doesn't doesn't allow us or III
don't think it's possible to do some
more fancy stuff using class files and
also this tells you to do it yourself I
don't see that gap coat like for fee cap
code to won't allow you two do fantasyhd
geez on your project yeah I cannot
guarantee del what I think it is
yeah yeah well in innocence IDF index
foreign logins and forge a developer and
he can basically go go through some
legends to Jay top and desire using
completely different everything
good question basically me but well if
if if it sounds good then I like it well
no III didn't mean it this I like that
then there will be more encouragement to
continue and to make it better yeah well
in fact if if you like would like too
tight and report back your experiences
some feedback will be hearing aid this
transition will be available and on and
on the only secure page it's like
written up somehow if something is not
clear email me or like whatever okay
thank you very much
yes it's possible to run it separately
but their hearts and Hudson does some
plumbing between them so it's not that
easy but it is possible but but it's
like doing it in inside Hudson is
basically Theriot or I hope at least it
so basically I take it supporting gooey
it is that is that favor for crew behind
or oh yeah okay I well I I ok so you see
that i didn't i didn't consider that but
maybe i should maybe maybe i should look
into that yeah
about good good session thank you that
is probably a bit more difficult a
little bit thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
