service with your on-premise identities
currently stored in Microsoft Active
Directory the identity bridge component
of Oracle Identity cloud service enables
synchronization of all identities and
groups from Active Directory into its
own identity store residing in the cloud
in addition you can implement federated
single sign-on between cloud and
on-premise applications by configuring
Active Directory as an identity provider
using the sam'l 2.0 open standard first
let's synchronize users from your
Microsoft Active Directory with the
Oracle Identity cloud service by
installing the identity bridge this
enables you to setup a unidirectional
synchronization from Active Directory to
Oracle Identity cloud service log into
the console as an administrator and
select download and configure from the
identity bridge section once you've
downloaded the software you're presented
with a dialog box which contains a
client ID and secret this is the
credential which allows the identity
bridge agent to communicate securely
with Oracle Identity cloud service next
we install and configure the identity
bridge in the setup wizard enter the
Oracle Identity cloud service URL and
client ID and secret that were issued
earlier connect to Oracle Identity cloud
service and active directory by entering
the credentials for each once connected
select the organization units in groups
we'd like to synchronize from Active
Directory in this case let's select some
of the employees groups the first
synchronization should now run verify
that the synchronization is completed
successfully in the sync history tab
another way to verify that the
synchronization is successful is to
select a user from Active Directory and
ensure that their entry appears in
Oracle Identity cloud service in this
case the user Clarence saladna exists in
both user stores now that we've
synchronized Active Directory users with
Oracle Identity cloud service let's look
at how to implement federated single
sign-on to applications in this hybrid
environment Oracle Identity cloud
services provides out-of-the-box
integration with sam'l 2.0 identity
providers the sam'l 2.0 specification
defines three roles the principle
typically a user
identity provider and the service
provider in this example the user see
saladna at example.com is the principal
the oracle identity cloud service
console is the service provider an
Active Directory the identity provider
first register Active Directory
Federation services or a DFS as an
identity provider this requires us to
download Federation metadata from a DFS
and register it in the Oracle cloud
service administration console download
the service provider metadata so we can
provide this to a DFS later in the
configuration next register Oracle
Identity cloud service as a trusted
relying party in a DFS by importing the
metadata downloaded previously from
Oracle Identity cloud services then add
claim roles these define what
information about a logged in user is
passed from a DFS to Oracle Identity
cloud service following a successful
authentication here we configure two
claimed rules for Oracle Identity cloud
service as a relying party email and
name ID the email rule defines that the
email address from logged in users will
be sent to Oracle Identity cloud service
the name ID rule defines that the email
address will be presented as name ID to
Oracle Identity cloud service the
configuration is complete let's test the
connection to our identity provider ad
FS in the Oracle Identity cloud service
console by selecting the test login
option with the test login successful we
can enable the connection to complete
the integration
now let's login to Oracle Identity cloud
service using Active Directory
Federation service crew den shows
because the activate logon chooser
option was selected in the identity
provider registration we're presented
with two login options the Oracle cloud
identity services login and the identity
provider login by selecting sign in with
identity provider we're presented with
the ad FS login page after login the
identity cloud service homepage is
displayed confirming that our
integration is fully functional after
configuring federated single sign-on
the user has the ability to perform
certain tasks
such as being able to login using the
Oracle Identity cloud service login or
change their password via the cloud
interface to prevent users from
performing these and other such actions
you need to mark the user as a federated
entity this ensures that the federated
users can't circumvent security the
simplest way to achieve this is to mark
users as federated in the identity
bridge this has the advantage of
automatically setting users from Active
Directory as federated alternatively you
can also manually set users as federated
and the Oracle Identity cloud service
console Oracle Identity cloud service
allows you to leverage your existing
investment in Active Directory
infrastructure with a hybrid on-premise
and cloud environment you can
automatically synchronize your Active
Directory users with Oracle Identity
cloud service and enable single sign-on
to both on-premise and cloud
applications to learn more about what
