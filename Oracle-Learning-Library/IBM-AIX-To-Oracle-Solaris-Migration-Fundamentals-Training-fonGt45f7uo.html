Solaris migration fundamentals training
if you're a technical IT manager IT
architect or system administrator this
training is for you over the next half
hour you'll gain an understanding of the
fundamental requirements for migrating
from AIX to the Oracle Solaris see how
the key operating system technologies
and tools in AIX map into solaris as
well as discovered the key solaris
technologies that are not found in AIX
as such this presentation will be the
starting point in planning your overall
migration we've assumed that you're
familiar with AIX but have limited or no
familiarity with Oracle Solaris AIX an
Oracle Solaris are both based on UNIX
system 5 so the transition to Oracle
servers running Solaris 11 isn't a
difficult one however migrating to any
new platform takes time and effort
particularly if the tools and
technologies used on the new system are
unfamiliar database migration is an
important piece of the migration story
we'll touch on the database migration
tools in this training module but
detailed database migration will be
covered separately once you've completed
this training module you'll be able to
find more detailed information on
various subjects in the Oracle Learning
Library and will provide you links to
key resources in addition look out
future library content covering specific
topics as we have more content planned
to get you started with migration from
AIX to Oracle Solaris this training
module covers software installation and
management data and file systems where
we touch on database migration the
various options for virtualization tools
for assuring the availability of systems
applications and services the
all-important topic of security a brief
look at scripting before finishing by
providing you with some suggestions for
further reading and training to take you
deeper on these subjects the good news
is that AIX and Oracle Solaris have
similar concepts for software
installation and management but the
tools you need to use a different AIX
and Solaris provides similar options for
installing a new instance on a single
system using distributed media or
network installations while AIX an
Oracle Solaris also support automated
installation of multiple systems the
tools are different AIX uses network
installation manager NIM whereas Oracle
Solaris 11 uses automated installer to
provide similar functionality automated
installer automates and batches
installations based on customized or
standardized system profiles enabling
unsupervised installation of multiple
systems in large-scale environments jump
start support is also provided in Oracle
Solaris offering a way for you to host
existing jumpstart environments on top
of Oracle Solaris 11
in addition Oracle Enterprise Manager
ops Center included in Oracle premier
support agreements can be used to manage
multiple systems through a web interface
so in moving from AIX to Oracle you'll
replace network installation manager
with Solaris automated installer when it
comes to software installation and
management Oracle Solaris 11
uses the image packaging system as its
software packaging model image packaging
system provides software management
functionality that similar to rpm
repositories or nim based collections of
file sets on AIX image packaging system
handles the entire software lifecycle
including installation patching upgrades
and removal through the command line and
a GUI interface let's look at midge
packaging system more closely during
installation image packaging system
performs automatic dependency checks and
adds any additional packages and
libraries that are required which
simplifies the installation a snapshot
of the system is taken before each
package installation this provides two
advantages first it ensures that the
system is always in a valid State and
second it enables a rollback in the
event that the package installation
fails perhaps the biggest advantage in
using image packaging system is that it
eliminates patching because the image
packaging system software packaging
model releases updated software packages
that are already integration tested
before they are made available for
download and installation removing the
need for manual analysis to determine
patch interdependencies another key
advantage of image packaging system is
that it provides safe rollback so if a
system reboot is required after an
update the image packaging system
creates a ZFS filesystem boot
environment that you can boot into
should an update fail you can reboot
back into the older boot environment
providing for fail
system updates this can make change
management and system updating much
easier for you to install software IX
uses system management interface tool
Schmitt this is similar to using the
image packaging system package install
command also AIX uses Service update
management assistant to update software
this is similar to using their image
packaging system package update command
moving on to boot environments in AIX
you use fix central Sumer NIM and
Schmitt load entire service packs it's
recommended best practice in AIX to
perform system backups before updating a
system which can be time-consuming but
of course you could choose to create not
disk install to minimize downtime in
contrast Oracle Solaris uses boot
environments these boot environments
take advantage of the built-in Oracle
Solaris ZFS file technology this means
that you can create a snapshot quickly
and use its cloning capabilities to
replicate the active operating system
note that cloning a file system takes
seconds even for large disk arrays the
ability to quickly clone the system
eliminates the need to manually backup
the system before creating a new boot
environment by default a new boot
environment is created automatically
when certain system packages such as key
drivers and kernel components are
updated or when you update all packages
this approach offers you the advantage
of being able to easily roll back to
previous boot environments if any
problems occur
the Oracle Solaris B II ADM BDM utility
is used to manage boot environments
let's move on to looking at managing
data and file systems moving data from
AIX to Oracle Solaris cleanly and
efficiently requires some knowledge of
the target file systems so that you can
determine how best to move data in AIX
the most commonly used disk based file
systems at the IBM proprietary journaled
file system JFS an enhanced journaled
file system JSF 2 in Oracle Solaris 11
the default file system is Oracle
Solaris zettabyte file system or ZFS
some key features of Oracle Solaris 10
FS you'll want to be aware of
after ZFS is a highly scalable 128 bit
file system that lets you manage
virtually unlimited amounts of data
with individual files and systems able
to scale up to 16 extra bytes ZFS
provides data integrity with no silent
data corruption ever because NFS
self-healing feature automatically
repairs data corruption all data is
protected by a 256 bit checksum and data
consistency is maintained at all times
ZFS has built-in data services including
encryption compression and deduplication
as well as providing for infinite
snapshots clones and replication across
systems and sites unlike traditional
file systems that require a separate
volume manager ZFS integrates volume
management functions also so in moving
from AIX to Oracle you'll replace GFS
and JFS 2 with ZFS now let's look at the
options you have for transferring your
data to Oracle Solaris Ted FS as ZFS
doesn't support the air X file systems
you'll perform a data migration there
are two options available important
export and backup and restore in the
import/export option is typically most
effective to use the ZFS shadow
migrations feature first connect the
systems then on AIX make the source file
system read-only and available over NFS
on the Oracle Solaris system create an
Oracle Solaris 10 FS filesystem if the
source is nee IX encrypted filesystem
make sure that as NFS target has
encryption enabled in addition using a
secure subnet is recommended as data
isn't encrypted when sent through the
network then using Oracle Solaris the
devas Shadow migration facilities the
directory structure of the source AIS
file system is moved to the Oracle
Solaris system and data is copied in the
background you can use the shadow stack
command to monitor progress if you wish
the advantage of this procedure is that
the new ZFS file system can be used
immediately if users try to access a
file that hasn't been migrated the file
is migrated immediately are made
available the other option
backup/restore
requires compatible tools on both AIX
and Solaris you then simply back up the
JFS filesystem on AIX and restore the
data to an Oracle Solaris ZFS filesystem
but remember unlike shadow migration
data will be offline throughout the
process
having touched on backup/restore as part
of data migration let's look at the
options you have once your data is on
Solaris the good news is that many
backup utilities including cpio packs
and tar are common to both systems in
addition a wide variety of third-party
backup utilities such as Tivoli Storage
Manager are available for AIX and Oracle
Solaris but do note that a IX specific
backup utilities such as backup make sis
and sis back aren't supported on Oracle
Solaris another Oracle Solaris feature
worth knowing about is ZFS snapshots a
snapshot is a read-only copy of a ZFS
filesystem or volume snapshots can be
created almost instantaneously and
initially consumed no additional disk
space in the storage pool with snapshots
you can save the state of a filesystem
at any particular point in time and
recreated on another machine to simplify
data migration the ZFS send and ZFS
receive commands are used to send a
snapshot to a file file system or system
so in moving from ax to Oracle you can
replace your AI X specific backup
utilities with the ZFS send and ZFS
receive commands to send a snapshot to a
file file system or system if you have
an Oracle database on your ax system
you're well supported with a variety of
Oracle tools and utilities available to
help with migrating to your new system
the choice of tools depends on the size
and complexity of your database the
tools available include Oracle data pump
providing for fast data and metadata
movement between Oracle databases the
database upgrade assistant is a GUI
based tool that performs all the
necessary prerequisite checks and
operations before upgrading specific
database instances the transportable
tablespaces feature lets you copy a set
of table spaces from one Oracle database
to another you can use Oracle are men to
transport table spaces and entire
databases between disparate platforms
replication gives you the ability to
share database objects and data at
multiple databases another option is to
create tables using SQL statements such
as create table and select Oracle active
Data Guard can be used to facilitate
migrations from one platform to another
with minimal downtime or risk and the
final option Oracle GoldenGate
provides for real-time data integration
and replication in heterogeneous IT
environments you can find more details
on the migration tools and utilities in
the Oracle database documentation
provided or on the Oracle website both
AIX and Oracle Solaris provide extensive
and powerful virtualization
functionality both for host and network
virtualization let's look at host
virtualization first your Oracle Solaris
platform provides a full range of
virtualization options dynamic domain on
Oracle's SPARC m6 32 servers provides
electrical isolation as well as logical
isolation and employs highly redundant
Hardware this type of Hardware isolation
is available it to AIX only on IBM's
e-series hardware Oracle VM server for
SPARC which is purpose-built for Oracle
SPARC t-series service and SPARC m6 32
servers provides a full virtual machine
that runs independent operating system
instances like power VM it uses a
hypervisor that resides at the chipset
level Oracle Solaris zones are built
into the operating system and can be
used on Oracle's entire range of SPARC
and x86 processor based servers zones
provides simplified consolidation and
high consolidation ratios they also
provide legacy operating system support
so that for example you can create
Oracle Solaris 10 environments on Oracle
Solaris 11 when migrating from AIX to
Oracle Solaris there are two
virtualization use cases you will most
commonly employ often in combination if
you used a IX logical partitions for
isolation such as separating your
development test environments from your
production environment you would now
typically use Oracle VM server for SPARC
which would previously called logical
domains or Eldon's if you used logical
partitions for consolidation for example
to improve workload efficiency and
system utilization you'll typically use
Oracle Solaris zones now an important
thing to note is that in Oracle Solaris
it's very common to use multiple
virtualization options in a single
deployment for example you might use
Oracle VM server for SPARC to isolate
multiple branded domains
you may even have some of these domains
running Oracle Solaris 11 others on
Oracle Solaris 10 then within each of
these demo
change you can set up multiple Oracle
Solaris zones for consolidation so we're
moving from AIX to Oracle you will place
L pass used for isolation with Oracle VM
server and L pass used for consolidation
with Solaris zones for more detailed
information on the various Oracle
Solaris virtualization technologies
please see the manuals provided with
your Oracle Solaris system or on the
Oracle website now let's take a look at
network virtualization with Oracle
Solaris you aren't limited to
virtualization of network interfaces
only as you are in AIX solaris
virtualizes all aspects of network
typography this granularity of
virtualization means that you can
aggregate and share resources to combine
Gigabit Ethernet connection to offer a
single large network connection that
provides greater bandwidth to
applications
conversely use the basic building blocks
of Phoenix to carve up high bandwidth
physical network connections so they can
be used to share an enhanced network
utilization consolidate workloads by
isolating and assigning limits or
guarantees on the amount of bandwidth
the server can use you can improve
network utilization and performance
rates this approach can be useful in
supporting operating system
virtualization cloud computing and other
consolidation efforts achieve high
performance that control resides
directly in the operating system layered
functionality with heavy overhead is
eliminated virtual stacks can be
assigned their own priority and
bandwidth on shared NICs without
degrading performance in addition
network workloads can be easily
paralyzed in Oracle Solaris network
virtualization is administered to the
data link level once created Phoenix act
and feel like physical NICs virtual
switches are automatically created to
properly route the network traffic to
the physical NIC devices Phoenix can
also be created over sudo devices called
ether stubs rather than over physical
NICs to create private virtual networks
with full traffic isolation tenant aware
application flows enable SLA of shared
network resources while dynamic link
multipathing a link aggregation provide
resilience in the face of network
changes so in moving from AIX to Oracle
where you used to be able to virtualize
networks at the interface only can now
virtualize all aspects of the network
an important aspect of any system is its
availability let's look at what our
course lares has to offer
Oracle Solaris 11 has a strong
background in providing the highest
levels of availability both AIX and
Oracle Solaris include tools for
monitoring and managing systems and
processes as well as handling automatic
failover restart and recovery in the
event of hardware and software failures
the key feature of the Oracle Solaris OS
is that it includes an architecture for
building and deploying systems and
services that are capable of predictive
self-healing the service management
facility and fault management
architecture provide Oracle's
self-healing capability monitoring the
operation system performed whether its
individual hardware components or
systems or application services these
features then silently work to isolate
any faults or automatically restart
services with the fault management
architecture automatically diagnosing
the underlying problem responding by
trying to take 40 components offline if
needed the service management facility
provides similar functionality to submit
in AIX and is used to configure and
manage system services the service
management facility provides for
tracking dependencies and the start
order of services automatically
restarting services should a failure
occur in Oracle Solaris 11 support for
legacy brand control scripts is
available for legacy applications
however it's recommended to migrate that
service management facility to gain the
advantage of automatic restart failure
detection and other useful features the
fault management architecture provides
similar functionality to system fault
management in AIX and handles fault
detection reporting and recovery
however the Solaris version goes further
than a simple detection and reporting by
diagnosing faults and initiating
recovery measures that can help prevent
outages it does this by trying to
configure problem components out of a
system before a failure occurs in the
event of a failure it initiates
automatic recovery using the service
management facility in addition to
service management facility and the
fault management architecture Oracle
Solaris cluster provides a high
availability solution with similar
functionality to IBM PHA formerly known
as high availability cluster multi
processing H a CMP it does this by
having redundant nodes where one or more
systems continue to ensure critical
services run even if other systems
fail nodes may be located within the
same data center or on different
continents from a physical perspective
or an Oracle cluster contains two or
more nodes that work together to provide
applications system resources and data
to users
no single hardware software storage or
network failure can cause the cluster to
fail loss of services prevented through
Hardware redundancy hardware and
software failure detection and automatic
recovery of services an application
failover in addition a single management
view enables the entire cluster to be
managed as a single entity reducing the
risk of errors Oracle Solaris clusters
also support virtual clustering allowing
Oracle Solaris zones to function in the
role of cluster nodes virtual clustering
allows you to deploy multiple
applications or multi-tiered workloads
on a single physical cluster
configuration applications can run
within a specific cluster under separate
zone policy based management in the
event of his own failure individual
zones can be restarted or failed over in
this way Oracle Solaris cluster can
protect applications that run in Oracle
Solaris zones Oracle Solaris cluster
complements Oracle database for
multi-tiered deployment providing a
single high availability and disaster
recovery solution this solution provides
coordination facilities which offer
faster failure discovery and recovery of
services for example you can create
dependencies between database components
and underlying storage it has load
balancing capabilities and can restart
mission-critical applications in
priority to less importantly
applications and you can get global
disaster recovery capabilities with
Oracle Solaris cluster global Edition so
in moving from AIX to Oracle you once
used IBM power8 a you will now use
Oracle Solaris cluster as a system
administrator you want high levels of
visibility and control over your systems
to achieve this Oracle offers an
integrated set of tools in the Oracle
Enterprise Manager product line these
tools provide end-to-end IT management
that extends from applications to
systems virtual machines software and
storage for both Oracle Solaris and
Linux the family of Oracle Enterprise
Manager products enables management of
the entire Oracle stack rich monitoring
features support proactive application
and systems management across the
infrastructure for both Oracle and non
Oracle components
Oracle Enterprise Manager upper center
provides for basic hardware management
offering similar functionality to IBM
system director
it controls data center assets and
simplifies physical and virtual server
lifecycle management using this tool you
can gain insight into Oracle service
storage and network components including
those on Oracle Solaris Oracle VM server
Linux and Windows servers the features
at your fingertips include firmware
server status energy use and operating
systems through to virtual machines
storage and network fabrics another tool
available on Oracle Solaris 11 is the
DTrace facility if you have used probe
you on AIX you'll find DTrace offers you
more features DTrace facilitates rapid
identification of hung processes
bottlenecks and other performance issues
that impact system availability designed
to quickly identify the root cause of
system performance problems DTrace
combines over 100,000 trace points with
a powerful scripting language and a
simple interactive command-line
interface it works by safely and
dynamically instrumenting the running
operating system kernel and applications
with trace point known as probes that
are completely passive until enabled
probes can be enabled quickly for data
collection and then disabled again to
minimize the performance impact on the
system being examined developers and
administrators can use this information
to quickly identify performance
bottlenecks optimize resource
utilization and performance and quantify
resource requirements so a moving from
AIX to Oracle you'll replace IBM System
Director with Oracle Enterprise Manager
op center and probe view with dtrace
when it comes to securing your digital
assets Oracle Solaris provides a
comprehensive set of security features
these features offer a defense-in-depth
approach by providing tools to protect
hosts networks and data let's start with
role based access control which AIX and
Oracle Solaris use to provide
fine-grained privilege management in
Oracle Solaris process rights management
is implemented through a privileged
mechanism granting only the least
necessary privileges reduces the
security risk compared to a user or
process having false super user
capabilities on the system privileges
can be corrupted to a command a user a
role or a system many Oracle Solaris
commands and Damons
run with only those privileges
required to perform their task Oracle
Solaris 11 has taken the additional step
of removing the root account itself when
root privileges are needed
administrators must enter a password to
assume root control both AIX 7 and
Oracle Solaris 11 include trusted
extensions an installable option that
provides a layer of security labeling
technology that separates data security
policies from data ownership access to
data is controlled by special security
tags or labels that enforce mandatory
access control in addition to unix
permissions as we mentioned when
discussing data migration AIX Oracle
Solaris 11 includes support for on disk
encryption AIX JSF 2 supports per file
encryption in Oracle Solaris ZFS data is
encrypted at the data set level using
the cryptographic framework built into
the operating system applications that
run on Oracle SPARC t-series servers and
use the cryptographic framework gain an
additional benefit cryptographic
operations are offloaded automatically
to an on-chip cryptographic accelerator
for improved performance a key component
in the Oracle Solaris defense-in-depth
approach to security is extensive
network security that protects physical
and virtual systems and networks this
provides for security by default
configuration when Oracle Solaris is
first installed a large number of
network services are disabled by default
for example the only network service
that accepts network requests is the
sshd diamond all other network services
are either disabled or configured to
handle only local requests for greater
than etwork security and integrated
firewall both AIX 7.1 and Oracle Solaris
11 included integrated packet filtering
firewall in Oracle Solaris 11 the IP
filter software is configured and
managed using the service management
facility for ease of configuration and
automatic failure detection and restart
capabilities a secure shell both AIX 7.1
and Oracle Solaris 11 include the secure
shell ssh for secure remote login in
Oracle Solaris the SSH utility is
extended to allow the use of x.509
certificates for authenticating users
and hosts this makes the use
administration of remote logons more
straightforward and secure users
don't need to populate authorization key
files on each host or answer prompts to
verify a hosts authenticity one final
topic before we close scripting you
write scripts to manage as many of your
day-to-day tasks as practical AIX an
Oracle Solaris both provide the corm
shell 93 most of your scripts will port
Solaris with minimal effort the only
changes you should need to make are
related to the variations in scripts
dialect many administrators also rely on
Rex another powerful scripting language
developed by IBM while Rex is not
supported by Oracle it's available as an
open source and known to work well on
Oracle Solaris
in this training module you've been
introduced to the key tools and
techniques that will help you migrate
from AIX to Oracle Solaris you've seen
