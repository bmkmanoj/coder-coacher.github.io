apps with cloud services so my name is
Max cats Iran developer relations for
for a cig Z which is a mobile app
platform right running entirely in the
cloud and has a number of components and
all of them working together we're going
to give them your mobile app a real
mobile app all right so first we gotta
basically ID running in the browser I'd
stay out builder right thing kind of a
never beans eclipse obviously not as not
that had many features but again think
ID in the browser the app that you get
it's pretty much a standard html5 jquery
mobile app all right you can also export
the app as phonegap or Apache Cordova
right so that framework gives you access
to device features okay and of course
you can also it no and there's no just
exporting the app as a hybrid app as I
said you can also access device api's
whichever phonegap Apache Cordova
provides you can do so let's for this
sort of the UI portion rest api's so
there is a huge explosion of API is
happening right now and you might have
I'm sure you've read and heard but there
is a whole API economy happening where
everyone is exposing their services
their resources ap is perfect example
Twitter and everyone else so you can
consume any rest api s that's available
they're available in the internet or you
guys build all right anything okay so if
you guys are very cool but most of them
provide very specific functionality but
what then what happens if you want to
save data right into a database so the
platform also provides a cloud database
and to be more specific MongoDB where
you can save pretty much anything right
and what's really nice is that anything
you save into MongoDB is instantly
exposes the rest api s and if it's
exposed to the rest api is it means you
can use basically use in your app all
right there's some other features like
poor
server-side code not available yet but
it's also sort of part of back-end
services and of course again it at the
end of the day you get a mobile app so
you get you need that you get any
development tools right the app is HTML
mobile app can also be a hybrid app and
then for your back-end data you get rest
api third party rights api's and you
know back in services incall database
all right but that's actually the only
slide that I have all right I've got
actually one more i'm going to show you
later what i'm going to do now without
say i'm going to build an app for you
i'm going to show you basically every
thing that i described here all right
and what's really also pretty cool is
that you guys will be able to try the
app as they build it all right you guys
don't don't sound excited alright so
again the actual platform is called take
Z and this is sort of the the first the
main page or the projects page I'm going
to create any app and I do one yesterday
so we call this Java one mobile app to
click create and it's going to load it
again it's going to load the Builder
also in just a few seconds you're going
to see is going to say connecting the
collaboration server so there's
basically kind of a google docs thing
built in where you can collaborate on
the app with other developers or
customers or whatever at the same time
or a different time so just a few more
seconds here
alright so this is the Builder and this
is the phone frame or you can also do a
tablet so in this side of a guy jquery
mobile components and html5 components
so important thing again you always
start with html5 mobile app right or
jQuery so we you know jquery's use as a
UI framework and to start you basically
take components and you drag and drop
them like this well let's change this to
make this to be a placeholder I'm going
to get a button component so guess i
should mention what i am building the
first part i'm when i'm building using
Twitter's rest api we're going to be
searching twitter for whatever you enter
here you'll be able to get all the
tweets that have this keyword you enter
it right that's the first part we got a
button and we can make this we can
change this to app now because this is
html5 mobile app or yet which means then
you can run it in any browser just a
browser but of course you want to be
able to run it on the mobile browser as
well so testing is incredibly simple
there is a test button and what it will
do will open the app right so this is
the real app right the frame is just
sort of for us to see where the app is I
can also want you without the frame all
right now it doesn't do anything yet it
will rip so let me make it public so you
guys can actually try it public and just
for a second let me so this is how it
looks without the frame right this is
surgery lap and what I'm going to do now
actually i'm going to create a shortcut
for you because you don't want to type a
long URL all right and this is from
yesterday so why don't we do it 13 right
for next year we'll take the shortcut
awesome it's available so if you guys
die if you guys go and you're on your
phone
doublet if you type in this URL you'll
be able to get all right again
tinyurl.com java 113 an alternative
method is you guys can and it depends on
the device and how far you can scan the
top QR code this one right here if you
would like you can try with your phone
and you'll get the app as well again
make sure you scan the top one so let me
know when if someone gets it all right
and again the tinyurl is set the
shortcuts tinyurl java 1 13 13 all right
shall we continue very good so this is
for the input this is for input now
let's get the output we're going to
display the tweets so I'm going to use a
grid component and it has two columns
but no place it has two columns by
default useful for layout in the first
one I'm going to put an image component
and it's for the Twitter picture now I
know ahead of time the size it where it
sends me back it's actually 48 by 48
that's why I'm going to resize the grid
the image in the second column I'm going
to put two labels this is the twitter
username and this is the Twitter text
right there also a bunch of themes
jquery mobile themes and this is just a
short list but we can do something like
this and if you guys refresh on your
devices you'll be able to get this all
right
works alright so basically you know if I
said this all we have means this is
already pretty nice because you can
build the UI for you out basically and
you can write JavaScript and you can of
course create multiple pages in
navigating the pages basically again
basically good the UI portion for your
app and you can do some dummy data with
JavaScript maybe and so on but this is
just of course not everything I mean we
want to be able to get rest services and
that's exactly what we're gonna do next
I'm so again I'm using twitter twitter
is simple everyone knows how it works
but as i said any rest api out there if
it's open requires authentication or two
doesn't matter you can use all right
again this is just a tool the app is
just html5 mobile app at the end so it's
not some secret framework that you know
we're using here all right let's create
a service so go to project i'm going to
create a service and all of just rename
it so it's Twitter service and this is
the service editor so right here i'm
going to enter the twitter URL alright
so again anything goes here facebook
linkedin you name it all right now every
service usually as inputs and outputs
and that's what we need to define next
so request parameters and tourists case
the one that requires ask you stands for
query has optional parameters i'm not
going to worry about it now it's Q it's
also really nice once you define answer
which you want to make sure it works all
right and we can test the service here
test connection and we can enter java
one click test and we get went to
Twitter and get all the you know tweets
now next step would be to create the
service response right what you can do
because we got this JSON back we can
actually automatically create the
response and clicking this button it
will automatically create the response
so
is everything at bag back on Twitter
right and so we it supports JSON or XML
right but this is now I could have done
this by hand but obviously this put
taking much longer all right so we've
got output we got input and we guide the
actual service all right so save and
close now we need to add the service
onto the page and take the service drag
and drop it and this indicates the
services on the page next I need to bind
the service of the page all right so i
define the service i added a service to
the page now i have to bind the service
and for that i go to data mapping and
let me do it like this and this is the
service and this is my page all right
this is the input components i'm going
to taking the implement and mapping it
to the service right and you can also
write JavaScript if you need to again
this is just running in the browser so
any JavaScript painting the browser
supports you can do when these local
storage right so this is for input now
let's go to response mapping and result
this is the collection this is
everything a bit from Twitter now
results this is the collection of all
the tweets so I'm going to map it to the
grid now why do I want to map it to the
grid this is going to give me a looping
feature because I get multiple tweets
right now text is the tweet text I'm
going to map it to this second label
from user a from user is the user
twitter username and the last thing we
need to do is the URL alright so again
you can write JavaScript here and
mention you can save stuff into local
storage if you need to ok so done with
the mapping let's go back here alright
and the last thing we need to do is we
need to invoke the service on button
click so we're going to click search
events so these are just the browser
events right again just that the button
support and we select click and invoke
service we select the service click ok
and we can test
so if you guys refresh you'll be able to
get the same thing
all right let me know when you get it
anyone got it yes all right yeah make
sure your fresh so this is a real app
right i mean it it's not super
complicated but more than just hello
world that people use the video right
okays think it's awesome but yeah I mean
you know I can open it without the frame
and of course that's basically uh this
is how it's going to look right but of
course on a mobile device is going to be
much smaller alright a few things i
mentioned phonegap right or how do you
get this app out right so there is an
export button and there are options you
can export the app so first you can get
you know if you want to build just a
pure mobile app that which means it's
going to run on any device with the
browser you just export it right here
all right you can also get the source
code this is already with phonegap or
Apache Cordova so you can get a klipsch
project xcode project or visual studio
project for Windows Phone and this is
windows phone 7 right for Android and
iOS we got a binary we can actually
package the app for you right this is
really this Android is obviously very
simple once you download the file you're
five minutes away from putting in the
google play because apple or sorry
google makes it pretty simple but you
know apple private reasons going to be
take a little more time as an example if
I click here it's going to go and build
this might be more than just 10 seconds
but at the end there going to be a QR
code will appear here and you can scan
the QR code with your android phone and
you will be able to download the app and
try it on your phone all right i mean i
can open it later at the end see if you
guys want to scan you can actually do
that right and install the app on your
phone for android
okay let's see what we can come back but
let's wait maybe after this one 10 more
seconds ah 10 more well it will it will
it will finish let's do it let's wait
for five more and here we go right and
yeah you don't have to scan it now if
you want you can scan it later i'm going
to add more stock to the app all right
okay very good so so this is the end and
what's really amazing is that this is
built entirely in the browser so nothing
to install nothing to download it's a
mobile app and it consumes a cloud a
cloud service right and of course you
can export the app if you want to and
you can get the Eclipse project looking
at the Xcode project and again you can
continue working with you whatever in
your favorite tool if you would like
alright so again any rest api out there
anything you can easily consume here now
really quickly before moving to the
cloud database i want to show you there
is this notion of plugins right i'm
going to plug in it's basically similar
to an eclipse plugin but it's it's
prepackaged functionality where you can
pre packaged services and pages together
all right and to give you an example
let's say you're building a mobile app
where you want to have the ability to
send SMS messages right through an API
not through the native app so there are
companies that do that AT&amp;amp;T is one of
them it provides API for sending SMS
messages twilio i'm sure you guys
probably heard of two leo has api's
again to send SMS messages so i create
new from plug-in and I select
communication and I select SMS api right
and again it comes prepackaged with the
service to send SMS message and a page a
sample page so import now every API
usually when it's something like you
know more than just searching Twitter
it's going to require you to register an
appt with their service right and get
keys so you can use it to you can use
the API it's pretty much standard for
now so you would need to go to developer
that att.com or any other service you
have to register create an app they're
going to give you a key right
something's wonky maybe two keys but
again it's after the service and you
would enter the values here but we can
just keep them blank so we can just
click save now what happened is we got
an SMS page imported that looks like
this alright so it's ready to go yes you
got two services here so the first
service is called get token this is just
how i DNT SMS works yourself to a
thumbtack aid against the service ATT
then you get a token and then you can
use to send a SMS message alright but
this is kind of an the basic idea is um
in you guys can create your own plugins
actually but the basic idea is to
simplify this even farther so like the
Twitter edge is that right you know it
is possible to create a plug-in where it
is basically import and it's available
for you out of the box so I guess it's
something along the ways like you people
build JavaScript SDKs so this is kind of
a plugins you know similar concept so
given you know let's simplify stuff even
more all right um but what I'm going to
do now is I'm going to actually edit
database right cloud database and let's
do that close the pages here alright so
database alright so we get one would you
be running in the cloud and I'm going to
this is a list of all databases i'm
going to create a new one java one see I
already have one so Java 1 12 DB create
all
this is my database dashboard collection
so this is your tables or collections as
a built-in user management which means
if you have a user user can you can
register a user user can sign then user
can logout you're the king changes of
her password file management means you
can upload files all right now let's go
to collections let's create a new
collection what coldest will have
interactive feedback you guys can type
stuff anything you want into the app all
right and so we got a collection
feedback obvious they can create
multiple collections these are default
columns but let's create a new column
and just call this text and create right
text now what's really nice that you
actually enter sample data here so you
can do java one 2012 we can do one more
all right now of course you want to be
able to display this list in my app and
as I said aliens exposes rest you saw
how easy it is and in fact you can see a
rest and if you click on actually get a
curl command right so you can actually
test if you want from a command line
right but now having this command I can
actually create a service and I can get
this list right so let's do that so this
is the URL I'm going to get the URL I'm
going to go back here and create a new
service let's call this back yet
all right this is the URL now I do need
to change my collection is called
feedback right and the other thing I
need to do is there is a key that
identifies the database identifies me
right which database so it's like a
token from AT&amp;amp;T this one in this case
it's a database ID that's a probe sorry
so request parameters I create one here
and now i'm going to copy its value and
I need to make it a header now very easy
right we want to test it make sure it
works and we click test and right away I
get the response right next step is to
create the service the actual response
tracks adjacent structure again I could
do this by the end but I can also just
click this button right and do it
automatically and you see in about a
minute i got a service right so let's
save let's close let's create a new page
and we call this right and let's rename
this to and let's use another component
it's is your list component now so take
a list component and I'm going to make
round corners and now because I'm being
again looping over my values from a
database I don't need the three items
here this is kind of for static list so
I'm actually going to just have one all
right make sense as before I'm going to
add a service to the page right a
defining service I had to service to the
page and then I have to bind this over
to the page I go to mapping nothing for
input the key is already set by default
so for input mapping now for response
this is what I need this is the
collection of all the text text items
and then the text all right now back
here the last as for before in a
previous example we wouldn't
to serve us on button click but again we
can use any browser event doesn't have
to be you know so we can use page load
for example in this case right because
we're nothing to click on so I go to
events and they select page load and
then as before invoke service and I
select the service all right and oh so
if I launch it now it's going to open
the Twitter page because it's the first
page right what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to make it make the
database to be the first page so let's
do that so go to project settings and
feedback test alright this what I get
now for you guys you have to make sure
the URL is sort of clear because you
might have the actual page name so what
I'm going to do is on the Twitter page
I'm actually going to add a button so
it's easier for you Twitter or Twitter
right here give me a sec I'm going to
add a button to take you to a page so
we'll call this just next right well at
a click event and we'll add a navigate
to page and feedback alright so if you
guys reload the Twitter page now you
have a button in the header which will
make it easier for you to navigate right
or again in the URL just delete that
first page and it's going to load the
new default then your index page
basically all right but either way let
me know when you guys get get this all
right
alright so this is pretty nice but let's
also the ability to actually add new
items right so you guys can see type
stuff okay so let's do that so let me
close close close all right now I
mentioned this is a platform right and
now if it's a platform obviously it
should somehow be aware that you have
this app and then you have this database
ok and then exactly what it does is that
I show you how to create a service now
by basically manually defining it but
they're actually even a simpler way to
do that because again because the the
Builder is aware what databases i have
created and we can basically generate
all the services automatically now again
if i wanted to do it create i would just
click here and now there is a curl
command and i would basically right but
i can go to project and i can do
database services and right here I get
it collects a list of all my databases
and this is the one that I right so
database 12 so this is for user
management so every database guess is by
default you can do login logout and sign
up and this is my collection so I've
only get one connect one collection and
they chose mine I can check all of them
or just create I still want to generate
the service for creating a new feedback
item so import and then what happens is
it creates a service here and you got
the URL automatically and I get all the
input parameters automatically and I
also get the output automatically right
so it's even simpler ok and as as before
I can also test us and we can say new
and this is fine and this indicates that
it's working I can close I can go back
here I can click on feedback and
this is right here all right now let's
now modify the page and let this one
let's get oh let's open the back all
right um put an input component and we
can say new item doesn't matter and we
can make this to be a placeholder and
let's add a button and we can say add
and we can even make this fancy and we
can add a little plus on this site all
right all right let's add a service to
the page as before so adding a service
and we need to do data mapping as before
so here we go it's a little bit easier
to see this way so the only thing we
need to do our to map is the input from
the page and the input is right here so
I map it like this right so that now for
the response mapping it returns the ID
of the object created and the time
created but i'm not going to actually
use it here so i don't have to map
anything back to the page but you could
all right and as before the last that we
need to do is we need to invoke the
service we go to events click invoke
service and you can rename these today a
little bit more easier to know which one
but this is seven and there's one more
thing is i'm going to add any item to a
database tried but my UI i have to
update the UI right there are two ways
to do it I can do it on the client I can
basically add a new item to the list on
the client right or I can just go ahead
and do another request and reload the
new list and because i already have the
service to reload to get the list i'll
just going to use that so i'm going to
have to request so i add a new item and
then
once the create service successfully
finishes I'm going to use a success
event and this is just a query and
invoke service all right test click Add
All Right see you guys can now try the
same don't say anything bad all right I
can refresh and see what guys you're
saying right go to try
sure refresh oh very nice oh nothing bad
so far I was doing a demo Watson san
diego area users group and i got some
really bad things people type I mean not
about me but just kind of not good
things let's do one more reload awesome
very good we can actually track actually
we're getting location so we can track
where you enter it now were you sitting
no we can't so so um alright well let me
show you one more thing you guys all
know but there's another conference
running in Europe and kind of it the
European devil one called a box or the
dev ox awesome so they also a rest api
for schedule right so you can see the
schedule you can see schedule but day
schedule but speaker so an example let's
say you want to build an app the users
right there their api so let's go to dev
box yes of course yes running on a cloud
yeah yeah so the question was if the
tool is running in the cloud and so yes
it's running in the cloud the Builder um
the other question was I'm just
repeating so that for if the services
are not public I mean if it's if you're
using the sort of this public version
that yet the services need to be
accessible somehow they don't need to be
completely open right you can log in you
can do you know out or to yes you can do
authentication but they need to be
accessible in the Internet
one way or another I mean there is a I
mean this is kind of a custom option
where you installed within your private
cloud but that's our custom installation
so I mean one more another if you're
running your service has to be
accessible on the internet the preso
private club we want option arm or again
or you would have to authenticate right
so if you have partners who only you
want only these people to use and yeah
you put identification secure yeah yeah
yeah so anything you can do I mean you
can do a clog in with facebook or log in
with twitter i mean you can do that it's
all possible all right so here the rest
api said they have and what we can do
what I know kind of hard to see but
let's get this it's the schedule by day
all right so you get as five days monday
through friday and then you can get a
schedule so let's try that and we're
going to create a new service
alright and paste now number of days so
every day is actually like Mondays one
and in few days too so let's do they for
for example alright and we can test I'm
actually going to get an error but on
purpose so again I'm getting an error
message saying it's not working so it is
this is very useful and you can see the
actual you know response is I didn't
specify the event ID alright so again
you get an air it's not a bad thing it's
actually pretty useful to kind of Oh
something is wrong with the URL maybe
and we can easily go and i know the ID
for this event is 707 alright and test
connection and I get the JSON right and
again what's really nice and if you guys
tried you'll see that using this
automatically creating the JSON response
makes it super easy to try services out
there right I mean even if you guys want
if anyone is a service I can try it I
mean it has to be open though right so
if you guys want to give me a service
i'll try it because this makes it super
easy right i got i get all the structure
so save close as before let's quickly
create a new page
alright palette and let's get a list
component and again we don't need the
three items and let's add the service
which is right here mapping there's
nothing for input x so this service
doesn't require any input besides the
the day in the URL alright and you could
actually dynamically insert days into
URL so it does have to be hard-coded
right you can pass the date front page
to write to be invoked the same and so
mapping the only thing we need to do for
response mapping is right here so we're
going to map and it just opens
automatically as they put the mouse over
and title goes here and finally as
before we want to invoke one load which
is right here book service okay so the
only thing is we need to change the page
again let me do that that works what I'm
going to do is I can create an index
page where there are links to each each
separate so you see pretty much in under
two minutes you get this now the empty
ones it's actually because in the
schedule they have like breakfast and
coffee breaks which are not official
it's not an actual presentation so you
obviously need to add some logic right
so if it's it's not a session or if it's
a breakfast or registration and so on
then you do something else so it's also
possible but out of the box I mean you
see how how simple it is and of course
you can click on an item and you can
look look at details right how would you
do that very simple so every every
presentation has an ID so on click you
would save the ID somewhere the easiest
way is to save it into local storage
browsers local storage you save in local
storage dady on the next page when you
navigate on the next page and page load
you use the ID to invoke a service to
get information about that session
so you get the value from local storage
ID put it into the URL for our service
it will be invoked with that what
information about session so that's the
easiest way to do it alright hopefully
so this makes a bit more sense right so
cloud platform you get development tools
you get a builder the app is just HTML
jquery mobile app or again you can also
do phonegap you get rest api's you saw
again if you guys have any rest api
we've got time actually almost done i'll
be more than happy to try it and do it
so rest api is and of course cloud
services so this everything gives you
your mobile app all right does it
promised i have one more slide right
there was a question in that i think in
the list right price right so it is a
service right so it's not a product you
download so similar its like sales sales
force or other so and it's a freemium
model so there is a free plan there is a
middle plan and there is kind of a pro
plan and actually old plans get the same
features right so the only difference is
a number of apps you can build okay but
if you guys use this code gel 112 right
you can I get three months a pro plan
where you can build 50 apps right 15
month maybe doesn't sound like a lot but
trust me it's a lot of apps to build its
50 right if you really love it and need
more time and you you can always email
me get you more time but again keep in
mind everyone gets the same features
now my email I guess I should put my
email on that side as well but this is
my email now it says X Adele so external
is sort of the company its backing this
platform so I work for XL but the
platform is cool tikz right but again
we're out of Concord east bay so it's
the company behind the platform yes yes
so the question was if I can create an
app and put it in the app store android
yes you can so basically you would
export and as I said this is a right
here is Android binary okay so if you
guys want maybe at the end or you can
scan the QR code or I can email it to
you later if you would like and you can
put it on your phone so Android isn't
going to be simple you can put this file
today in 10 minutes into the App Store
and will be available yeah you do have
to sign it with a certificate yeah if I
click here it's going to ask me to set
the certificates and information so yeah
it's a little bit more involved and of
course your app one appear right away
there you know so but yeah for windows
phone we give you the source you would
have to you know build it build it
yourself in visual studio or or you can
use phonegap build you guys familiar
with the service it's a cloud service
for building so this is not phonegap
build this is our own but you could take
it to phonegap build and I think they
provide windows seven support for
packaging the app yes yes so anything
phonegap allows you to do you can
basically use so yeah so the question
was if there any difference within a
phone app and a tablet app so we have a
separate template for for a tablet which
basically is a bigger bigger screen but
it also has a it's actually more
specific to
ipad it has kind of it has this master
detail it has a mainly on one side then
you can select but in general use jQuery
Mobile and then we'll just kind of
automatically stretch for there now the
question is if you're for example doing
responsive design of some sort where if
it's an iPad show this menu if it's a
phone don't show this menu so yeah it's
not supported in the tool yet but you
can still do it yourself so you can
write any JavaScript code here and you
can do CSS anything and primarily you do
it through these events and for example
run custom JavaScript okay so you can
run any JavaScript right if you need you
select any element in the Dom and do
anything you want with that so there is
jQuery available there a jquery mobile
you can also add any other libraries you
want so if you go to project external
resources you can add any javascript
library load into your project via URL
or you can create a new javascript file
so so the question was it a try it
account so again there's actually a free
account right so you can there is no now
but as I said if you worry this use this
code and you're going to get basically
will be able to build more apps that's
the only difference
all right I know we're I mean there are
15 minutes left again if you guys any
questions or there's actually a REST API
that you guys have I'll be more than
happy to try it yeah if you go to a
sitcom there is a help link or support
link yeah it should be there but go on
me on a desktop the phone is going to
take you to a login screen when you go
to texts of tom yeah yeah takes to go to
a goal in a desktop yeah yeah on the
phone and takes you to slightly
different types so check it out on that
again regular browser yes the question
was if you can eat you have to use the
cloud database um you can use your own
but has to be again available somewhere
in Internet yeah I mean it can be a
database running in your computer right
because I mean at the end the app is
running on your phone right so it can
access has to be available internet plus
has to be restin able so yeah anything
that's
right anyone has the REST API that's
simple to type no all right you guys are
not prepared thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
