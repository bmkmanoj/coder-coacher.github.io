of the three weekly lessons about Oracle
yet in this part we're going to take a
look at the built-in support for
security and authentication in jet bear
in mind that jet is only focused on the
client side of your applications when
exploring security considerations the
vast majority of security concerns will
be from the server side where you will
want to take advantage of solutions
available for protecting and securing
your data though server side security
considerations are outside the scope of
jet they're unlikely to be outside the
scope of your business requirements jet
components follow best practices for
security for example old JavaScript code
is executed in strict mode using the use
strict directive also Oracle jet code
does not use inline script elements
Oracle jet code does not generate random
numbers and any HTML generated by a jet
component is either escaped or sanitized
one of the best resources to follow for
web application security is the open web
application security project a wasp
well jet provides security measures
within its own components and toolkit
level features it is up to the
application teams to have a solid
understanding of the overall best
practices for secure coding in
JavaScript the OWASP website is the best
place to start that education also note
that OS is a widely used open protocol
to allow secure authentication in a
simple and standard method from web
mobile and desktop applications jet
includes a helper library for working
with our authentication supporting the
OAuth 2.0 open protocol
o or standardizes the way desktop and
web applications access our users
private data it provides a mechanism for
users to grant access to private data
without sharing their private user name
and password credentials jet in
you'd support for OAuth via the Oh Jo
OAuth method enabling you to use it
quickly and easily in your jet
applications in this part you have
learned that jet follows security best
practices for jet components and that
jet provides the oje auth class to help
you authenticate and manage access to
user data via OAuth for your home look
for this part
review the Iowa's website to get a
better understanding of the top security
related issues within JavaScript create
a jet application and add an input field
and a label connect the two components
together using the techniques you
learned about in the first week of the
course try entering some JavaScript code
into the input field and see what is
returned in the label as always thank
you for following along with the Oracle
jet course and see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
