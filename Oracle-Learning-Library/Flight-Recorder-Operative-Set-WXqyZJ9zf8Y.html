demo on the events tab about the
operative set so you'll notice that
there's this checkbox show only
operative set available on the most of
the tabs in the events tab group so I'm
going to jump over here to threads and
click on that there we go and what I'm
going to do is I would like to focus on
just this thread the event queue so I'm
going to go ahead and select that and
i'm going to right click it and you'll
notice here i have in this popup menu
have an option for operative set and
let's say add that selection so what
that does is it allows me to check this
box and so then instead of showing all
the possible events for a recording i
can focus on one thing so now when i
check that box only the events related
to the event queue show up so let me
jump back to the overview tab and you
can see here I've got a lot of events if
I check that box I've got 61,000 here to
start by turning that on I only see
13,000 events there and let's see what
we see we have a lot of you know count
the high count here for a lot of
different stuff let's go ahead and check
that and that graph that pie chart
chains quite quite a bit too so you can
see that the operative set setting that
allows you to change the the focus of
what you're looking at when you're
looking through your events and stuff
just with that little setting I can of
course uncheck all these and also to get
back to my default settings I can always
select something here and then when i go
to operative set i can just to choose
clear and then that sets it back to the
default settings so it's a pretty
powerful thing actually and you probably
do a lot more with it than i'm showing
here but definitely something to check
out the operative set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
