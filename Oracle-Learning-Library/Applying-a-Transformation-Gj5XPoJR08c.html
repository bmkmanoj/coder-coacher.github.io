apply a transformation to your model
with our model open when go to tools and
then design rules and then
transformations we want to take a look
at some of the transformations that come
with the product we do not have the
JRuby engine installed so that's why we
got that error message but if we take a
look at some of the other transformation
scripts that are supplied we are going
to be taking a look at the table
template transformation so in order to
apply this transformation we are going
to go ahead and close this window and
create a table called table templates so
we go select the new and table icon and
click in the background and we'll call
it table underscore template that's what
the transformation expects and then
click the columns attribute we're going
to create a couple of columns so we'll
go ahead and click the add button four
columns and then click OK we now have
our table and we can apply the
transformation so we select the
relational model in the navigator and
select apply custom transformation
scripts from the context window select
the transformation and move it to the
selected scripts and then click apply
the transformation has finished so we
can go ahead and close this window and
you'll notice that in each of the tables
in our relational model those two
columns exist now so that's what the
transformation actually performed we're
going to go ahead and change the columns
to something a little more meaningful
and apply that transformation again so
we're going to go ahead and change the
column one to update a date and specify
a data type of date and then we're going
to select the second column and specify
it as I created by column and we'll
select the VAR char 25 is a size and
then click ok now we can rerun that
transformation script so we're going to
right-click on the relational model and
select that option and then select the
table template script and apply that and
then we click OK and click close
and you'll notice that both of the
tables or all the tables in my
relational model now have that specified
you have just learned how to apply a
transformation to your model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
