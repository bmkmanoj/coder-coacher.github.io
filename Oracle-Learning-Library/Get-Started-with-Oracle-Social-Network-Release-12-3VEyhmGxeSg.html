business object like a sales opportunity
or a customer so I can bring all my
stakeholders together and collaborate on
it through conversations and document
annotations and there's a record of
everything that's transpired so new
folks can easily jump in and come up to
speed depending on my environment I
access Oracle social network in
different ways if I use an Oracle
application I might see a social icon on
my landing page or while viewing a
business object or I might have a social
option in the navigator alternatively I
might have received an email with a link
to access Oracle social network when I
open Oracle social network I see the
overview page which shows all the recent
activities surrounding objects I have
permission to view such as new messages
uploaded files and wall posts the
overview page like most pages in Oracle
social network provides easy access to
several features I can filter and sort
the items in the list to easily find the
content I need I can mark an item as a
favorite so I can get to it quickly I
can add a flag to a message to let
someone know that they need to take a
look at it or respond to it and I can
see how many unread messages I have in a
conversation or wall I can use the
global search field at the top to find
something I type in a keyword to search
all types of items such as conversations
documents people and groups I can then
filter my search results by clicking on
a result type like messages the panels
provide quick access to information
wherever I am in the application recent
activity displays the most recent
messages from the conversations and
walls I'm a member of I can click a
message to go to it trending displays
the conversations collections social
objects and walls with the most people
in them at the moment

icon to quickly start a private
conversation with the person the menu
enables me to access other pages such as
my wall where I can view and edit my
profile or post status messages or other
content that isn't associated with a
business object or conversation I can
access my flags and my favorites as well

social network so I can easily get to
everything I need to collaborate on a
project and see it through to its
