Oracle cloud blueprint processor in this
demo will show how to browse the
resources in your Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud will use cloud blueprint
path expressions to navigate the syntax
is pretty simple you only have to learn
three operators here's a quick example
to look at the cloud resource we just
enter its name cloud the cloud resource
is a singleton and represents the
overall cloud from here we can get to
any other resource a cloud contains zone
so we'll ask specifically for that by
referencing it's attributed name zones
we see that the zones attribute contains
an element attribute and that there are
two elements one for each of the two
zones they're both named zone one but
one is used for Java as a service and
the other for database of this service
if we want to see what's in the Java is
a service own we specify the first
element in nixing is zero-based we can
further narrow this to see the zones
universal resource indicator or uri and
then Traverse that you are I to reach
the zone resource itself so now we're
viewing the zone cloud resource it has
simple attributes like name and
description but more interesting is its
list of service instances with the name
and status of each let's home in on the
first instance and Traverse over to it
you
now we're viewing the Java as a service
instance and can see it has the list of
application deployments on that service
and also the list of data sources so we
can traverse again to the data source
I'll show you more in a minute but
here's a summary of all you need to know
to be productive you can start with
cloud use the dot operator to reference
an attribute name and if the value of
the attribute is adjacent list use the
square brackets to refer to a given
element of the list and finally if the
attribute is a URI use the arrow
operator to traverse to it you might be
wondering what's the underlying
mechanism here well all cloud resources
are accessed by way of a restful api
each resource has a type and attributes
the type in attributes are all defined
in this document but so long as you
understand the basic Oracle cloud
concepts you should be good to go you
can explore the way we did earlier
follow links to a resource and see what
its attributes are the names are pretty
self-explanatory and the cloud resource
model api doc is available if you want
more details let's look at a few other
situations and ways to explore the cloud
resources this time I'll start from the
command line to enter the blueprint
processor debugger just start up the
blueprint processor specify the cloud
URL the minus I option that tells it to
pause before the first phase of
blueprint processing and any old file is
the blueprint it doesn't matter we won't
be executing it now you're ready to go
the blueprint processor drops you into
the debugger before any other blueprint
processing in our previous example we
traverse through several other resources
in order to get to the data source but
you don't have to start with cloud every
time once you know resources uri you can
enter it directly
for instance once I know the URI of a
zone is this I can use this syntax
you
and one last feature if you want to get
subset of the attributes when you
traverse you can limit the display to
those attributes in this case I'm only
interested in a zones name and service
instances so I use this syntax for more
information including the user's manual

processor software see this page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
