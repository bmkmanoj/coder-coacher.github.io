the video training series this is a
video recording of application testing
suite to adopt two new features and
updates my name is utakata katsu i'm a
group product manager of the application
testing suite products this presentation
covers new features and updates we have
in oracle application testing suite
Twitter to the video recording will go
approximately 40 minutes in the first 20
minutes we will talk about the new
features for open script for functional
testing in the next 20 minutes we'll
discuss the new features for oracle lu
testing and orgo test manager this slide
shows a list of the new feature we have
four golden script for functional
testing in 12 to open script Twitter to
introduce the JD Edwards functional
testing module which is a new
accelerator that provides application
specific API also provides command line
tools interface that allows you to bulk
compile multiple scripts without opening
the script in Oakland script you I an
open script whether to introduce the
support for playing back pre-recorded
functional test scripts on linux systems
also having on the enhancements on
capture screenshot options new assets
tab in the script view support for 80th
data visualization tool and for firefox
browser 10 extended support 3ds will
talk about in details for each items
first a new feature we have in 80's 12
to that I want to introduce is the new
functional testing accelerator module
for JD Edwards application when you open
a script users in open script version 12
dot to USC work with JD edwards
enterpriseone functional testing module
this module was built on top of the web
functional testing module and extends
the web testing by providing an
additional capability to record in
playback or call JD edwards
enterpriseone applications with grid
controls this feature allows you to
record the JD edwards enterpriseone grid
components by loading an application
specific API on to the script the great
components will be captured as e1
commands and non grid components are
captured as a standard web controls so
when you record the jde application with
this module you will see both web and e1
commands recorded into the script
supported version of jde applications
are 90 and 91 supported browsers are
internet explorer and firefox and please
note that recording jde version 9 20
with firefox is not supported jde
version 91 is supported with both IE and
firefox so let's see this in actual
product I have open Street version 12 to
open in my screen I'm going to click a
button in a toolbar to open a new script
wizard here I see or good JD edwards
enterpriseone under the functional
testing in the tree view I'm going to
click Next and going to name my script
click finish
this is my brand new JD eone script I
will go ahead and click the recording
button and this will launch IE and i'm
going to navigate to the application
that i want to record against enter
username and password sign
select the environment move on and now
the application is loaded and this is
jay de enterpriseone version 9.1 i'm
going to enter a value into a fast path
field and let's navigate through the
application commands are written down to
the script as mentioned earlier jde one
functional testing module is a mixture
of web and Iran commands the grid
components will be captured as e1 man
and the rest of the components are
captured as standard web components
because so far all the actions I perform
in this browser are non great actions
that commands I see in the script are
the standard web commands this is a java
code view of the script the commands we
have here are starting from web web 2
element web text box will top button
whipped radio button these are all
standard web commands but now I see a
grid control in the screen i'm going to
enter a value into a QB e field which is
a query by example field the body is
2020 and this will record an e1 man so I
see set QBE value recorded into the
script the corresponding javac man can
be seen in a java code view this action
was captured as e 1 dot great command
and this is just an example you can also
see the other available jte commands by
typing a period in front of the existing
method and this list of api is also
available in openness of the user guide
please see the open strip the user guide
at
they're 14 using JD Edwards functional
testing module
the next feature we have four 80s 2802
is open script command-line tools
interface this is an umbrella interface
for writing command-line tools that
includes open script command-line
compiler which performs bulk script
compilation and open sweet man like a
set up later that configure script
assets for multiple scripts as a
background operation for both tools you
can run them from the command line and
you do not need to launch scripts in
open script graphical user interface the
first two included in this feature is
the script compiler which allows you to
do a bulk script compilation without
opening the scripts in Oakland script
graphical user interface so let's think
about an example use case you have an
automated testing framework that runs
your scripts from the command line so a
lot of scripts are running as a
scheduled batch execution and therefore
you're now launching open script UI for
doing so and say there was an
environmental change in application and
a URL that is specified in all of your
scripts need to be changed because the
script source in Oakland script is a
plain text file you can do the bulk text
replacement by using any third-party
tools to run against your script source
files and find and replace the URL
however because open script the script
is a java program any change made the
source file requires recompilation you
can do the recompilation by opening a
script in Oakland script UI but you do
not want to do that as you are not
running script from the UI first of all
and especially if you have hundreds of
scripts it takes a little time to open
each script just for completion purpose
so this is when the command-line
compiler is useful it allows you to
specify a folder where your scripts are
located and performs the multi
compilation
I can ranch the command prompt and run
compile command and I can also specify
the directory name where my scripts are
located and in this case my directory
name is 12-2 new features and in this
directly I have for scripts that I want
to bug compile I'm going to run the
command and it is already finished and
all for scripts and this folder were
recompiled without the need of opening
them up in the open script you I because
this is a demonstration I only have four
scripts in this folder but it can run
the same command against tens of
hundreds of scripts if we exist in the
specified a directory the second tool
included in the open script command line
tools interface is a set up later using
this tool you can interchange scripta
sets such as data bank files object
libraries childhood scripts or jar files
in the platform a bulk update against
multiple script old ones by specifying
the script location in the file system
here is a possible use case say you have
a requirement to add a new data bank
file or to change the location of the
existing Java scripts in all of your
hundred scripts it is time consuming if
you have to open each script manually in
open script to reconfigure the script
asset's you can add a new script asset
or change the existing Street assets by
running an asset a plate command from
the command line for example add a
script that I would like to add a new
data bank file currently this script
doesn't have any data bank file
associated
and I'm going to run update assets
command from the command line to add a
new script aset till all the scripts
located in a specified folder the pipe
of the asset is data bank and here is
the file location I just started to the
command and the result came out
successfully so I'm going back to the
same script in open script I'm going to
close this once and reopen and go into
the set stuff now I can see a new data
bank while added to the script and
because I run a command against all the
scripts located in the specified folder
I should see the new data bank well in
the other script as well I'm going to
take a look at the other script in the
same folder going to the set dub and I
see the new de in the back file
Associated for this script as well and
why am I happy because I could do this
without opening each script in open
script you I the next new feature
introduced in 80s 12 to use support for
a playback of pre-recorded live in a do
functional test scripts from the command
line interface online acts through a
firefox browser as for the prerequisites
80s full installation or an 80s agent at
the minimum should be installed on the
linux server also a firefox browser with
a version that is supported by 80s
should be installed or go 80s version 12
2 supports firefox browser version 10
ESR extended support release and
supported browser is currently only
Firefox also Oracle 80s helper service
should be enabled in the system prior to
running the script from the line command
line
and please note that this is a playback
only feature because a current version
open script product cannot be installed
on the writing system recording in
debugging required windows system so you
need to create a script using open
script in Windows system and make sure
the scripted runs without an error
before bringing them on to the next
system to play back I have a Linux
system that has Orko 80s installed and
at first I would like to check whether
the Oracle 80s helper service is running
in this system I'm going to run this
command to check the status of the
Oracle 80s helper service and if
prompted please enter the root password
for the linux server ok so the status
came back and the helper service is
running but in case you see a message
the helper service is not running then
you need to start the service before
running the script and here is the
command to start the help of service ok
so next I want to start the script
playback and this is a command I'm going
to run with and as you can see this is
same run script command that you can run
the script from command line in Windows
systems I'm going to hit the enter key
to kick off the command
and I see the Firefox browser lounge the
commander drives the browser and
navigate to the internal mock-up
application where I will they called it
a script in my window system and it
performed a few transaction I recorded
and the scripted execution is finished
and you can find a result report in HTML
format in the file systems where your
scripts are located and for this
demonstration I did not add optional
argument to run my script but you can
add more options to customize your
playback and supported the command line
options can be found in opens of the
users guide so please see appendix a
script command line reference section
for more details the next feature is new
options in the capture screenshots
setting for functional test scripts
prior to open script version 12 to only
option we have for this setting was to
capture the browser content now user can
select as your to capture only browser
content or to capture entire screen for
both recording and playing back
functional test scripts depend on your
preference when only browser content is
selected screen comparison generally
provides easier debugging as extra
desktop contents are excluded on the
other hand you may also want to check
messages displayed in browser status bar
in addition in some cases a script fader
could be affected by norm browser
factors for example there may be a
network Vader that terminated a
connection to the application during the
playback and maybe that is the reason
that your script was failed having the
entire screen captured you can detect
those messages during the playback let's
find this sitting in open script I'm
going to be open to the preference will
functional under record and I see
capture screen shot has two options only
capture browser content and capture
entire screen the default setting is to
capture browser content but you can
select to capture the entire screen
and the same options are available for
the playback as well and actually in
this playback dialogue at the
miscellaneous section there's another
setting capture entire screen on fail
this is also a new feature in 12 to that
we are going to talk about next the next
feature is the captured screenshot own
fader prior to version 12 to open script
capture the screenshots only when a page
is loaded the first time however the
script may fail with the subsequent
actions such as entering a text or
clicking a button on that page and the
screenshot that that timing is the
actually information you need open
script 12-2 has a new option to capture
the entire screen shot at the timing
when a skater is occurred so this way
you can know what exactly happened at
the failed command another new feature
that open script order to provide is a
new tab in a script pain that enables
easy access to configure script assets
script assets such as data bank files
object the library files child scripts
or jar files or dependent files that are
associated with the script the single
script can have multiple script assets
and need to be configured in the asset's
dialogue here in the virtual machine I
have previous version of openness credit
one open player the open secret version
12 to in order to configure these
scripts sets a user needed to for us to
go to the script menu go to the script
protease open up the script property
dialog select the script assets from the
tree view and now you have accessed the
script assets window now we are back at
22 and I can go to the same assets
window by clicking assets staff one
click
so this is a design improvement that
enables more convenient asset
configuration especially for users who
frequently update their script assets we
also have an enhancement in ADF
functional testing module to support DVT
data visualization tool controls open
script to the two now supports object
test verification on ADF DBT cage and
ADF DBT graph controls and for the ADF
graph controls recording and playback of
quick action is also supported here's
once again open skate 12 2 i'm going to
create a new ad a functional test script
and start recording this we're going to
launch a browser and I can navigate to
the application that I want to record
against and this is the ADF application
that has power control I'm going to
click bars in the graph and each time I
click a bar in the graph click ADF DBT
graph command is recorded into the
script and each of the command has a
serious index that locates which bar in
the object it can click at the playback
in this command the series index is one
and another has to this example was for
the bar graph but DBT graph control
support is for the other types of the
graph as well and here I have a script
that I recorded ADF pie graph and here
is the application I recorded I have a
pie graph in center and a table in the
right and each time I click a slice of
the pie corresponding data is displayed
in the table you can see the data body
changing as I click the slices so I'm
going to execute this script to see how
it plays back in my ATF application
now the playback has started and as the
command is executed the table is being
flash and you can see the data body
changing and this is because open
scripts new API for the ADF DVD graph is
clicking on different slices of the pie
as it is configured in the script and
lastly for the ADF dbt feature i'd like
to show you how we can verify values
using object test here I have gauged
control in my 80th application open open
Script API won't be able to record any
action performing this object but you
can use objects test to verify attribute
values for this object I'm selecting
objects test from the open script
toolbar and hovering my mouse cursor
onto the gauge object when an object is
highlighted it means opens to recognize
that object and you're ready to press
f10 to finalize a selection click ok and
here's the list of attributes you can
verify for the object I want to verify
the value of the indicator value and I
can also change the value type from the
string to numeric and also change the
operator to this time later than or
whether it is in the specific range of
values as a recorded value is 63 let me
set this from 65 to 70 so that it will
fail at the playback I'm going to click
OK and here is the objectives let me
bring it to the bottom of the script
and playback
and you see the object test has the
reported a failure as the body was now
in the specific range okay so that was a
DF DVD control support open script 12-2
also has other new features as in the
support of firefox browser 10 ESR now
users can record in claim at functional
test script with Firefox 10 ESR extended
support 3ds and the last new feature we
have four open script to that too is a
new setting automatically dismiss
javascript alert dialog the steering has
added to the open script preference with
functional playback section when this
setting is checked during the playback
if there is any unexpected javascript
alert dialog displayed open script will
automatically dismissed a dialog then
this action will be shown in the result
report and tells you at which stepped
alert dialog was dismissed and please
note that this feature only handles
javascript alert their logs the more
generic thyroid handling is being
planned for future releases next I'll
directly talk about new features and
updates for Oracle load testing and orgo
test manager worker load testing Twitter
to introduce the blog scenario module
which you can generate multiple
execution paths out from your existing
scripts it also provides a hardware
estimation feature that can give you an
estimate of what type of hardware you
will need for your specific scenario
player you're running your load test
from 80s version Twitter to you can run
functional test scripts in local load
testing also new load testing
accelerators are added for the Hyperion
and PeopleSoft applications finally
Oracle test manager introduced role
based security settings which allows you
to configure in 80's administrator to in
the first new feature we have for Oracle
load testing is a block scenario module
the block scenario is a new script
module that allows you to generate
complex virtual user scenarios
basically what you can do here is to
create a blog scenario script and add
existing scripts and functions in the
run them as child scripts but if that is
all about you can already do with the
current functionality well block
scenario script allows you to do
condition is to specify how many times
you want to I trait these child modules
or specify the percentage of the
execution so that it can create multiple
execution pass out from the existing
scripted sets and here's how to
configure your blog scenario script
first you need to create a blog scenario
script then you can add existing scripts
to your blog script as scripted sets
then go to the details view open block
XML tribute app using graphical user
interface you can specify which scripts
functions you want to run and you can
also add a folder which is called block
into the tree and configure how many
times you want to loop through or what
person at the time you want to execute
these modules within your scenario in
this example the first and last modules
are login and logout functions and they
will be always executed once in a single
iteration of the blog script then you
can see there are two blocks nested in
the parent block seventy percent of the
time the function ticker search you will
be executed and when executed he will
run twice and the rest of the thirty
percent a child block my bill view will
run and within the child block might be
of you there are two functions
displaying forty percent in the sixty
percent respectively the first function
bill portfolio will be executed with a
forty percent chance and while the
second function bill summary will be
executed sixty percent at time and we
will see this in the product first I
will need to create a blog scenario
script I'm going to the script wizard
and select block scenario script from
the tree view
i'll name this script rock do okay so I
have my Brock scenario script created
now I need to add other script to the
script a script to set I'm clicking the
asset staff to access to where I can
configure the script to set I'm going to
set the scripts from the tree view and
click Add i have a function library
script that I our previously configured
I'm going to select this script and
click OK my function library script was
added to my blocks in our script as a
script asset now I can go back to the
tree view and select run scenario node
and this will display tabs in the
details pane I am selecting block xml
treater right mouse click the main node
and select the add script as child from
the pulldown menu I will select a theme
stock functions which is the functional
every script i just added to the
scenario i can run the whole script or
select a function define in this script
i will serve to log in from the pulldown
menu i can select around once or
multiple times or what percent of the
time i want to run this function for
logging i will leave us default which is
run once hundred percent so the function
we always executed within the block
script click OK next I want to add a
block to the script right mouse click
I'll block ass child i'll name this my
block and leave the hydration of
schedule to default so that you always
run hundred percent click OK next within
the block I want to run a function
view portfolio I want to have it run
forty percent of the time and when it is
executed always run twice click OK so do
portfolio was added but I see the
percentage value of three percent is
displayed in red because a total
percentage block does not equal one
hundred percent so I need to add another
function that runs sixty percent at a
time so I'm going to add another
function deal summary and the schedule
is already showing sixty percent as
there is a max i can set for this
function click ok ok now i can run the
block script i'm going to run four times
to see what path you will take the
script is executed and the result is
coming back the first iteration run view
portfolio and the second iteration run
bill summary and the third iteration run
view portfolio and the fourth saturation
is running beautifully again the
scenario runs using random distribution
within the plan so this does not mean to
guarantee the percentage is specified
especially when you're running a blog
script with a small number of iterations
in open script however when you're
running all scenario in Oracle low
testing to generate the enough large
sample size then the results should be
close to the specified percentage so
this was a block scenarios mojo the next
feature we have is the olt hardware
estimation this feature will give you an
estimation what hardware you need to
prepare based on a specific scenario in
order to run X number of virtual users
without running the rail load test
before talking about this feature let me
show you the traditional way of doing
the hardware estimation
just for the comparison purpose when
planning for a low test a typical
question may arise is what hardware is
needed in order to run the load test for
example you may want to run 3000 virtual
user load test and need to come up with
a speck of hardware you need to prepare
but this is a very tricky question as
there is no generic answer that applies
to all situations it involves many
different factors and answers are
different by scenario to scenario this
slide shows how to do the hardware
estimation before Twitter too I'm now
going through the details of this slide
because there is not the purpose of this
presentation but the point is it
involves a lot of money 0 effort in fact
this slide shows even the easiest way of
doing the Manu estimation there is
another way which is more professional
way to monitor the agent resource using
j-rok admission control however eyes
your way you need to spend some time and
have to run a set of small load tests
and do manual calculation in order to
get the hardware estimation in Twitter
to you don't have to do this money will
rock anymore hardware estimation tool
will do this for you without running a
real low test in oil tea now we are back
at a hardware estimation tool what you
can do is that you pick a specific load
test scenario in the tool will estimate
the hardware required for that scenario
for you it gives you a report that tells
you how much resource the low test could
consume and suggest how to set the
proper configurations in this example
here is a current hardware configuration
information the example has only one
agent system but if you have multiple
agents configured in the scenario then
you will give you a report for each
agent and here is the estimated resource
consumption and finally the suggested
information on how you can configure the
settings to run the scenario in this
report the two estimated the total 1.6
gig ram may be consumed
by running 3000 virtual users and
therefore suggested to apply to gigabyte
for agent heap size as you can see all
the manual work we needed to do
previously can be done instantly using
the hardware estimation tool supported
load testing modules in total to our
with HTTP fusion ADF siebel and EBS
forms accelerators and also please note
the hardware estimation tool is not
suitable for block scenarios module
because it has more than one execution
pass in a single script let's see this
in the product I have an Oracle load
testing total to open email system I'm
logging into the application by clicking
the login button and going to load a
scenario that i have created previously
which is my SC and one this is my
scenario and i have two scripts
configure in the scenario that runs 1000
or users in total now i'm selecting
hardware estimation from the tools menu
and going to select a scenario that i
want to estimate against which the same
scenario i saw in the build scenarios
tablet previously my sen one click
custom it and in the background now the
tool is running a single virtual user
for both scripts in order to collect of
the resource consumption per single user
then going to estimate how much resource
in total you will need in order to run
specify a number of virtual users and in
this scenario case is 1000 so please
note that the estimation tool requires
to run a least one virtual user for each
of the specified script in the scenario
against application okay so now the
status changed to complete it so I can
place the bill report button to see the
result
and because of the rich contents of the
configure the script they have and also
the week agent system I have configured
for the scenario looks like I need seven
agent system with a similar spec with
the agent system configured in this
scenario in order to run 1,000 virtual
users the next new feature is Oracle
load testing support for functional test
scripts from 12-2 you can run functional
test scripts in work or load testing
along with the load test scripts in a
single scenario but please note the
running of function test script requires
much more resource than running a load
test script so running hundreds of
functional test scripts in your load
test may not be a practical model for
using this feature rather here are some
of the benefits of running a functional
test scripts in work or load testing you
can measure user response time during a
load test for example by running
functional test script in a load session
you can measure how much time it takes
to complete specific legal transactions
during the peak load condition it also
enables the easier debugging when
virtual users are fading with script
errors looking at the browser you may
see an error page coming back from the
application you can also use this
feature as an alternative to oracle test
manager functionality to run your test
cases just like you can run multiple
test cases in work or test manager you
can also run them in Oracle load testing
in order to run functional test script
in worker load testing you need to have
other line acts with VNC enabled or
Windows 2008 r2 with remote desktop
enabled I have oracle load test and
twitter to installed on a Windows 2008
system that has rdp service enabled in
the script view I see icons with
different colors functional scripts are
displayed in blue icon and load scripts
are displayed in green icon I'm going to
take the function
a script from the tree view and add to
the scenario and notice that the default
body of number of virtual user is one
for functional test scripts while the
low test script has 10 I am sending the
scenario to the autopilot tough and
select the iteration 2 1 i'm going to
start the load test save the session and
this will start the playback interactive
service down logs to the displayed i'm
going to select the Soudan message and
this will launch a remote desktop window
and now i can see my functional testing
script running in the remote desktop
window
I can also see the report of the session
I have just run and you see the response
times of action was executed during the
test and lastly for oracle load testing
a new feature we have a new low testing
accelerators for hyperion and PeopleSoft
applications they provide an easier
record and playback for testing these
applications and I am back at open
script Widow to when I select a new
script wizard I can see oracle hyperion
or PeopleSoft under load testing tree
node i can select these modules when i
create a script that I need to record
against these applications and the
correlation layer is can found in the
bill openscad preference correlation
here is Oracle Hyperion load correlation
library I can also see the variables
predefined to work specifically with the
Hyperion application and I can also see
the similar for the PeopleSoft the last
feature I want to introduce for 80s 22
is orko test managers role based field
security in orgo test manager 1202 now
administrator users can control which
roles can have read and write
permissions and withdrawals can have
read-only permission for specific fields
and this can be done in 80's
administrator tool in 80's administrator
tool when you add or edit fields or
field options a permission link shows up
in the edit field window you can click
the link to open permission window where
you can specify which rose to have what
permission for a specific field I have a
oracle test manager 12 to open i'm going
to log in with the user john john is
QA engineer I am at the execution tub
and I'm going to open test step one and
this is a test set he owns it is
assigned to Jang engineer that is his
name but users John can actually modify
the owner of field and he can assign to
somebody else the new role based feel
security feature in 12 to can disallow
him to change this field well he can
still have an access to this dialog and
also still have read and write
permission to other fields i'm going to
log in to the 80s administrator tool
first let's verify what role Joan has
John has QA engineer oh and let's also
check other users have tom has QA
manager role bill has QA engineer oh and
there a also has QA engineer oh so what
we want to have here is a rule that only
Tom who is a QA manager can modify the
owner field in the test sec window while
other QA engineers can out now I'm going
to the field stuff and select default
fields in test set and then the fields
that you see in a test that window I'll
list it in the right hand side I will
select the owner and click edit edit
field dialog opens and this is the new
link it is Twitter to provides
permissions I'm going to click this link
that opens permission dialogue so
currently everyone has read write
permissions what I'm going to do is to
select QA engineer row and move it to
the right but this section anyone who
has QA engineer Oh we'll only have
read-only access to the owner field in a
test at window I can also select other
roles to read only
the only QA manager can change the field
click OK log out and now login back to
the orgo test measure with a user Zhang
select test set one open now owner field
is disabled for users Joan well he can
still modify the other field in this
window so this was Oracle test managers
