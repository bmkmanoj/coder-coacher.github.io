to a tooling support for enterprise
development this afternoon we're going
to take a whirlwind tour of the Java EE
tooling landscape and show you how to
more effectively and more efficiently
create a new Java EE projects manage
existing projects and automate your
existing your existing environment I'm
Ryan Kubrick I run the Connecticut Java
users group and work with a work for two
social systems and in my free time I
co-authored the NetBeans certification
guide so hopefully I won't be too
coloured towards net mean this African
that means this afternoon oh yeah my
name is Reza Roman I used to be an
independent and also a co-author with
the Ryan here on etv three in action
actually I just joined Oracle as the
Java EE and Gloucester evangelist same
as our own Gupta if you're familiar with
him and hopefully I don't have a
NetBeans bias i don't think i may have a
just a tad bit of an eclipse bias but
that's it so looking over the past ja ve
has had a bad reputation part of that
reputation comes from the early days
when it was too complicated when it was
perceived as being too complicated
having long build times complicated and
expensive proprietary tooling copious
amounts of repetitive coding if you can
remember the early days with ejb3 ajb
one and two expensive application
servers and in many cases it was
overkill for many projects times have
definitely changed since 2000 java ee
made great strides and leveraging the
new features that came out with java SE
5 specifically annotations and now java
ee is fast easy and clean and definitely
more maintainable than the old code and
my favorite thing to say is that it is
now java ee not java to EE so the
challenge for this the objective so the
objective for this half of this session
we're going to focus on starting a new
prime starting a new project is often
painful in this presentation you'll
learn how to set up a new java ee
project and get it off the ground
quickly we'll also discuss the
disconnect between theory and practice
many times you read java ee books like
ejb3 and action or many of the other
books and i'll talk about the you know
the layout of prod
in terms of how you structure your ejb
jars and you know the different ways of
packaging your applications but they
don't tell you how to actually set up
the project with your tools so that's
one of the first challenges that you
often run into is how do you take what
you read in books and actually create a
working project and deploy it to a
container and the reality of this is
somewhat pragmatic I mean basically the
Java EE spectrum standards are talking
about the API is in the packaging but in
reality most of us aren't developing in
VI and Java Sea right hopefully these
days you know really we need more
tooling to make our if make our
environment much more automated and
that's the disconnect that I think we're
trying to just consume yep so so we're
going to cover the tools that you could
consider a learning adding we're also
going to cover the best practices for
java ee development from the tool side
um and then one is then one point to
consider is when is the last time you've
evaluated your tools how many of you
have updated a new version of Eclipse
within the last new version of Eclipse
your IDE within the last six months how
many know how many no co workers that
have not updated their development
environment in at least a year also wall
so the types of applications that kind
of fall into you know in terms of that
determine how you set up your projects
you know first of all you're working
with prototype to verify technology like
if you're trying out you know ejb3
timers or something like that you're
probably going to start off with the
prototype that you're in a bank you know
prototype some code in to see how it
works on toss it away later so say
you're turning to troubleshoot a bug in
your application figure out how you JB
timers work so you prototype it so
that's that's one type of project
another type of project is the throw
away an application that's being used
for a short period of time to say
perform data integrations or something
along those lines you know it's got a
life expectancy of a couple of months
but you know probably at the end of the
year the thing will be tossed away then
you have your internal external portal
with your applications that have a long
life expectancy that are exposed to
other users but the application is
something that you maintain internally
and you have control over the
environment and everything else and so
you want to minimize your dependence on
tools and then the fourth type is a
product an application which is deployed
at more than one customer site possibly
multiple code brain
as you customize it for different
customers but you have to have a
repeatable process you have to have you
no paths for being able to migrate a
customer from version you know 12
version 2 to version 5 managing database
changes etc and the last point is a life
expectancy really drives the tooling
decisions so considerations for a Java
EE toolbox build systems if the one of
the first things they have to consider
is the build system are you going to
pick for your new project or an existing
project if you're upgrading it ant maven
or are you going to use something I de
specific you're going to depend upon the
IDE for compiling and deploying a
project outside and not have the
capabilities for doing a command line or
continuous integration builds a what
type of glassfish sorry what type of
container are going to use are going to
be supporting glassfish jboss are even
support weblogic in production and
develop using glassfish internally on
your on your development machine because
it's more lightweight what technologies
are using or using ejb are using
enterprise javabeans JPAC da you know
XML beans you name it what is your
primary development environment such as
Eclipse NetBeans do you have a mixed
environment where some developers stones
are you know still develop using them
others use Emacs and then you've got an
IDE idea and an eclipse user thrown in
for good measure and then other tools
you know such as unit testing
integration testing UI testing how do
you you know perform regression on your
software on a regular basis so the Ides
that we're going to cover today or
netbeans and some of the key points with
it as NetBeans is easy to use it has
many java ee templates that which makes
you know creating a new project in
experimenting with some of the new
features very easy and includes a number
of includes a pre-configured glassfish
container so if you are interested in
playing around with some of the new Java
EE things that you learn this week you
can download netbeans and fire it up and
you've got a glassfish environment you
don't have to go out and configure a
container and you know figure out how to
debt with the ID and it has support for
bleeding edge java ee technologies so
sauna so oracle is really you know
putting the latest and greatest into it
I don't know how many of you saw the
keynote where they were demoing the
html5 support but they've actually
embedded the Java I think it's the
JavaFX webview control so that you can
actually debug your JavaScript
and see it executes in the IDE will also
be covering IntelliJ which has excellent
editor support auto completion and code
analysis and support for complex project
structures and my rate of different web
technologies beyond just the Java such
as flex and Android development eclipse
which has wide industry adoption
external drive eee tools there's also
plugged in many a large ecosystem of
plugins such as jboss tools so just out
of curiosity how many of you are that
means users Eclipse IntelliJ vim they do
look ok and and then last point is a
here exploring ja ve for the first time
NetBeans is probably your best bet in
terms of getting up and running because
the tooling there is definitely much
easier ok so you know beyond those basic
tools that we talked about obviously we
won't weigh in there's a lot of other
tools that you potentially will need I
know full-fledged develop in the
environment obviously in this top we
won't cover all of it but the reason for
this slide is for you to really think
about I'm going to go away from this
presentation and start thinking about
some of this tooling in addition to what
we show you today so we talked about you
know a ryan mentions a bus tools a
little bit i will talk about j bus rules
a little bit more on where in the club
section of the doc said let's skip over
that for now if you haven't considered
it we definitely recommend jarabo you
know it's an excellent tool to use with
any application server to reduce you
know your deployment turnaround time so
that's it that again you know in
addition to the basic ID and build
systems and the like is something you
should consider another thing you should
absolutely consider if you are doing
java ee development is it to a to from j
busco arquillian i'll show you look
Allah Allah talk about arquillian again
a little bit more towards the end of the
presentation but basically what Arcadium
does is it makes it possible how to
usefully test a unit test java ee code
um the other a tool that gets Ryan
really wanted to mention with liquid
base you wanna talk about liquid base
above it yeah so what could base it
basically version control
for your database so you put all of your
ddl and liquid base and then you can say
bring a database version from you know
version 1 up to version 10 of your
software so if you're doing with you
know an environment where you you know
you have a customer at version hey you
deploy new drop to the customer you want
to bring them up the most current you
run your local biscuit script it keeps
track of what database scripts you've
executed on the database includes check
sums etc because you know although the
j2ee to the Java EE tools you know you
have support for you know auto
generating schemas and everything you're
probably not doing that product or
hopefully not doing that in a production
environment where you know your
application starts up in the first thing
it does is drop all of your tables and
recreate them anyway so a jmeter a
beyond unit unit testing and function of
listening jmeter is is another tool i
would definitely recommend for you and
what jmeter does is it's an excellent
tool for stress testing your application
once you your once you have a unc ready
to do a release hudson Jenkins is again
i think pretty much a staple these days
you know continuous integration
environments anybody that does agile
development you know or even if you're
not doing agile development still
excellent tools to have beyond basic
beyond your basic tool set selenium is
another tool we recommend selenium is
useful and not necessarily for you as a
developer but really more for functional
testing especially for your QA folks you
know to do automated automated
functional testing it really takes out a
it reduces the QA cycles quite a bit i'm
so py if you happen to be using rest or
or soap jax-ws or jack cyrus and job IE
parlance so POS an excellent tool again
functional test both of those and even
to some degree unit test both of those
in addition to that in a production
environment you will need things like
monitoring tools and profiling tools so
monitoring tools are things that you
know basically is a is a gut check on
what your runtime environment looks like
so things like nauseas HP openview IBM
tivoli oracle enterprise manager and the
like and of course you can you name your
favorite there's a whole ecosystem of
those tools is just the primary ones as
well as profiling so runtime profiling
in here
you'll notice some familiar names like
jay profiler but we also want to want to
make a note of some tools that are free
right they essentially free and an
extremely useful almost just as useful
as jay profiler and j probe and the like
net Bentham NetBeans profiler built into
the NetBeans IDE as well as visual vm
which comes free with your jdk so you
know feel free to fire up you navigate
to your bin directory and double-click
on what this visual vm thing is and i
think you'll be pleasantly surprised
actually the visual vm that's actually
duplicate there because visual vm and
the NetBeans profile are one and the
same so visual vm is just the NetBeans
profile are packaged up separately so
it's actually an effing is application
that comes with the jdk and you actually
if you're using the NetBeans profile or
you do not have to be using NetBeans to
develop your project you don't even have
to have your code loaded into NetBeans
comes with things so that you can
actually for instance use sequel queries
to examine your java heat to find out
you know how many connections to oracle
do you have and who's who's actually
using those connections to oracle so if
you've got some type of database layer
that's leaking database connections you
can easily find that so one of the
important decisions to make as we
mentioned earlier when you starting up a
project is what type of build system are
you going to use and I've got my break
it out into four different build systems
aunt so some of the pros with aunt is
that it's infinitely flexible on the
definitely too flexible you can
definitely recreate you know uh you know
basically pearl like scripts using aunt
it has integrated support with most IDEs
such as intelligent and netbeans
NetBeans out all the NetBeans built-in
projects actually use aunt underneath
the hood the cons to using answer
there's no defined project standard I'm
as a maintenance headache at with IDE
can be a maintenance headach with IDE
integration and then maven the purse to
maven are has a standard project layout
so if you know if you're familiar with
one maven project you're familiar with
basically all of them it's got to pay it
handles dependency management for you so
if you download a new version of a jar
file you don't have to go in there and
figure out how to add it to your custom
aunt file and then add it to the IDE if
you're not if you're using the IDE to
build things though you could use IV we
would with end as well to do dependency
manager if you so wish yep
and right now maven is supported by all
of the Ides so in the case of both
IntelliJ in netbeans you don't have to
download a separate plug and they'll
actually open up your maven projects as
a native project for the IDE so if
you've got users that are but and then
jboss I'm sorry uh Eclipse including the
jboss tools as a maven plugin so that
you can actually open up your maven
project as a native application so if
you have a environment where you've got
multiple people do using different ID
IDEs maven is a really good solution
because anybody can open it up and will
appear the same in a lot of the Ides the
constitute it does have a steep learning
curve it is harder to customize and
sometimes the build cycle times in terms
of you know building your application
and deploying it in the you know and be
challenging in particular as compared to
ide based you know your your IDs built
in bill system which typically will use
incremental deployment to reduce you
know the the compilation until cycle and
then the other to build systems are you
know an IDE specific one these are the
ones that come with both IntelliJ and
eclipse where it has its own mechanism
of building it on the the drawbacks to
that is that you don't have a command
line build the benefits are that all the
maintenance and maintenance of a build
system is done via the GUI you get the
incremental compiling so it's extremely
fast because they want to you know have
advertised in a fast round trip times
the cons are is not portable it will run
and definitely run trouble with a
continuous integration servers and then
the other approach which generally
consider a bad idea as a hybrid approach
where you use maven or ant and then you
use your ID specific build system to do
the development there so you might have
a ant to build you know to build your
product and release it and bet you do
all of your development using your IDE
problems that you can run into their as
you add one thing but then it you know
you get it working with the IQ you check
in to fix you add something in the IDE
but then it breaks your build with the
ant script so cons ards twice twice the
work um so you know we I guess we kind
of feel obligated to put in the j2ee
packaging slide here and this will be
useful when we actually talked about you
know that the disconnect between how
this maps to the various ideas that will
cover today and in some of the build
systems that will cover today so this is
the old j2ee packaging mechanic
if you will so the drop very top of the
hierarchy you have an ear file you and
keep in mind you don't necessarily have
to have an ear file you can simply have
a war files and ejb jar files that are
not interlace it but however if you if
you need in interdependencies between
your war files and ejb jar files the
doing need need to be inside of an ear
so at the very top level you have an ear
file beyond that you have an ejb jar
okay so that's a base your basic you
know component reuse that happen in via
hav jars the adobe jars would have a
mitten directory in them and the inside
of the meta en trajectory is where you
would have on the deployment descriptors
namely kbjr dot XML persistent start XML
for jpa beans or XML if you are using
CDI inside of your hav jar file um and
and so on and so forth and of course you
have your other artifact which is the
war file and the war file as you know
has a web in can have the web being a
webex MLB's dot as well as the beans or
XML and as well as the other artifacts
as well in addition Ted you can have a
Lib file where you can package up
whatever things that are not easy Ibiza
not who is for any reason you don't want
in your war file ok so this is the
simplified packaging so for those of you
who are not familiar with it this was an
a nice of you simplification that was
added in Java EE 6 ok so what this does
is basically it allows you to package
you jayvees inside of a war file which
was not possible you know the prior to
job IE java ee 6 so basically in this
schematic you have a flattened war file
so you have you know your war you have
your web in in the closest directory you
would package up your e jayvees you have
your of course your web artifacts and
all of your deployment descriptors that
you need including the ejb grr xml and
beans note xml and persistence or xml
and so on so one of the benefits with
this is that you can then use your java
ee features you know stateless session
beans timer being message-driven beans
and all of that stuff without having to
deal with the complicated packaging that
you saw on the previous slide which gets
very complicated if you if you turn this
up an ID
project for this is just a review of
again those configuration files in it
again there'll be more for context when
we talk about the eye when we talk about
setting up the projects beans dot XML
again if you're not familiar with the
disc pertain pertaining to CDI okay so
here's where you can figure your
dependency injection web directional is
basically servlets and the like ETA VT r
dot XML is your e JV deployment
descriptors application dot XML is used
primarily in the ear file and for the
most part you will not need an
application directional however you will
need it if you want to specify custom
library lib directories and the like
persistence.xml let's forge APA and
faces config directional is for jsf the
one thing that i guess we wanted to
wanted you to note is notice of version
number and and the x SD numbers
sometimes some IDEs will well when they
auto generate these xml artifacts they
have subtle bugs where they don't really
specify the version numbers correctly so
always be mindful of that even if it's
generated xml file make sure that the
excess use the right version and you
have the right version specified in your
deployment descriptor so for instance if
you went through the IDE you know you're
trying to create your first java ee 6
project you went through it and you're
accepted the defaults that this
particular idea that i use for this
example had for you you'd end up using
the servlet specification 2.5 now when
you tried to use those nice new servlet
annotations on your classes those have
not actually work you've got to run time
in your servlets would not be picked up
and you'd be sitting there scratching
your head thinking oh geez this doesn't
work you know what did i do wrong and
you would have to look back at your web
that xml file the top of it and the
container is actually looked containers
actually looking at the versions that
you have up there to figure out what
version of the spec you should can plug
your compliant to yep and it's just as
simple as missing one little text box
you know in your project setup and
suddenly you're spending hours trying to
figure what it is that's going wrong so
again you know these these are some of
the common things that you should watch
out for so tooling challenges so with
that with that in mind how do you create
a new project from scratch of either of
those tight too
to project layouts that we showed you
how do you go about importing an
existing project creating a valid java
ee configuration files how many of you
have ever sat out there you know
googling the web trying to find a you
know the an example beans xml file to
paste into your ide how many of you have
ever you know done that thing where you
pasted in the wrong version of the
web.xml file in there and then spent
time try to figure it would happen how
do you navigate the java ee features
effectively how do you find what are
your enterprise javabeans are you
getting warnings if you're working with
CDI whether you're the thing that you're
trying to inject doesn't actually exist
the the label on it is wrong you had a
typo in your named annotation you know
how do you find those things and then
finally how do you manage the evolution
of a project and the ja ve technologies
as time changes and new versions come
out so with that in mind I will go dive
into the Ides so the leading Java IDEs
right now are NetBeans 7.2 IntelliJ 11
and currently eclipse juno is one ide
better than the others no i actually
switch between all three of the Ides at
work and i use them for different
reasons on the same project if you
happen to be an architect that you know
is managing or or technically that's
managing a large team with multiple IDs
guess what it that's just you know what
you need to do is no no all of the IDS
in there in the nuts and in some cases
in the past I discovered you know
warning and one ide is not like as a
problem on another ID or an error it is
actually increase incorrectly in hair
that's no corrective another ID he has
it correct so what are the major
differences between the Ides at least
from the dr e perspective first off
you're starting a new project the
available project templates what do you
have available to support in containers
so each of the ids has a different set
of containers of the support out of the
box how do you setting up and
configuring external libraries of course
ease of use and then some of the unique
features for the Ides so NetBeans has
you know the integrated profiling
support hudson integration CDI if you've
been through any of the other set of the
other sessions the other day especially
the keynote the html5 support and the
java effects support so using the javafx
support you could grade a desktop sorry
a javafx application that deploys and
talks to each
these fairly easily ID idea has
excellent code inspections it's got
integrated soap UI and then you know for
some shops you're not using jsf you
might be using ejv on the back end and
then flash flex on the front end they do
have JavaScript editors etc and then
Eclipse has a plethora of you know
external plugins that give you a bunch
of different things we sighs what the
IDE provides so if you're developing
with GWT you know doing aspectj stuff so
it's got a giant Jenny attic gigantic
set of tools available for you and so
some of the key features to create
consider are the project creation
management you know what was observable
container integration as I mentioned
before generating checking configuration
files generating you know entities
versus crud so if you're starting for
new application you want to quickly
generate you know entities off the
database jaqua j ql query code
completion so some of them have code
completion so that you can actually test
that you're Jake will take UL queries
without having to run your application
to play it and find out whether you
actually did it right l code completion
including support for CDI CDI jsf jsf
validation etc and some of the
screenshots on the right here is just
kind of illustrated there's no way that
we could possibly get through all the
different features to consider but we've
got in on the first one the one that's
sticking out we've got a CDI example
where I'm actually injecting an entity
incorrectly so the first one you know it
Flags it as a little I there means that
it's injected and that's working a
little icon on the next one tells you
that you've got a problem there that's
why it's underlined because there's
nothing you know can't find anything to
inject and then the screenshot behind
that is actually showing you database
you know within the database so the
first I first ide that I'm going to
cover is the JetBrains one so there's
actually two editions of the Jeb reigns
won the community in the ultimate
edition if you're doing java ee
development you really need the ultimate
edition because that's where all the
features are and they actually they do
charge for that so there is a
two-hundred-dollar personal license as
well as a $99 academic license and then
there's a different plans for if you're
out of corporation it's got you know
it's got all the standard things that
we've covered thus far basically all the
Ides you know basically cover all the
major features
got support for running application
servers out of it you can launch your
application server and deploy your
application and debug get and Scott
support for CDI jpa code completion
after all the standard things that you'd
expect the build system it does not it
supports maven and IDE specific it does
not out-of-the-box integrate with aunt
like you'll see when I discussing that
means or or if you've played around with
the Eclipse builders so it does have its
own build system the drawbacks to that
are of course you know you can't use
outside of the IDE so it's got the
benefits of that has incremental
compiling tight integration with ie
complete management in the UI cetera and
you can actually using your ID project
you can actually if you're using maven
you can actually generate a
configuration file for it it's got
really good a broad range of containers
that it supports out of the box
including weblogic websphere j plus all
the standard ones as well as jsr 45
compatible servers and the servers can
be either at local or remote so you can
be defined to a remote server so a
couple of concepts if you're new to idea
and you're looking at playing around
with it for for playing around with it
and say you're coming from the NetBeans
world it's got concept of a project and
project is an organizational unit that
represents a complete solution so it's
your complete project not you'll see how
this compares a little NetBeans later
the module is discrete unit of
functionality that can be compiled run
tested independently such as a war and
JV jar and then you've got facets which
represents a framework technology
language used in the module to project
formats when you go to create a project
will give you the option of either a
directory or file based it's really up
to you which one you want to use it just
has ramifications for going to check it
into version control so with the Java EE
project something too important to
remember is there's no predefined ja ve
template so if you're creating a new
project you don't have any predefined
you know there's not a you know here
create an ear create an ear project for
me there's nothing out of the box that
says create an ear project you have to
kind of set that up there are three
starting points you can start from a new
new project from scratch you can create
a project from an external model such as
maven and it or you can do from an
existing sources so you haven't exist
some sources and you don't care with the
built without the build system that
you're using
take that approach and then after you've
set up your project yet facets for
endframe works with a different java ee
features and configure the artifacts for
drive eee packaging okay so this kind of
gives you a snapshot here I won't go
over this in detail but you have your
the part on the left there is what your
project wizard will create and then
after you set up your project if you
want to do features such as CDI you have
to configure those afterwards so just
because you went through the wizard and
you created a job a web web application
project doesn't mean that you have a you
have cd I support you have to add that
in separately and you actually have to
possibly download the CD I
implementation jars reviews so with that
I'm going to try doing a demo and
hopefully it works what demo gods are
good move into idea so I'm going to
create a new web-based project so i'm
going to create a project from scratch
i'm going to first i'm going to tackle
the simplified project the actual
creating the ear i'm probably going to
post a web blog later going over how to
do the ear project because we don't have
enough time to actually set that all up
during this one hour session so i'm
going to do action bizarre there's the
name of the app name of the application
from ejb in action and it's got a couple
of settings you know the module name
content route this is where all the
content goes then you can actually have
your configuration files to the project
stored separately say okay the next
question is just your source module and
then on the third on the the third
screen you actually pick which
technologies you want to use i'm going
to do web applications jsf and then i'm
going to pick primefaces so i want to
you know generate the initial project
with you know the prime faces jars and
how many of you were using primefaces
and it's going to actually download
everything so people don't boo boo pelon
download okay I'll plate it java
persistence we're going to use jpa and
we're going to use glassfish as the
application server so this is where we
set up initially but finish
what it's going to do right now it's
actually working it's got a good network
connection it's actually downloading all
the jars for the project onto my machine
locally and one of the caveats with this
is that and the the jars that is
downloading may possibly differ with the
container that you're running in
loaded and the initial project that it
created by default that will create a
JSP based project so we're not using
payslips or anything else that is an
additional set of tests that you'll have
to do afterwards you have to reconfigure
that it's downloaded the lib files that
we said before now over on the sides
here we've got see if we've got our
persistence manage our persistence
manager so it created a default on by
default and we can go in here and
generate mappings generate code from our
database schema so you'll see you know
all the IDS we're going to demo
basically the same thing throughout all
the IDS all the IDS had the same
capabilities here so I'm going to
generate code generate code off of those
oops yes and it's actually going out to
the database the connections of the
database i set up separately earlier so
it's actually going out there and
sucking down the analyzing tables and
generating code for the tables
to run it we can edit configurations
ketchup in the glass special
configuration welchol one I registered
the container now if you're using ID
you're going to have to go out download
your container separately configure it
and then log into ID and you type in
your passwords and cipher projects i
deploy so it's going to ask which
scepter and which which artifact we're
going to play I don't module settings
let's see and one of the things to watch
out for if you're if you're doing this
for the first time when you go to run
your application it actually isn't going
to run because it's going to take and
put your jsf implement your jfm jsf
implementation files into your classpath
which is going to screw up glassfish in
this case so you actually have to go in
here and reconfigure it so does provided
provided is provided by the container
otherwise you're going to overwrite you
know basically conflicted with the
container has and you'll get a nice
nullpointerexception which I was getting
earlier oh that's not the one you get a
nullpointerexception when you went to
run it that's just something that's part
of the Genesis for this the Genesis for
this presentation is the frustrations
that you have getting a project up and
running the first time so anyways that's
that snap beans and we can if we also
can add in the CDI support so that by
default you can't configure in the
initial module for setting up the things
so you go down to facets we're going to
add in CDI and ask you which module do
you want to add it to give it a second
to think then click on you know jboss
weld apply and then support for this is
a little flaky you have to actually go
out download jboss weld and add it to
your project so just because I've
selected it here doesn't mean it's added
to the project I have to actually go out
and download the jar files
like if I went back to the code a code
editor right now and tried to type the
name that's not going to find that class
so you know where as it went out and
downloaded the jpa classes it doesn't
necessarily old always depends upon how
I set the project sometimes a little
download detected at this point and
download it but it didn't somewhat
subjective statement is idea is seems to
be slightly less mature in terms of it e
60 for trade yeah and some of that some
of the cutting edge features yet so
forth i'm also i'm also a fan of idea so
I don't not turn annakut I actually use
it a lot so that's that's idea so the
wizard some of the wizard created a
single module project the project uses
technology technologies that you
selected download as many of the Java EE
dependencies but not necessarily all of
them additional modules can be created
after the fact there's actually quite a
bit more complicated if you want to set
up a near project and I'm going to try
to get a weblog up for a screencast up
at some point by the end of the week
with that and then what have we
accomplished so we basically set up a
new project with jpa ejb i did not
deploy it to the GlassFish it is a time
and some of the challenges we had the
container installation separate some of
the libraries have downloaded
configuration files like with a CDI it
doesn't generate the beans that XML file
so I actually have to go out there and
grab the beans of XML file and put it
into into my project into the web in the
directory otherwise you know although i
would have selected you know i want to
use you know well then everything when i
go to run my application none of my
injection points would actually be
executed because it wouldn't be the
container would not be scanning the
project because i didn't have a beans
that xml file in it that's something
that you have to be aware of and then
required posted up project creation okay
so i'm going to shift over to NetBeans
NetBeans has got excellent support for
java ee ja ve support is not a separate
downloaded feature so you don't have to
download anything separate install any
plugins or anything like that saying
this is like idea comes comes with
everything built in the one benefit that
or a big benefit is it has predefined
project templates for you for getting
you up and running so it's got you know
three different web templates I live
Apple you know in the template support
you know CDI ejb out of the box you
don't have to it does it's not going to
go out and try downloading into any
dependencies for you it's got all of
them there for you already
there's also got six different java ee
templates for enterprise application
development enterprise applications with
existing sources etc so then we should
note that this is a Eclipse job I
eversion we're talking about right the
this other a burn sorry Ned been others
other NetBeans versions with this
happens to be the Hawaii person that has
all these templates Gupta yes and now
hello it's it's that this means that it
comes with everything you can actually
activate the teachers separately if you
download one of the lighter weight
NetBeans so you just go in during the
activate features so it's just it
basically determines the size of the
download I'll just download the the
NetBeans modules NetBeans has full
support for javi g6 integrated support
for CDI like like IntelliJ does IntelliJ
I didn't show it on the side that
IntelliJ actually has a nice little fold
out window which will give you all of
your request scopes it's got some very
nice features in terms of visualizing
the CDI stuff so although there were
some initial problems with the NetBeans
demo or the NetBeans portion in terms of
setting up the dependencies once you get
NetBeans up and running it's got some
very nice you eyes for navigating and
seeing what's going on with CDI which
you don't have in that means so the
service and it has service integration
monitoring data and a built-in database
editor so you can actually execute
database eight statements jpa support
all the standard stuff and one of the
one neat thing that it does the other
neat thing has it has integration putts
and so it can actually kick out Hudson
jobs to build things and then NetBeans
comes with numerous templates so you
don't have to go out there googling to
try to find your beans that XML file for
it so we've got a whole bunch of
different web type things where you want
to create a JSP page a JSF page you know
etc you know jsf tag libraries these are
a bunch of jsf template so these are all
the templates that will create for you
like session beans you want to create a
session bean but you don't want to i go
up you don't remember the the
annotations for it same thing with
context and dependency you know you want
to write a qualifier persistence in the
persistence entities so it's very easy
to navigate all of the stuff create it
restful webservice you want to create a
Westfold clients you know server and etc
go through there and do that as well as
container specific configuration files
and then editors for CSS so I can
actually visualize your CSS changes and
if you saw the keynote in the next and
netbeans 7.3 you'll actually be able to
make your changes to the CSS and they
immediately take effect over the web
browser without restarting redeploying
your application and then NetBeans has
integrated a nice this one tab called
services where you can register
different servers so you can have an
umpteen different servers registered and
then you can you know easily navigate
and get to the administration portion of
those those servers and you know see
what JDBC resources you can spend on the
tabs or see what applications are
deployed and a network okay so you've
got you know you've got your huts and
integration servers you can register web
services there's a bunch of different
things maven repositories and then maven
NetBeans doesn't have a concept of
modules so modules are concepts that
idea maven intelligent maven has
projects that can depend upon other
projects so that's that's how it works
modules is everything is a project and
then projects can depend upon other
projects and the other project doesn't
necessarily have to be open in the ID it
just has to be in a place that I can
find it projects always produce an
artifact so even if you can create you
can create a project that uses your own
custom ant build file and then you can
have another project that's and that
beans or a maven project and have the to
depend upon each other project types so
netbeans has got different types of
projects which the other two ideas
really don't have one as a standard
project which uses a NetBeans generated
ant build file NetBeans does not have
its own build system that's outside of
you know the tools that you're used to
using so any NetBeans native project
that you create is going to use ant
under the hood and it's going to have
extension points which also show on
another slide maven projects actually
use made innate maven natively and it
also has a concept of a free-form
project which is basically where you're
just using NetBeans to edit the source
code so you can actually use this if
you've got an existing Java EE project
you want to pull it into NetBeans to
work with it to gain some of the
features of NetBeans
you can pull it you can create a
free-form project tell it where your
source files are tell where your library
files are pointed at your aunt files and
then it's got a nice little dialogue
which allows you to map the IDE specific
actions to your aunt file so you can
configure you know what is the run
target for your aunt task and point it
at the run tower the execute target in
your aunt file so idea will completely
delegate everything over to your a file
for you and won't do any compliation or
anything like that for you and then so
you know one of the decisions that you
face them with netbeans that you don't
necessarily have some of the other IDEs
is you know when you're creating a new
project you know are you know how do you
pick which approach to take are you
creating an existing project yes or no
you know and then that determines
whether you're working with existing
build system organs the job at free farm
project or you can use a Navin template
etc so this this whole matrix of
decisions here you have to actually run
through to figure out which type of
approach that you want to take with it
so this is another demo watch NetBeans
you were shut down idea say from save
some memory
for this to launch I had downloaded
NetBeans 7.3 but I didn't feel like
going out on the edge today using it
developer build last night some of the
html5 stuff looks very very cool so as
we can see here I'm going to create a
new project and you'll see that the
dialog looks quite a bit different than
the one that we saw previously we've got
our standard Java we've got our web web
project here and we've got three
different choices initial we're going to
do a simplified java ee web project a
simplified approach we're not creating
an ear file we wanted to create an ear
file you switch down to this one we'd
say enterprise java application and it's
going to create a complete project
structure with an ear and everything
that we need without all the
configuration files that we need
everything is going to be there and we
can hit deploy in the application will
just rot we can start writing code at
that point I'm going to do a simple web
web application project okay and the use
the dedicated folder since this is a
NetBeans project any jar files that I
download and add to the project file a
little I can optionally have it stored
in the lib directory so you can check
the project into version control and
then other developers can check it out
go through it on the next slide here I
configure my application server I'm
going to go with the Java EE 6 web
profile I'm going to enable context of
dependency injection it the next one
here they've actually got a bill to
select which web technology that I want
to use framework that I wanna use i'm
going to use javaserver faces and then
as a component library i'm going to
select primefaces now one of the neat
things with selecting primefaces is that
when i use netbeans to generate a simple
crud application for my database it's
actually going to use the prime faces
widgets for doing that so it's not going
to just generate you know the standard
old XHTML a standard old stuff I click
finish goes ahead and creates the
project and
and if you were importing an existing
project you could you could use the you
know existing sources or freeform
project and map it to your existing aunt
file and then you can take advantage of
all the new Java EE features and try
them out with your existing application
so I'm going to expand it and let's go
ahead and add a persistence context to
our applications and add this and i'm
gonna select as my data source and when
I select my data source it's actually
going to configure when I go to run
glassfish it's actually going to
configure the data source and glassfish
so when I go to run my application the
data sources going to be there and
available for the application so i don't
have to like at this point go into okay
now you know i want to use a database
with my application i have to go over
and figure out how to configure that and
get the get it working the GlassFish
nodal will take care of that for me for
the most part great that I notice you
have the little check box is there
whether you want to destroy your
database every time you run it and it's
created it now i can create entities
from database i'm gonna do the same
thing that I did before right now it's
scanning the database for entities add
them all click Next write a package and
it's going to create also unlike the if
I went back and look at the intensity
code that intelligent generate it's
going to create a bunch of findeth find
named queries for me and just accept it
settings there there's actually help on
each of those pages so you can look up
the different things if you're not
familiar with the things it's a great
way to see what all features are
available by just going through these
Wizards because sometimes it's real
learning exercise will discover things
that you know unless you sit down there
and read through the you know through
the xml schema for some of the specs you
know you would necessarily know that so
it's generated the code reason with that
one and then I'm
to generate a JSF page from entity class
and it's going to hopefully search
through entities eventually
okay okay go ahead and wipe them a hit
he build something went wrong I've done
this at least 20 times in preparation
for the presentation he manages to
surprise me do jsf pages for entity
class well it's not letting me like them
I think that's a class that I had before
I'm so corrupted the database so anyway
so if I had done that it would have
actually generated a crud based jsf web
page with some controllers that I could
use for doing that and then we have just
to show off some of the other features
we do have you know if you're editing
persistence of XML file its you can
either edit in the source or design mode
it's got a bunch of different teachers
with this same with all of your editors
switch back over 20 pounds now if I
chosen one of the other templates who
created a java ee java year project this
is what it would have created on the
left and you can kind of see the overall
packaging and tried to depict that
pictorially for you so you can see with
it had an ear file in a ejb jar and then
a war file on the inside so it would
have created everything for and you
could just start writing your code in
there you wouldn't have to you know
right aunt feel files and try to figure
out you know what files and eat in order
to build it and finally the bill pile as
I mentioned before if you're using the
ant it's got many hooks in there the ant
files are actually readable and you can
actually extend them so you're not using
some some horrible we generated XML
build file that you can't maintain
afterwards it's actually fairly easy to
maintain very this is you know it's it's
a nice spam file and then you know
NetBeans generates a bunch of different
project settings and the build that XML
file there's a directory called private
which you which contains all of your
settings that are specific to your local
machines such as and what to check into
version control etc so the difference is
I'll quickly scan through these
differences between you know you know
the NetBeans provides many different
project templates there's no need to
download a CD I implementation glassfish
comes prepackaged with it so you don't
have to download that separately
our subset of supported containers and
integrated support for brunette beans
okay so i don't actually have a lot of
lot of slides for eclipse i just wanted
to you know just primarily focus on the
demo if you will I'm as you know you
know eclipses is very very popular it's
by far the most popular ide the true
power of eclipse really does come from
its plug-in ecosystem so by default you
know what you need to download in order
to develop with Java EE is a job IE
version of eclipse and that will give
you eighty to ninety percent of what it
is that you need and beyond that you
know what you can do is simply get
whatever plugins that you need for
example if you choose not to go with the
built-in eclipse builders and you want
to use maven instead all you need to do
is go download a.m. to eclipse and then
you can basically use maven as your
build system and in eclipse there's a
couple of different java ee projects
types i'll go over those you know
they're listed here i'll go over those
in the de amor real quick besides
besides but the built in java ee ID
features and eclipse one of the things
that you absolutely should look into if
you're doing java a development with
eclipse is something called a bas tools
i mean gbus tools basically meets the
gap between word eclipse is today which
is eclipse juno and what the java ee
specs are so eclipse juno currently does
not have things like you know very very
disparate support for CDI very very good
support for jsf and the like but it does
have very good support on the other hand
for jpa and then certainly basic
servlets some ejb support you know i
would say ninety percent of ejb support
so up I in the demo well show you that I
Eclipse version with jboss tools
installed I'll try to show you the
things that are just a plain june /
source of things that are that are in
contact come from j bar stools it's very
very easy to install it's just available
through the eclipse marketplace i'll
show you the actually i can show you the
eclipse Marcus marketplace because of
the really crappy really crappy internet
connection here but you can download
the Eclipse market market risk it's just
as easy as installing any other eclipse
plugin and that's really it I think the
rest of it all just all this demo I'll
just do it in the demo here so this is
eclipse juno for those of you who are
not familiar with it you know it's it's
the current release of eclipse and
basically in eclipse everything is a
project every project you get roughly
corresponds to a java java artifact
namely a war file or near file so we'll
go ahead and create a new project here
and as you know i'm there is various
built-in project templates in Eclipse so
the ones that are of interest for us are
the ones for ejb are namely an ejb pro
and sorry an ejb project or and as well
as that an enterprise application
project you also have for jpa a.j.p a
project and the like and of course
there's a whole bunch of other other
project types that you can also use i'll
show you some of the ones that come from
jboss so in here we have jboss central
jboss central actually has another java
ee web project similar to the dynamic
web project in that comes with you know
the difference is that this is a maven
based project so what they're literally
doing is they're using em to eclipse to
generate generate a file from sorry
generate a project from a maven
archetype that's part of the CD i J Maas
tools so we'll go ahead and create a
complex enterprise application or a near
project so I'm choosing enterprise
application project here hitting next
give it a giving it a name I'll call it
acne bank okay default location that's
all good I cheated here a little bit I
already have glassfish installed when
you actually go to install the GlassFish
plugin it also adds a little bit of the
deltas between Java EE and what comes
with you know as well but I guess bottom
line is here I already have glassfish
312 configured
I'm just going with the default
configuration of our glass which 312
hitting next I notice if I didn't don't
do anything in this project here in this
screen here all I'm going to get is a
near project and then I'll have to
manually add you know all of the
constituent java ee modules that make up
this application I don't really want to
do that I'm just starting up you know a
new project in this case let's say I'm
evaluating Java EE so I'm going to just
go ahead and use the module that comes
with the ear wizard so here we go we say
hit new module and our lo and behold
this recognizes all of the basically
java ee module types right so i don't
really want an application client module
so i'll go ahead and deselect that I do
want an ejb module in a web module in
this case I don't want a JC a model and
module for this project it's very very
simple so I'll go ahead and hit finish
and it will take just a second here just
out of curiosity how many of you use J
bar stools are ready i'm goin ter using
just that the tools that come out the
clips ok let's hope there's nothing
wrong with my machine I shouldn't be
taking quite this long but let's see
people only we're all done here maybe me
Bentley decided to found home on the
network I think that's really like
what's going on I think I think that's
exactly on you but okay let's see if it
actually is your network working little
man let's see here you mind burning out
eclipse real quick guys anything okay it
finally has woken up all right so uh I
want that generate the application dot
XML deployment descriptor I could have
but I have no real need for it at this
point in time I will hit finish here and
that should finish up my my ear project
here um so here we have our basic
structure here's the ear file this is
the GV jar and this is a web archive and
again you could go ahead and create
those yourself just by hitting new and
then you know under ejv there is an ejb
project and son and so on so let's take
a look at what what exactly Eclipse
generated for us so in here there's not
very much at all this just an empty year
file I'll show you the the default
deployment descriptor now it's basically
has taking the lib directory to be the
the lib and that the two modules that I
specified direct created at at runtime
so here is my e JV project again very
very simple there is a deployment
descriptor should be empty there's
nothing in it of course here's my HIV
module where all of my code resides
sunny kbjr dot XML was created and
here's my web project again very very
simple stuff there's not really much to
it at all there's an index dot JSP that
was created by default I'm nothing
nothing too exciting really and the may
10 file as well as the Sun web.xml now
this is the basic setup of the web
project you will need to add more things
in order to enable to Hawaii for example
let's assume that for my ejv project i
want jpa and CDI interval what you will
need to then do
going to your projects facets and enable
those those are features so here we go
in under project facets right so we're
going to say yes I want CDI and you
don't need any for any configuration
beyond that it will simply generate your
your bees or XML file for you we will
say that we want jpa and in case of jpa
will need a little bit more
configuration okay or I thought I needed
more configuration when I guess not yes
as a matter fact I do so I've disabled
the library configuration i'm going to
choose a connection that i created
already again I cheated a little bit i
created a database connection beforehand
i'll show you that in just a second over
here you can choose to create a noir m
dot XML file I'm not doing that you can
choose to explicitly list your entity
classes in persistent external I'm not
going to do that either so we'll just
hit next here and we're going to say I
do generate the beans or XML file form
so i'll hit OK on this and i'm now
changing the facets that will generate
just a little bit more code and change
my project structure structure just a
little bit in order to facilitate the
fact that i wanted CDI NJ PA ok so the
difference is here now is that if you
now expand the ejb project you'll see a
jpa GPA content in there and under jpa
content i have the persistence that xml
file not much in there at the moment
it's just an empty mt1 and by default it
took the name of my project and stuck in
the persistence unit with the name of my
project in if you look at the pure
source code it's basically in
persistence or XML is stored under meta
in I have a beast or XML generated so in
this particular module CDI is enabled
again there's nothing in here it's just
a basically in the empty stub and I can
do the same thing for my web project I
don't really need to but what I will do
is I go ahead and enable not see dead
you know i'll go ahead and enable CDI
just to show you where the be
lexmoto generated here and i'll also
enable java server faces okay and that's
the defaults that I want in my in my
files it's fine i'll hit apply here yet
okay and you know there's a bug in here
looks like where it does not correctly
generate the faces config file so i'll
need to go ahead and delete that so all
they need delete the Pacers config or
not because I don't really need it
there's nothing initially in it delete
and notice that the bees or XML file
instead of in meta n fits in web in web
in by in case of a web web.xml file and
of course in if you look in the web.xml
file here it will show some it will show
me my my GSF configuration that it ought
to also auto-generated i'll go ahead and
create an some entities here so we'll go
and under jpa tools and generate
entities from tables this is the same
thing that Ryan was doing before again
I'm pointing it to the database
connection I already have I'll take the
users and the accounts tables don't have
any table associations for this I'll use
an auto generator and the rest of it
should be fine i'll hit next on this hit
finish
km lo and behold we have the hour jpa
classes I'm going to go ahead and skip
this for now just briefly to briefly
show you you know because I enable CDI
I've whole bunch of CDI features
available to me as well so if I go under
CDI and I can create any kind of CDI
artifact that I want so pretty decent
support via jwow stools okay good going
to skip the Maven support and we'll jump
immediately to our Killian to do any
more exciting things right so in in our
kid are clear NASA as we mentioned is
basically a way of unit testing your job
IE projects is essentially what it does
is it integrates the container either an
embedded container or a remote container
with Jamie that's a so it just takes
it's basically maven based so this is
how generally how a llorar kaleyam maven
xml files look like and this is how your
your code look your little bit of
configuration I'm going to go ahead and
skip this I don't think I think it's in
advance and you know this is how an R
Killian project looks like okay so
what's happening here is just a J unit
class we're running it with our Killian
that's what the top annotation run with
is all about we're able to inject the
HIV is directly from the container into
into the into the test and of course in
the ad test method we're just testing
the server certificate that we're we are
creating and notice that there is an ad
deployment at deployment method and the
purpose of this method is really to
create the artifact that you're testing
okay so you're declaratively describing
how in this case how your war farm looks
like you're adding all of the contents
of the war file that you you want to
test just for your just for your
particular little little desam then you
can inject that plus it basically gets
it and there's actually whole sessions
that java one on our Killian and the
thing to realize with this code right
here this is actually starting up your
you're in this case of the GlassFish
container and running the unit tests for
you then running the next unit tests
within glassfish so if you've ever
wanted you know if you're doing j units
with your code you can only test j you
know Jay units don't run inside of the
container this allows you to do unit
saying inside the container with just
that block of code right up there so
it's extremely powerful and allows you
to do integration because you know tests
cover small snippets of code this is
integration testing actually testing
using your ejbs in a container and the
group and you can use things like
selenium so you can actually fire up
your web application use selenium at
this point to actually do this so you
don't have to write you know reams of
shell scripts and aunt can't files to
actually try to invoke and start up your
container deploy your application add
sleeps in there virus software checks in
suddenly your deployments taking too
long you don't have to deal with any of
that it does everything for you and then
the next the last technology that we're
going to cover as a part of this once
again just because at the time limit is
liquid base what good base is something
that it's actually robust tool has been
author for a number of years and this
does database tracking management for
managing your ddl scripts that you
execute against your database so this is
how you can manage the change you know
the change deltas between your database
so you add a new column to your database
you can add another column how do you
migrate from version one of your
database to version two of your database
schema it's an open source project it
integrates nicely there's actually
plugins for hibernate with it and then
this right here is an example a
changelog now I'm using it to actually
generate the sequel court but you know
there's other ways of doing it so up
here you can see I've got to think three
different chain sets where I'm basically
adding columns and everything and so it
actually if you look at the database
schema for it what is generating what
happens at runtime you'll see two
different two new tables for tracking
the changes and then if you look at
those tables you'll see that it
maintains a list of chainsets along with
the checksum to detect whether somebody
went back in and tried to change you
know they they realize that when they
added the table before they forgot to
put on a column that was required so
they went back in there and they felt it
added with nobody knowing then you know
manually added it to the database and
then when you know somebody you deploy
at a client site suddenly you know your
application doesn't work because this
column is missing or something like that
we got to run those problems because
this is going to do check sums and say
hey wait a minute something somebody's
been busy trying to change stuff from
the past on you've created an
environment that you can't reproduce we
actually where I work we actually use a
system similar to this where we deploy
to a vm and we actually run through
basically run this type of setup where
every time we do a full deployment of
our software we run regression tests
where we rerun through all of our
database scripture we upgrade an
existing database schema to the current
version of it so that we can verify that
when we do a roll out we're actually we
just skipped a QA um yes so this is the
summary um and we'll skip the QA since
45 minutes over if anybody hasn't um yes
so Eclipse has built in a built-in
support for uml tools again that's a
plug-in that you can get for Eclipse so
it's pretty decent I believe you
netbeans does the same thing yes there's
party plugins for that I'm not sure
about into legit you know off the top of
my I will happen my head I doubt I don't
either any other questions we'd like to
thank you and enjoy the rest java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
