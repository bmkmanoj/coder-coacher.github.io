rates are increasing all the time we're
using cloud applications more and more
SAS adoption is growing because SAS is
simple its orders of magnitude easier
than deploying on-premise software but
it's also easier to create new silos you
need new SAS applications to be
integrated with your existing SAS
applications and your on-premise
applications cloud integration should be
as simple assess you need to integrate
your applications in minutes not months
but so many companies have experienced
cloud integration problems one in two
companies has abandoned the use of at
least one departmental cloud application
in the last three years due to
integration problems and their the
frequency of one application dropped per
year 54% say project deadlines have been
missed in the last six months due to
cloud integration problems 42 percent
have seen data security breaches in
their department associated directly
with the use of cloud applications
averaging 6 incidents per department in
the last 12 months 68% of cloud adopters
have attempted integration but 86
percent of these encountered negatives
along the way
in fact 55% have tried and failed cloud
integration can be very challenging IT
needs to understand various integration
options exposed by cloud applications
developers often need to be trained on
cloud applications and their integration
technologies security is an issue and
there's usually multiple integration
options
this results in a lot of manual
development effort which increases cost
in time to market when what you really
need is agile delivery of integrations
between your cloud applications and
between your cloud and on-premise
applications the solution is integration
cloud service which integrates
applications across clouds and
on-premise it simplifies connectivity
between key enterprise applications like
fusion applications right now Eloqua
ebusiness suite and other third-party
SAS and on-premise applications with
integration cloud service you get
automated backup page updates and
upgrades leaving you to concentrate on
the tasks of creating and integrating
applications also there's no data
mapping from scratch in fact no
hand-coded integration is required and
you get enterprise-grade security and
governance capabilities integration
cloud service comes with a library of
adapters for Oracle and third-party
applications and you can purchase
pre-built integrations for common
scenarios all this means you can
integrate your applications faster
thereby increasing your business agility
in this cestus as example you've
identified a new opportunity and created
a new customer and right now so you need
to create an account in Oracle sales
cloud for the new customer you need to
map the data between the organization
object and right now and the account
object and sales cloud as these use
different formats and you want to use
the one-way fire-and-forget message
pattern all this is easy to do an
integration cloud service with no hand
coding integration cloud service gives
you an intuitive point-and-click
experience to create your integrations
it's very easy to use for
line of business developed integrations
let's look at the development lifecycle
for integration cloud service the first
step in integration design is to
identify the applications you want to
integrate and then configure the
connection details for these
applications you do this by creating
connections which are based on pre-built
adapters after your connections are in
place you create integrations by
dragging and dropping these connections
into the designer you use the graphical
mapper to tell integration cloud service
how to map data between your
applications then you're ready to
activate test and use your integration
to see how well your integrations are
running you use the monitoring dashboard
here you can pinpoint bottlenecks
monitor errors and see details for each
running integration we'll cover all
these stages in the development
lifecycle in later lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
