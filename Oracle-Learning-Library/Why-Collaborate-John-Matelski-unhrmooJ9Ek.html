29,000 members globally so we are a
global organization we are independent
we have established such wonderful
relationships across all facets of
Oracle obviously our focus being in the
database and the technology side but the
partnerships with Oracle as well as some
of the partnerships you know with with
the other user groups as well you know
coming here to a conference I
collaborate we're collaborating with two
of the application user groups the OE g
and quest so we've got relationships
with the doh egg with the UK oug Assad
Latin and Latin America we we just want
to collaborate coordinate and work with
other user groups in those areas and
that's I think we're really really proud
of how we've been able to build those
collaborations as well you know this is
the conference for the users by the
users I go to open world every year it's
a great conference this is a
complementary conference I go to open
world to learn about product roadmaps
and those kinds of things I come here to
find out how other people are using that
which i already own that's not to say we
won't learn about product roadmaps or
something's here as well but most of
what we're doing here is really user to
user networking user to user education
and learning from each other through
those experiences through the
educational content through the
interactions I actually sent eight
people for my staff to this event to
learn the technology side but also to go
through some of these softer skills the
leadership training and those types of
things so we're all about professional
growth and there's that technical side
of your professional growth but also the
other side really you know it's for me
to be honest with you it's a lot easier
when I do hiring to find people that
come in with the technical skills it's
some of those soft skills that they may
not always have and so for us to be able
to provide at collaborate some
complimentary leadership type training
and soft skills training and
have that as also an additional track I
think that just adds that much more
value not just to my organization but to
everybody that would attend a conference
like collaborate
