this video we will cover project
validation dependency checking and
project deployment let's start with
validation SDF lets you validate project
components without having to deploy the
project to your account you can validate
the project directly from suite cloud
IDE right click on the project go to
NetSuite and click validate project
against account notice that you can
validate the project against any account
that you have access to the validation
login the corresponding messages are
displayed under the console tab SDF
validates multiple components in your
project it ensures that the required
features in the destination account are
enabled dependencies are valid and
expected values are present in each
custom object
note that the validation log is not
stored in the project or your account
now that we have validated at our
project notice that one of the error
messages refers to a future dependency
that needs to be enabled in the account
to fix this error you don't need to know
which dependency right click on the
project go to NetSuite and click add
dependency references to manifest the
manifest file has been updated and the
missing dependencies are now referenced
in the project the final step is
deployment SDF lets you deploy the
project to your account right-click on
the project and go to NetSuite there are
two menu options you can use to deploy
the project deploy and deploy to account
SDF lets you deploy to any of your
accounts but it also lets you set a
default account to deploy to the deploy
option deploys the project to your
default account we will click deploy to
account select the account and role and
click OK if you are deploying to a
production account you may be prompted
to confirm the action
deployment progress messages are
displayed under the console tab the
deployment log shows the date and time
of the deployment and the components
that were deployed to your account the
deployment lock is stored in your
account thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
