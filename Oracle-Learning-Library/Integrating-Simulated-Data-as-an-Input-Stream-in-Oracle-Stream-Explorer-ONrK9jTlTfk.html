the CSV file the comma separated value
file as input as an input stream into
the stream Explorer this helps you
basically model and simulate lots of
different use cases with lots of
different event types that you might
want to use for different scenarios and
different industries so let's login to
the stream Explorer in this case a
tutorial will focus on the IOT the
Internet of Things so let's look at a
catalog of artifacts for the internet
things one of the key aspects of this
tutorial is to use a database file as
reference data so here you can see how
you define a database file as part of
your application you provide a tank of
IOT to make sure it's part of the
catalog for IOT you define and use the
SX and school tables which is defined in
the algal bit processing platform and
next the stream Explorer will indicate
the tables the database tables that are
available to you now and here I've
selected devices next we will look at
the network management stream which uses
the CSV file and in fact we're going to
create a new stream we're going to give
it a name it's always good to give
meaningful names and descriptions to
what you are creating in the stream
explorer this will help your colleagues
other business users and newbies to be
able to understand the relevance of this
this artifact and its use within the
different applications that you will be
creating
the stream explorer always remember to
specify a tank or tanks associated with
this artifact this element in this case
always remember to use the IOT tag for
using the internet things here there's
an option to actually call the
exploration capability directly from
after your creation of the stream here
we're going to define the csv file you
need to upload and access the file that
you're going to use here we have a CSV
file already created for you the event
interval an initial delay and this is in
in milliseconds so we want to specify
one second as interval and a two second
for the initial delay and then the
stream explores read the CSV file and
looked at the header record and as you
can see here in terms of the shape of
the event itself that will be in the
stream it was already populated and done
some manual mapping for you based on the
names and the different data types the
only difference is we know that the last
data type here is an integer watch it on
that you create the stream which is now
been successfully created and we move
straight into creating an exploration or
application that's going to use both the
reference data and also the stream so
once again we want to give this
exploration a good name that's
meaningful to describe its usage will
give the exploration a good description
and finally we're going to give a nice
tag iot again to make sure it's put in
the iot section of the catalog and some
other tanks that we can associate with
this application and finally we define
the input stream to our exploration and
we create
now you can see our expiration canvas we
see our fields defined in the header and
immediately you'll see in the stream of
events coming from your CSV file the
first we're going to do is actually add
a filter to ignore anything there's an
error code of 000 this means that we are
going to ignore the events coming from
devices or equipment that is actually
working correctly and in a healthy state
once we see only the events relating to
equipment or devices that are failing
the next thing we're going to do is add
context to this data so using the device
ID we're going to join that to
information that's been persisted in an
old good database using our reference
data so we're going to add correlation
and we're going to correlate using a
device ID with the ID which is the value
in the Oracle database table itself
immediately now the application has been
redeployed and the stream is coming back
to us and we're seeing the information
in the stream we're going to clean up
the day to a little bit by removing the
duplicate ID value in the stream and
there we can see the stream which is a
combination of both the stream itself
and the devices or the equipment joined
automatically with the database table
information that is adding context to
your event stream finally we want to
preserve this exploration application
for further usage so we will publish
this application for later access
and here you can see our new exploration
with a status of published available in
our catalog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
