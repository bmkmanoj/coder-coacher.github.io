in this video we will see how Enterprise
Manager r5 provides a single pane of
glass for hybrid middleware with state
using enterprise manager r5 you can
manage on-premise and on Claud instances
through a single dashboard what that
hybrid agent must be deployed on Oracle
cloud Java cloud service instance before
you start monitoring and managing
middleware instance from enterprise
manager let's see how to add Oracle
cloud Jesus instance to on-premise
Enterprise Manager to add Jesus instance
to enterprise manager go to target
middleware on this page we will see all
existing domains click on the Add button
to start to add new domain select Oracle
Fusion Middleware or read logic domain
option on find targets wizard select
admin server host where Jesus services
are running on Oracle cloud
the host is selected what is
automatically populated as 9001
discoverer of WebLogic domain a
management agent uses gem Explorer
evolved to make t3 connections to domain
admin server if a respective channel is
already created code is picked up
automatically otherwise you need to
create a new channel on the
administration server to allow
communication between management agent
and admin server let me show how
existing channel looks like so let's go
to weblogic console from the service
menu select administration server then
go to protocols when you select channels
tab you will see the existing channel if
there is no channel listed here then you
need to create a new channel as 9001
owed as this and put let's go back to
add target facade on enterprise manager
and a weblogic admin username and
password
change unique domain identifiers if you
want I am going to keep it as it is
agent is selected automatically once the
host is identified once done click on
continue vizard runs a procedure in
background and identifies all targets
associated with the domain and shows in
a pop-up click on close button to add
all targets once all targets are added
domain appears under middleware targets
home page let's go to middleware targets
home page as you see here a new domain
is added here on the signal dashboard we
see on-premise and uncloudy targets from
heat map or load map tab you can see the
performance details of your entire
hybrid cloud state as you see here we
have emd CGC domain which is on-premise
domain and then sells their domain which
is on cloud domain both domains are
displayed on a single dashboard you can
monitor both domains with weblogic
server numbers and cpu usage and then we
also have the same information for on
cloud instance as well as you see here
cpu usage is very low so there is not
much activity happening on these
accounts at this moment once domain is
visible here you can go to table view
and start managing domain directly from
this page using right click
or you can go to domain homepage and
then use the usual menu options to start
managing it so let me show you how you
can manage your domain directly from
this page just right click on the
selected row and then you can see the
options to monitor diagnose or you can
control the startup shutdown of the
domain or you can create new Jerry bc
data sources you can also deploy new
applications to this particular domain
there are many ways to identify if
instance is existing on cloud or
on-premise easiest way to go to clout
target home page once you are on cloud
target home page you can look at the
symbol for Oracle cloud this symbol
indicates that a particular target is
existing on Oracle cloud thank you for
listening this concludes video
