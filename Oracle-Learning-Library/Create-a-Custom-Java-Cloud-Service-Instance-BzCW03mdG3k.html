Java cloud service instance by using the
instance creation wizard as I'll
demonstrate here prior to launching the
wizard I will already provision an
Oracle database cloud service instance
and just to be safe
recorded the database username and
password for that instance now I'll
launch the wizard first I'll provide
basic service information my service
name must start with the letter and
cannot contain any special characters
nor be longer than 50 characters I'll
select a production level service that
will provide the clustering backup and
restoration patching a rollback and
scaling support I need a monthly
metering frequency works best for the
high volume of usage over extended
periods that I expect can also mean a
cost savings over the hourly rate next
I'll select an Oracle WebLogic server
release that supports cloud
infrastructures that span web server
application server and load balancer
tiers and finally I'll select the
appropriate WebLogic server edition next
I'll provide my service details first
I'll define the shape of the service and
provide access information for
integrated services administration
consoles and a secure shell compute
shapes are pre-configured and determine
the processing power of a service
instance I'll select an all purpose
shape rather than one that's memory
intensive since I might need to connect
to the instance by using a secure shell
client I'll specify the public key of
the secure shell pair well I could
specify the name of an existing key I'm
going to load a new one from my
filesystem
by default a cluster will already be
configured but I want to add a couple of
managed servers to it
this will automatically enable a load
balancer which I'll configure
momentarily next I'll identify the
WebLogic administrator
and now so that I can access my WebLogic
and other administrative consoles also
like this advanced setting next I'll
enter access information for the Oracle
database cloud service instance that
contains the Oracle Fusion Middleware
component schemas this is why it's
helpful to record the database user
credentials now I'll configure the load
balancer which shares work across manage
servers and automatically redirects
traffic during routine maintenance
activities here too I'll select one of
the all-purpose compute shapes this
policy passes each new request to the
manage server that has the fewest
connections ensuring a smooth
distribution when manage servers get
bogged down finally I'll define access
information for the Oracle storage cloud
container instance that will store the
service instance backups
if it doesn't already exist Java cloud
service will create this container now
I'll confirm the details and create the
instance I can see that the service
instance has been added and will be
provisioned and running soon I can check
the provisioning progress here and here
I'll refresh the screen and my service
has been provisioned I'm ready to manage
my instance and deploy my applications
