has decided to modernize their sales
ecosystem by subscribing to salesforce
com for their customer relationship
management requirements this means that
they now need to integrate the data in
salesforce com with their on-premise
Oracle e-business suite they've chosen
Oracle integration cloud service or ICS
as their strategic platform for this
integration this demo illustrates how an
opportunity can be converted into an
order with just a few clicks using ICS
as the integration platform after Bob
the sales rep logs into salesforce com
he creates a new opportunity in the
system he enters information for the
opportunity and adds the associated
products to complete the opportunity
configuration next Bob creates a quote
for the opportunity he provides the
relevant details after he saves the
changes Bob can synchronize the quote
and the opportunity to enable
bi-directional sync of quote line items
and opportunity products now the quote
configuration is completed Bob presents
the quote to the customer and after
negotiations the quote is accepted the
opportunities closed which triggers the
creation of a new sales order any
business sweet Bob can check the details
of the sales order for example he can
see the order number of the sales order
in e-business suite right here in
salesforce com now when the customer
calls bob for details on where the order
is he calls the order management team
and provides the order number in
e-business suite with that the details
of the order can be retrieved
immediately now let's take a look at how
you can build this integration using ICS
quickly and without any coding James
integration designer a vision
incorporated logs into the ICS web
console this console is the one stop
shop for designing monitoring and
managing all your integrations from the
landing page james can perform one of
the following tasks creating connections
to various SAS and on-premise
applications building integrations
between connections or monitoring
transactions through the dashboard James
starts with the connections Oracle
integration cloud service provides
pre-built connect
shins these include connections to SAS
on premise and social applications and
more here James builds a new connection
from scratch to first configure the
connection to the e-business suite using
integrated so a gateway web service he
specifies a name and a version number
for the connection configures the wisdom
file in the connection properties field
and tests the connection to make sure it
works fine James then creates the
connection for salesforce.com and
configures credentials using the
provided salesforce.com account
information James then moves on to the
integration the landing page shows all
the integrations that James and his team
have created Oracle integration cloud
service provides pre-built integrations
to integrate between various SAS and
on-premise applications here James
creates a new integration from scratch
he chooses the map my data style of
integration to simplify data mapping and
to send the request data from salesforce
com to e-business suite there are other
patterns available such as pub/sub
orchestration virtualization and more on
the right is the list of SAS and
on-premise connections he's created
previously since the opportunity
information is sent from Salesforce to
e-business suite James drags and drops
the Salesforce connection to the source
section he names this endpoint and picks
up the outbound messaging interface and
the related business object in this case
opportunity next James configures the
target of the integration ebusiness
sweet James selects opportunity sync as
the operation the next step is to create
the data mappings between these two
endpoints typically this is the most
complex and time-consuming part of
delivering an integration however with
the simple data mapper in ICS James can
easily drag and drop to create the
mapping also ICS has a mapping
recommendation system that can create
the mapping automatically the time and
cost required to build and deliver
mappings is significantly reduced to
ensure and end visibility James
configures the key search identifiers
for this integration flow why is he
doing this if an order creation failed
or if EDS was down for maintenance the
operation manager may want to search the
transactions based on the opportunity
name or organization ID and identify
which trans
actions are not processed he can also
use this identifier and search for
transactions on the monitoring dashboard
James has completed the integration and
he hasn't written a line of code worked
on an XML schema xslt or other artifact
he activates the flow in one click
messages can now seamlessly flow between
salesforce com and e-business suite for
