JSON support in a Java Enterprise
Edition eight coding session we will
start with a little bit of legal stuff
so this is safe harbor statement which
basically says that what I'm going to
talk today what I'm going to demonstrate
could be not a part of for the final
product so you shouldn't make critical
business decisions based on that now a
little bit about myself I don't have a
caption software which supports
picture-in-picture so I can't make it
the day as other doing there the corner
of the screen you see my picture my
video talking so I just put my photo
here it's how I look like I'm from
Oracle I am Jason Biden congestion
processing specialist
last year was awarded as outstanding
spec lead which I'm very proud of I'm
also open source enthusiast and eclipse
link project comida
enough introduction let's actually start
coding and this session is organized
today that I created a project template
which is using JSON processing and Jason
binding and I will demonstrate live how
to use adjacent proteases and Jason
binding features from very very easy
from very simple ones to some advanced
ones and I will also demonstrate how to
use JSON processing condition biding
together the result of that I will put
into this repository all right maybe I
will clean it up a bit maybe I put some
comments there to make it nicer before
putting it there so don't expect that
it's exactly the same as you see
you will see today but it will be same
from the functionality pottery so this
is how my project looks like you see
that this is a maven project it has only
three classes here and through the my
model classes I will touch them when I
will talk about Jason binding this is
the console application I already pre
filled some of the UI scenes here so we
won't lose time coordinate so when you
run it it will show these texts and you
select the number you should type the
number we GMO you want around and the
GMOs are listed here so I have 8 things
to demonstrate we'll start adjacent
processor and after that we will go to
Jason binding right well actually you
select the demo it runs the
corresponding methods receiving methods
here and currently this methods empty so
I also not Oleg and I empty this is not
empty but as you see this is just data
preparation nothing else right and I
will call I will add chords to these
methods you know online unity session
over else resources which is what the
JSON documents I'm going to use for my
samples and important I suppose is this
this is for maximal mailing file which
is also very simple let us go through
these quickly dependencies I have only
four dependencies and these are Jason
protesting API is I'm using milestone 1
version
Jason producing RI as base and the same
for Jason binding API and RI which is
yassun and in order to add yes on here I
to add this repository here because yes
sorry uses Eclipse Foundation
repositories it has its so release
repository which is base right built
section is also very simple where are
only free plugins compiler with 1.8
target and source assembly plug-in and
exact plug-in because I want to run my
application from console main let's just
take a look how it looks like if I
compile clean install and exec Java so
base can building the project and
running it OC maybe it's or build at all
first time it usually takes time
no no it was relatively quick so you see
this UI right and you select the DMO you
want to start and nothing happens
because these methods are empty at the
moment so I need to queue to creat okay
now let's open our demo and start coding
something Jason parson demo demonstrate
parsing of JSON document so what's all
about I will show how to open JSON
document how to use JSON parser and the
task is to list all the parts in events
and the corresponding keys in values and
after that ultimately how to skip some
part of your document if it's B
jason jason so this is the document i am
going to use for that so as you see this
is a JSON document in the least and at
least of free jason's jason bourne
super-agent
it has some phone numbers so you can
phone him if you want another one is
jason voorhees remember Friday the 13th
so he is a maniac killer he also had
some phone numbers
I'm not recommending given him a cover
and the last one is Jason from the Asian
grease he's the lead of Argonauts if you
remember what's that right he doesn't
have any for novels because that time
phones didn't exist right anyway okay so
let's just open this document and the
parser parse it parser works the way
that it just goes through the document
and the when it gets when it reaches
meet some Jason related field or talking
or whatever it raises like that all
right so let's just create a parcel
jsonparser parser it's imported equals
to Jason dot create parcel
so Jason P has these Jason class right I
just don't see what it has it has
methods to create everything factory
methods right it's some builders patch
generator blah blah blah a lot of things
right so when you need to create you
always know that you need to create it
from a subclass so it's very simple
create parser and we need to pass the
input stream to this parser like these
get resources stream and we are going to
read our Jason's Jason document okay so
we have a parser now we need to parse a
document how to do it we need to have a
cycle which cycles until parser has next
event looks very similar to if you were
working files basically similar way so
now we need to get the event itself and
we use parse the next method which was
the event so event E right
also a this and now we'll just print out
name of event and let's run it and see
how it works
compile it slow yup got it running
number one PMO and you see all the
realtor here if we open our jason's
document you see that when parser
reached your stockin it start array
start the Raven traced and up then go
start object which is here and after
that goes key which is name and after
that when you still adjacent ball blah
blah blah blah blah blah and when it
reaches the end of the array or end of
objects it has an object and the Ravens
right so this way it parses all the
document so what are we going to do now
we are going to email it reaches the key
we will just print out the name of the
key when it reaches the value it just
prints out we will print out the radio
let's do that close it jump to the demo
okay so in this case we need to
distinguish their beds right so when we
get this key name or where we entered
value string will print this value if
some other way to just keep that right
so in order to do it we just add a
switch statement here switch sorry
switch event right and in case it's key
name or in case it's very string we will
just print out the value parser gets
trick so this parcel get still returns
actually the value from education
document to make it a bit nicer or we
need to remove freak line here making
just breathe
make it like this and okay that's it
this way we need to line break it that
doesn't look good I think so let's just
check it okay I forgot to creat tweet
and compile it again my computer's are
rolling now when I'm starting compile it
just was like that hoping you won't hear
this but I hear that okay done and you
see that if it's key key name when used
in Jason Bourne blah blah blah it looks
great
okay so I assume that the first two
tasks are completed but we still have a
third one imagine that imagine that
these phone numbers are is huge
Jason bore he is a super agent he works
in different countries I suppose it in
each country he has a phone number maybe
many phone numbers
he changes four numbers every day you
know super agent so his phone numbers
array can be huge and we don't want to
parse it we want to skip it
right so how to do it it's very easy and
because JSONP version 1.1 has methods
which allows you to skip erase and skip
objects basically when you inside
immediately go to the end of it right so
it means that in case we are either a we
need to skip it parser skip array right
but now if I keep it like that it won't
work because the document itself is the
least in the array right so star trees
are first element so it will just don't
do anything we need to only skip phone
numbers array in order to do that I will
introduce a string very whole
the current key were in so 20 modify our
sample that in case you meet the key we
just put it into our variable yes you
need to print it right you need to print
it and I need break here right and if if
these key equals phone numbers I need to
skip array and break right so that's
good news
yeah think it's okay so let's just run
it and check up a little bit again check
that it works I have a feeling that
compilation slower and slower because
we're aging the code there may be
subjective okay number one okay I choose
like working so you see that you have
starter and after that rejected and
object immediately right so we don't
have phone numbers here oh we have a key
for numbers but what's inside is skipped
so this is actually exactly what we
wanted so huge phone numbers array we
just ski okay so we finish to the first
demo let's jump to number one
and Jason generated them and here we
will generate a document similar to
Jason Jason in the course sometimes you
need to generate Jason in the code to do
it Jason B has a class called Jason
generator let's just create it
I call it Jan right then again if you
need to create something I need to go to
Jason class right create generator data
to cast and here we need to pass where
actually we want to generate it right on
output stream and we will use system out
for this purpose
okay so we created the generator now
let's start generate and the first
element is basically we have a list of
Jason's right so first element is a
start array right star alright and after
that we are going to put the third JSON
object I mean Jason born here object
contagion Jason board here so we need to
write start object right you see that
generator has a nice builder interface
which is really easy to use so after
that we need to write our source
property right and the key is name and
the value is Jason Bourne
and then Jason Bourne like that and the
second property is profession if I
remember well profession and his
profession is a super-agent
right and after that goes array we phone
numbers so we need to write start array
and now we need to actually pass a key
here right four numbers right and inside
there again we need to write start
object and in that object we have two
properties first of all is tied for type
of phone number so it's home and
actually the number itself so right
number and if I remember well number is
like that it's not because I am phoning
him a lot just because number is very
simple and this is the end of the object
so we need to write the end of the
object right
and Jason PC has one method right and to
write to end everything so
it's used for the end of the object and
for the end of array so we are closing
the object now we are closing this array
now we are closing out a smaller object
and here we are
Oh closing our three and what I also
have to look at the flashes and it looks
like it's it they just started and see
how it works
thank forgetting to create all the time
so let's compile it it's supposed to
produce like a source part of our JSON
JSON document I use in the first sample
let's take a look here and here it is
array first object Jason Bourne super
agent phone numbers blah blah blah blah
blah blah so it works great so now we
can go to the fourth sample and for
example is streaming API right so in
JSONP 1.1 we added support for Java 8
streaming API so we can actually read
the JSON object and using steamin API to
do something like that and from this
sample I will use another JSON document
I prepared and this is a list of like a
shopping cart
and here I have again this is the least
and it has free objects there so it's
what I buy and by Martin ball 400 bucks
and buying a video card for 500 bucks
so it is nice fun it's supposed to
collect an 18 g-force or something like
that and I'm by the PC case which is
cheap for hungrybox I'm not sure that
I'll be able to assemble a nice PC from
that but anyway this is just a
demonstration right and our what are we
going to do we are going to use
streaming API to get the total of the
cars right
how to do it first of all we need to
read the JSON document and we will use
JSON the reader for that Jason the
reader reader sorry later equals to
again Jason create reader and we are
going to create reader from our card
document card Jason right now we need to
read everything to JSON array because
it's array jason array now actually do
it the other way around so because I
need to demonstrate a streaming API
service UCS reader we need to read array
right like that and that read array it
has a method called stream so get a
raise 3 so now we can use our streaming
API right so we need to all I need to
collect all right lights just need to
collect because we actually need a map
right we need to map and not map we need
to map to double because double the
price is double right now we put a
simple lambda here which actually
extracts the price from our object there
and lambda will look something like this
we need to get the object s JSON object
right so at least we got our JSON object
which has a name and price here right
and we need to get a number value for
our property a single property's price
if I remember well it is check quickly
yeah name and price okay
back price and we need to get a double
value of that so it's easier to that and
after that we just need to summarize all
this that's it
and to print it out I just do I just put
it to variable and I print out this
variable here let's just run it and see
does it work or not and the amount of a
total amount will be supposed to be 700
bucks if I remember well this yeah 700
so look it works so and this is how to
use generate steam a steaming KPI with
JSON processing okay now we are jumped
into the interesting bit which is JSON
pointer this is the feature of JSONP 1.1
and which is one of the most requested
features and here I will demonstrate how
to create Jason pointer and how to print
out its value okay first of all let's
create a pointer
let's use our Jason's document and
create a pointer to a profession of the
first Jason Bourne right it will look
like first of all we need to create a
Jason pointer again P Jason create
pointer and then sign the pointer we
need to put a string which is something
like XPath inside the JSON document so
we always start with the root and
because it's array we need to get
resource little bit of the Ray which is
0 and after that we are getting a
profession property here it is it's very
simple
now we need to apply this pointer to
some JSON documents to extract this
value from there
so basically we need to read our Jason's
as you can copy it from here yeah so
we're reading our Jason's documents and
let's just create an array Jason array
Jason's and it's imported from the
reader reader iterate so we have Jason's
right now and now we can apply this
pointer to the document right so it does
it it works the way that pointer and it
has getvalue method right and we pass
our Jason's here right and it's supposed
to get the value corresponding to the
pointer from them so it's Jason value
Jason value profession and print it out
procession to think let's see what we
will have
combining compiling
and this is number four and it doesn't
work right
and it says non-existent name when you
pair in the object blah blah blah key
profession I made a mistake somewhere
here or or fish here it looks okay but
here is the wrong document because I
could be pasted here its supports to be
Jason's right and then I food cart there
right sorry about that
so then just try it again okay I hope
now it works and it does so profession
of Jason Bourne super-agents right so
just to confirm that it works they'll
just change it to this and it should
display a profession of the second Jason
right owner just run it and it's
supposed to be maniac elated
yeah when your killer so this is how
Jason pointer works okay
so finish - Jason pointer and the next
one adjacent page right what adjacent
page Jason page is basically the ability
to pay - Jason document basically change
them or add something thing they're all
remove things from there it's similar
you are working with source code
repositories you eat for instance right
so you have a source file and you create
a patch you changed something you
created patch not that you apply the
patch to that source document to produce
new up right this is the same vein JSONP
right and if the EMA will take out Jason
document and we will create a page which
has multiple things there and it will
remove the last Jason from there it only
came right and it will replace
professions of Ross - Jason's right so
in order to do it let just read Jason's
document like this I copy paste it here
and hopefully it will be right this time
Jason's Jason then we have Jason's Jason
right here now let's create Jason page
Jason patch right Jason fetch fetch we
use Jason class to create patch again
but we're going to use create page
builder here right because we'll build a
patch right so eight page builder and
the first thing we are going to do we
are going to remove and we are going to
remove the last jason which is a little
Argonauts we don't need him here and as
a parameter we supply the pointer to the
object to want to remove and this is a
number free in a release so it's like
that right the second operation is going
to be replaced and we are going to
replace the profession of our first
JSON which is Jason Bourne and replace
it with
maniac killer so he will become a maniac
killer which is maybe right because in
the super agent is killing a lot of
people so he is sort of a big a cure
right and we are going we don't have one
we don't want to have too many killers
in our list so we will replace a
profession of Jason movies to super
agent
and it could be true as well because in
the movies it never said that he is not
so courageous so maybe he is actually
super agent doing some very complicated
tasks or whether anyway so it looks like
these
okay so thread because I forgot I forgot
to build right now it looks okay and now
we need to apply this patch to subject
right
basically we similar pattern we are
using here right patch apply and we
applied it to out Jason's list right
like that it will produce a new JSON
array result right and we need to print
out this result to see that it's okay
result to string right it looks okay so
let's just run it and see how it works
okay and this is number table number
five okay so what we have here we have
adjacent ball and here is Romania killer
works and we have Jason hoodies and he
the super agents great and we don't have
Jason who is are going out so it seems
working so this is how to use Jason
patch and it looks like we finished with
Jason protesting demos and now we'll
jump into Jason binding BMO right and
what is Jason binding Jason binding key
the framework which allows you to buy
the Jason to Java object and vice versa
so basically serialize and deserialize
Java objects to and from Jason documents
and this is the front
sample where I actually have some pre
filled something's right and what is
that I just created the model classes
for our Jason's right so person class
which is which has a name and profession
and the list of phone numbers and phone
number is this it has a type it has
number and what I did here I just pre
field I created to Jason's list
basically but save and here right but
Angela okay so assume that this Jason
contains the same data as our Jason's
JSON document and here I will
demonstrate how to serialize this into
Jason and some customizations like
formatting Jason changing property names
changing the now fields behavior
discussed but we'll start with we need
to actually create with Jason binding
agent Jason bugging instance shorts
right and all in Jason P over main
projects Jason Jason be woven projects
is Jason be right but it created
slightly different way so Jason be Jason
being equals to import Jason be builder
create it just creates Jason be agent
with default settings and we design
Jason be the way that default settings
suitable for
everything so this is the standard way
of creating Jason and after that we need
to serialize out Jason's list and it can
be done like with Jason be to Jason and
we are passing our jason's list here and
we say look just two lines of code and
we need to bring it out like that and
now let's see how it works if it works
then just run it
okay and this is number 6 DM oh yeah it
produced JSON document which looks
absolutely the same as our Jason's Jason
but it's not for matters right so I
can't read it properly let's just add
some customizations here and which
produces we're formatted output right in
order to do it we need to create Jason B
configuration which is stored in Jason
bit config object so all configuration
is there so we're creating in you Jason
B configuration and so which is which is
what I can configure look many things
click order steak gene ponytail adapters
blah blah blah many things here but we
will use this one for now before
marching through now we need to pass
this configuration to jason builder to
create customized Jason B engine it can
be done like this look it's very easy
and if we run it it's supposed to
produce nicely formatted Jason let's
take a look okay and this is number 6
yeah so this is how our Jason looks like
looks it's nicely formatted now let's
see what if what if we want to change
the property name it it's phone numbers
but it's too long we would like that
it is fonts in the produced JSON
document house
of course I can change the property here
right but this is not nice much better
day is using Jason be property
irritation which allows us to change the
property name to funds right and if
we're on our sample now these phone
numbers should be replaced with false
let's just take a look let's combine
compiled I hope that if it compiles
immediately I had time to add another
GMO to my demonstration but I can't do
it
okay so look it changed to phones right
and I think is that and you can put this
annotation not only to the field itself
to actually put it in together alright
get phone numbers if you put it here it
will produce the same result if you want
to check it and then just run it again
so this property can be on getter can be
on the field itself can be on set if you
put it on setter we will expect that we
will read from our property all these
which is supplied in the annotation so
you can actually read two from one
property and write to another one I
don't know do we need with use case but
it's allowed so she founds here at so
you can put them together
another thing I want to demonstrate here
if you look at that document that
adjacent in turtle he doesn't have any
phone numbers so funds property is not
there at all because it's now by default
Jason be just skipping now tortoises but
what if you actually want to have it
there right so you read it from other
application that expected to be now
right it was easy to change we just put
Jason be mid-level annotation on the
class so all properties which are now in
the class now supposed to be a supposed
to appear in result in Jason document
and just take a look I keep forgetting
to creat yeah oops
you see that it has phones which is now
now right so there are some more
annotations right for customization
Jason B creator and blah blah blah it's
out of scope of adjustable of my
demonstration now maybe I'll do another
demonstration to demonstrate you know
other customizations but not today so I
assume that we finish with serialization
and let's jump to another demo and Jason
BD serialization them okay so this is
the nice thing what we are going to do
here we are going to use jason processor
and jason reader together and by the way
i think i didn't mention that but Jason
binding is using Jason Otteson in behind
alright so what anyway that's not you
what I'm going to do I'm going to read
out Jason's document using jason
processor I'm going to use Jason pointer
to get the first Jason or let's use
second Jason yes you'll get second jason
using jason pointer and after that I'm
going to deserialize it bind it to our
person object here right
oh okay so again I will just copy paste
these beads right which is getting which
is creating the reader and reading
everything to Jason Rae and now we need
to create a quiz head it in the demo
here create an adjacent pointer copy
paste it here but instead of profession
I will get whole of the object so this
is the pointer to the second Jason Jason
Voorhees right okay so now we need to
change this because it's not profession
let's call it oh he's right so this is
Jason value of that accent I think we
can yes that's okay that's okay
okay so we've got our who he is now now
we have to bind it to our carson object
so we need to create a Jason B Jason B
which is Jason B builder create right
and now we need to do person person
equals Jason B from Jason in this case
right and we need to get out jason here
which is Voorhees to string and we need
to actually for DC realization we need
to pass a type a target type here which
is person class right so this is our
Jason book is to check that it works
let's just print it out
a person I'm sure that it has to Street
methods okay doesn't have it so we can
just quickly add it like this right like
this and let's run it
creet first and run it
okay so this is number six okay
wrong DMSO is 16 number seven here okay
and you see that it's actually you find
it's actually works
so we digitalized so it doesn't print
anything here but which is through my
design so the phone numbers are there so
what we've done just now again we just
use JSON parser to read JSON document we
you Jason pointer to extract some bit of
that and we use JSON by binding to by
this data to our Java objects here okay
and now it looks like we have our last
demo which is deserialization
with generics again we are going to what
we are going to use here we are going to
use our favorite jason's document and
this time we are going to dis realize it
into the list of person so it's a
generic list right okay let's do it
first of all we need to create a Jason B
and gene jason be using jason be builder
base B builder create right here our
comes okay let's just do this a we need
to dis realize how Jason's jason jason
file to a list of person list of person
Jason's
supposed to be Jason B from Jason and we
need to pass our stream here so let's
just do it as I usually do
Jason's Jason right and we need to pass
a type of whether it is realizing to
hear it was very easy for the normal
type like this but for generic type is a
little bit different because a generic
type and you know this generic
information usually is lost then we're
passing it to like like this way right
so in order to do it properly
what we have to do we have to do it this
way we have to doesn't know what the
type is okay sorry
when it actually create array list of
person
so basically instance in a sink right
and after that get it's a generic
superclass like this - and we need to
pass it here and in this case it will
properly work right - check it let's
just print out let's go to see the first
name the name of the first Jason get the
short element and it's supposed to be
Jason's and get name right then just run
it to see that it works
here computation is okay so it's number
8 VMO Jason board so it works you check
it then just print out the name of a
second second Jason it's supposed to
print out jason voorhees here
okay so number eight Jason movies okay
absolutely so it looks like we've done
everything what's planned so as I said
