sweet thank you which is a product that
we had oracle announced last week i am
my name is noel poor i'm an architect in
the Java platform group at at Oracle and
I was I'm the architect for Java
embedded sweet so this will be this is
going to be relatively informal occasion
hi everyone and essentially what we're
what we're doing here one way to think
of it is that we are beginning to bring
java ee technology down to embedded
devices and we're trying to produce a
product that allows you to easily create
and host in web applications web service
web services web pages and so on on
embedded servers and what we're seeing
is a trend to push compute power out
into the field there are lots of cases
where the the edge device yes simply in
some places simply can't communicate
directly with your back-end and then
there are plenty of cases where you
simply don't want it to communicate
directly with your back-end so you need
you need a way of putting more more
server functionality into some of these
devices for m2m applications and the the
components of the java embedded sweet
are the java SE embedded runtime the
version of glassfish is called glassfish
for embedded sweet java DB and Jersey
which is a framework for restful web
services and so we've taken all these
things um you know integrated them done
some work to make things a little
smaller and behavior behavior on you
better on embedded hardware and donna a
lot of testing on embedded hardware as
well
it was kind of interesting work to start
with working with the GlassFish team it
was like what what is this arm of which
you speak and the the two platforms that
we're supporting initially our arm linux
and x86 linux so this is a picture i
think this has been used in more than
one presentation this week so you may
really have seen it it just kind of
identifies you we're in the architecture
does java embedded sweet fit so you've
got a range of edge devices over there
on the left hand side that are
communicating with you know a gateway
kind of device that is either you know
doing protocol translation of some kind
or it's gathering data across a bunch of
different devices and sensors may be
doing some processing and filtering on
that on that information before
forwarding it on to the rest of your
infrastructure already did that so java
SE embedded not going to spend too long
on this it's essentially a headless
configuration of java SE so think SE
without the graphics you have the full
complete SC AP i set but with
optimizations for embedded use and it's
been ported to you know embedded
platforms like the ARM architecture for
example so the benefits are that you
have a very familiar java 7 s api set
you can use your whatever your favorite
idea is to do your development work and
you can you the you know the whole host
of third-party libraries out there that
you can continue to use so it's very
nice from that point of view it's a very
familiar you don't have to learn a whole
bunch of new stuff and we're you know
we're up to date in terms of the you
know the version of java that we're
shipping here seven years six was
released into the wild
just a few weeks ago
absolutely so one of the benefits of
using Java in this kind of environment
is exactly that that you obviously if
your if you have native components in
your application then it's not write
once run anywhere but we've in
assembling the the suite and you know
writing some sample code and test code
and so on we've had absolutely no issues
with you do your development on the
desktop push the code out to a device or
push the jar file out to a device and
we've had absolutely no surprises in
terms of why didn't that run so there
are a real benefits to having yes
essentially full se available as the
runtime then so a little more detail on
glassfish glassfish is an application
server it sounds like at least one of
you maybe touches it professionally and
again we've we've done work with the
GlassFish team to size reduce this for
use in an embedded use case and
unfortunately with glassfish then the
word embedded is actually overloaded and
glassfish has what they call their
embedded API which is nothing to do with
embedded but it's what that means is
that rather than running glassfish is a
separate standalone process and then
doing all your communication with it via
a network connection you're actually
embedding the application server into
your to your application so it's running
in process and there is an embedded
glassfish api that you use to control
configure etc the backlash fish instance
so essentially what we're providing here
is you know you know the the Grizzly
HTTP server that's already integrated
into glassfish a full servlet freedo
container and it still passes all the TC
case and Java DB and Jersey integration
for
so you've got a very capable and
expandable container that you can start
off with an add additional functionality
to so Java DB is the the next component
and Java DB has been integrated with the
JDK for a little while now it's it's
essentially a very full-featured
database supports multi user access and
has a lot of lot of options for
robustness and how much you want to
recover from crashes exactly how a
robust you want to be and how slow do
you want it to be or how fast you wanted
to be and so on I've you know I'm saying
that it's easy to use from the from my
perspective not being a professional
database guy then I was able to pick it
up and run with it really surprisingly
quickly and again we've talked about the
benefits of having you know a full a
capi set around well I think there are
also benefits to having a pretty
extensive sequel dialect around as well
that again is very very similar you know
obviously not as large in scope to you
know MySQL or the full oracle database
or whatever but it's actually very very
capable database so again you can take
the same kind of approach that you use
to storing data out down to your arm to
your embedded device and java DB is is
the Apache project derby and that's
still a very it's a very active project
so there's a significant community of
developers and users around this and by
now it's it's a very mature code base
and they have an awful lot of test
testing that they do between releases so
they are you know it's a very reliable
product and we we actually had I'm
trying to think if we didn't file one
bug against Java DB in in doing all this
work they may have filed a couple of
bugs which were all we should do that
differently in the future
but I don't think we I don't think we
filed one from our site did we dug No so
it's easy to use you've got a single jar
that's all you need on your classpath
sequel support it has a lot of
self-tuning capabilities so it can kind
of look at the environment and say well
i think i'll pick this page size today
that kind of thing you can obviously
override the default behavior if you if
you need to for your specific
application and then there's a lot of
functionality that you can plug in to
you add additional functions that are
callable from the orc from yours from
your escort SQL and so on yeah we've so
I have a beagleboard XM sitting here and
that's running booting off off an SD
card and running java d be using the the
SD card as the storage volume and yeah i
guess it's you know it's in the
benchmarking that we've done actually
java DB compares very favorably with the
alternatives that we looked at running
running in the same configuration same
hardware same SD card and so on oh there
is and there is a java DB session
tomorrow if you're interested in
learning more about java DB it's at two
o'clock in this hotel within the Montori
room so i'll be co-presenting that with
with one of the architects of java DB so
the final the final thing that I like to
the final component to cover is is
Jersey and this is a framework for
authoring and hosting restful web
services it's the the reference
implementation for jsr 311 also known as
jax-rs and it's it's
the way it works is simply by Anna
annotating your code and i'll show you
an example of that at the moment and
it's actually astonishingly easy to to
do you know really quite complex web
services using this framework so it
includes things like Jason support which
is obviously pretty useful if you're
going to be accessing those web services
from a browser environment for example
and it also provides a rest client API
so a client-side API for accessing
restful services what we're what we're
shipping in this initial version of
embedded suite is jax-rs you know one
jax-rs to is currently being worked on
the expert group has been meeting for
quite a while now and the client api
there will be a standardized client api
as part of jax-rs too yes thank you so a
J's application kinda looks like this so
all the stuff on the bottom there in
blue is is basically what's in Java
embedded sweet and then you end up with
you know we have a little utility that
you can either use as your main
application but typically end up with a
little main application that invokes
glassfish and deploy some some web
applications and services and you're
probably going to have some static
content in there you know some static
HTML and images and style sheets and and
things like that so that's kind of what
what you end up putting putting onto the
device so here is a Hello Jersey kind of
program so this is sort of a hello world
of a restful web service so this is just
a POJO it's not you can see that it's
not the class isn't implementing any
special interface or extending any
special base class what you can see is a
path annotation which
you know tells the the container the web
container which path to associate this
this class with and then in this case
we've only got one method inside the
class again you know the the important
thing here is is that there needs to be
some some level of correspondence
between the mime type that you say that
you claim this method can conserve and
the the type of the return type of the
of the method so this when the
annotation here says that when a get
operation is performed on / hello world
then this method will be invoked and the
other annotation tells the container
that to return mine typed text / plane
in the in the HTTP response and lo and
behold if you access this then so you
can just do this from a browser
obviously then you'll you'll just see
hello world so it's not a very exciting
application but it kind of illustrates
the point of of how you used how you
start to use Jersey and they're a lot
obviously a lot more annotations that
come into play when you actually want to
do something real I mentioned the
embedded glassfish API so this deals
with you know the life cycle of the
application server starting and stopping
deploying a nun deploying applications
so war files and runtime configuration
of things and also you can access
different glassfish services through a
generic services API this part of this
so again just to give to show you some
some simple code then you get an
instance of the GlassFish runtime you
just call a static method to do that and
then you you create a essentially a
property's object which you use for the
initial configuration of the the
GlassFish runtime in this case then
we're setting two properties
set the port numbers to be used for HTTP
and HTTPS and then we create a new
glassfish instance and tell it to start
and then we can ask ask that instance
for for an object that we can use for
deploying a nun deploying applications
so i want to just to show a little bit
more of of the the code and configuring
of things i want to talk a bit about you
know securing the device so you can see
the disclaimer there this is not a
generic device security tutorial if
you're actually building a real device
you should understand for yourself how
to how to secure a Linux installation
and so on make sure you run the right
tools to check and all that kind of good
good stuff but let's talk a little bit
about some you know securing access to
web applications gobbly important if
your device is sitting out there
somewhere or sitting on the underwater
and you really don't want someone
hacking into it when you're just about
to make that vital discovery so I guess
the the high-level point to make here is
that it's still glassfish so
conceptually the way that you configure
things is basically the same as with big
glass fish and no that's not an official
name so difference is because you know
glass fish for embedded suite is size
reduced then there is no admin console
the good news means is that that means
there's no admin port open that you have
to worry about you and use the the
embedded API to do the the configuration
you typically do using the admin console
or the IAS admin command line interface
and unless until the point at which you
actually configure them then Glatt
embedded glassfish does not listen at
all so unless you give it the port
numbers then it won't open any sockets
so yeah this makes some just make some
things a little easier when you're doing
a
security audit on your device so a lot
of cases then you'll want to force the
use of a secure transport and there's an
easy way to do that in fact there are
several ways to do it depending on
exactly the context so you can use the
the old traditional web.xml way of doing
it or with servlet 3 dot 0 then you can
you can use a servlet security
annotation unfortunately if your servlet
is actually a web service that you're
building using Jersey then the server
security annotation isn't yet
implemented to that so you you have to
do it using the web.xml way if for
example you wanted to do this
programmatically and for and maybe say
if if you use the secure connection then
I'll give you some extra stuff in my
response then you can you know you can
query you know Inge with in Jersey and
obviously within the server DPI to
discover whether the connection that is
talking to you was is secure or
unsecured so you could say if security
context that is secure you know then add
add special source to the response for
example I don't recall I'm sorry good
question Lee so this is just a quick
quick look at some what you have to put
into web de XML it is a little bit wordy
but it is it is what it is and it's it's
been that way for a long time it isn't
going to change now so in this case that
I've highlighted that sort of the two
really important lines out of this so in
this case we're saying anything any path
at / admin / star and you know we're
giving that the human readable name of
admin pages and then we're saying we've
got the transport guarantee clause in
there and if we say confidential then it
will enforce the use of
of TLS on the connection and if you
actually connect to the HTTP port it
will actually redirect you to the to the
secure port which is kind of nice so
having got a secure connection maybe we
also want to limit who can connect using
that secure connection so that we can
you know we have some authentication and
authorization not just privacy so
there's a lot of authentication
functionality built into glassfish and
there are ways of extending that when it
doesn't quite do what you want or need
it to do and I'm going to show an
example of relatively straightforward
username and password style
authentication so an authentication
realm is is a it's essentially the set
of rules that you're going to use to
decide who's allowed to access and give
them that you're allowing someone to
access what what things you can allow
them to do what roles you are you going
to allow them to take on and there's
this simple six step process for um for
doing this and we'll go through each of
these fairly quickly so the first thing
you have to do is to create you to tell
glassfish about the JDBC realm and again
you'd normally do this from the console
and the embedded glassfish API has this
API called canal Runner which
essentially lets you do all the things
that are normally done through the a s
admin command or via the the UI of the
the console so in this case we're going
to ask the GlassFish instance that we
created earlier for a command runner
object to operate on that instance and I
think you can I think you can pretty
much see how this works
so normal this is the equivalent of
typing a s admin create jdbc resource
with a bunch of arguments and the the
result the command result thing you can
use to determine whether or not that
that actually worked you know in a
regularly configured system there are
very few reasons why this would not work
so having done that then you need to
tell so glassfish has a built-in JDBC
realm authentication protocol which
understands about how to how to use JDBC
and some seats are kind of built-in
sequel queries to query current user
credentials and working out what roles
you know whether whether the user should
be authenticated and what roles that
that user should be able to acquire so
here you can see the I guess the
important things here are you know four
or five lines down we've got a password
column equals password so that's telling
the the code that's going to be that's
going to construct the sequel queries
inside glassfish which column of your
database table it should it should treat
as being as containing passwords and so
on so in this is basically where you
tell glassfish which database tables in
which columns should you be using to do
the authentication then you have to tell
glassfish to actually use the the JDBC
realm for this specific web application
so and we're going to use what's called
basic authentication which just means
that the the credential that we send as
part of the HTTP request as opposed to
there are various other options you can
put into the in there as well
then you have to I've already talked
about roles roles basically specify what
you know what what things you know a
user can have a collect you know one or
more roles associated with it and it's
really up to up to you to define what
those roles actually mean you know in a
full-blown identity system then those
roles would determine you know are you a
manager and are able to see you know
personal details of people that report
to you and all that kind of thing then
you also need to see need to specify the
the role names that you're actually
going to recognize within this
application and then specify within the
security constraint where we put that
confidential transport field earlier
we're just adding into that to say you
have to have the role of admin to be
able to access these these pages and
then we're getting close to the end now
so then in this case actually this is
just the full the full security
constraint laid out so then we've got
with we told last fish all the
information it needs to be able to
construct a bunch of sequel queries on
some database tables to work out whether
it should allow a user to to log in or
not so we then need to use some sequel
to create the database tables that are
actually going to back at the backing
store for this if you like now java DB
allows you to do things like encrypting
the data store and there are various
other things built into it that help you
make the use of the use of this more
secure so here we just we basically is
creating three tables one that holds the
list of users one the holds a list of
groups and one Maps users to one or more
groups
and so we will so if we go back okay if
you look three lines up then you'll see
that it says md5 so the thing that it
will still be an md5 hash of the
password not the password itself and
there are a bunch of other other you
know that this all lives on top of the
underlying you know crypto functionality
of the Java platform so you've got a
whole bunch of other options that you
can use there too right good
ok
okay so we've created some tables and
this is you know pretty pretty basic
sequel we've got here and then so in the
example that I created I just you know
when we create that that database I just
inserted some fixed some fixed values
into there obviously you have to start
off with at least one so that you can
have you the ability to login and
administer things so again we got some
fairly simple insert statements here
which again we're we're executing
through through the JDBC AP API so we're
setting usernames and passwords and
assigning setting up people to be in
various groups so we've established an
admin group and a user's group we've got
a user called admin user who is a user
you know part of the users group and
part of admin and you have a user called
user who's only part of the users group
and this is what you see when you use
firefox to access a web application
that's protected in that way and you
won't you won't see the you won't see
the underlying page your service until
you can satisfy the the the password now
there are you know the framework that
this sits on top of is is completely
pluggable so if you want to do more
advanced things like adding in a
per-user salt for things like that then
you can very easily write a custom login
module which you know that there's a
glassfish class that you extend and a
couple of methods that you have to
implement but there's you can very
easily do that and make things you know
more secure as secure as you need them
to be so
absolutely yeah if you mean if you've
got if you got the hardware capability
of talking to to a card then yes you
could absolutely do that in a inner
space in a custom login module and that
would obviously be a you know would seem
to be a pretty secure way of doing it so
when it comes to actually like putting
code on your device then what you have
to do to install J's on the device well
you don't install it there is no actual
installation process you simply copy the
jazz jazz is packaged in a directory
tree and you basically copy that tree
wherever you want it to be on the device
you'll probably need to tell some some
part of your code or a script or
whatever where you put it but you can
put it wherever you want it to be and
when you actually start at last fish
instance then it'll create you can
actually point it at an existing
glassfish working tree if if you wanted
to do that if you don't do that then it
will create a skeleton working tree and
they'll actually use that tree it'll are
unpack you know war files and things
into that and run them from there by by
default obviously you know your
application may need some sort of cold
start process to for example initialize
the critter you know any kind of
credential store that you're keeping you
may you may want to actually pre
initialize a database and copy that into
place so that you can initialize the
database your your database at build
time put whatever you want to be present
on the device into that and then package
that app as part of what you copy onto
the device so that might be a way of
avoiding one
dude and to start up time the first time
that you that you device starts okay so
what I'm going to do next is so this is
a this is a little demonstration so
think of a smart home use case which
matches the sensors that we happen to
have on hand a few weeks ago and excuse
me so you've got a device that has you
know attachments to various sensors over
here i have a beagle board which is
running java embedded sweet and it's got
in this case it's got two USB sensors
alliance sensor and a heat sensor plug
into it so we've got an application
running running under jazz that is
sampling those sensors the way that as
package looks just like the the diagram
the block diagram that i put up there
are a few minutes ago so we have a
little application that actually just
starts everything off we've got a war
file and we've got some static HTML and
JavaScript so this is a you know that
the presentation here is all being done
by JavaScript using jQuery and that
javascript is using a web service call
to talk back to the BeagleBoard to both
the control and to query the current
status of things the current temperature
and to get historical data for to be
able to draw those charts so the
not on this one no this is purely purely
jax-rs sure
yeah the mean there's enough of
glassfish there I I haven't actually I
don't specifically know that WebSocket
will work but I'm I'm relatively sure
that there's enough of glassfish are
there but it would so jpa is certainly
an option and it will you know it's
known you know things like jpa and
hibernate unknown to work on top of java
DB job there are some restrictions with
things like you know the spatial data
type if you're talking about like a GIS
system there's there's some
functionality that is not there not
quite there in Java DB yet for to
support that but essentially hibernatin
and jpa and so on will work in this case
then the the day the persistence of this
sensor data is just low level jdbc calls
so it's just doing insert inserts into
the table
again I'm credit i'm i'm pretty sure
that the all of the containment
functionality that's required is still
there because there yeah I know
something about how its modularized and
so even though we don't you know we
don't include any you know o our mapping
as part of the embedded sweet the you
know I don't know of any specific reason
why it shouldn't work exactly
this is yeah this is not using jsr 256
this is just basically opening up a
serial data stream and grabbing numbers
out of it well the what the code that's
in the demo basically knows what the
device IDs of the USB sensors are and it
uses those to make sure that it's
talking to the right the right device
all right devices it then there's this
code that basically sucks numbers out of
those devices and passes those back to
the sort of the central persistence
module in the application it stores it's
storing whatever received from the
sensor and along with the timestamp of
when it was received in this case so the
the presentation of that as you know 101
Fahrenheit or 13 celsius is is done by
the by the UI in this case so and we've
you know we've got I what I'm showing
you today is a is a web UI oh I'm sorry
okay let's go chart from current slide
that's it so just to recap essentially
what this is saying is that see all the
blue stuff is basically Java embedded
sweet and then you'll you'll have some
sort of main application which you may
be may be quite small may be quite quite
large and extensive depending on how are
you exactly how you want to tart ition
the functionality between that part of
your code and and web applications or
web services you'll likely to have some
static content so simple HTML pages
images style sheets and so on and then
if you want to be able to you know be
able to you know either access that the
device programmatically from other
devices then you a restful web service
is a pretty good way of doing that or
again you can build an fx UI and we
built both a web you iron and FX UI on
top of the for this demo the light blue
right now is about 60 megabytes if you
as you as you if you saw any of the
keynote information on Sunday evening
then you'll know that we'll be able you
we're working both with the GlassFish
team and and also with the ers the
embedded team to be able to
significantly reduce that but with the
introduction of profiles into java SE
that will will significantly help us be
able to fit into a much smaller
footprint
you change you change sensors and you
how do you reconfigure yeah i think in
absolutely I so in in that situation
then I think you would have to process
the data into a you need to normalize
the data before you actually persisted
it in this case you know this is a demo
and but
yeah i think you know things like since
you know parameterizing sensors so that
you can actually know that when this
sensor says you know 27 it means 13
celsius or whatever that's you know
that's something you have to do on a
sense of my sensor basis and it may be
you know it may be the in some case you
have to you know the way that you'd
implement that may what may well change
from from sensitive sensor mmhmm yeah i
think you know put it particularly once
the day you once you get to a point
where the data is going to go to can
potentially go to multiple places then
having some sort of standard way of
representing that would be a good thing
this yeah oh yeah yeah that there's
there's the ASM one based syntax for for
health care stuff right and okay good
maybe we should okay good we should
maybe chat after it okay so i will try
and maybe talk loudly so that you can
still hear while i step away from the
mic a little bit so I've got the
temperature sensor here and a line
sensor both attached by USB to this
vigal board
so right now I
ok
seems to me like something about the
demo is stopped so you're not responding
to this hot pad
bear with me for one second
sure
if you want I can show
please put it right thank you
I'm sorry just what he's trying to sort
this problem out and we've got a project
running at the university of bristol in
the UK and we are exactly using the same
architecture and I've got all the
sensors now running in the lab so I can
show you live what's going on and on the
web basically yeah I'm not sure about
the Internet's for a bit
yes miss tempest honest watts is a
product that was developed by sun
microsystems a couple of years ago a few
years ago actually I think yeah we've
it's probably confused because I've
actually got a wired connection to this
to this some bridge over here anyway I
think the
okay the problem was of the tablet I
actually starting the demo from this
tablet over here and that had gone to
sleep so I think the server had actually
quit so we should be able to see some
temperature increase name and we
actually do have a version of this so
that that use um has users x10 to
control the heater and and some lights
not yet there are Oracle's a large
company and there are there are
processes they'll I don't know whether
it'll be java.net but there they'll be
we do plan to meet to make things
available yes whether it's java.net or
near the Oracle technical network or
whatever so you can see that graph
definitely as an upward slope now so
essentially you can run this in you know
automatic or manual mode in manual mode
then you can go in and set the
thermostat or and the the ITO we'll just
we'll turn on until it until the
thermostat temperature have reached and
so on there's a there's some lighting
control underneath this as well so you
can turn turn lighting on and off line I
put some light into the sensor then you
should also see
so we're accessing sensors making making
decisions based on those sensor values
and we're providing all this information
and control to both a web interface and
a JavaFX interface via a restful web
service so that's I think that's
probably enough for the demo
okay so if you are ready to actually try
jar java embedded sweet then I think
probably all you need to do is type
three words Java embedded sweet into
your favorite search engine and but if
you want to take a picture of that
screen that will do just fine too so you
can download an eval of Java embedded
sweet from the from Oracle technical
network
mmm I i don't know but i can i can
obviously find out so if you want to be
on a contact me afterwards then i can I
I know someone who knows say sure yeah
that's yes I mean that that is the
Oracle the typical oracle business model
to support
so there's there's lots more places will
lots of places you can find out more
information specifically you know our
opal places there's a set of pages about
driving very sweet there's obviously
also information about John you know
java SE embedded online and Lord general
information for the Java developers too
so thank you all very much for coming
it's been fun having a conversation with
you guys and if you've got any more
questions you want to ask now then yeah
go ahead I'm sorry absolutely
yeah Oracle is does consider embedded to
be important we announced you know the
our embedded convergent strategy that
last year's Java one where we convergent
I mean typically then more historically
then you know we've we've used CDC in
the sort of upper half of Java ME for a
lot of embedded applications and you
know the so that the profiles work that
was talked about on sunday is kind of
the part of the outcome of that in the
convergent strategy that we announced
last year so we are yet there's a lot I
can tell you that there's a lot of
engineering time being focused on making
it possible to use embedded se22 on
embedded devices and you know not not
real you know not embedded I seeing a
light switch but embedded se on you know
relatively small devices not much much
smaller than anything you've ever seen
running yeah much much smaller than
anything that you've seen running se
before so yes Oracle is some remains
committed to the embedded space as an
important place where we think the Java
can play a major role and Bob do you
want to announce your session
challenging farmer guys so we actually
get the GG IL
Oh
rolling your own and trying to figure
out what the state
hmm yeah yeah I mean I guess the Arduino
guys have a slightly easier task in the
sense that you know that they're the
Arduino guys but it oh it's absolutely
an existence proof but I guess from the
point of view of a the Java platform
group then we we have to be a little bit
careful about pushing stuff out there
that like yeah we can say well it works
on this platform Annie you know that
doesn't mean that that we have to make
it work everywhere before it can work
anywhere but it you know it does mean
you can't just push something out there
because you can make it work in one
place
mmm
yeah and I go yeah
Oh
hmm yeah i think you know i guess i have
to be really careful why i say here
because of that safe harbor statement
but clearly clearly that's not him yes
clearly that's not a not a it's it's a
concept that the thumb that we may have
thought of
why not well there's when you think
about the hardware that's inside those
kind of devices and compare it to what's
inside of eagle board I mean that you're
if you bought a phone probably this year
it's got significantly more compute
power than then this beagle world has
then it has twice the number of course
so well there is that as well but um
from a from a purely technical viewpoint
it's not that crazy an idea okay well
thanks thanks again guys thanks for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
