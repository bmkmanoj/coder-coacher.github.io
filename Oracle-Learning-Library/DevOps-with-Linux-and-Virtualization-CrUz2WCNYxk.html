director of product management for auto
could be an invisible box thank you for
joining us and the time you're going to
dedicate to this webcast today i'm going
to be talking about Oracle VM VirtualBox
vagrant and how these very cool
utilities can help you to build a DevOps
solution this is our safe harbor
statement to remind that this webinar
registration is intended only to outline
our general product direction and it's
not a commitment to deliver any material
or code development release and timing
of any feature described remains at the
sole discretion of Oracle here the Jen
I'm going to discuss with you today in
the first section and introduce the
concept of the box and why it's time to
evaluate and work on it
then I'll move to the products on which
you can rely so I'll put the end little
box and vagrant and how thanks to these
utilities you can create your own
virtualization the ROPS environment we
will also add a little demo running on
on a laptop and at the end I'll leave
you a set of documentation references of
both little box and background at the
end of this video you will also have the
time to get the answers you need on what
I'm going to present so first question
what is divorce so the verbs target is
to solve this very common issue between
development and operation business unit
as you can see on the Left we have an
admin saying hey it's not my machines
it's your code while on the right we are
the developer replying it's not my code
it's your machines the box is a
combination of software development and
operations and it as its name suggests
it's a melding of these two disciplines
in order to emphasize communication
collaboration and Cree
in between the traditionally separate
developer and IT operations teams rather
than seeing this as two distinct groups
who are responsible for their specific
task but all really work together did
the verbs methodology recognizes the
interdependence of these two groups by
integrating this function as one team or
Department DevOps apps and an
organization deploy software more
frequently while maintaining service
stability and gaining the speed
necessary for more innovation and in the
end everyone is able to deliver the best
result and overall experience possible
to the customer so DevOps development
and operations is a term used to refer
to a set of practices that emphasize the
collaboration and communication of both
software developers and information
technology professionals while
automating the process of software
delivery and these respective changes it
aims at establishing the culture and
environment we're building testing and
releasing software can happen rapidly
frequently involved in IP here we have a
picture that shows one of the main
problems that DevOps could fix more than
one time once the code copy work is on
there it's not more a development
problem what happens next the Bob's
thanks to its automation processes
allows to create a real continuity
collaboration between developers and
IT professionals that build on automated
processes will really do the difference
on this picture you can see development
group on the left and operations one on
the right one on the left you can see a
very guy interest on introducing new
features and the nice link also to
enable the business on the right you
have operation group that do not want
introduce regressions want respect
service level agreement uptime and
security
while on the left you are one team
asking to work on new technology quickly
on the right you add a group that it's
much more conservative and do not want
to change anything that actually works
so I'll deal with this a bit of history
if we go back 20 years prior to calm
there were software software companies
like Oracle Adobe Microsoft shop and so
on while moving into decom era we see
the rise of companies whose core
competency is actually software that
director of revenue streams come from S
word if we fast forward to 2014 or 2015
we see massive disruption from startups
companies where core competency is
software being used to disrupt the
traditional approach while these
companies enjoy a strong position in the
market they had to retain tremendous
software agility and these startups are
not only competing with the established
businesses but also faced other
disrupted startups DevOps has really
been driven by this type of company to
give them fast-moving agility to
innovate in software to respond to
market changes or competitive threat so
now we see enterprises looking at the
verbs both as a path to take market
share from traditional rivals but also
as a defensive shield to profit protect
them not only from those rivals but also
the traditionally fast-moving smaller
competitors and disrupted startups and
this is also why DevOps is mostly
culture automation but what are we
automating infrastructure as code
continuous integration or continuous
deployment as the next step of
continuous integration continuous
testing and monitoring all these
automations obviously we require an
initial investment in term of money and
time
but once ready we
allow you to deliver your solution in
minutes or hours instead of days or
weeks so it's important to know that
DevOps requires some really big changes
across the organization changes that
impact control process and people DevOps
isn't easy and every company's journey
is different but the payoff is really
tremendous DevOps will help you to
deploy code faster and more of them spot
a fixer Ross sooner and ultimately meet
market demands and customer expectations
better second points on the first
section of our agenda why is now the
time for the votes so why is now time
for all this automation so business
value is driving the web's traditional
IT organization common problems are
mostly due to poor communication and
coordination between team leads that
impact the up early cycles with delays
manual intervention leads to human
errors and no repeatable processes huge
amount of waste exists because of
different configured environments
development QA stage production and
usually you can also see multiple
processes with the no standard defined
sealer teams so development operation IT
QA q e and so on and non integrated
tools and 420 data so how can you avoid
this problem and why devups could help
you on this today you can increase the
automation you can automate everything
you can accelerate routine tasks and
then sure repeatability and reduce
errors you can reduce the latency with
the continuous workflow for integration
testing means API vaporization delivery
and deployment so all targets of the
tip-ups approach
you can increase visibility with the
continuous assessment monitoring and
measure everything custom feedback loops
prioritize business and that planning
provide visibility across teams and the
neighbor collaboration and include
planning and security for your
application results with the good
develops approach could be a faster time
to market because you can increase the
frequency and the courtesy of releases
the automation processes will give much
more time to the people cost you will be
able to reduce objects by automating
processes this will also prevent human
levels and reduce downtime and with a
focus on business because you can allow
employees to focus on high-value
activities that will also improve
employees professional satisfaction and
one important thing to know is that the
good and those open technology is
already available as you can see the
automation tools has been started in
2005 and more arriving in the following
gears between them we can also see
vagrant one of the DevOps technology
that we are going to discuss today ha
and on the right a very cool picture
don't really show what the automation
can do compared to what it would require
with binder steps it's also important to
know that you won't get a complete devop
solution by one single product more than
one which is usually needed here we have
configuration management products like
unstable puppet shares or continuous
integration and delivery products like
jenkins or one decks
betting control product like g2
subversion visualization products like
docker or vagrant testing products like
Gradle or robot and binary management
products like Nexus or our factory each
product gives you
automation for a specific section of
of operations and what we are going to
discuss today is something related to
the best initial section with background
and Bristol box as the base hypervisor
maybe someone has never worked with
beautiful box and so I'm also going to
give you a brief overview of this
product here you can see the Oracle
utilization portfolio where we have
solution for desktops as virtual box and
secure global desktop on-premise
solutions like Oracle VM server for x86
and spark and the Oracle public cloud
let me introduce little box this is a
desktop virtualization product and it's
part of our whole virtualization
portfolio little box lets you create
virtual machines that run on your laptop
on your personal computer or on your
Macintosh so if your desktop computer or
laptop is running Windows Mac OS or
Linux or Solaris you can create virtual
machines running any of those operating
systems and this is very useful for test
development for running the occasional
use of some product that doesn't exist
on your normal desktop or environment
it's fast and it's powerful we will talk
about some of the capabilities of the
product as we go through this and for
personal use this is a free download
that anybody can make his own so why do
people use this well the first thing is
that it's a cross-platform solution what
does it mean cross-platform it means
that the same product with the same
features it's available for all the main
x86 platforms and moreover you can have
the same x86 performs running as brittle
machines on top of little box paper box
is very helpful for
bring-your-own-device situation where
there may be a standard software
application that is needed within a
company but all the participants using
that they bring their own
with them of a palette of different
types and they can then still use the
same standard application that may be
shipping in one particular platform it
could be used for desktop utilization
and migration it could be used for
running old operating systems that are
not longer supported on to these current
personal computers and obviously it can
also be used as a way to deliver
software products for a client base or
foreign team or for example this
operating system with dispatch level
different operating system different
outdoor types this can require a lot of
hard work to create all the possible
combination of operating system and
patch level JVM versions compiler
version and so forth or if we had
customer bases that are on a different
operating system we might have to
develop for each of these different
types of combination well that's one use
case we might like to have sandboxes for
experimentation where to set up an
environment and do something that might
be destructive or you would like to have
in a private environment that you could
could throw away if it's not good or you
can keep if you like it so with restore
box you can run all x86 operating
systems on your own laptop or desktop
environment you can quickly and easily
test new platforms you can create
multi-layer test and development
environment or you can also run legacy
platforms all applications on modern
hardware and last but not least you can
also use visual Docs to create and
develop your applications and solutions
that once ready can be exported to a
cloud provider like Oracle so middle box
is one unique product within Oracle
foundations on which is based are at the
same time a Bible community
participation we have so many users that
elaborate and ripoff feedbacks for
Bristol box and also the enterprise
Oracle development and support that
constantly work to supply the best
enterprise service level possible and
for sure if you are interested you can
find further and detail information
related to butyl box also by cooking it
let's say I'm not going to give you a
brief overview of the other piece of
software to build this the Bob's
environment vagrant so what is vagrant
vagrant is a tool to build develop an
environment based on virtual machines
it's focused to create environments that
are very very similar to production the
ends of servers it uses hypervisors
talker or cloud ad as providers and it's
written in Ruby code and like little box
vagrant is available for all x86
platforms so Linux Windows and also Mac
OSX vagrant provides the same easy
workflow regardless of your role as a
developer operator or designer it
leverages a declarative configuration
file which describes all your software
requirements packages operating system
configuration users and more veterans
aims to measure production environment
by providing the same operating system
packages users and configurations all
while giving users the flexibility to
use the preferred editor integrated
development environment and browser
variant also integrates with your
existing configuration management
tooling like chef puppet and Sybil or
salt so you can use the same script to
configure vagrant as production vagrant
works on Mac Linux and Windows and more
remote development environment force
users to give up their favorite editors
and problems while with the brittle box
integration you can also work on your
own laptop
vagrant can work on hypervisors like
digital box docker or also on different
cloud vendors and why vagrant vagrant
provides easy to configure reproducible
and portable work environments built on
top of industry standard technology and
controlled by a single consistent
workflow to help maximize the
productivity and flexibility of you and
your team so thanks to vagrants you can
easily build reproducible environments
with an automated workflow no human
intervention is needed and everyone like
an IT administrator or a developer can
easily build the same environment with
the simple command so how can I start to
play with vagrant and little box I'm now
going to share with you some concepts
and at the same time some very common
commands that will help you to approach
the verbs based on background and
theater box first point distillation
obviously the first step requires to
install little box and vagrant on your
own machine for each product you can
find executable that will proceed to the
software installation you'll find dot X
Files for Windows rpm source source code
for Linux and dmg images for Mac OS X
once the software has been installed
you'll need a variant box what is a
vagrant box
it's a previously built vagrant little
machine image pre-configured and ready
to run it's a very similar solution to
the Oracle VM templates that we have for
our Oracle on-premise open cloud
infrastructure the boxes can cover all
exits six platforms like Windows Linux
BSD and also Mac OS X and you can also
create your own boxes obviously and how
can I get a vagrant box
there is more than one public catalogue
between them we can mention the official
capital from a Shi Corp the company that
actually owns the vagrant project or
also the Oracle Linux vagrant boxes
catalog available on our young website
by vagrant you can manage catalogs for
your own installation and it did it
configure more than one catalog you also
have the option to create your own
catalog or if you prefer get a vagrant
box by specifying the URL where it
resides so below you can see a picture
where you consider the design tax of the
common vagrant box art the name of the
box available URL where to download the
box and the provider the provider in our
case is VirtualBox now how can I create
a vagrant environment first of all the
project's concept a veteran project is a
host operating system folder that we get
your box images you can add more than
one project and each of them can be
managed with a single configuration side
the vagrant file the main function of
the Begum files is to describe the
little machines required for a project
as well as how to compute and provision
these machines the idea is that when a
developer checks out some code from
version control which has a vagrant file
that developer can simply vagrant up to
get a fully provisioned digital
environment to develop that product as
you can see from the example picture by
the command vagrant in it the default
configuration file the default Begum
file has been created vagrant is means
to run with one bigger file per project
and the vagrant file is supposed to be
committed to version control this allows
other developers simple bidding in the
project to check out the code run
vagrant up and be on their way
vagrant files are portable across every
platform penguin supports the sine tax
of bigger file is Ruby but knowledge of
the Ruby programming language is not
necessary to make modification to the
Vega file since it is mostly simple
variable assignment in fact ruby is not
even the most popular community
parenting is used we think we should
help show you that despite not having
ruby knowledge people are very
successful with vagrant so how can I
start to use vagrant on these pictures
you can see different type of vagrant
operations the first one on the left
for example shows you a tentative top so
the comment is very on top of the box
named s quarter - box obviously this box
image does not exist locally and
moreover does not exist on the default a
c-corp Box catalog so their goal is
clear here could not open a box named s
Cotter - box while moving on the second
picture always on the left we can see
how to download a real box image from a
specific URL here we have one bigger box
image containing an Oracle Linux 7.4
image moving on the right first picture
above here you can see the content of a
vagrant box image the box image is
composed of the purple disc containing
the operating system or your own
application installed a bigger file
dedicated to the Box image and one ODF
descriptor file so the open
virtualization format that is the
standard for the hypervisors and at the
end a JSON metadata file containing
configuration options for vagrant like
for example the provider that in our
case is purple box once the box has been
downloaded and is in place we can sort
out the bigger machine by executing the
common they won't help now how can i
connect them work on my vagin
on the picture on the left as you can
see we have the machine creation of
thing by the common beggar on top
pleasing the output of the common we can
see that first point the machine will
have a forward deport so the for number
22 of the machine will be forwarded to
the port number 2222 of the oscillating
system to give SSH access the access
would be granted to the user vagrant by
using a private SSH key from the host
operating system to the best machine and
there will be a shared folder between
the host operating system and the guest
machine that will be automatically
mounted by the machine itself on the
right you can see how to get access to
the machine so by vagrant SSH without
any password prompt you can see the
shelter folder already mounted by the
vagrant machine and also the ability to
get administrator rights on the machine
by executing sudo here you can see other
very usable vagrant comments to remember
so they don't halt the comment to shut
down the beggar machine running vagrant
preload that is the common to restart
the running machine or typical an
updated version of the brigham file and
valent destroy to shut down and destroy
the better machine running with this
option the box image downloaded will be
obviously preserved is it possible to
customize boxes obviously yes you can do
it by editing the vegam file so the
unique configuration file for your
Bigham project over there you can
customize more things such as the port
for holding configuration or the
resources that will be dedicated to the
machine for example suppose that I want
to restart my machine with more memory
us or CPUs the steps to accomplish this
operation are
first I need to edit the Vega file and
apply the changes needed in the second
we start the machine by executing
vagrant reload if you are interested to
customize more your machines you can
also evaluate all the options available
into the underline hypervisor so little
box by executing the command the Box
managed on your host operating system
now coming back on the vagrant box
concept vagrant box is a tar gzip file
containing the Vega file so the
information from this file will be
mapped into your bigger file that is
created when you want
Vivint in it into a project then you
have VMDK files that are the brittle
discs containing the machine image with
operating system or applications then we
add the OBS configuration file that
defines the vista larder for the box
based on the open virtualization format
and then we have committed at a JSON
file that contains variant metadata
information like for example which
provider the box works with so here we
are I'm now going to show you a brief
demo on how you can start to play with
vagrant and little box and Oracle Linux
on your own laptop or desktop
environment
so obviously the main common to use is
vagrants by executing it you can also
see the help of the common and here we
have a huge list of common comments like
box to manage our boxes connect destroy
reload Hulk
package PowerShell and our DB for
Windows boxes status version and so on
as you can see for each command you can
also find a description of the same
additional sub comments are also
available but are either more advanced
or not commonly used and if you want to
get all the option for a specific
comment you can also execute variant
command - eh for example we can fly now
to see which are the options or the sub
comments available for vagrant box so
yeah what attitude to execute vagrant
box - age and here we have options for
this common like add list or other like
repackage or update another thing for
example now I can check the list of
boxes already available by executing
vagrant box list all I can check the
bacons release installed on my machine
now let me show you where you can find
veteran boxes for radical Linux for all
our images we have a standard define
that obviously can be customized on your
own environment by a web connection to
yamdoot oracle.com
the slash boxes you can find our
official parent boxes for oracle linux
between them we can see images for other
kulhanek 6 and and also the latest
oregon linux 7.3 for each box you can
also find the URL that you need to
download the veteran box on your own
laptop or desktop environment and also
the checksum of these images
last but not least you can also see the
example comments on how to start using
Oracle Linux vagrant boxes below one
example on how to verify the checksum of
the downloaded box
I'm going to now to create my own bag of
Balzac to create a vegan project the
only thing that I need is a directory
once my project is readied for step I'm
going to execute is the download on one
of one box from yonder TOCOM and this is
an Oracle Linux 7 update free obviously
the download and open image is needed
only the first time following machines
will start from the same image
you
once my Oracle Linux box has been
downloaded next step is to create the
vegam file for my project by executing
the common vagrant in it oil 73 the Box
imported a default Vega file will be
automatically created into the VM file
for this project you can see different
configuration options like network
configuration CPUs and memory allocated
for all the details you can refer to the
variant documentation so coming back up
to our project next step is to start the
variant box import it to accomplish this
step I only need to execute vagrant up
by this command the default box image in
this case l7u 3 will be start it up as
you can see this machine I started with
the forwarded port for SSH access so the
port number 22 on the machine will be
redirected to 4 2222 on the host system
another automatic configuration is
related to the shared folders in fact we
have the directory on the host system
that is mounted under the file system
slash vagrant on the machine so here we
have the port dedicated to the SSH
access here the shared folder so now I
only need to connect to the running
machine to accomplish this the comment
is so easy vagrant SSH and automatically
I'm connected to the Oracle Linux 7
machine the authentication obviously
happens by the ssh key available on my
host system and this is a common Vista
machine where I can execute all the
comments like hostname or verified the
Oracle Linux release installed or verify
the running kernel and connected with
the user vagrant but obviously I have
total administration of my machine by
sudo
I can get atom
to preview ladies you can also check the
slash vagrant Nonpoint
the default share where you add
read/write privileges and where you can
share files and directories between the
host and the guest operating system
another important evaluation the actual
vagrant box running it's really a simple
critical box machine and you can check
the process running on your host
operating system so here you can check
the process running and you will see
that we have a process at brittle box
process with the machine running
now on the same vagrant project we can
also add further boxes or machines for
example I can add another clinic 6
machine by downloading another box from
yonder protocol comm and this is an
Oracle Linux 6 update 9 box
you
once the download is complete if I try
to start or initialize the second
machine the Oracle Linux eyx I want to
be able to do it using the same comment
use it before as you can see you will
get an error saying that they can filed
already exists in this directory and the
same if um if I'm going to use a date on
top because actually the configuration
file is only one being defined to start
more than one machine in the project I
need to properly configure my machines
so first of all on our demo I am to stop
the running machine running that's the
default one one stop it obviously also
the VirtualBox process won't exist
anymore to properly configure more
machine I have traded the brigham file
of my project as usual the best practice
suggests to become clarified before
editing it so into the VM file the
configuration file of my project I'm now
going to comment out the original
machine name and create two different
ones because I'll have two different
bigger machines six and seven where each
one will lie on a specific box six on
l6u nine and seven on oil 73 now I can
start two different machines of my
project to start the machine named six
allowed to execute vagrant up six as
seen before the read later directory SSH
port will be 2222 and as you can see the
box used is il 6 u nine on the left
column you can see that we do not have
any more default but we have six so the
name that we used into the vegam file
you
once the six machiners be
started I can proceed to start the
machine named seven as you can see
vagrant dick detected the poor collision
because also the machine named seven is
trying to get four 2222 for SSH access
automatically vagrant will choose a
different or to redirect the SSH access
and here in this example the port will
be twenty two double O
you
now to connect to my machines background
SSH won't be enough we need to specify
the machine name we want to connect to
so to connect to the machine name 6 I'll
execute the vagrant SSH 6 and then I can
also check the Oracle Linux release
while to connect to the machine name 7
I'll execute the vagrant SSH 7 by
working on a variant project with more
machines an important point to consider
is that I have a distributed shared
folder between all the machines
so if file created from one machine can
also be read or updated by another
machine part of the same variant project
as you can see here I created a file
into the machine and now I'm going to
connect to the other machine and also on
the other machine
I have the access in read write mode to
the same text file
we saw our clinics box images but by
switching to the article bacon catalog
we can also find a very huge list of
ready to use boxes as you can see here
you have a real search engine for
vagrant boxes you can look for providers
also the list by number of downloads or
creation update date you can look for
boxes with Oracle products or you can
look for Windows boxes for example and
here we have a Microsoft Windows 10 box
so now talking out one box from a
Chicago catalog
first of all I've traded my vagin file
to add the new box to the project I give
the name you boon to the to this box
coming from a saccade catalog and as
already did for Oracle Linux boxes I
need to add an entry for this machine so
I'm going to add Ubuntu and the name
Ubuntu will refer to the specific VM and
so the name that I got from the Hashi
co-op website okay
so now the command to start the ubuntu
box as you really know is vagrant up
given the important thing here is that
we didn't specify the URL a URL because
the aashiq or catalog is the default one
and so we do not need to specify to your
you
as already happened
why we are going to start this vagrant
machine vagrant detected a port
collision and so evaluated in Newport
for the SSH access to this Ubuntu
machine so like for the Oracle Linux
machines also for the Ubuntu one we have
the port dedicated to the vagrant SSH
access and the shared folder mounted now
yeah so the machine now is going to
start and the process is now completed
so while we refine the river box process
is running you will see that we have
three different processes one for each
PM for each image running on the host
operating system obviously to connect to
the Ubuntu machine allowed to execute
vagrant SSH Ubuntu and here our running
Ubuntu machine
you
and what about the network with vagrant
and little box I have the option to
define private network managed by DHCP
or aesthetic IP address but at the same
time I also have the option to define
public networks managed by DHCP I can
enable default routing and also static
IP addresses
coming back to our our environment how
can i define a private network the first
step could be to define a common user on
my machines
this user could be used for the
connection between the machines
themselves or maybe also from for a
particular connection from the host
operating system to the machine so I'm
now going to define the user Oracle here
on the Oracle Linux 6 machine and also
on the Oracle Linux 7 machine obviously
I also need to - to define a password
for here for the Linux user ok so and
for the private network what I have to
do is most of you already understood I
left with my big Ram file I will take a
backup of the existing configuration and
then I will add a line for the private
network to the configuration file so
here I define the private network based
on DHCP today enable this network on my
machines I need to reload them the
common to reload the machine is vagrant
reload machine name in this case Ubuntu
as you can see while restarting the
machine is now going to pick up a second
with the link and nost only one so we
have two different virtual links here
one for the net network and the other
one for the host only network
by connecting to the machine and you
know by vagrant SSH command I can check
which is the IP address assigned by DHCP
server and here we have the idea that's
associated I can also check that this IP
address is reachable by my host
operating system and by that Bethany I
can also connect to the machine using
standard SSH and the same thing
obviously is also valid for other
machines like 6 &amp;amp; 7 so I'm now going to
reload also the other two Oracle Linux
machine first the other clinic 6 and
then also the other clinic 7 and the
target of this reload is to only to pick
up the second card based on host only
network
you
now the latest machine so
balance of balance reload 7 and also the
third machine will pick up the second
little knick
once all the machines have been reloaded
you can call it their IP addresses on
the same private subnet on the u-boot
machine we add the IP ending with five
on the oracle in of six we have the IP
address ending with six and so we can
check their and ssh six and here the IP
address of this machine on the hostile
linear network and then on the other
clinic seven machine we have the IP
address ending with seven it's important
to know that direct SSH access between
VMs or also this SSH access from the
host operating system could be accepted
only by SSH keys this is usually valid
for all the latest releases of vagrant
box images in fact I cannot connect from
the seven machine to the six one by
supplying the Oracle user password and
here you have the example but obviously
you can always set up the SSH keys for
your own users and here some example
where you can see that SSH access is not
a low weight without SSH keys on Oracle
Linux six and seven box images obviously
this is a limit valid and in place only
for SSH access and you can also change
this kind of configuration IP address
enable as hostile liberally will be
always reachable from the machine and
from the host operating system and
so if you are going for example to build
up a web server listening on a port
could be D 81 or could be the 443 for
HTTPS protocol this services for sure
will work correctly and here you can see
so from the host operating system I am B
I have been able to ping all the IP
addresses and the same thing is also
valid while pinging the ends from other
machines
you
I'm now going to stop the
environments the common to store my
machine is vagrant heart even if I
always like to use shut down I'm used to
use shut down within the needle in
experience
I'm now going to
you some references for both products
vagrant and VirtualBox in the meantime I
would like to thank you for the time
dedicated to this webcast and please
feel free to ask your questions now I'd
be glad to answer and those who give you
faster details if needed thank you thank
you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
