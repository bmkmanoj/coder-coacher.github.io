connections between your applications
both in the cloud and on-premises and
define how data is shared between those
applications so what can integration do
for you an integration could give your
sales reps who currently can't access
customer records when in the field
seamless and instant access to all
customer records resulting in a deeper
customer relationship unhappy customers
having trouble accessing order status
are thrilled when they have real-time
access to everything they need to know
about their orders and why let your
marketing team see customer data in the
cloud that is out of sync with your
legacy on-premises application data when
a single integration can synchronize
data across applications to perfectly
target marketing campaigns resulting in
more revenue but you don't have extra
time during your busy week to build
these integrations right and certainly
not enough time to spend it reinventing
the wheel so instead of creating
integrations from scratch
simply select from the growing list of
tested and proven integrations built by
Oracle and Oracle partners that's right
no coding just select a pre-built
integration and quickly connect your
disparate cloud on-premises and mobile
applications or you can design your own
integrations first select and configure
the adapters to use as connections
connections enable Oracle integration
cloud to interact with your application
instances such as Oracle RightNow
Oracle sales cloud and many others next
create an integration by dragging
connections to the trigger area for
requests sent to Oracle integration
cloud and the invoke area for responses
sent from Oracle integration cloud to
your application this easy-to-use wizard
helps you configure how to process
connection data including selecting the
operation to perform and the business
object to use then define the mappings
that transfer information between the
trigger and invoke data structures for
each request and response or let the
Oracle recommendations engine
automatically suggest the mappings to
use
finish by defining the business
identifier for tracking payload fields
in messages during runtime and that's
all there is to it integrate your
applications in hours not months time
complexity and risk are dramatically
reduced after activating and invoking
your integration monitor the status a
user-friendly dashboard provides overall
integration and system health you can
also track the payload fields and
message flow view the audit trail and
view and troubleshoot any errors
finally Oracle integration cloud PACs
are best cloud-based tools process
integration and analytics into one
simple and powerful unified interface
making it easy to add integrations to
your automated business processes for
example a process can use an ERP
application for product planning a
configure price quote application for
automating product configuration and the
Oracle e-business suite for booking
customer orders connect your business
and integrate your applications quickly
more securely and with Oracle's proven
performance with Oracle integration
