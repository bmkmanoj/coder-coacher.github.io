tokens in OAuth would you like to know
what they're used for codes and tokens
are exchanged between clients and
authorization servers in OAuth as part
of the process to retrieve resources
let's look at authorization codes first
the authorization code is used in the
authorization code grant type
it's obtained by using an authorization
server as an intermediary between the
client and the resource owner it
provides the ability to authenticate the
client authorization codes operate as
plaintext bearer credentials their
special codes with a very short lifespan
up to a minute there can only be used by
clients to request an access token
clients request an access token to
access protected resources the access
token represents an authorization that a
client application may have to do
something on behalf of the resource
owner or user there are two types of
access tokens reference tokens and
self-contained tokens reference tokens
are validated using a validation
endpoint when an access token is
presented to the resource server it has
to validate the token to do this the
resource server sends a token
introspection request to the
authorization server or introspect
endpoint it retrieves the token metadata
in JSON format once the JSON response is
retrieved it's validated to determine
whether the token is still active on the
other hand self-contained tokens such as
JSON web tokens or jots are validated
locally by checking the signature the
expected issuer name and the expected
audience or scope jawed is an open
standard that presents the access token
together with a digital signature and
metadata in JSON format the signature
information allows resource servers to
self validate the access token
authenticity using the authorization
server signing key without having to
query the authorization server every
time a new request arrives a jot token
is compact because of its size it's sent
through a URL a post parameter or in
HTTP header the structure of a jaw
generally includes a header a payload
and a signature the header identifies
the algorithm used to generate the
signature it consists of a token type
which is jot and the hashing algorithm
the second part of the token is the
payload which contains the claims claims
are statements about an entity or user
an additional metadata the signature is
made up of a hash of the header payload
and secret the secret is the signature
held by the server it's used to verify
the sender of the jot and to ensure that
the message wasn't changed along the way
a typical scenario for using jot is an
authentication after the user
successfully logs in using his
credentials a JSON web token is returned
and is saved locally whenever the user
wants to access a protected resource the
user agent should send a jot as part of
the authorization header using the
bearer schema because the user state is
never saved in server memory this is a
stateless authentication mechanism the
service protected routes will check for
a valid jot in the authorization header
if it's present the user will be allowed
to access protected resources another
token in the OAuth standard is the
Refresh token this is a special token to
obtain new access tokens on the Refresh
token grant type it's used in situations
where clients need a very long session
like days or weeks issuing a refresh
token is optional at the discretion of
the authorization server to learn more
