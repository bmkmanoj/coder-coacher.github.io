for joining me here today the session
creating new and innovative applications
mobile and web applications using
network api's and so my name is paul
schultze i'm from verizon so we're
obviously one of the big carriers here
verizon wireless in north america and
all the verizon services and the topic
today of network api's is quite
interesting in fact in sessions just
prior to this one and throughout this
java one since I've been here there's
been a lot of talk so I was here last
year there was certainly less talk of of
network API certainly api's so I'm very
encouraged to see all the all the new
and exciting things that are going on at
verizon my primary responsibility over
the last couple years has been to be an
advocate for open development so the
vision of myself and a lot of the
members of my team is to create verizon
as a platform so we feel that within our
you know just like many large companies
we have a lot of interesting assets and
what we want to do is open it up to
third-party innovation developers like
yourselves and we want to be able to do
that make it very easy to discover to
onboard and to run your apps and you
know to make some money with it all
right so with that said let me go ahead
and so this I'm just showing some some
pictures from an application web
application built with network api's and
this is that these are from last year
some pictures I had some opportunity to
wander around San Francisco last year
I've got an updated version and I'll
show you later for for this year and of
course powered by network api's using
multimedia messaging service and short
messengers so my plan for today is to
minimize the number of slides so am in a
minimized amount of slide where and
really to focus more on live demos so it
was interesting Sunday night up at the
Masonic Hall I really appreciated the
fact that the Oracle guys were up there
doing you know javafx and Emmy and they
were moving in smaller and smaller
devices and I really like live demos and
I respect the fact is they work to the
Raspberry Pi was anybody at the masonic
center and see that you know so few of
you saw that was great they're doing all
these different demos and
no net live demo and what I think
happened and I don't know this for sure
but the Raspberry Pi they built that
they loaded it on the Raspberry Pi and
as he was typing in they probably didn't
do any error checking because it was
just a demo and it ended up crashing
there a spare by but again I applaud the
the no net approach to doing demos that
way I hope to do that myself let's see
so let me move on to what the agenda is
and so as I mentioned I want to talk
about open development a little bit i
want to show you a little bit about the
verizon developer community so at
developer Diaries mcom we have a portal
and the idea there is to make it easy
for developers to discover a tryout and
i'll show you a little bit about how you
can try out network api's i can show you
which ones are commercially available
today and then you know from there we'll
go into some some other things i want to
talk a little bit about service exposure
one of the reasons that we're here at
Oracle Java one conference is we use a
piece of Oracle infrastructure called
the Oracle communication services
gatekeeper so it's been it's a weblogic
based platform that is our gateway and
I'll talk a little bit about that and
the importance of that it's it's very
scalable reliable and extensible and
I'll talk a little bit about the service
exposure and how we have extend that and
of course the heart of my presentation
is really about the demos so live demos
and a couple things I want you to look
out for so again they are showing you
the messaging demo I'll show you a
little bit about some updates we've made
since last year but I'm going to do a
number of different demonstrations
around location so location is still a
hot topic and probably will remain so mm
but I plan to take a little bit of
unique viewpoint on location so the two
themes that you should hopefully see
throughout this is the privacy of our
subscribers is paramount so we make sure
that anyone that is going to be located
by an application or any of their data
they own that data so the verizon
subscriber their data is theirs they
choose what they opt into so the whole
privacy protection i'm going to talk
about that and then separate but related
is some ideas around location and how
you can just provide the amount of
location you need to so i'll call it a
like good enough
just like good enough engineer should be
good enough location where perhaps you
don't need a precise location perhaps
you don't even know need to deliver a
location you just might say you know an
application could make a query to say is
this particular subscriber or are these
subscribers within a certain proximity
of of a point in a radius kind of like
like a geofence are they in or out and
things like that so again a little bit
different look at location both from the
privacy perspective but also from a
perspective of in a sense obfuscating
where the true location is that maybe
i'll show you even in ways where you can
actually tune your location so maybe a
user and end user might want to provide
a more precise when their indoor you
know if it's not picking up Wi-Fi or
they may want to put themselves in
location that they're not so think about
that and then of course after demos
future and we're going in question
answer so I plan to leave some time at
the end and and anywhere anywhere along
this if you have any questions so feel
free to ask questions at any time so I
want to take a look at the verizon
developer community quickly so let me
change it here so again I mentioned it
developer to verizon calm you can go
here and sign up and what I wanted to do
here there's lots of information but
again since this is about network kpi's
I want to focus on that in particular so
within here we have verizon api's and
when i go here we'll see the
commercially available AP eyes and and
i'll show you more deal detail about
these later so here we have a short
message service multimedia message
service terminal location what are they
miss Theriot properties and terminal
status so from here of course I'm just
going to just mention that those there
we're going to look at those in more
detail but from here when you drill down
you there's a button here where you can
try these things so in the spirit of
letting you try before you buy and try
something quickly you go to this you can
register your devices and I'll show you
and another demo later kind of what the
user experience for that is you can
select which API you want to try and
then you can opt in and send a request
so if i go to get started here I've
already oops logged out
logged in so the first thing in order to
get this get here is you want to be able
to create an account and it's really
easy it's free so that's all great let
go here so here I am in the try these
things so you'll notice that I've got
two phones actually got both phones here
one of us a test bone ones my my normal
phone and then here's the actual API so
if I just pick an easy one likes SMS
here I can just pick one of the devices
I've registered and type in some text
and go ahead and send an SMS and down
below you'll see that here's the rest
for for that particular API course is
pretty simple sending an SMS is simple
by design it should be and here's the
soap so in general see if this is an
accurate statement yes so for all the
api's we expose today all the public API
we have both soap and rest versions of
api's one thing I wanted to mention
about network ap has let me step back
for a moment about two weeks ago there
was the global sts DP summit service de
leur platform summit in Rome and I
hopefully maybe someone you got to go
there I wish I did I didn't one of our
friends Alan quail was an excellent blog
was a participant and a blogger there
and has a great blog post about globally
what's happening in the carrier
community about network api's and so
there were three points about that that
I took away from what was what was being
talked about so I think these are
relevant in the sense that it's a global
conference it's talking you know all i
should say all the operators since its
global there's operators from all over
the world different regions and there
were three themes that I want to mention
first is there was a lot of discussion
about the maturity api's coming from
operators and a categorization of public
versus private api's there was a lot of
focus on the fact that there's the
public api's and again that's what I'm
showing here these are public API is the
majority of what we'll talk about here
today our public api's makes sense for
this community you know as java
developers these are ones you can go off
and try and use now the second theme so
we're on the private api's there's a lot
of traction in offering api's within
within the carrier's themselves right so
we can you know share serve
this is amongst our products perhaps
more easily with api's and there's
private AP is that may just be between
particular organizations or you know for
whatever reason they're not public if
yes so a new focus on looking bullet
that both those areas another comment
was about standards and it was a good
session yesterday my colleague Hugh
Fletcher did birds of a feather about
Network api's there were some good
questions and discussion about standards
so are our api's there's a few standards
out there today parle x is one and one
API is another standard so standards are
great they're good but one of the key
takeaways from the global stp summit was
that while standards are good we
shouldn't be limited by them so there
are some folks that feel that the
standards may slow us down right so I
guess the key takeaway I looked at that
is you know if there's a standard or
something it does the job might as well
use it but if there's other ways or you
want to extend it or there's no standard
for it don't let it slow you down right
so I would like to think that if you've
got a good useful API you start a
standards track in parallel but you get
something out there if you can build
measure learn get it in the hands of
developers quickly and the third key
takeaway is the notion of cooperation so
as an industry I'm going to speak about
the carriers and the communications
industry we can do a better job of
making it easier to do cross character
stuff right so a lot of things that i'll
be showing you today our verizon
specific but as an application developer
you're going to want to be able to say
locate this mobile phone and in many
instances you know whatever the api is
you shouldn't have to know or care who
the characters right so we're not known
to be the fastest innovators in the
world however there is this that's more
coming together to make cross carrier
stuff easier to do it's all about you
the developers and I should make the
point that while this title of this talk
is about innovation I'm not going to
claim that odd that that i'm going to
show you things innovative it's really
your job so my job and our job is to
provide you with the api's and the tools
and and the processes and procedures to
do the innovation right so that it's
really your job but here's just some the
demonstrations will show you the types
of things that can be done all right let
me
they slide where for a moment all right
what's next okay so service exposure at
verizon um so on this chart the most
important thing is left off so if i
think about this in terms of outside in
that's the important thing right so you
guys shouldn't know or care about the
inside stuff that that's really hard job
so again the themes i mentioned is
discoverability onboarding being able to
try before you buy being able to
monetize your applications make money i
would imagine there's there's a lot of
you in here that would like to make
money with your applications so the
outside in perspective is is certainly
the most important where I sit and where
I work is service exposure and I just
have a couple of the types of assets so
again arise ins a big company we've got
a global IP network we've got 4g LTE our
fiber network we got terramar cloud and
lots and lots of other things so I think
of it kind of as a push and pull what I
like to hear certainly and during a Q&amp;amp;A
or whenever your office what are the
kinds of things you guys need that we
might be able to do so I'd like to think
as a large carrier we have assets that
are value to you and so that would be
more you know you guys come to us and
telling us what you need and we expose
news api's on the other hand I like to
think of you know companies like Apple
and things where they'll invent
something before we ever even you know
need to need me to know that we've
needed it the ipod right so didn't know
I needed one but when it came out it's
like oh god I have one of those so
looking around inside of the assets
might want to look around discover
things that say you know what if we
expose that to innovative developers
like yourselves and be a value the other
thing probably worth mentioning is when
dealing with the network elements
underneath the line here one of the jobs
of the service exposure platform is from
my operations friends is to do no harm
so as I move into looking at the actual
service exposure infrastructure one of
the things that's very important is to
make sure that you're protecting the
underlying network elements that are
that are rendering you know the service
for you via AP eyes and for other
services alright so moving into the
service exposure infrastructure I
mentioned the Oracle communication
services gatekeeper and this is a figure
I lifted for some of the documentation
that's on the
Oracle site this is an Oracle picture
and i'll give you the reference here
it's a a document called making money
through service exposure and the new
business model it enables it's from
oracle june of 2012 so the service
exposure platform you could consider
that sitting at the edge of the network
and above it what we want to do is
expose api interfaces that are kind that
are the flavor and the kinds that you
all want so soap and rest and rest like
I learned some more stuff about rest
earlier today the different level 1
through 3 of rest so different flavors
of AP is that that you're accustomed to
web services are all similar because
looking in the network if you go down to
the bottom I don't think anyone in here
wants to program to mobile location
protocol 32 right it's probably not
terribly exciting to you one of the
things that the cervix exposure platform
can talk to a location server in over
the protocol it understands it might be
session ishy a shin protocol or ims you
know service control interface or
whatever all the stuff is you guys
shouldn't have to know or care so
towards the various developer
communities we want to expose that the
api's make them simple to use I think a
great model is twilio twilio does a lot
of great things and their site is great
it's easy to get started so we want to
have those simple interfaces and then I
mentioned southbound you know at least
from my perspective is protecting the
network elements not as part of this and
of course the protocol conversion but as
API requests come in you obviously have
to do things like authentication
authorization all that kind of good
stuff and in terms of policy management
there's really kind of two flavors you
want to think of facing your
applications they're probably the only
one you care about is what is the SLA so
for example which which api's do you
have access to what rates and quotas
things like that so for your application
when it's on boarded you'll get a
certain service level now there's also
the platform provides in the network
plugins down to the network elements
there's rates and quotas there as well
and this is less things that you care
about but for example by protecting the
network I may have my friends that
provide the messaging servers and
they'll say oh you want to wear up to
this thing great but I want you to not
only authenticate and authorize to my
platform I don't want you send you know
more than a thousand transactions per
second or whatever it happens to be the
network element so very robust weblogic
piece of infrastructure and one of the
important things I've been going a
little bit of detail is the capability
of doing service interceptors so I'm
going to talk a little bit about why
you'd want to do that and I'm going to
show a little bit of just very high
level Java code for some of these things
so I'm going to move now to the the
service interceptors so why might you
want to intercept these requests so if
you think of that stack coming from the
application down on network elements and
back up eating we might want to for
example modify requests so for example
maybe there's a request that comes in
for location and it may be asking for a
fine-grained location so maybe assisted
GPS very very fine-grained very specific
location and for some reason it could be
maybe time of day day week maybe who the
user is whatever it is we may say you
know what for these criteria we're going
to change that to a coarse grain for
whatever reason so we can modify the
request coming in similarly if a request
is coming up from the network we might
want to modify there's the response
coming back to your application so yeah
locations another example we may want to
mask results I kind of mentioned the
obfuscation and doing things like that
and there's lots of other reasons we
want to do that so service interception
is important we might want to deny a
request and specifically I'm going to
move into doing the privacy check and I
want to talk about that how we do that
affect it again before we allow an
application to have access to the
subscribers data we make sure that that
subscribers opted in for that so how do
you do this in Java you implement an
interface you define a method and then
you decide what to do next you might
aboard you might proceed or you might
you know proceed to the next interceptor
in a chain and so here's some very
simple java about the service
interceptor so there's a privacy
intercept for class it implements the
invoke method and then in right about in
the middle there is the check privacy so
what we have is a privacy database and
there's a couple of different ways that
you can twiddle a bit if you will in in
the privacy database so one way is
dynamically by us sending you an SMS ask
right so we and I'll show you what that
might look like
so an application says say it's a friend
finder wants to locate you at that time
we may send you and say here this you
get an SMS it says the friend finder
wants to locate you do you want to deny
do you want to allow always do you want
to allow for the next 24 hours so you
can do it that way through the my
verizon portal the verizon subscribers
can go in and find applications are
subscribed to and then there's a third
way for trusted applications with their
proper business agreements there's we
expose a privacy and policy management
interface so imagine if you're a large
company XYZ company and you want to have
subscribers subscribe to your app and
you're going to take care of all the
opting in and we trust that you're going
to do that will give you an interface to
say okay you've opted it in again but
keep in mind the caveats that all the
businesses you yet you have to follow
all the rules and really the end rule is
the subscriber has to opt-in right and
have the ability to opt out so privacy
hugely important so I'm going to do is
do one more piece of slide where and I'm
going to move into demos this is a
little bit different so from the Oracle
communication services gateway there is
a communication service creation wizard
it's a clips wizard and it produces
output and here's the output of that as
an example for a terminal location so
what this is is it gives you some
information about the actual get
location request the URI the HTTP method
the response content type in the
response body and some arrow responses
so this is nice and this is a piece of
documentation you could use as you
develop your application all right so
with that let me go let's go to the
demos all right let me go to all right
so I mentioned the commercial api's that
are available this one's location I'm
going to come back to that you're a
short message service and so you can
send an SMS you can get a delivery
status you can start a notification and
stop so the notification stuff for it is
it's not only sending an SMS out right
to up to a mobile device mobile
originated so say for example you have
an application and you want someone to
be able to send an SMS and direct it to
your application and to do what
you want to do with so you set a call
back and then when when our platform
sees that we say oh this is yours and we
hand it to your application so that's
true of both short message service and
multimedia message service or sending
attachments so same kind of thing and
let's see same thing for that so this is
multimedia message service terminal
status so let me go ahead and actually
look at terminal status know this at the
moment i'll show you what this looks
like we put in a phone number here and i
can go out and get the status of this
particular mobile device and so right
now assuming the demo God's with us it's
it's not terribly detailed so the two
things if you can see in green that
comes back it tells you which device
it's a tell you I and it says it's
reachable so what this means is the
phone is on its registered it's on the
network and it is we're looking at many
of these we're looking at providing more
information so it might be nice to know
if you're roaming other things that we
know about that device so I mean this is
just simply saying it's reachable what's
on the network but as you might imagine
there's lots of other things and
certainly be interested to hear what
other things might you want to know
about that device alright so that's
terminal status carrier properties I can
do this I could do carrier properties
for a phone or for a group let me do
this and I'm just typing in a mobile
phone so the mobile device number so
here we look up the carrier properties
and we notice it's the carrier name is
verizon wireless there's a carrier ID
and there's also whether it's wireless
or not so you can know if it's a mobile
phone or not a mobile phone and this is
another one where there's additional
information that we could probably
enhance that with if you want to do a
carrier for group well from this demo
but the API you can just keep bad and
phone numbers and so on and so forth so
that's getting carrier properties device
characteristics I'll show you what that
looks like so this one is probably
something that's more interesting to you
guys again any time stop me for
questions alright so this one is finding
information about the device i'm using
it comes back with a device ID a device
all it's a samsung model number the
marketing name the droid charge by
Samsung that tells you the manufacturers
and interestingly the firmware version
so oh yes sir excellent question I'll
repeat that he said so we can get the
information about any device for any
carrier and that's where we want to go
so the answers today no not with this
these are verizon specific so that's
this is commercial available now for
today right so for horizon however as i
mentioned as an industry we're trying to
make the cross carrier stuff a little
easier for you to do right so great
question today verizon only so it's only
for a 100 million summarizing loyal
subscribers all right for free the for
free part i'm not sure about probably
not so let me let me back a full
disclosure on the technical guy i'm not
a business guy although I'm isn't savvy
enough that I do it I don't know if it's
free if back on developer not verizon
com um there is pricing for stuff so let
me stop there for a second I believe the
way it works you'll have to check will
give some number of them for free right
it's you know but on the freemium model
whatever you want to call that so
someone or free if you're going to do a
huge number of them but they're intended
to be low cost and not the business guy
all right yes sir question the version
of Android there on um let's see did I
see my buddy Q in there su here yeah you
do you know is that all right so so
great question in fact that's
interesting that that would be something
I have the Galaxy Nexus that just got
jelly bean for that one yah as exciting
way to anyway now I got it's wonderful
that would be a cool thing you get so
that I'll take that as a as it take away
to cns you mentioned this kind of API
it's reaching in its you know it's the
database of that that the information is
in our network
somewhere so technically I'm sure we
could expose it I'm taken from you
that's something and maybe event or so
but that's noted so great other
questions for a move on yes sir so opted
in yeah so some number of these require
opt-in location I don't remember if
device characteristics you need opt in
for you do okay great glad I you can
phone a friend so this one in order for
your app to get my information I have to
allow that opt-in and so the reason I
was hedging on that is some of the
things like you know maybe carrier
properties might not be so sensitive you
know who cares but again it's a value
judgment but generally being a carrier
or pretty cautious so it's anything
about you and for any reason you didn't
want an app to know about this we would
make you opt-in so I think the general
rule of thumb certainly check the VDC
portal and check what the agreements are
but when in doubt if it's information
about that subscriber we're very
protective of it okay so so think that
probably going to have to have opted in
to get information about that subscriber
these are great questions great fully
engaged team here like it alright so
there's a couple pre-commercial api's on
here this one's called place messaging
and this is one that you could send a
position to a device position for group
you could send an airport code you can
send an address this isn't commercial
but this just just to show you the kinds
of things we're thinking about and
another one that's not commercial yet
either is device capabilities and
configuration go out and get a
configuration list and what's
interesting is being able to push
something to a device so what the
example here is showing a mobile
location agent so we may want to have a
location agent on a mobile device to do
precise location and we might want to be
able to through you know
programmatically through an API push
that that is in this case mobile
location agent and we might even want to
start an okay to notification and get a
call back to know when its installed and
ready to go right so if your application
says gee I need this location agent I
can push it out there let me know when
it's ready to go and then you can go do
the next thing you have to do so those
are some of the future api's that are
coming up let me go back to location
look
very rich all right so get location i'll
just do this real quick we're talking
about it I'm just going to do one of a
mobile device that i have here and i'm
going to leave the defaults and you'll
notice that there's a one of the nice
things about this is a web-based test
tool it's easy for me at least you can
visualize it it's easier to demonstrate
what is so you see the parameters
requested accuracy acceptable accuracy
I'll just get a coarse location but
through this tool being able to
visualize this you can see the different
parameters you can set for these types
of things and then the type of location
i want to get is again i'm a big fan of
if i don't need a coarse grain what why
not just get a sorry if i don't need a
five great location just get a coarse
grain location so that's what it looks
like and we just mash it up on a map
that looks pretty much where we are
there's a terminal distance I'll come
back to that get location for group as I
mentioned if you want it you know your
friend finders say we're all here John
one we want to find out where everybody
is and find my central place to go out
and have a cocktail we can do that set a
periodic notification so this is one
where you could say for example every
five minutes you want to track somebody
so I think about using this for good so
Santa if a college kid driving junker
car up the college mates you know let's
keep keep an eye on making sure keep
moving in the right direction don't go
out in the weeds so that's periodic
notification and then one that's very
interesting is geographic notification
so setting geofences set a point in a
radius and so being able to be notified
have your application notified once you
enter or leave a geofence that's I think
that's quite a quite an interesting one
pretty useful alright so here let me do
a terminal location 1 i'm going to do
get terminal distance and i think but 0
meters because it's fine where I am so
what I did was what I want to do is I'm
going to Fisherman's Wharf this evening
so I want to got it I just went on to
google maps and i just got a latitude
longitude so let me go find out how far
in that
see cutting and pasting alright so I've
got my point for Fisherman's Wharf ok so
and I'm just mashed up on a map to
visualize it it says I'm a little over
2,000 meters away from Fisherman's work
alright so that's an example and what I
want to do with that now i just want to
show you a little bit of java coats and
square at javaone some of you guys might
get nervous if you don't see some code
for a little while so let me go look at
that so we did terminal distance mashed
it up on a map so this is again pretty
simple stuff invoking the terminal
distance API and you see kind of in the
middle here the input input parameters
we're sending in and address a tell you
are I a latitude and longitude and then
through API returns back a distance so
so pretty simple stuff on that one so
that's kind of a survey of some of the
api's in general so let me move on to
another demo location notifier so this
is and what I'm showing here is a
simulation and I'll kind of show you
what this looks like through I'm gonna
try doing this to a the video so the
reason I did this is that there's a
number of steps so let me tell you about
a little bit about what this is going to
show it's going to show first opting in
a phone so if I want it again you always
want to make sure somebody ops and if I
want to opt in a phone to test this out
with we run a simulation so first I'm an
opt-in a phone and then what I want to
do is to be able to set up a
notification so to say you know
someone's going to be traveling around
and when they come into this geofence
let me know about it right so you know
how you wouldn't people like like when a
VIP comes to visit my office or
something there's always the old call me
when you get here well if you set a
notification and say you know send me an
SMS the other reason i did a video of
this is that there's there's two phones
involved there's the phone that i'm
going to be tracking and then there's
the phone i'm going to receive that the
notification on right so let me give
this a whirl here and i'll talk through
this i didn't didn't hear it so here's
this here's what this looks like and the
first thing i mentioned so its location
notifier and i'll show you really
here in a moment so what I'm going to do
first is put in an md n so a mobile
device number I'll put it in and I'm
going to validate this so that i can get
permissions to do things with this phone
and again for tests bone so go and
valleyhu the carrier is and then it's
going to send a pin and if you notice
will send and again the way we did this
is a five digit number that comes up on
the web app so this is assuming i'm
sitting here with my phone so here's my
phone says oh verify your mdn with that
five digit pin you got so on the phone I
type in that pin I send that back in and
when that comes back into the web
application then we know that I actually
had that device and it's validated so
that's part so we now that we have it
let's go locate that phone that we just
added so again this is very similar to
what we saw before locate it mash it up
on a map when i did this i was in
beautiful colorado springs that's where
I'm from and so that's where that map is
from so now I can go in and set up a
notification so this first thing the
monitor is the phone that I'm going to
track i called this one Bob track i'm
going to put in the mobile device number
for that and then this is to be messaged
back to say who you're tracking so i put
in who the tracking person this is me
and it's going to go to my other mobile
phone and then i can set up some
criteria so this 1 i'm going to set up
for 30 minutes and i'm going to leave
the default to say here's a point radius
let me know when someone comes in and
breaks that geo fence so send me a
notification so now i have this and here
i'm going to validate with the end user
that I can do this tracking so I don't
know about you but I would like to know
if someone is going to be tracking me so
this is a thing where on the mobile
device again it says dr. Paul's using
location notifier and wants me notifying
your location and you can allow or deny
you'll see I put a cone here because
we're reusing shortcodes but again this
is a mobile originated so once i opted
in for this so we'll go ahead and put
the allowed code in and that allow me to
go ahead and start a notification for
this so once i start a notification here
it is and so now it's running so now
it's going to periodically track me and
so here's what it looks like and what
we've done in there to help do this as a
simulation so instead of having to drive
around and do this here's a simulation
where you can just move the phone you
can resize the the accuracy you know
that you're in and it'll trigger and
keep locating you all right i'm going to
show you a real example this later so
you go on and you kind of move around on
your map so you can kind of test the
behavior
and eventually it's going to come in and
it's going to send a thing a message in
and this is my other phone where it says
here's the the notification to Bob track
and it sent me that a latitude and
longitude so now I know that they're
here and I know they'd broken the
geofence so here's what it looks like
and then one last thing about it is all
the events that happen so when here you
see the application Senate consent it
got a consent received it they that if
they accepted it and then it goes
through and periodically tracks you so
it's like a periodic notification and
then the stuff in purple is all the
simulation and once you break the
geofence it lets you know right so
that's just a quick way of looking at
what that looks like and let me show you
a real one so what I did is before I
came out here on let's see when when was
it sunday so I came out sunday so um I'm
Saturday night before I went to bed I
set up a little and notification and I
had the grand idea since I was going to
be up very early that I would go ahead
and and and do one of these when I
arrived so down here you see the map of
beautiful San Francisco and so what I
want to do is I want to go into the
history and go ahead and load the
history of this event and I'll map it
let me get my map here so what we see
here is I set up this notification you
can see up here where I opted in and
what I did was there early in airport it
was 456 am in Colorado I started this
and turned my phone off so it didn't
locate me while I was flying because the
TSA or the whoever descent have my phone
on and then once I turned my phone on
you'll see all the successful location
request so it did location I wandered
around in and out of the fence and so
really what happened here is it tracked
me somewhere near the airport it got me
again part way here i took the bart of
course because it's a cool way to go and
then when i had this point radius was
the hotel that isn't right here but it's
kind of in the area and so when I broke
that geofence I got a notification on my
phone so again this is just another
example of an a web application that was
built with network API using things like
oak location carry property seems like
that all right any questions or comments
on
one all right how am i doing on time is
the next thing yes sir far away uh how
did I set the radius of the geofence let
me go to that okay right here so in here
I could say entering so yep that's
entering I could say the distance is
2,000 meters right there and then a
latitude longitude so yes sir anyway
complex a flux that you want to treat a
lot of city or state that is the circle
okay so that's a great question he said
is there a way to outline a shape other
than a circle so I wish I had my math
major friends here there's probably a
way but I don't know how to do it so for
these things that I'm going to ponder
that one right so for a pointer rate is
certainly using math there's there's
probably way to do it it's just not
something totally done alright so great
questions about that yes so the question
is is there any geographic information
about the user without the user oft
again I'm aware of but not directly
involved in some things in fact I saw an
announcement today from our proximity
marketing or there's a marketing group
that has anonymized data so for like
advertising you might have said how many
you know people between you know males
between ages of 18 and 24 or in this
area there is ways to get that it's not
there today there's not an API exposed
what we're talking those people so there
are ways to get what I'll call
anonymized data but today it's not as
easy as just sparking up a REST API but
I hope it is someday right so I'll take
that as a as a as a kind of what to do
that we should expose that kind of
information that aren't your question
right yes ah
so so that's a great use case and
there's probably ways to do that when i
actually get to one of these proximity
demos that that's very nice that's the
question is you know knowing about a
country or being able to have that kind
of geographic information and I think
that's hugely valuable and I think
that's great right so that should be
something where we don't have to tell
the person where they are but you can
say they're in this country so not
available today but that's again that's
right along the theme of I'll called
obvious gated location right or good
enough location so that great put that
on that the requirement list other
questions okay so great question so it
was the the the question was how
accurate is the information now if you
remember I went back to the get location
and I I requested my request accuracy is
this big number right 65 536 right so I
just basically said I want a coarse
grain location and so what this is doing
is going to the network and in our case
and Verizon its cell sector right and
the accuracy is what it's found my
accuracy of this device here inside it's
within that's 1693 meters so that's
coarse grain right now if you were to
ask for a fine grain location and it was
to get a GPS fix that's that's possible
as well what I'm highlighting here is
that the network based information
because certainly you can go and query
the device and get it from the device or
the device knows it itself but those
things take battery power you know and
things like that this is from the
network so here's again how accurate is
it kind of depends on the cell sector
but this one's you know less than 2,000
meters and for the banking and I'm going
to talk about kind of banking type
example got a couple use cases where
that's good not right in fact i'll just
mention one of the use cases now is this
is great that and people are doing is
today is if I'm a financial institution
now I'm off say I'm a credit card
company and so I mentioned I'm from
Colorado Springs and I come out here and
I you know swipe my credit card my
credit card company might say hey this
guy from Colorado somebody just swiped
his credit card in San Francisco let me
check of his mobile phone
is within 2,000 meters of that point of
sale that'd be a pretty useful piece of
information perhaps for fraud prevention
right so that might be a use case we're
good enough this might be good enough
right so they know now I don't know
about you guys typically my credit card
my phone are within a few meters of each
other probably all the time right so
that's a use case in the financial
industry that might be useful and coarse
grain is again good enough but fine
grain if that's what you need that you
can get that as well alright so let me
move on i would do one more of these
type of demos a proximity demo so let me
do this and then i'll explain what i'm
doing here so again I mentioned a theme
of good enough location oh let's see is
this my yeah so let me do this proximity
one alright and I'll explain what I got
here so i think i put in the Fisherman's
Wharf again so when I do this I should
get back a map in some information about
the proximity and this again is another
just web app running in the cloud
assuming a demo gods are working for me
today and so here it is alright so let's
look at the map for so again this is a
coarse-grained location that they the
icon of the phone is me and the icon out
at Fisherman's Wharf is the point in
radius and I just said within 2,000
meters so here's an example of good
enough and what we've done with this
proximity demo this let me first go
through what's returned here now I
mentioned that what we might want to do
is just return the amount of information
the application needs so here's an
example we again this may be in a
country or something but you could say
how confident are we that this device is
within this proximity of a point right
and so here there's a ten percent
confidence that I'm within 2,000 meters
of Fisherman's Wharf right so that might
be all the application needs to know and
of course if the applications as well I
want to know you know I want him to be
inside this so I could have a bigger
number but again with this proximity
type of thing is if they were within
that
you could say yep there I'm you know
ninety percent confident there within
that and you don't have to tell them
where they are so right here I happen to
be well I guess directly south of this
but do I think one of the beauties of
this is you could say yeah this person
is nearby but I'm not going to tell you
where they are right so if you think
about that a little weird but that has
some pretty useful things now as a user
I let me back up to the story so I've
got kids and I occasionally torture them
by showing him this stuff and when I
show him location stuff I get the word
is creepy they go dad that's creepy now
I was doing some precise location and I
was getting like two meter fixes and it
could tell what side of the sidewalk i
did a periodic walking the dog and we
looked at all of this they go that's
creepy so this is supposed to swage the
creepiness of it so I could say yeah
they're they're nearby but I'm not going
to tell you where they're at so let me
go through some of the other things so
this is a composite service that uses a
bunch of api's so the confidence is
really the main return here i want to
mention obviously we used you know
carrier properties we know with the
devices we know it's reachable we have
the requested latitude longitude and
then if we want to know the distance
apart you know how far are they apart
things like that but again this could
all be masked if the application only
wanted to know a confidence that you're
within a proximity that would be a cool
thing to know so any questions or
comments about this yes sir that's what
this is so could we do it by that yet is
yep exactly and I suppose them the
converse is if you wanted a smaller
circle around the phone the bottom you
could use a precise location so you can
mix and match these but I'm a big fan if
you know just using the network location
because it's a quick and easy all right
so that is that now let me go back to my
slide deck here for a moment and then
we'll do a couple more demos okay so we
talked about location notifier oh yeah
some Java code for the location notifier
so here's some code for processing a
mobile originated SMS so you think about
that that asked right I want to ask you
to opt in so the location notifier i
said this creepy dude wants to track you
so you when you opt in what might you do
with that so the way this Java code is
it passes in a correlator string that
tells you the user
the type of pin and the pin and again
example I use there was a five digit
number it could be whatever happens to
be if if it comes back from that if the
mobile originated response isn't allow
we go ahead and let the notification
start in the case of the location notify
our demo and then a deny you go ahead
and update the state say you know you
can't do this and then importantly you
noticed in the location notifier is all
about history so you may want to
maintain that history you know when they
opted in all the different location
fixes things like that so I should have
talked about that when I did location
here's a piece of Java code for the
proximity so here's for the math majors
okay so what this is it uses an
interesting formula so when you're
calculating this you have to take into
account the curvature of the earth all
right so I'm showing a map it's you know
just showing it this way but of course
its curvature earth and there's a very
interesting formula called the hammer
sign formula and it's great circle
distances between two points on a sphere
using latitude and longitude so there
you go if you haven't learned anything
you learned at this is if there's a cool
math function you could do to to
determine that distance between two
points on a globe alright so I'm
switching gears a little bit who gave
all the love to location going to go
back to messaging real quick so when you
came in when you guys came in early I
add a picture stream running and we
actually had this this kind of problem
where you know the messaging API is
weren't getting any love so the real
truth of this is we just you know
dreamed up a use case for this we happen
to be going to the consumer electronics
show so we thought let's make an
application where we're running a big
display in the booth and people can go
take a picture with their mobile send it
with an mms up into a cloud app and then
we'll display it on the big screen right
all sounds good yes sir question yeah
this guy this code is running in fact
all the demonstrations I've showed you
are running in a web app and cloud
that's correct so this was in the
proximity demo the last demo it's
implementing this you know Gary because
my local yes you would point it at the
remember i mentioned that service
exposure the OC SG so that's the cervix
exposure point so you when you on board
for the verizon developer community we
hand you some credentials you
authenticate it to it you send your
question great questions yes sir that is
crack okay so that that's a great
question so in that I think that that's
a use case so in it there's an account
owner so I know got kids I'm account
owner they have phones for the account
owner could go into my verizon portal
and on their on their behalf of the
people within your account you can opt
them in so if you're going to be all use
might I'm going to be a creepy dad and
I'm going to track my kids because I
know freaks them out I have the ability
through the my grass and portal 2 on
their behalf and it's only because I'm
account holder happened to be the due to
pays the bills as well right yeah yeah
so you know so that in that context that
that's a legitimate a legitimate one all
right so getting close to finishing up
here so I mentioned oh yeah questions
yeah I yeah so that's a great question
so he's asking about more metadata about
that location so today you can do that
by finding location by by some other
third-party things so if you go to
google maps you can actually kind of see
what's around so i would suggest that
you probably don't need verizon do
anything for you in your app you can
match that up so once you have the
location and in you know latitude
longitude there's other web services you
could probably leverage mapping services
that you could find things around that
so for doing things like offers I think
that would be a wonderful thing one of
the use cases I hear that you know set a
geofence when you enter the geofence at
the store send me a coupon to my mobile
device that I mean that's something i
would use that'd be awesome right so
yeah that that kind of stuff those are
great use cases alright so back trying
to give give messaging some luck in back
to the CES show before putting an image
that somebody sends an mms we inserted a
step to do real-time content approval
right so that seemed like a good idea on
public display i can show you a little
bit about what that looks like in fact
let me do that so i'm going to show you
how let me do that let me go to my
android phone alright so what i'm going
to do is if cut this phone here come
back to this let me show you so I'll
show this picture stream later so we add
this is the real time content approval
and this is the mobile at peace so that
was anything so we I'm here you'll
notice that there's pictures that you
take when you're at javaone there's one
in here oh yeah so here I like this one
Masonic symbol that that Masonic place
we saw that like Java keynotes and so I
go ahead and send it in so what this is
is that real time content approval piece
right so that's relatively interesting
and I'll show you that I was taking
pictures of last session Hugh's not
paying attention Hugh there you are so
you made the big screen so there's my
colleague all right so so that's that's
the content approval now I'm going to
kind of switch gears a little bit here
back to the location stuff so you notice
i have an application called reporter so
I was part of this application for doing
the picture stuff what we've done is
added some location features so here is
again using coarse location and here's
my location on here and this is subtle
try to bear with me on here so I can
look at it in a map view or satellite
view and this is pretty good this is
essentially looking around this is where
I'm at I'll go back here to the
satellite view so this is a feature we
like to call location tuning so this
says where I am so this could be for
good or for evil this could be for
making more
or less accurate this would have been
good in the moscone if I was buried deep
in the bowels of moscone center and you
know I wasn't using Wi-Fi I just had
this wall he's kind of here I could say
well you know where I really am is I'm
sorry it gets its refining it's fixed
and I'll be able to set a point and say
that's where I really am so if say I
friends and they're meeting me and I
know then and it's cool i might say i'll
tune my location tell you exactly where
I am now I'll let you use your own
imagination what if there's a case where
this is kind of saying where I am and I
don't want to tell them we're out in
fact I want to say kind of I want to
obfuscate it and the old I was thinking
about this last night one example could
be one of the guys had a session about
Eddie harmony and all these dating sites
so say and this isn't me because I'm
going to alter the spot and say I'm
meeting someone for the first time and I
say you know i'll meet you at this
coffee shop right and so perhaps i might
what I might want to do is you know say
I'll tell the mammoth the coffee shop
and I'll be you know across the street
watching them so i may say you know what
where I really am is up here right so
again if nothing else is a little
different spin on it and again use for
good but being able to tune your
location and to say where you are either
to make it more accurate perhaps less
accurate go ahead excellent question so
the question is if you opt-in do you
opt-in for all these applications or as
a for a specific one it's per
application right so i use the the
location notifier that's one or you know
the geo friend that it's only that app
and in fact if you sign up for a lot of
them and you know to my verizon portal
you'll see each one listed you can turn
them on or off but perhaps oh that's
really important good question thank you
yes sir so that that's a great question
so the question is / requester that is a
work in progress and that's something
we've wanted to do for a long long time
in fact one of the things the
I'm not really going to talk a lot about
is 0 often we're looking at as a
possible solution for that so so let's
kind of dive into that because that's a
great use case right now it's the friend
finder wants to locate me so anyone
who's running friend finder could locate
well really I want to know it's Q using
the friend finder app is trying to
locate me so we're not there yet but
that's wit that's where we want to go we
want that fine grain level of control
that's a work in progress and I think
that's certainly for the creepy factor
you know it's not only the Sabbats who
would that app right so yeah that's when
my kids would want to know which one of
their crazy friends want to locate him
any other questions yes sir so the
permissions for the typical opt-in I
showed you the SMS opt-in and today for
location I could have picked one of your
phones today it's allow always allow
never or allow for 24 hours now that's
from the SMS up and so so those ones i
mean the 24 hours great like the pizza
guy say you know i'm going to be
somewhere in san francisco the pizza guy
you can locate me those are the options
today our infrastructure underlying that
can can do much more fine-grained than
that but for the SMS again how many
characters do you have an SMS that's
just simple so today those are the
options but it's certainly extensible
yes sir so there is what is that called
there is an application that is built
potentially balai i'm aware of a verizon
application that an account for life me
remember the name of it that did yeah i
think there's something like that i I'm
not Leesie navigator thank you that is
the application I I own three beers now
yeah so these navigator that's a charge
for application yep all rights um let's
see the location dip this is using
network api's and again with the network
api business policy you get so many for
free and then you
for some so eventually right we're going
to want to make some money on it but
it's it you know maybe a penny or
something it's not 55 bucks all right
yes sir okay so the question a great
question how often is the data updated
so if someone changes their device now
I've done this before when I bust a
phone and I'll go back and take my
oldest phone and activate it so when
that activation happens so you don't
care about this but under the covers in
our IT systems we say oh you know this
particular mdn is now associated with
not destroyed charged with that Galaxy
Nexus that gets it's in there it's it's
updated at some pretty you know I would
suspect a minute later I had not having
test this but it's it's near real time
right because again we use that that
data for that device we use it for lots
of lots of other stuff and when we go
read that data it's it's pretty you know
pretty near real-time don't know exactly
but I think you can count on it being up
to date all right yes sir question great
question so request so the mom let me do
this I'm happy I'm Paul Dutch Schultz
verizon calm you can send them me
there's the verizon developer community
but yeah they're question is are we
taking requests that's one of the things
why we like to socialize this and we'd
like to hear that because again you guys
are the innovators if there's things
that we have that would make your job
better let us know about we're
absolutely taking that feedback that
helps that you know again I'm in this
gig I'm enthusiastic about it I'm
passionate about doing this because
exposing stuff that you guys can
innovate on you know used to be the
carriers build all the stuff ourselves
like VZ navigator now it's let all you
creative guys at it so yeah that a
crowdsource and stuff great idea I like
the way you're thinking but but please
do please do tell us those those types
of ideas I got the without warning by
the hook i think i'm going to have to
get the enforcer stopped in and told me
I gotta quit exactly on time
I got three minutes with that I want to
