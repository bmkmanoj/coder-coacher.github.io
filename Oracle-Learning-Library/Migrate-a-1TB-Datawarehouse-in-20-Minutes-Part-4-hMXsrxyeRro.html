performance video series this is part 4
of my great a one terabyte data
warehouse in under 20 minutes with
Andrew holdsworth senior director of the
real world performance team the next
thing we want to really show is this is
the interesting part of the data
warehouse the business end of thing
let's run queries because this is after
all why we build a data warehouse we
want to run queries so we can make
decisions and it's such a shame actually
that so many data warehouses people get
bogged down in this the maintenance of
the data and they forget about the
importance of the data warehouse which
is to run queries so and as we increase
the power associated with any database
environment of course we can solve ever
increasingly more complicated queries
and business users will demand this
office for our first example I'd like to
sort of ask the most impossible well not
the most impossible question but a
difficult query you know and let's think
about this as we talk our way through it
how would you formulate the sequel what
were the most popular items in the
baskets of shoppers who visited stores
in California in the first week of May
and they didn't buy bananas you can see
very quickly that becomes a list
processing query and that's something
that the Oracle Exadata machine is
extremely good at doing so let's have a
look at the query and you can see that
we've used the with clause to break it
up into query blocks to make clarity of
reading a lot easier and so you can
understand what the query is doing but
remember the goal was to find all all
those guys who didn't buy bananas so the
first part of the query is to do a for
table join to find all the transactions
of people who did buy bananas the second
block of the query is a to table joined
to find all the transactions in that
time period then the final part is to
join the two sets together with an outer
join and effectively look for null for
the exclusions and then rank group and
sort the results so we have a real-world
query here this is more than just
counting rows or just scanning data
we're doing joins so
it's etc and it's a real world problem
so let's go back and have a look at it
on the application let's start running
the query the query has gone in and it's
gonna we know in advance how long is
taking but you'll notice that the
database machine is busy you'll notice
all the reads from flash just then and
we're getting the the CPU busy you'll
notice that a lot of the reads are
slowing down as we get past the data
acquisition phase of the query and now
we're moving into the join and sort
phase which is making the CPU busy on
the top and you can see after 23 seconds
we've got the results to the query now
that query in fact hits about half a
terabyte of data and again it was a
multi table join hitting half a terabyte
of data all I ask you is yourself go
think how long would that take that
query take to run in your own
environments and please note we haven't
yet built any indexes any aggregates the
only thing we've done is compress the
data and partition the data can the next
thing that people usually ask us about
so having completed one query in a very
impressive time which would have made
the analysts extremely happy to get
results back in under 30 seconds and
being able to segment an entire portion
of their customer base well mostly we
have multiple users and one of the
challenges we have is setting up a
database machine to effectively use the
whole database machine effectively and
this has become particularly important
as we have multiple users using the same
machine unfortunately out of the box the
settings on the database machine are not
perfect to ensure uniform response time
if we have a total of twelve queries
all's being 12 users all hitting the
buttons simultaneously and in fact we
were to do that we'd get a distribution
of response times as we scroll as each
user goes off and what is actually
happening is the amount of parallelism
being given to each query is being
reduced as each user comes in and so in
many cases people complain about an
inconsistent response time
so a lot of dbas are very heads-up about
this and what they do is they start
tuning and the degrees of parallelism
and and backing off the degree of
parallelism such that at her worst case
12 users will at least get a consistent
response time so that's what we're going
to simulate right now so I'm going to
put in twelve users running a very
similar query to the one we ran before
but on a reduced time amount so we can
get them all to finish within the scope
of the demo and you can see the queries
rolling in very quickly and we making
the database machine again extremely
busy it's all looking under control so
the DBA has done a really good job you
can see that no memory is running out
the machine is behaving extremely well
and with that in mind you can now see
the queries are popping out after in
relatively consistent time we've got 24
27 26 29 29 the response name time in
perception of a human is relatively
consistent okay however what happens if
12 users don't all press the enter
button at the same time let's talk about
another way of doing what happens if
only three guys or four guys actually
decide to run queries at the same time
it would seem an awful shame to
basically detune their queries giving
them reduced degrees of parallelism so
they're deprived are getting faster
results so what I'd like to introduce is
this concept of query queuing so in this
case what we're going to do is we're
going to use the resource managers to
ensure that only for queries run
simultaneously and then the fifth and
subsequent queries are effectively
queued and waiting for the other queries
to finish so let's initiate that and see
what happens that so the queries are
going in the first thing you'll notice
very quickly again is we've made the
machine nice and busy but we're now
starting to see queries five six seven
eight nine starting to queue but the
thing to notice is because we're using a
higher degree of parallelism and a more
optimal degree of parallelism
those first four queries came out
extremely quickly making 10 seconds
you'll notice that the key we now
subsequent queries that were queued for
a little while are just taking a little
bit longer so we have in the case one
we've got one running for 11 seconds but
queued for seven seconds and you can see
there's effectively a step function
thing to notice however we got through
those 12 queries faster than when we had
a DQ detuned degree of parallelism
associated with it so one of the best
ways to have a look at that let's go
back and have a look at the graphs here
we are you can see the DBA restricting
the DOP all relatively uniform is here
we are with query queuing coming in and
you'll notice there's like a step
function in the query results okay some
guys are coming in a lot quicker but
what will notice is that the total
elapsed time was quicker and if we
express this in a tabular form the thing
to note is that basically the query
queuing and effectively gives a better
average response time and this is
literally because we're setting up the
machine to be optimal for pushing the
queries through the system the fixed do
p is a better result than the
out-of-the-box settings but you can see
very quickly using query queuing we can
get optimal performance the other thing
to note about this is that the system
run extremely stable e with the latter
two however imagine if we put query
users 12 we put 13 and then 24 query
users you could rapidly see that we
would start to degenerate the whole
system for the out of the box and the
fix do p but with query queuing you're
keeping the system safe so what I'd like
to do is we finish up is move back to
the demo again and put in the order of
200 queries into the system very quickly
and again you'll notice we're making the
Machine again extremely busy and queries
are getting cute as we go through but
the thing to note is that the machine is
remarkably stable this is how dba's
sleep at night they're not going to run
or have Runaways and things going wrong
in the
the night this machine is extremely
predictable and well behaved we're
running at about sixty to seventy
percent in userspace perhaps a little
higher a little bit ten percent in
system time and you can see that the
machine is incredibly stable and very
safe to live with perhaps if we go back
and have a look at the enterprise
manager screen what we've just
demonstrated you can see the whole demo
that we've put together you can see the
data load you can see counting the rose
the statistics all the transformation
activities the last thing to note is you
notice is the various groups have uses
the humps towards the end this as this
is the last part of the of the demo with
three sections we've effectively loaded
one terabyte and had it ready to go in
20 minutes so let's just break out the
time and gives you an indication where
we spent the time you can see that the
initial one terabyte load took the most
time and pretty much everything else was
very in short duration so we turned
about fifty percent of the time doing
the data load from so let's just pan
back to enterprise manager such that as
we finalize the demo you'll notice and
the last set of queries of the 200
queries I've put in the cpu load is
quite considerable in fact you know the
number of processes sitting on cpu load
is higher than the number of cores but
what we haven't done is deliberately
overload the system so that there is
some query queuing and this can be told
by looking for the scheduler weights if
I slide the mouse over the scheduler
wage you'll see a band of yellow okay
and effectively that band of yellow is
telling us that we're doing query
queuing now conclusion to learn from
this is one that you're doing query
queuing but the the thing other thing is
to also learn that this is an extremely
positive thing because you're keeping
the system stable but it also gives you
an indication if you've done your
homework correctly and all the queries
are running optimally the system is
fully utilized and you're starting to
queue queries and you're seeing that
you're queuing queries for a
considerable length of the time this
will be an indication that perhaps it's
time for system upgrade or system
expansion
