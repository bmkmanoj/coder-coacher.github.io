automatically determines whether the
request is auto approved or needs
sequential or parallel approval the
decision task flow element defines when
this automation occurs in the process
flow a decision contains a set of
related business rules which describe
business policies or key decisions such
as spending policies and approval
matrixes or constraints such as valid
configurations or regulatory
requirements for example a business rule
within the decision for a car rental
company might specify that if the
drivers age is less than 25 years the
application should be denied you can
also use decisions to set computations
such as discounts or premiums for
example if the amount of a customer's
annual purchases at a department store
exceeds $5,000 and the customers
membership status is gold the customer
will enjoy thirty percent off for all
the orders for the next year in process
cloud service decisions are separated
from processes and procedural flows
which makes them easier to access modify
and reuse you associate a decision with
a process through the implementation of
the decision task flow element decisions
have input data objects and output data
objects input data objects define what
conditions will be used as the basis for
a decision for example the age of an
applicant the total annual spending of a
customer or a membership status output
data objects define what actions will be
taken based on the decision for example
a loan application may be approved or
denied or a certain discount will be
issued in decisions value sets constrain
possible values and range value sets
simplify numeric range representations
for example you can group the total
annual spending of a customer into three
ranges
less than three thousand dollars between
three thousand and five thousand dollars
and more than five thousand dollars you
can assign short names to value set
values or ranges for efficiency and
convenience a rule is a logical
statement that defines one possible
outcome of a decision if conditions are
relatively simple and independent you
can use general if then rules for
example if the applicants age is 25 or
older then the request is approved if
there are multiple related conditions
and actions a decision table may be
easier to work with a decision table
evaluates the set of conditions for
example different combinations of
spending and membership levels and each
rule has an associated action as a best
practice use global variables in
business rules instead of literal values
global variables or Global's let you
change values in rule without editing
rule logic for example if you define a
global for the age threshold you can
change the age value without changing
the if-then rule itself you just change
the value of the global for details on
