calculated measures and add an
aggregation level to one of the measures
which sets the grain for the measure
start by locking the data model a
calculated measure is a column that is
derived from other measures and created
by using formulas it can be either pre
aggregated or post aggregated a pre
aggregated measure is aggregated in the
database source table a post aggregated
measure is aggregated at run time I also
want to show you how to create an
expression that combines columns to
create a single column in a dimension
table this is called a derived attribute
create a calculated measure for average
order size and open the revenue metrics
facts table name the new column and
except before calculating because this
column is already aggregated use the
expression editor to create the
calculation for average order size
double click a column to add it to the
expression average order size is added
as a pre aggregated expression create a
second calculated item for average unit
price copy the column and then select
after calculating to create a post
aggregated measure edit the revenue
column and add an aggregation level for
the revenue measure to set the grain for
the line of business within products by
quarters select the levels tab to adjust
the grain use the slider for products
and drag it from detail to line of
business
change the grain for time to next create
a derived attribute sometimes you may
want to see columns combined in your
reports and on your dashboards you can
add a column and then use the concat
function to do this
the concat function enables you to
concatenate or put two arguments
together you'll want this column to be
legible so add spaces and a dash in the
expression between the region and area
columns then make sure the expression
validates successfully now that you've
added the derived attribute which
concatenates the region in area columns
make the individual columns unavailable
these two columns won't be visible in
the subject area when creating reports
validate and publish the model to begin
using the new columns the final step is
to create a data visualization project
to view the new columns select a subject
area as the datasource expand the
appropriate folders and then select
multiple columns by using the ctrl key
and drag them to the canvas in this
video I showed you how to create two
types of calculated measures change
aggregation levels and add a derived
attribute to learn more visit us online
