going to look into Oracle cloud
infrastructure at a very high level
our vision is that Oracle cloud
infrastructure is the foundation on
which our core infrastructure platform
and SAS services will run in short
Oracle cloud infrastructure is the very
foundation of Oracle cloud platform as
you can see here on this slide Oracle
cloud infrastructure is optimized to run
Oracle database and applications but it
is also an open platform with a broad
ecosystem that supports third party
applications tools and frameworks also
customers who want to run these exact
same services behind a corporate
firewall can leverage cloud add customer
which has symmetry with Oracle cloud
infrastructure let me start by a quick
recap of our core concepts we operate in
regions a region is a metropolitan area
inside the region's we have multiple
data centers that are called
availability domains each region
consists of at least three availability
domains these are isolated from each
other and all your resources like
compute and database go inside and
availability domain availability domains
are wired together over private dark
fiber and there is very little latency
between ATS which makes it a perfect fit
for a high availability primitive and
also for replication of data we have a
dedicated backbone connecting these EDS
and the backbone plugs into the edge or
peering points of presence where
customers can get direct connections
into our network again as I said in the
previous slide regions are constructed
of isolated fault domains you can see
some latency numbers here the
the tune of less than 500 microseconds
one-way latency between 80s and this
enables zero loss data loss
architectures like Oracle maa and other
scale-out architectures inside of these
80s we have built one of the best public
cloud networks what I mean is that the
public cloud network we have built is
big flat and fast you can see some
numbers there our public cloud networks
runs at a very high scale to the tune of
more than a million Network ports per
availability domain by flat I mean that
our network is not oversubscribed so we
get tremendously good latency and fast
means that we we support 25 Gbps network
bandwidth between hosts and each of our
bare metal hosts has two network
interfaces so you get basically two
connections with 25 Gbps bandwidth we
have made some drastic changes into how
virtual networking is done with Oracle
cloud infrastructure we call this
capability off box network
virtualization as the name implies we
pulled all the virtualization out into
the network including the storage and
network i/o virtualization generally
this enables the next layer up so we can
take any physical form factor and plug
back into our virtual network this is
the basis that lets us do bare metal and
engineered systems like Excel EDA
and plug it into this environment
without making any changes
it is massive enabler for us to deliver
the classes of services and meet our
goals around performance and security so
this is what the fully integrated
picture looks like starting with the
region at the bottom made up of isolated
four domains called a DS then we have
the physical Network we have the virtual
network
and on top of that we have the largest
class of compute and storage options
plugged into a highly differentiated
virtualized environment built using off
box network virtualization and if we
bundle that with the backbone network
this is what the picture looks like okay
now let's talk about the various
services we have running on the platform
today now these are the classes of
services and in a particular service you
might have several other services which
which make up that service for example
networking so let's start with the
services which are available on the
platform Identity and Access Management
service helps you set up administrators
users and groups and specify their
permissions as to what they can do in
the club audit service helps you track
activity in your environment networking
services helps you set up
software-defined versions of a
traditional physical network compute
service as the name implies helps you
provision and manage compute instances
block storage service which goes with
with the compute service helps you
dynamically provision and manage block
storage volumes which have been you
which are used by the compute instances
object storage service helps you manage
data as objects that are accessed over
the Internet
load balancing service helps to create a
load balancer within your virtual
network which you could do for
scalability or high availability and
finally the database service helps you
provision and manage Oracle databases so
these are the the classes of services we
have existing on the platform today and
we are launching many new services at a
very fast cadence so what are the core
themes of Oracle cloud infrastructure
there are three core themes of OSI I
lift and shift infrastructure heavy and
cloud native workloads for lift and
shift Oracle cloud infrastructure is the
best play
to run Oracle's workloads and customers
can bring in their Oracle apps like EBS
and run them on on on OCI we also want
to make a CI the best place to run non
Oracle workloads like SE p our second
core team is infrastructure heavy
workloads that requires very high scale
and high performance
these are workloads like HPC and big
data workloads the final core team for
us is around cloud native workloads
where customers can write modern
applications using open source DevOps
tools like tena farm and run these apps
on OCA there are two main areas where we
differentiate the first is the support
for Oracle apps and Enterprise is
architecture and the second one is
industry-leading price performance let's
look into each of them we are the Oracle
cloud infrastructure is the best
platform for running Oracle database and
key Enterprise Oracle apps we are the
only cloud that supports bare-metal
services and where VMs and bare-metal
services have the same set of AP Ed's
also our network is highly
differentiated as we talked about in the
previous slide we have a fundamentally
different approach to networking through
off box network virtualization and as I
said our network is big flat and fast as
a result you can get tremendous
throughput and low latency we also have
a unique approach to security and
governance through the use of
compartments which we will talk about in
the later modules second we are the
industry-leading price performance
vendor our compute storage and network
costs are all lower than AWS and you can
see some some numbers there to recap
in this lecture we looked at Oracle
cloud infrastructure from at a very high
level went through some of the core
concepts however data centers are
structured and and look at the
fundamental code set of services in the
next eight modules we will cover these
core OCI services starting with identity
access management networking compute a
different class of storage services
database and DNS that's all for this
lecture in the next lecture we will look
into the eye into the identity and
access management service if you have
time please join me in the next lecture
