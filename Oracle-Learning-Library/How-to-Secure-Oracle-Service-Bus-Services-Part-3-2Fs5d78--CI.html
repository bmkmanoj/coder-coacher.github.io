curriculum developer here at Oracle in
this demonstration I'll be showing you
how to secure Oracle service bus
services this is the third part in a
three-part series on Oracle service bus
security is the setup for this
demonstration in the previous
demonstration in the series you saw how
to configure the keystore create a
credential key for Joe and secure the
proxy service with the OWS M username
token service policy in this
demonstration we're going to attach the
sam'l client policy to the credit-card
validation business servers and then
attach the sam'l service policy to the
credit card validation so a composite so
let's get started in the service bus
console we'll create a new session and
we'll edit the validation for CC
business servers to add a policy we'll
go to this policies page and we're going
to use the policy from the ows in policy
stores so we'll select that and let's
click Add here you see all the policies
that we can add from OWS M let's go to
the page that has our policy on and
we're going to choose this Sam or token
client policy and submit and now we can
see it listed as a service level policy
so let's update and we can see that the
service was updated successfully and
that the web service security
configuration has been reset to the
changes in the security policies
so let's activate our changes and enter
a description and submit so we've
attached security policies to the proxy
service and business service our next
task is to secure the credit card
validation endpoint service that's
deployed to the WebLogic server will do
that
by attaching the sam'l service owsn
policy to the so accomplish a credit
card validation service we need to
perform this an Enterprise Manager so
here we'll expand solar solar infra
default and go to the home page for the
validation for CC composite like we did
in the service bus console we'll go to
the policies page and you can see that
there are no policies attached first we
need to specify what to attach the
policy to so we'll click this attach to
drop down and select this get status by
CC service let's move this window over
and we'll scroll down to find the policy
that we want and we want to attach the
sam'l token Service policy so we'll
select it and click attach now you see
it here under the directly attached
policies so let's click OK and you can
now see it's attached here now we're
done so let's test our security setup
we'll open the test console for the
validation for CC proxy service let's
move this window up and we'll enter a
valid credit card number
now let's scroll down and then the
security section you can see the policy
we've attached the username token client
policy and we're going to override this
with the credential key that we
previously created for job and let's
execute it and we'll scroll down to look
at the response and here you can see a
valid response which indicates that the
service was successfully invoked using
the sam'l identity propagation so that's
it for securing service bus services
