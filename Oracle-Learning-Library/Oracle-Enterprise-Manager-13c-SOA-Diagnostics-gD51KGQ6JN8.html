so our management using Enterprise
Manager today we are going to see how
Enterprise Manager 13c helps
administrators diagnose their to day
issues using integrated deep diagnostic
capabilities within Enterprise Manager
Enterprise Manager 13c integrates
diagnostic capabilities at various
levels it integrates with incident
manager to receive alerts notifications
and to create incidents for warning or
critical conditions log analytics to
slice our dice log output and group them
using ECI D theta D message ID our
search custom strings to bring some
meaningful value jaebeum diagnostic to
analyze JVM level performance assess
workload and perform live threat
analysis lob is diagnostic to understand
dehydration's top performance and
analysis database deadlocks and finally
configuration comparison utility to
compare configuration of two different
instances we will see how administrator
uses all these features to analyze
day-to-day issues we will take an
example and try to drill down using each
of these diagnostic tools so recently I
her as an administrator I have received
many times complaint from my IT
department about very slow performance
of a composite we are going to see today
how am I going to analyze this slow
performance of the composite using
Enterprise Manager
the threading seen as an administrator
first thing I would like to see in the
morning is how my entire so ah or
middleware state is looking like what
are all domains are running ok what our
domains are showing issues so I log into
Enterprise Manager
as soon as I log into enterprise manager
I see middleware targets page where I
see my entire middleware estate here I
see the list of all my domains running
in the organization however a scrolling
through so many targets is very tedious
so I want to have some crisp view of my
entire estate which can give me briefly
the idea about the status of all
instances so I go to heat map tab on a
heat map tab I see all my domains and
their status here each rectangle
indicates a domain size of the rectangle
indicates number of targets like servers
composites JVM D agents etc in a domain
color of the domain indicates status of
the domain here I have customized color
coding using customization tools on
right hand side if more than 60% of my
targets in a domain are down then domain
color is rate in more than 95% of
targets are up and running then domain
color is shown as dark green so this
single page gives me visualization of my
entire estate there are a few domains
down but I have brought them down on a
purpose so I do not see any major issues
at this level next step is to check if
there are any major incidents at
interval individual target level
so I go to incident Punisher go to
enterprise monitoring and click on
instant manager here I get a list of all
incidents generated recently I can also
search based on time period I see couple
of incidents here where I shall pay more
attention some of the targets are down
some of the targets are shown some
metric evaluation errors
and here I see multiple events which are
generated by Enterprise Manager wherein
I see some of the events are related to
bacon some of the events are related to
average incoming process signal time so
this way I can find out all my events
and incidents which I shall be more
careful about I can click on the
incident and find out more details about
a specific incident but I do not see any
major issue happening as part of
incidents at this point so now I go back
to targets page and browse to so our
infrastructure page
on soy infrastructure page I see many
details related to composites their
performance also see details about
latest incidents problems for all of
these targets on the next tab I see more
details about each composite and see if
everything is alright here I do not see
any major issue apart from these two
composites wherein validate payment
composite has a synchronous response
time of more than 5,000 milliseconds
similar is the case for pack and ship
service so I suspect that there is
something which is happening within my
system which is creating such a delay
for execution of composites now I need
to focus on analyzing why there is such
much delay on these executions I'm going
to next tab that is dehydration store
performance here now dehydration store
performance is available from integrated
DB diagnostic capabilities into
Enterprise Manager I see dehydration
store growth rate which is very normal
here this particular factor is very much
important for also administrators to
keep dehydration store working fine and
also are composites working good just
below this I see the graph indicating
number of activations and related
reasons on the right hand side so I see
that there are many accusations which
are open for the reason which is not
known and marked as other there are few
number of CPU related activations and
few number of activations are waiting
for I wait I scroll further down and I
see that there are many top sequels
which are listed as per the DB time
required for each of this equal so this
particular table indicates the slowest
sequel on the top there are
two sequels which are performing very
slow here insert into cube instance and
select see Akeem the first particular
statement is about select query and this
is not very frequently used so I'm going
to focus on the second sequel which is
about insert into cube instance which is
important for each and every composite
execution before jumping on the sequel
analysis let me see whether there is
anything wrong at JVM level I click on
integrated JVM diagnostic feature and go
to JVM Diagnostics performance page I
see here active rates by their states
JVM CPU utilization JVM heap utilization
there are top activities and top
requests which are listed on this
particular JVM diagnostic page I can't
do Java workload Explorer to see how
much is the workload on each of these
instances though there are some warnings
here indicated in the yellow I do not
see any major hurdle here creating slow
performance of composites so I go back
to my soil infrastructure dehydration
store diagnostic page since I am not
able to find any major issue in JVM
diagnostic now let me drill down into
the sequel performance so I click on
sequel ID here and once I am logged in I
see details about query execution at
database level I see some spikes in
active sessions here I select activity
tab and find that spikes in the
activations are at regular interval it
looks like that all these sessions are
open and waiting for resources as soon
as the resource is available all
sessions are closed immediately that's
exactly the problem occurs when there is
a resource contention
we are simulated resource contention
here by locking cube instance table for
few seconds
so when threats are waiting for table
access we see number of activations
increasing and as soon as access is
available we see number of activations
drastically reduced now this was about
performance issue but there can be many
other issues where Enterprise managers
log analytics will be extremely useful
let's go to log messages for so infra
and see some more details to go to law
analytics capability go to soil
infrastructure menu go to logs and view
log messages here we see by default
error messages are populated let me
change the search criteria to select
warning notifications trace and all
messages related to this particular so I
instance now I see all messages I can
now slice and dice these messages and
group them by ec ID or threat ID if I
try to group them by CID I see number of
messages or notifications for each EC ID
so those are grouped together once I
click on these notifications I'll see
all the messages for this particular EC
ID
typically if there is any exception in
the log file developers trace exceptions
by tracking EC ID and given that so
alongs generate huge number of log
messages this is extremely tedious task
Enterprise Manager provides out of box
support for slicing and dicing of all
these log messages I can even search by
custom search string last capability we
are going to see today is about
comparing configurations of different
instances so that I can find a root
cause of the issues that occur on one
environment but do not occur on other
environments I can go back to my saw
infrastructure page
doesn't go to configuration tab and
click on compare in the next screen I
select a template for comparison and I
our target to compare with
this default template indicate that
eeehm to compare all the aspects of saw
domain so we will see the huge list of
differences we can customize this
template to compare specific parameters
and also find continuous drift from
templates as soon as I click on compare
submit button
iam submits a deployment procedure and
both domains are compared and results
shown in a while as I mentioned we see
huge number of differences here which
corresponds to each of these domains
configurations so today we saw how
Enterprise Manager 13c helps
administrators in their day-to-day tasks
that can be managed effectively from
single pane of glass provided by
Enterprise Manager this concludes demo
thank you for arranging
