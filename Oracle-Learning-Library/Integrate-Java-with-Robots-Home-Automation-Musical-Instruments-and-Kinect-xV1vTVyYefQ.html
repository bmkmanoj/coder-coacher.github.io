brazilian team we are from Seoul Java
the Brazilian Java user group we are
finishing one set up here it will be one
minute more this tall kids its a mix of
you know passion java community a bit of
glassfish Arduino and lots of cool demos
just to start since we are talking about
community I just would like to know who
here is a member of a Java user group
please that's a lot that's very nice I
hope that other guys and girls join I
user group near you we have been doing
lots of things yesterday night it was a
very special moment for all the Java
user group community there are two user
groups there are part of the java
community process executive committee it
means the little group that approves are
not everything on the Java atmosphere on
the java community process and yesterday
night london java community and so Java
one the JCP member of the Year award so
it was very special for the entire
community this is a sign o of they want
us to participate more they are giving
they gave this award for the community
and I hope this next year we you and
everybody we can do even more for making
the future java together
of them cover has done
thanks
good so this talk is about integrating
Java with lots of things robots home
automation music instruments and connect
next please so just a brief introduction
of myself I am one of the founders of
global coda training company I have kind
of two thousand our 2,000 hours of
teaching experience I'm Judd leader from
Seoul Java I'm member since 2001 I am
proudly member of the java community
process an elder of several articles but
i'm not alone i am a great group so
Bruno Souza he's also participating on
this talk he's kind of hiding under the
table so he's founder of so Java in 98
yes it's a kind of old user group since
98 founder of some cool projects one of
them is tools cloud a set of tools on
the cloud story troupe so if you want to
be part of the Java starry just write
your own story at story troop telling
the story of Java it's also called as
Brazilian Java man the man with the flag
you probably saw him around this year
and the other his first Java one was in
97 is there anybody here that was here
at Java 197 good so probably saw this
crazy man with the Brazilian flag he's a
Java champion and won a Duke choice
award in some ear I think it was 2003
but it team big
we also have juggy where is juggy can
you come on dougie hey guys how are you
doing chuggy is our you know I'm the
main speaker just stop okay oh no don't
leave Jackie is our Java user group
mascot is the first open source member
of the jug the Java Finch so welcome to
jaggi what do you have to tell our
friends here in the audience so thanks
everyone that's gonna be a cool talk you
know i'm a enterprise developer so we're
going to talk to hear about you know
cool enterprise technologies like a gb
javaserver faces you struts like very
you know some new clothes Oh in korba
some very cool thing right come on
Georgie are you talking about strats why
not isn't isn't it the coolest thing a
while no they leave jiggy if you keep
talking about stress well so we're going
to talk about here Jana Oh Douggie we
are talking about integration with cool
stuff you know Java EE but Java EE not
for corporate development so this is in
korba integration no no we were talking
about integration in this case with
Bluetooth and other you know home and
robot protocols oh ok let's see what
that means welcomes Aggie I hope you
have fun in this talk i would like to
introduce also Venetia singer his member
of so Java since 2001 or more he
participated at the jsr 314 javaserver
faces we got the Duke Choice Award last
year for home automation project he is
that beans green team ja ve senior
architect and have some thousands of
hours on experience given classes do you
want to talk anything about yourself in
issues no thanks he's a demo yeah he's a
demo man and now he's praying for the
demo God so if you can send good
energies we appreciate what oh there's a
demo God right here why are you pulling
out the cables no please don't game Oh
God okay I think that's praying for the
demo gods I guess take kids I get for
you know protecting don't let him do
anything under the table but you know
Joey brought me lunch that's a banana
here finishes yes we have a banana here
Jackie we are integrating the banana
with our computer you're what we are
using the banana as a mouse jerky cool
they score by the banana Danny the
mother but now we have the internet your
things in the banana can be part of the
internet you know jerky no no internet
your things is the internet that you can
sense the things you can control the
things like our gates lamps cough
machine and robots and you can have this
control have fun ultimate eyes your
house and you can do many different
projects all using java journey not just
for corporate applications there is life
beyond database applications you know
whoa that's cool what does that mean
really oh so let me show you something
the first thing that we want you to show
you is to control turn on and turn off
labs isn't it interesting joy yeah let's
see it lets see so here we have a
project color J home automation J home
automation one the loops Choice Award
last year and with j home you can
ultimate eyes your house using a
glassfish server so you have a JD's to
control
cough machine sensors and is very funny
jerky because you know oriented object
programming ok so I like one thing you
said there is corbin in glassfish there
is karma yeah there is corbin glass dish
actually you can access the cough
machine using car but if you want juggy
oh cool if you are they sound horrible i
know it's so funny I'm not missing it I
just hate it so let me show you Georgie
how is the user interface to control the
lamp with Java that's the user interface
isn't it nice juggy let me see yeah
looks good it's good it's all java facts
here no no it's not John FX actually is
html5 pure html5 and here we have the J
home automation console and we can
control the things using this console so
let's turn on the lamp here so very fast
very simple to turn on and turn off the
lab is injury you know III got some
things in my wall that does the same
thing right yeah yeah i think they call
lamp switch but here you can turn on
your lap in your house using twitter oh
so you can tweet to your house to open a
door or you can follow your house to see
if someone is inside your home own is
stealing my house do i need to follow it
yes oh man this is very getting
complicated so i need 140 characters to
turn on my lamp yeah max at next ok ok
so this is the first of the first thing
that we want to control is a lab but in
the place of the lamp it can be anything
that is plugged you know some air
conditioning and a cough machine or
anything else that you want a fan you
know isn't it good Jackie it sounds
sounds ok you know you're trying to
convince me to get out of enterprise
applications that's not working you know
I think you need to show something more
than that more than that ok
see what i have here with me so coloring
the things i think that this one you
will really enjoy because we are using
an RTP energy stripe that is waterproof
and you can put in your swimming pool
and more you can have this kind of RGB
light in your house and you can use the
colors to transmit information like if
there is traffic outside your house
nearby your house the wall can be read
things like that let me show you let me
change the color here okay I kind of
like this because birds use colors to
show that they're in love can I send a
love message to my i can say who she is
though okay so here we have another
control we are using jquery we for some
rest and servlets in the side of java ee
and i'm going to change to blue the the
RGB light stripes so now it's blue nice
cool that's nice can you make it red can
you make it red shirt let's see how is
the right color right oh that's nice the
color of my dick yeah heavy noticed you
are nice okay isn't it nice Joey yeah
that's cool and you can use this to 22
for the christmas time also oh i see
that's me yeah you can think about a
Christmas API or something you know sure
you can call but Christmas or something
now let's let's leave a cobra out of
days okay okay okay no problem so is
that it good joey is enough for you it's
kind of cool but can you do something
more than that Oh Georgie my friend you
are put in a hard situation oh let's
let's do let me show how to choose
anything 22 to rate sensors using Java
and Java EE so here I have some boards
with temperature sensor and light sensor
we used to plug a heart beat sensor so
you can integrate your heartbeat into
the internet so you're the doctor can
follow your heart using twitter isn't it
amazing jury you're scaring me man so
let me show you let's just let's start
to read the sensors so here we have the
temperature in the screen we have the
light sensor and I can make it hot its
kind to 22 Celsius so you can make it
hot what are you doing don't eat that
stuff it's bad for health what are you
doing there so I can drive an ejb use a
temperature sensor you know you can have
a temperature DJ beat region i J be
driven by temperature isn't it amazing
journey well that's very cool you know
you talk about a gb to look like
Enterprise now yeah so what I mean I'm
understand this you have these sensors
and they are connected to somewhere to
this computer yeah and there's a there's
a glassfish there somewhere it's getting
interesting this stuff that's it we have
a board here nah very simple and cheap
board on arduino board what is Arduino
Arduino is a platform for prototyping
and do it yourself developers that want
to prototype something new something
different like plugging the banana into
the computer you know so is it really
plugging in an iron very Chris projects
using Arduino and also many other words
you can have more power like Java me
boards and you can use whatever you want
and since considering its open-source
juggy we could make one specially in
Brazil you know so we can make our own
board and add and whatever features we
want so very cool what we produce it was
a kind of a super do we know with more
things than the original one so that's
open source hardware that's very cool so
what else what else yeah show me more
show me more I'm kind of
you're interested think about scheduling
your cough machines so you can wake up
early in the morning and your cough is
red and you have this Mel of the coffee
and instead of some bus some noise wake
waking up you so let me show you here
i'm using ejb timer services to schedule
the appliances in our house so i have
the cough machine plug it here let's
schedule to start the coffee in three
seconds and it will be turning turn a
dog for some minutes that's a very fast
coffee yeah let's try to see if it's
work okay it's working 1 2 3 oh okay the
coffee machine is working whoa in a few
minutes we are going to have a coffee
why I mean yeah white coffee you watch
white coffee it's just water but ok so
so let me understand this straight you
came all the way from Brazil and you
didn't bring coffee now that there are
good cough is here also before that I
love the coffee here but don't you think
it's too much to use a GPS for
scheduling a coffee yeah don't you think
it's too much mmm not always not too
much because we are using java e side
many home gateways so that's a big
tendons and glass fish is very
lightweight and you can run glass fish
in a small device i'm going to show you
later so you're really having
application server there somewhere yeah
yeah but i remember from other java ones
it's legally
it's some problem with the coffee deal
okay there is never linking company but
I remember this ejb stuff isn't it too
complicated no it's very simple yeah I
think it's very simple to tell you what
I do every day ejb two dot one Jaggi
well it's a lot easier than horrible
good Jackie that's the nice way very
simple actually when you are writing
your code using J home API you can
inject a cough machine object into the
servlet and control the cost mashiny
object so it's real body ated object
programming so very that's very cool
here you're getting things into objects
whoa whoa real things is the internet
your things and physical computing the
concept of physical computing all
integrated with Java so it's very nice
I'm very motivated with this kind of
product you know okay but you said is
our demo so what else okay let me see
what I have more to show you scheduling
things and ah now we are going to show
you something really different but I
need to put something to start here and
to make it work so I need immunity you
can talk with Yara for a few minute for
two minutes k 4 fe o a few miles an hour
winds oh come on having issues you're
really going to get all these people
waiting for two minutes yada we have to
take up tell joke here then hmm I'm not
a good Joker jaggi yeah neither am I now
everybody so the cool thing okay yeah
just explained it to me so basically we
have an Ag be server running there
somewhere glassfish why you choose
glassfish you know when he was working
with Java EE he was always using
glassfish as a reference implementation
so one thing that really motivates
people on doing you know cool project
it's
earning right so we went to have the
first touch with technologies so you
know this is a strange way of testing
technologies but that's been easiest way
you know okay so he was testing how to
use new features java ee but but you
know you're trying to get some
application servers a small device yes
but that now the GlassFish is running on
the computer would you like to see it
running on a smaller device yeah that
would be nice like instead of a desktop
computer maybe a notebook a notebook is
it ABS know enough for you no no the
notebooks today as big as I know they're
small but there's barf us desktop so
would you like to see it running on
maybe Raspberry Pi whoa okay okay you're
gonna you're gonna put a glassfish
running a fruit yeah we are making a big
mass here you know controlling the mouse
with a banana and now Raspberry Pi
you're hungry I'm ready Joey hello i'm
going to show you oh the math do is math
math math no I hate math no I like math
you know there is a guy call it foo yep
and he did a very important math
oriented algorithm hey sorry yeah people
can understand understand me and that
they can understand you okay good and we
are using your processing witches are
very nice to the rotating java and here
we are using fast food here transforming
integrated with the things so i can play
some instruments and I control my things
using some kind of strument let me try
to to to find my record with my recorder
okay
your recorder recorder I didn't bring my
record oh man what do you mean like a to
record a movie um like the flute you
know in your route yeah let me see I
don't have a fluid here you can try to
trick some nice and see if works try to
make something you are a bird oh come on
you don't read it you really don't want
to hear me singing how can i whistle oh
I have what is this that's a nice sound
who is playing that hey Fernando how are
you doing oh nice hey man how are you
doing yeah I need a flute so can you
please Mike yeah you can try you better
you better you they do it AMV to see if
the left turn on and turn off oh I it's
not working
it's open yeah so Fernando it's not use
it to high quality people playing
recorder you know there is a low quality
sensor over there yeah so do you really
getting functionality into music sound
yes yes is it nice jerky that's so cool
so you can use and you can use this kind
of stuff to teach math to the kids with
something applied behind you no it's not
it's not a it is all about practicing
with the things the internet your things
it's all about motivation right what I
teach people motivated and I would like
to thank Fernando which is you know
plays recorder its founder of tail
target speaker at Java 10 bike angel at
gig bike hide and it prints free time
he's software engineer that's so cool so
you got some cool people to come to just
stopping issues yes yes best people from
resume but now you know everybody is
talking about 3d movies right but 3d
it's not enough sometimes sometimes you
would like to add more dimensions for
our lives Jackie think about adding
controlling the things inside the games
and what am I control the things inside
the game that's what we do we're
integrating integrating your labs with
the games so or integrating a fan with a
game and as fast you drive the car you
have more fan coming to you so you have
another dimension inside the game let me
show you something cool ok that sounds
very cool I have a device here
javafx hacking device four games so what
is the JavaFX hacking device that's the
device so we have internet means we have
the brick breaker game as a sample that
we hack it and we did the brick game we
can control the brick game by the right
way not using the keyboard or the mouse
we are going to use the old way of the
brick game like this so when I move a
dis potential meter I control the hook
here and this information will be will
be read by the game so let me show you
the game so basically you're getting
normal things at your house and using
them to play games yes and you're just
using open source software from the
network just open source software is all
open source you can download you can
contribute you can make money let me see
how that works so now I'm controlling
let me try to put the camera together
with the game is kind of hard but so
here I'm controlling the game with the
potential meter so much more fun and I
have an integration oops wrong screen I
have an integration with jay ho jay home
so what the labs turning on and off when
the ball hits the brig's that's what we
need yeah and when I lose the ball whoa
that's a Java fax game so you can hack
the games and put these cows stuffs
integrate this car stuff with your games
so it's a new concept and actually
you're doing this with your house right
so you really could turn on and off the
lights of your living room and
you really could you know play the ring
on your door that's is cool so isn't it
enough for you Turkey it's pretty cool
but what else okay sure I shouldn't see
where korba fits in there do you have
some some old Java me phone device in
your house not only in my house I have
like a 15 of them here so i'm going to
show how to reuse your old phone or your
old java me device to control robot and
control your house and everything else
oh come on come on venetian isn't having
it dad already not that we have dealings
of devices and we need to do something
with that device is you know slow and
these devices so here i have an
application we
I have an application running my cell
phone I have a bluetooth robot that is
receiving code over the air and by the
side of the computer you can control the
robot using Java C Java ME Java EE so
let's connect to the robot the first
connection will take Martin whoa whoa
what happened there oh good robot is
moving so so you're connecting from your
phone directly to the robot yes that's
it and we have a platform to integrate
things into your phone we have a
platform colored things mobile that you
can use to make this kind of application
very very easy and fast so we did it in
kind of two days you know and you can
also read sensors in your cell phone and
you can use your cell phone as a remote
control to your house or you can use
your old cell phone to display the
information of the robot and so it's a
nice usage of a foreign old cell phone
isn't it yeah that's very cool and
actually I could even take it's an old
phone I could even take it apart and use
its parts to do that you know to kind of
have a remote control my wall for
example yes that's it jerky you are a
very smart guy cool so all right it's
getting even better daddy better but
what else we have more you do yes do you
know the King night from Microsoft you
ever heard of it you heard of it you
know it's pretty hard for me yeah I know
how I I haven't time I try to use it
yeah doesn't recognize my arms okay no
problem let me show you how you can know
it seems can anyone do connect with
wings instead of arms let me show you
how to use
to control robots and home automation so
okay so connect let me see if I
understand this connects recognize your
movements and then it what does he do
with it it sends to the computer and
your computer sensor your robots that
we're going to do I'm controlling the
robot instead of our to you put the
robot is my body and we have about nine
application calling the GlassFish server
let's that is controlling the robot and
controlling the J home automation so I
can turn on and turn off the lamps using
my hand you're very fast love that whoa
so that's look pretty yeah so actually
you can have a dance floor where the
lights actually flash on the people
moving good example you see it it's very
fast I love that no I don't think we
have all day Vinnie shoes no problem so
that's the key back damn oh yeah and I
stand with Turkey that was pretty cool
so we okay okay so I got one interesting
thing here you said dot net applications
calling Blass fish there must be core
but there somewhere no not Karma but
kind of garbo the web serves you know oh
oh yeah web service that's korba with
xml that's is lots xml how did you like
this demo they're springy great but now
let me ask you one thing what how does
this relate to my development well you
know can I do anything like this when
I'm developing my daily in database can
you help me out somehow what when you
are developing oh hey fabiani what are
you doing here oh cool thank you
yeah tell you our example so so so this
is fabio not gone java champion we never
for Duke award and founder of story
troupe and a lots of other cool stuff ok
so my example is this jacket so I have
this website and from time to time to
website is down if there is a problem of
or if the CPU is too high and i wanted
to the way so you're you're doing wrong
code because you're another my code is
fine the problems is that i have a guy
that takes care of the infrastructure
and sometimes is kind of lame you know
yeah i think you should fire him yeah
but anyway so when there's a problem of
the website i want to i used to send an
email to him or text message so he would
wake up in the middle of the night and
fix the website but this was just not
enough so i talked to Vinny shoes and he
gave me one of those boards and we
integrated our Jenkins server we have
one of the J home balls and with a truck
horn so I gave did this isn't what I a
truck Haul truck horn very loved that's
evil yeah but I gave this board to my to
the development team and to the season
mean and they put you know in their bed
stand just in their room and when there
is a problem of the server like the CPU
is too high this day monitoring services
sends a message to j home server and the
j home server sends a message to the
truck horn in the board and then he is
gently awakened in the middle of the
night to fix the server so that's pretty
neat the service never know anymore it's
we bring out for several months with no
problem
it's very good for your development team
so that's my example that's pretty cool
house they're called house that's cold
yeah what do it right yeah what's how
they call the websites called story
troop no I'm saying this whole process
of the whole process is extreme feedback
Oh talk about the extreme yeah very
extreme I guess yeah we can do extreme
Airy stuffs but you know it's it's
pretty good okay so is that all of these
is Ronnie on your tues cloud stuff oh
yeah in two squad to have Jenkins will
have several tools and it's pretty easy
to integrate actually because J home is
a rest base it so you can do any Jenkins
build and if it breaks you just call a
rest URL and then you can wake up your
developments be good whoa nice
implementation that's very cool but I
remember jaggi you want to see less
piece running in a small device yes I do
yeah well we already said you is
glassfish and i'm interested in two
small device stuff now because you
convinced me so i have glassfish running
on my big server but what else can i do
with that tree nice years yeah we saw in
the cloud right on this tues cloud thing
then in the notebook and we have here a
a raspberry pi yeah give me a piece a
raspberry pi is very small board at your
heart everybody is talking about the
raspberry pi is a linux-based it and we
have glass fish actually we have our
gateway running inside the Raspberry Pi
and we have glassfish running inside
Raspberry Pi this board we have an
Arduino also connected to this raspberry
pi and you can use best fish in this
this size of device so it's very very
interesting thing so it's a server you
know to a very small then recall and so
who said linux is not sweet
yeah Lynn exists is amazing is amazing
and raspberry pi is a very nice board
also for doing education and prototyping
things with linux inside you know so
it's more powerful than arduino but you
can you can put together arduino and
raspberry pi to hack the physical stuff
so it's very nice and a new big tendons
i have here running the Raspberry Pi but
oh okay this one is the website run
inside raspberry pi is another IP so i
have here the gateway of things okay
here i'm running the Gator your things
when you are running glassfish with
raspberry pi the first access to the
page takes some time but the next is
very fast because Raspberry Pi needs to
compile the JSP JSF page and the first
time up the first access take this time
so but it's running here and it's we
have actually we have the the image from
our hard disk and we can clone the image
if you want if you have a Raspberry Pi
you will spend a lot of time doing the
setup to put glass fish inside so we
have an image complete image you can you
will be able to download our image with
jdk glassfish and all the things that
you need to integrate Arduino with
raspberry pi so it's red and will be
available next week to download so you
can try to play with you know they are
good isn't it nice that's pretty cool so
actually you have glassfish running this
little tiny little thing yes that's it I
am connected to all of the other stuff
that's it I used to say that we have now
the Java Enterprise Edition and bad at
server so we are the Java people we did
you
there was a good one yeah yeah now so
for this new architecture you don't need
neither the notebook or the desktop
right yeah you don't need everything you
would have in your house and when a
Raspberry Pi on the wall that's it one
mobile device to and OT enlarge you can
see different kinds of gateway running
in the Java ME side so they have
gateways more powerful Gator ease than
Raspberry Pi running glass dish also
professional gateways that cost kind of
hundred dollars so it's very real and
it's happening now you know it's not
attendance it's happening so one cool
thing about other things you said there
it looks like i can just go in heck with
this stuff i have by a little bit of
hardware just to play with and
everything is hackable right yes that's
it you see here we did ninth demos no
fail where's very cool yeah that's it
and I will bring out the equipment from
Brazil they travel a lot but it's
working because now the things are
getting more and more easy say hey demo
God get out of this place right there do
not do this dis switch ok yeah ok so
what am i praying work it and the banana
tell us a little bit more about this
yeah what about the banana you said
about banana making a mouse i'm using a
board colored makey makey and this board
you can use any kind of thing to create
a keyboard a different keyboard you can
see the video in the internet from the
makey makey is thirty dollars from this
board came from MIT labs and it's very
nice to play with your kids or to do
different types of input device to your
computer so i think that is very very
nice you just plug the USB cable in your
computer and you have alligator clips
and you put the alligator clips in a
banana so i can use this instead of my
mouth
and with the banana here I can touch the
banana oops 12 to Ernie you call the
demagogue again okay okay yeah so get
out of this cable man God whatever let's
touch the banana to change the slides so
I'm touching the banana and change you
they slide ok so now you have banana you
have you have a spoiler bow its life
changer what are you doing that's scary
we did you test the things you know I
learned with the engineers that we need
to test the things tdd with right ok are
to eat the banana so if you want to look
silly in the stage you know you get this
stuff yeah oops so we have a new thing
because to do all this integration we
need an API right yogi oh now now you're
going to tell me that all of these is
API that's open source that I came
download and it works yes we created at
the things API dot org which is the
first API for internet your things and
will be launched at night next week will
be available to download we are looking
for people to test this API and this API
is available for java me java c java ee
demo god is trying to or the connect and
the things api is very complete and you
can have bluetooth thing you can have IP
thing you can have serial connection you
can have zigbee and we are we already
did all the abstraction you just say
think dot send some comment to that
thing kind of relay or you can say think
dot reach and you are going to read a
sensor and you don't need to know if
it's a Bluetooth device or zigbee device
so it's a real cool API for internet
things that's so cool so so it's all
downloadable and everything's gonna run
like this yes and when I do I buy all
these devices there is it hard no you
have here in u.s. is a paradise you know
you have sparkfun which is a very nice
place to buy this device and we are
looking forward to the new sink
sanctuary on chip embedded inside the
ship and we are going to do everything
and chu ng using just Java we are going
to replace the arduino boards by the
java me microchip so it's very nice to
be a Java developer because you can use
Java to control the server to control
the phone to control the robot to
control the Kin ex-con throw everything
it's a nice jury that's very cool ok so
can I quit my job now yes you can stop
doing java ee come to the cool stuff
then yes no no because you will be doing
the cool stuff with Charlie oh that's
right that was smart so Jackie here we
have some links you can download j home
j home global code Kentucky are things
API will be launched at next week is not
available yet is better version and we
have the reader we're talking about
hacking here isn't everything beta all
the time all the time yeah almost the
time is better so just release man but
that's what that work release early
release often yes that's it so do you
have some questions yogi I do where's
the coffee but it's coffee no coffee
someone from the audience would like to
make some question 9 demos Oh
it's about starting hardware looks like
maybe the u.s. is backordered for
getting in
I started kid up come inside are you
from here yeah yeah yeah so drop me a
line I can send you by email do the
complete information because we have
many options here and I can point some
links to you and some options okay drop
just send me an email or what can you
put a link in the web site oh can you
put a link on the website for J home yes
I'll everyone can read yeah yeah
actually in j home website we have the
english version and off j home website
and there we have a starter kit and you
can base it on that kit you can buy the
same harder here much more a less
expensive actually and but write me an
email and i send more information
supported support insteon natural safety
it's your honest
oh no no no not yet no we don't have a
z-wave and extend we don't have because
in people we are doing what is more
popular in Brazil and it's not popular
this kind of communication yeah we hang
is open-source man so you can do it you
can yes the idea is to support multiple
protocols and we have been adding one by
one as we need them you have a thing
device interface you just implemented
base it on a Bluetooth device or some
other device you can extend our classes
or implement that the interface and I
just kind of support to the epr is a
hobby that we are trying to make
business sir cuz you know because we are
producing these boards you know and so
not here but in Brazil we sell the robot
we sell did kit so the idea it's doing
power developers that don't want to
touch the hardware part you know so
that's our main goal but it's pretty
hard so we be on an educational
education company we provide training so
we use this kind of thing to teach Java
yeah that really means they spend money
with it and they hope somebody who pays
at some point
yes exactly it's free it's open source
harder j home it's already open source
and so it's both Jake the open source
harder and open source software when we
think that things API it's been released
is because you know that we had the code
and they lined the robot and the cold
and their line j home automation and you
know with the time venetia this that
notice that you know they were things
both you know so things API it's kind of
unifying everything that we're already
done so it will be launched it but for
home automation it's everything open
source it yet ok so the name of so Java
and the name of Brazilian community I
would like to thank you everybody for
coming to all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
