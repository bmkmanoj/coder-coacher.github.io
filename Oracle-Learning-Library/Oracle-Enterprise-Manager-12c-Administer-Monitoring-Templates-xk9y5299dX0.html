monitoring templates we show you how to
view or other provided templates how to
use one of these predefined templates as
a starting point to create your own one
then we edit a template we compare the
settings of the template with a target
and finally we apply the monitoring
template to view an Oracle provided
template navigate to enterprise
monitoring monitoring templates if you
didn't do not see the Oracle provided
template select this checkbox and click
go
and here they are review the templates
and scroll down until you see the one
that has hosts as a target type select
host and first click the you to review
the information to viewed metric
thresholds click on the sub tab and now
you see many many details so one way to
quickly navigate is to click collapse
all and then expand them and expand the
area that is of interest for example
currently we are interested in load
thresholds click the view icon for CPU
in IO wait
and here on this page you see the
threshold values you see that we have a
warning threshold of 40 a critical of 80
and that enterprise manager waits for
two occurrences before it sends any
notification so that means currently it
takes 10 minutes before this is
triggered on this page you can also see
the description of the number of
occurrences how that mechanism functions
and we click OK
and we select the template for the host
target type again and this time we use
the create light functionality to create
our own template on the general page
provide the name and optionally a
description
now click the metric threshold sub tab
and here we navigate again to these load
values click the Edit icon and we will
change the critical threshold to 85 and
the number of occurrences to 6 so we
click continue note the information
message the settings have been modified
but they are not yet saved and we will
continue to make another change we
navigate again to the load section
as you see here
currently the collection schedule is
every five minutes and we change that to
every 10 minutes just as an example so
we enter 10 here and click continue you
receive the same information and we
click OK this time because we are ready
to save the changes to the repository to
see our newly created template we
navigate to the end and here it is
success is an example of what you can do
with a template we have it already
selected and we compare the settings of
the template to a sample target host so
we have selected it here we are
selecting the DB target p-21 host and
then we click continue now do that the
collection frequency which we just
changed is in red it shows every 10
minutes and also the CPU I all values
which we changed are in red to
understand the matrix settings have a
look under view you could look at all
metrics or you can choose to view the
metrics where there are differences so
scrolling to the end of the page you see
the icons in their meaning
next we want to apply our sample
template so we click apply template on
this page you have a choice of apply
options and we keep the template will
only override metrics that are common in
both template and target option expand
the metric key value settings
and we want to only apply settings for
key values that are common both in the
template and in the target type our host
target is already visible so we are
ready to click OK and here is the
confirmation message we navigate again
to our template and you can see that
there is a pending apply operation as
you refresh the page you will see that
it eventually disappears now there is no
pending apply operation this completes
the demo on showing you how to view
templates how to use the create like
functionality compare template into
target and to apply a template thanks
