and in this webcast on the Oracle cloud
I'm going to show you how to
troubleshoot an application using the
tools that are available in Oracle cloud
itself I do want to point out that this
webcast is a live presentation of an
Oracle by example or an OBE tutorial
using with the same name troubleshooting
applications in Oracle cloud using a PE
I'll paste the URL to that tutorial into
the chat window and in that case if
you'd like to take a look at what I'm
presenting and follow along that way you
can as well or you can look at later
this is the standards Oracle safe harbor
notice basically what it states is that
this webcast does not imply a contract
between you and I and what I'm
presenting today should not be used to
make any purchasing decisions okay so
moving on to the load count in order to
get the most out of it I assume that you
all of you have some experience with
eclipse with Eclipse IDE but if you
don't that's okay and you know ideally
also have some experience with EDF and
Java Enterprise Edition but if you don't
that's okay what I'll show you today
will help you get a feel for two clips
as an IDE help you get a feel for how it
interacts with Oracle cloud and so on so
in this webcast i have installed oracle
enterprise pack for eclipse version 12
point 1.1 play too this is a very
specific version number this version is
specifically designed for use with
Oracle cloud and to develop applications
with the Oracle Java cloud service you
also need to design sorry need to
install a software development kit or as
you can see on the list the SDK
and all of the software that I have on
this slide these piece of software are
all available to developers for free and
or developer license so you can use
these products to learn but you never
know charge at all and if you Gary has a
couple of gold questions that he started
in the manila to commit to answer those
so what we're going to talk about today
is a cloud where specifically going to
look at Oracle cloud and I assume that
by now you've heard the term cloud it
really has become a standard part of
many companies product offerings now
clouds come in three different flavors
so first of all there is
infrastructure-as-a-service there is
platform as a service and finally there
is software as a service and the graphic
here physically describes the relative
functionality of each type of cloud each
relative bubble each mobile relatively
shows you how much technology is
provided as a service level for their
club an example of each of these is as
follows so infrastructure-as-a-service a
good example of an infrastructure
service or I as cloud is Amazon ec2
Amazon provides virtualized components
that you can work with on these
components you install your own
application servers databases or use
whatever Amazon provides to you at the
far end of the spectrum at the far right
software as a service that's really
sales force which is an example of a
software as a service provider
Salesforce provide completed development
environment rich with tools to create a
customer relationships crm software now
with that of course comes a penalty in
that that's the only type of software
that you are provided or the only type
of software that you can develop
when cell phones what we're going to
look at it today is what's in the middle
it's a platform as a service and Oracle
cloud specifically is a platform as a
service as a platform added service it
provides specific implementations of
database application server identity
management web services support for
integration tools and you write whatever
applications you wish on to that
platform and then deploy it and run it
in the cloud service as I mentioned the
identity service also provides tools to
help you manage application security and
the result in you can create an
application that then is deployed to or
can be run as a web application can be
run on a mobile device it could be run
internally in an office and can even be
a application that supports other cloud
I mentioned a few slides ago that the
software that we're using today is the
Oracle Enterprise pack for eclipse this
is a implementation of the clips 3.8 the
juno version integrated with weblogic
server with Oracle cloud and it supports
ADF as well and what I've put up here is
a picture of the download page you
notice that there are two install types
the one that you're interested in is on
the right here the OE pe12 c+ weblogic
server ten-point 3.6 on ADF 11.1 point
1.6 lots of numbers but the point is
that this is the version you want to use
with this tutorial in to support Oracle
cloud
so what's going to do in this webcast is
a couple of things i'm going to show you
basically the notion of what happens
when you rent an application or someone
has written application designed to be
deployed to the Oracle Java cloud
service how you as potentially an
administrator of that cloud service how
do you determine whether or not this
application is legitimate is it is is
capable of running and how do you
troubleshoot it when there are problems
with that application so i'm going to
show you this very simple visitors
application there's a picture of it here
in this line we're going to go through
the process of whitelist scanning this
application looking to see if the
application supports all on the
whitelist into or supported features of
Oracle cloud and if it doesn't you know
the to throw an errand which one is
which service or which sorry which part
of the code is creating a problem then
we're going to deployed its application
to the Java services to jump service and
see if it can have any problems and then
we'll use the cloud services patrol
console to actually debug and solve
those problems so why don't we go ahead
and get started into the demo so what
I'm going to do here is share my desktop
start with the clips so I have Eclipse
open again this is the oracle enterprise
back for eclipse this is running on my
laptop locally but you can see down here
in the service that i have an instance
of oracle cloud it's connected it's
running actually there's some
applications that are deployed there too
because this is a shared version of this
cloud trial service of the music i also
have a local instance of oracle weblogic
server this is something that as a
developer you would use to create
applications and testimony before
deploying them to Oracle cloud so what I
want to do is again
the problem domain here is I have an
application that someone has set them
they would like to deploy to cloud and I
aim to go through the process of making
sure that it can be deployed and then
fixing if there's any problems so I'm
going to start by importing a web app
archive that contains a project I'm
going to use this one here the visitor
is web archive I'm going to my target
runtime is Oracle cloud I'm interested
in actually deploying this against the
cloud mostly finish it will load it into
eclipse before I do anything with this
application before actually run it
though what I'd like to do is to make
sure that there are no whitelist errors
and wait sell whitelist problems a
whitelist scan is a check to see if this
application meets the list of services
and technologies that make sense in the
context of a comfy cloud itself any and
method indications are any problems with
the XML files will be flagged with a
warning or an error as an example and
the Oracle Java cloud service does not
allow our patients to make network
connections or executed processes or
open direct sequel connections or
execute new process prophecies or invoke
native applications none of these things
would make sense in the context of a
cloud so these things would make sense
because you have an application that's
running in a container that is a part of
a cloud service so these types of method
implications and executions are flagged
has errors before an application is
loaded and an application with errors
will not be loved one so let's go ahead
and check this one the visitors
application and what i'm doing here is
I'm actually going to run the Oracle
cloud pointless Scan directly against
this war file and this one is fine
content validation completed
successfully I have no whitelist errors
at all in fact let me open up the
whitelist problems windows show that
this one is clean now what would happen
if you had one that wasn't clean let's
let's actually go through that process
let me open up one that I have to open
up a war file or it import a war file
that I have artificially injected with
some issues I'm going to open up this
file propably main cloud whitelist
Aragon war now notice that when it loads
okay it's going to come in this is a
perfectly legitimate piece of software
from javis point of view let's go to the
process of reading it okay it does have
some I think there are some issues with
the xml file but this code would compile
and theoretically would run but if i run
the whitelist scan on this particular
war file i can see that i have problems
and specifically i have some parrots i
have some failures i can go in and take
a look specifically at the errors by
opening up the marker on those errors
and i can see there is a number of
warnings says there's 33 warnings
discovered for this piece of software
some of them are just warnings for
example I'm using I have some love I
have some issues like I said with my xml
files but specifically I also have some
issues because I'm attempting to use an
API that's not supported them attempting
to use the jab x dot mail API and a
little further down scroll down a little
bit i think you'll see the error that i
actually injected besides just using a
male api actually attempting to open a
socket connection in one of the servlets
it's part of this war pop
suplex chair degree hi I won't go
through the whole thing but trust me
that there is a specific error that i
can check it into this piece of code so
that's not one that i want to run on the
cloud so go ahead and close that so
instead let's go to the process now of
actually deploying and running this
visitors application which we whitelists
and a minute ago in it and we're fine we
want to right click on this application
let's say one has and a run on server so
I already selected to choose Oracle
cloud say finish and we'll go to the
process of attempting to install this
application publish its your clock down
the bottom here in my screen hopefully
you can see this it says publishing to
work cloud where twenty-seven percent
about to content on the way look in the
console okay I don't have a couple yet
we're publishing or clubs to let's make
ten percent in just a moment once it's
completed it will automatically open up
the browser that I've selected for
eclipse in this case the browser and
I've chosen is chrome so Chrome will
open up there we go and ask me to sign
in to this to my Oracle cloud account in
order to run this application so let me
go ahead and do that
okay start to the splash screen that
says click start to enter into the
visitors application i'll do that i
should have mentioned on that previous
screen this application does use a java
persistence api to store all the
visitors that are using this plymouth
aquarium application so all the visitors
that come here to this one of the
aquarium they'll enter their data and
they will be stored in the database but
well you can see down the bottom here
and grab my annotation tools to make it
clear i have a problem i have a problem
with this application is telling me that
there was an error that occurred when
this application trying to run so that
expected error happened please contact
the systems administrator so this
application produced some type of fault
at runtime so let's take a look at why
that happened let's go back to let's go
back to OE PE and what I want to do is I
want to open up the Oracle Java cloud
service control console I can do it I
could do it from my web browser but I
could also do it here from within no
apenas 180 advantages of using an ID so
I'm going to right-click on the Oracle
cloud connection and what I'm looking
for is the Java service control so again
I'm going back to the web page because
it already logged in to look at that
application come right into the Java
cloud service control for my cloud
service account and you can see that my
visitors application has been deployed
its up it appears to be running an
active it had one active star
one acquisition the one that I opened
previously but as we saw there is a
problem with this application so let's
go look at the log messages and see we
can see what happened okay so I'm not
Anna carer when I attempted to run this
application let's take a look at that
error let's pull up let's expand this so
I can see it out sir let me select this
and expand this so I can see it so what
happened here in the log and it this is
just like if you were running it locally
I have a problem right here it says that
it's unable to resolve and your user
base user database service name in
persistence.xml well that was nice the
person who wrote this application gave
me a hint as to what they needed me to
do before I deployed it fortunately I
didn't do that before input so let's go
look at the application and see if I can
figure out what it's looking for and
what happened to Ed ok let's restart
restart my ID and i'm not sure what
happened to it and i don't see any
longer in the bottom ok
oh it's just running here Jay one moment
please
Oh
already have a locked file on it so
choose the other one the beauty of doing
a live demo okay so I open up again
should still have my servers I do the
only problem is i lost my project so
it's just important thats ok
let's open up
alright just one more time apologies for
the delay not sure why you my ID crashed
doesn't happen often alright
okay let's try this again import that
war file to third time
to Kahless and now only get to see a
double process going to go to the
process now I'm adding the Oracle cloud
as a service
alright
ok now let's configure this to be to
target the or clouds the runtime all
right and now let's go ahead and make
that fixed Billy needed remember there
was a problem in the persistence.xml
that happens to be here in the middle
information file for the source will
open up that file to close some of these
windows they don't need and here is the
issue I see that I have a JTA data
source that has a name that's meant to
be filled in later so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to change this and your
database service name and
persistence.xml to the correct name for
our service name for the database
servicing the correctly chase data
sources database so i simply make that
change i'll save this file and now go
ahead and redeploy this again to the
cloud say finish and we're going to go
through the process of deploying it to
the clouds and okay in this case i
opened up in a new window because they
didn't set the browser for this one so
what i'm going to do is let's go back to
our original application here and simply
reload this ok so now this application
because it's correctly using the
database started and Rand appropriately
and now we can actually put in it put in
values I'm going to put in my name and
say this is cool and and that and so now
I here as a visitor in the database with
money comment so here we went through
the process of
taking an application that had a problem
fixing the problem using the debugging
tools in the Java service console making
the changes in our code redeploying it
and finding out that it worked just fine
so returning to the slides here then
some next steps for all of you I would
certainly take a look at the online
viewers are any Oracle Learning Library
take a look at all of the various
tutorials we offer there they're all
free we have a number on Oracle cloud
including using Oracle cloud to do
development with netbeans ide to clip so
that just showed you today but also with
jdeveloper and finally I think that that
right I think we're at the end here side
and we can take some questions if there
are any yeah time I'm going to put up
another two poles oh yes please THANK
YOU Cary and then I'm also going to look
through our chat and Q&amp;amp;A see if we have
any questions out there and I don't see
any questions on chat or on Q&amp;amp;A so let's
just do the pole for another few seconds
here another 15 seconds or so which of
you should be able to answer questions
on those pop-up polls eps us better
understand the audience
okay and one more pulp coming up I'll
close this one that's just asking you
about oll so this one's going to close
in about ten seconds alright thanks oh
here's last one just trying to find out
how you found out about oll so take a
take a minute or so just click your
answer there and then meantime I'll
check chat again come yeah okay no
questions it will give this just another
minute or soda in the shop so this
brings us to the end of the talk and he
had any questions that you haven't asked
feel free to pop them in the chat and
Tom will pick them up an answer right
now if you're interested in playing back
this webcast if you want to watch your
dear somebody else in the organization
that he can access it as well as well as
other free content directly from oll
just search for the name of this
presentation that you'll find their
recording as well as the obe the top
fitness from all right well that brings
us to the end of the webcast for today
so many thanks to each of you for
attending let us know if you have any
questions in otherwise wish you good day
you look forward to you Sunil the next
