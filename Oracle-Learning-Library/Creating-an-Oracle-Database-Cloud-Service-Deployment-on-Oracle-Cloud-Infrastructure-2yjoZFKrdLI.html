place it's time to provision an Oracle
database cloud service instance I must
have this service in place before I can
create a Java cloud service instance
before getting started I need to make
sure I have available the following
information from the infrastructure
resources the availability domain the
subnet from the vcn that I created an
Oracle cloud infrastructure the object
storage bucket name the swift password
and the region I created with my Oracle
cloud infrastructure resources using my
Oracle cloud credentials I'll log in to
the my services dashboard from the
Action menu for my database cloud
service account I'll select open service
console and on the service console
launch the provisioning wizard by
clicking create service first on the
basic service information page I'll give
my database instance a name then I'll
select the same region in which I
created the Oracle cloud infrastructure
resources earlier selecting the region
spawns to additional required fields the
availability domain and the subnet I'll
select values for these fields based on
the information I recorded while
creating the infrastructure resources
since I want to use the default values
for the rest of the subscription details
click Next and move on to the service
details page where I'll enter critical
information about my service first I'll
create and confirm an administration
password which I can use when I need to
access the database administration
console then I'll select compute shape
that will meet my load and processing
requirements my options will include
only the Oracle cloud infrastructure
compute shapes
next insert an ssh public key which
provides authentication when connecting
to a node in my instance through a
secure shell client i'll click edit to
open the public key access for vm dialog
box and here click Choose file to open
my local filesystem I'll select the
public key and then click open
now I'll click enter and the public key
has been inserted next I'll assure I'm
using both cloud storage and local
storage for any backups from a cloud
storage container
the URL for the object storage bucket I
created as one of my infrastructure
resources this can be a rather long
entry since I need to enter the full URL
in this fixed format the variables in
this format are the region tenant and
bucket this is why I made sure to copy
the name after I created the bucket now
I'll enter the user name and the swift
password I generated earlier and then
accept the remaining defaults and click
Next
I'll verify the details my service
paying particular attention to the
compute shape region availability domain
subnet and the storage configuration
these all look fine so I'll click create
as it's being prepared my new service
will appear the database cloud service
console I can track provisioning
progress here in the service create and
delete history panel simply by clicking
detail and I can see that my service
instance has been successfully
provisioned now I can go to the overview
page for my service and see more details
about it thank you for watching creating
a database cloud service deployment on
Oracle cloud infrastructure now that
I've created a database cloud service
deployment I can use it to create a Java
cloud service instance to see a
demonstration of this task I invite you
to watch creating a Java cloud service
instance on Oracle cloud infrastructure
and for more information about Oracle
cloud infrastructure please visit us
