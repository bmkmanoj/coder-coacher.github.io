downloading and getting started with the
Enterprise Manager command line
interface in interactive mode the
command line interface or CLI for short
is another way besides the console of
using Enterprise Manager functionality
interactive mode allows us to set and
manipulate commands within a user
session much like the sequel plus
environment let's get started in order
to download the e/m CLI which comes in
the advanced kit jabba packet we need to
first log on to the console it brings us
to the home page
let's navigate to set up command-line
interface this is the download page
before we download we need to make sure
that we have Java version 1.6 0 for 3 or
greater dog but it's it download the e/m
CLI with scripting option kit to our
workstation save yes close let's bring
up the command prompt window and let's
navigate to where the kid was downloaded
after doing I left to see if we can see
the kid and there it is following the
instructions we need to set our Java
home environment first we need to know
where Java is installed
we need to add that to our path now
we'll go ahead and install our Java
packet the install on discard our tag
allows us to indicate where we want the
e/m CLI executable and associated
libraries to be involved we forgot our -
install completed successfully
now as it says in the documentation for
interactive and scripting mode we need
to perform a sync to establish
communication between the client and the
OMS I think also ensures the library
versions are synchronized between the
EMC Li and OMS the URL tag indicates vo
and asks we want to communicate with the
user name tag indicates the system
administrator user ID first all
certificates the minimum level of
security the sink was successful now we
will go ahead and invoke the EMC I like
command prompt the en CLI prompt
indicates we're in interactive mode for
using help in e MC Li we just call the
help verb open parentheses close
parentheses to call help on a specific
verb we call help open bracket open
quote close quote close parenthesis in
emc a light interactive mode we need to
set at least two client properties we do
this with that client property one
establishes which Bowen a special query
for information and the other to
establish what level of security we
shall use
- true let's do a status see if those
properties were set and we can see that
the EMU RL has been set and trusts all
certificates has been set I always think
the ultimate test is to do a get targets
the message indicates our session has
expired because we haven't logged in yet
you know try log inning and see login
was successful so let's try run I get
targets again there's a list of all our
targets in interactive mode it allows us
to set and manipulate data from
previously called functions within the
EMC a live session just like equal plus
let's get under score targets a variable
called res if we variable in this case
get underscore targets returns response
object you can do a print to get the
data we can print the exit code for that
function 0 because
successfully and let's see if it's in
JSON format
now let's set the output to be enjoyin
format
and we will do a print on that value we
can see it's equal to true so let's do a
print on the output you can see it's an
array of name value pairs and looks
quite different to the columns that we
saw before
that's called a list verb it shows us a
different array of information now let's
change the output based on just
displaying different columns so here
we'll display the target name the target
type and the target group user ID looks
a little better
so let's restrict the call Youm with in
that call by giving target name 30
target type 20 and target GUI D a width
of 32 and it looks different again that
concludes the demo on interactive mode
for more information please refer to the
Enterprise Manager command line
interface guide on the OTN which is
accessible from the Oracle home page
thank you for watching that concludes
the demo and downloading and getting
started with Enterprise Manager
command-line interface in interactive
mode
