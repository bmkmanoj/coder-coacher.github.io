Oracle's in database equal analytics my
name is Keith Laker and I'm senior
principal product manager for data
warehousing and big data and Oracle in
this podcast we're going to review the
extensions to the sequel group by clause
which allow developers and business
users to add subtotals and grand totals
to their result sets these can range
from simple row column subtotals to the
creation of sophisticated hierarchical
multi-dimensional cubes the key benefit
of using these group by extensions are
firstly they provide a faster more
efficient framework for creating and
managing subtitles they also allow
developers to simplify their application
code by pushing processing back into the
database and lastly they providing this
investment protection through compliance
with ansi sequel standards the
extensions are going to look at fall
into four categories roll up this
calculates multiple levels of subtotals
for us cube calculates all the possible
combinations of subtotals and grouping
set allows us to specify which subtotals
are going to be computed finally
concatenated groups allows us to
calculate a hierarchical queue so if we
have a fact table called sales based
around two dimensions time and product
the fact table will contain time ids for
months product IDs for items and we'll
have the amount salt now the base fact
table contains only the base data but
obviously our business users want to
view a logical cube containing subtotals
and grand totals to help them drive
their analysis
traditionally we use summon group by
operations to create an aggregate along
the two dimensions to derive a single
group so in this example here we've
created a subtotal of year and division
but if we want to create subtotals at
the division level for all levels within
our time dimension then we need to
extend the group by clause using the
roll-up syntax and specify the levels
that we want to calculate the actual
roll-up is straightforward it creates
subtotals that roll up from the most
detailed level to a grand total
following a grouping is specified in the
roll-up Clause roller takes as its
argument an ordered list of grouping
columns first it calculates the standard
aggregate values specified in group by
clause and then it creates progressively
higher levels of subtitles moving from
right to left through the list of
grouping columns finally it creates a
grand total so in this case we want
totals at the division level and within
our time dimension for levels year
quarter and month but notice that the
roller also calculates the additional
level of all years it's important to
note that both roll up and cube
extensions work independently of any
hierarchy metadata in your system their
calculations are based entirely on the
column specified in the Select statement
this means that Cuban roller can be used
even when there is no hierarchy meta
data available now if we want to know
the total sales for all items across
month quarter and year then we can just
simply drop the division level from our
roll up clause and just specify the time
elements of year quarter and month and
this will create the total for all
division
is across those time periods including
the all years but if we want to create
some higher-level totals but have more
control over these totals we can use the
q clause cube is much easier to use
where there are lots of dimensions since
only the base level need to be
referenced in the cube clause and all
the other levels will be inferred for us
in this example we've specified division
and year within our cube clause and this
will automatically create the additional
tables for all years at the division
level all items at the year level and
the additional top level of all items
and all years you can add more control
over which subtotals are generated
within the cube by using a grouping sex
clause here we want to compute totals
for division and quarter along with year
and brand but note that we don't when we
run this get the additional totals for
all divisions or all years so this is
where we gain some of our control so as
we said before the cube and roller will
automatically add these levels whereas
using the grouping sets capabilities we
gain control over which aggregation
levels are created concatenated
groupings offers the ability to control
the combinations of groupings by
allowing you to specify which levels are
calculated as part of the aggregation
process in the example shown here we're
going to calculate subtotals only for
the levels brand month and division
month
concatenated groupings offers a concise
way to generate useful combinations of
groupings and avoids generating unwanted
aggregations concatenated grouping sets
makes it easy to generate exactly the
aggregations we need to supply to our
business users in the following example
we're going to compute a hierarchical
cube as a data set where the data is
aggregated along the rollup hierarchy
for the product item dimension and this
aggregation is then combined across the
time dimension in include the typical
set of aggregations needed for business
intelligence queries by using
concatenated groupings you can generate
all the aggregations needed by a
hierarchical queue with just n roll ups
where n is the number of dimensions and
avoid generating unwanted aggregations
that your users might not be interested
in so here the first roller is over the
product item dimension creating
subtotals for item next we establish the
totals for brand-new vision and finally
all divisions and now we start
processing across our time dimension
firstly we compute our quarter subtotals
then we compute our years and then we
compute our all years to give us the
complete cube containing all of our
required subtotals and totals including
our all years and all divisions so these
X equal extensions to the group by
clause are extremely powerful and can be
used to deliver the most frequently used
bi data sets using simple sequel
statements they remove the need to ship
large volumes of data to a middle-tier
bi engine to create the required
subtotals and grand totals which means
they are very very performant hopefully
this brief podcast is giving you some
insight into the power of these
additional aggregation extensions bro
