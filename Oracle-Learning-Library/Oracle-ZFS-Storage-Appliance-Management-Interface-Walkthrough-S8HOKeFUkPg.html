going to be a short session walking
through the general ZFS appliance
interface when you first log into the
appliance what you see here is the
status screen so this screen gives you a
high-level overview of and different
analytics such as CPU network disk
different protocols as well as other
high-level usage on the box from a pool
perspective you can see how much space
is use if you have multiple pools you
would see those here you can see
compression space available you can see
some memory statistics from the DRAM
memory and the box as well as high-level
overview of the services you know
whether they're on or not or if there's
a problem with them in my case most of
the services are on just a few that
aren't packet you can see those here if
there was one I want to turn on such as
like here nYSSA's off don't want to turn
it on I can go straight to it enable it
you know put in the domain and such and
get right to it from that so everything
is hyper linkable in here just like the
analytics if I see something interesting
such as here on this you can see NFS was
busy you know almost six days ago and
click on that and this will show me the
last seven days of NFS activity so then
I could pick you know what's the high
point that kind of stuff will save the
Analects details for another session I'm
just showing you the how the general
interface works also you'll see
high-level overview here of the hardware
so whether or not if you have any
hardware issues does your hell on the
box has been up since that was lost
rebooted from recent firmware update we
did as well as if you have any issues
with disk power supplies anything like
that you also see alerts here if you
have any alerts set it'll tell you if
there's any alerts going on such as
replication going around so every time
it begins and finishes it tells us here
it's updating us there
other navigation in the appliance so
basically there's five tabs you can see
here across the top configuration
maintenance shares the status screen
which were on and then the analytics tab
and then every time we click one of
these it brings up a sub tab so on this
screen you can see here there's a we're
on the dashboard which you're seeing
here but you can also change the
settings of the dashboard so you can
change different thresholds for those
settings as well as the layout so what
order and what protocols you want to see
on the screen you can change to whatever
is important to you this is also here
you can see some indium P reporting on
this screen as well if you're using that
the configuration tab this is where we
configure things so all the different
services on the box the storage pools on
the box the network connectivity the Sam
block level storage is configured here
the cluster configuration that happens
here as well as user administration
happens on this tab and then some basic
preferences are available and then all
the alerts that are available in the
appliance as well and you can click on
the maintenance tab and you'll see a
bunch of other options here such as you
can see the general Hardware overview so
I can go in and see details of the
hardware what drives and CPU and memory
as well as the system tab so this tab
will show us if we have any issues with
any support issues going on or what
firmware level or on that sort of thing
the problem log the general you know all
the different logs available on the
appliance such as alerts fault system
audit logs
phone home logs you know from the box
this phone at home if it's having issues
you'd see that and then the workflow tab
as well the share tab this is where many
users spend a majority of their time
here you see let's really create
projects and shares and LUNs and so
we'll cover those in a lot more detail
later but
screaming that happen so you can very
simple to create those by typically when
you want to create something you click
the plus icon so whatever screen you're
on there's a plus icon that'll pull up
create a new file system if I want to
create a new one I click LUNs and click
the plus and I want to do create a new
project I click on projects gives me a
list of projects and again I can get
plus here one other navigation tip you
can click here and you can create to see
the projects as a side pane window and
you can create click projects here
something else you can do is you can
move shares in and out of projects as
well so if I go into the accountant and
I can take like this little grabby icon
and hold my mouse and I can turn around
and drop this into any project I want
I'm not gonna do it but just so you know
that is an ability of the system to be
able to drag and drop shares and ones in
between different projects a schema
setting so schema is where you can set
up custom properties for shares such as
maybe a department type or phone number
for an admin of a share or something
like that you could set up different
properties to show up and the general
tab on the share screen the status
screen are covered the last tab is the
analytics tab so this is where we do the
advanced dtrace analytics and we'll
cover this in great detail but it's
again there's a plus here you want to
add statistic you can come down here and
pick which one you want to add and it'll
add it in and pull up a you know a live
view of what's going on so here you can
see and we're looking at the current
minute of data and there's many other
things you can do when you come and look
in this if you hold your mouse it'll
tell you what exactly all these do show
the largest point in time the shortest
point time month of data a week you know
a day of data an hour or a minute of
data you can also zoom in and zoom out
to certain points of time you can pause
it
you can move forward and back on
historical timeline if you have
historical analytics as well as far as
the sub tabs on the analytics tab you
see right now we're in the open
worksheets which is this is what we have
open which is nothing you can also see
here they're saved worksheet so this
would pull up an existing analytics tab
that someone has saved so here you can
see I one here that has this data where
it's always recording it so I can go
back and I can look at very long point
in time so here's a week here's a month
of data it's gonna pull up and so on so
for the second season picked the high
point of the month and here you can see
it did 65,000 I ups at 9:45 on looks
like they're around the 6th of March
during the last month and I can quickly
zoom back to the current minute datasets
so the data sets these are all the
Analects that are recorded are currently
being recorded all the time so there's
thousands of possible analytics out
defaulted box there's about 30 available
but here you can see those how much
space they're taking on disk and how
much space they're taking in memory on
the system and then lastly there's a
Settings tab that lets you set retention
policies for the Analects themselves so
that's a general overview of just
navigating through the evaluate the
appliance it's fairly self intuitive if
you just follow what the word say that's
pretty much what they do thanks so much
for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
