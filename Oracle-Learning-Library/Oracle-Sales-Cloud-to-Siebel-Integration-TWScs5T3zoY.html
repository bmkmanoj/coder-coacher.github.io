has decided to modernize their customer
sales experience ecosystem by
subscribing to oracle salescloud for
their CX requirements now they need to
integrate the data in Oracle sales cloud
with their existing Siebel system
on-premises they've chosen Oracle
integration cloud service or ICS as
their strategic integration platform for
this task ICS will be used for
bi-directional data synchronization
between Oracle sales cloud and Siebel
for accounts contacts opportunities and
more this demo illustrates how you can
realize a critical integration use case
such as account synchronization
integration in a matter of a few clicks
integration cloud service helps realize
this business critical use case without
requiring advanced technical skill sets
or your team needing to write any code
sales rep John Dunbar logs into a sales
cloud from there he creates a new
account he provides the account details
and saves the new record John Swift as a
sales rep as well
John creates opportunities in Siebel now
he logs into Siebel searches for the
account and finds the account
synchronized to Siebel in real-time now
let's take a look at how you can build
this integration using ICS quickly and
without any coding Bob the integration
designer at vision incorporated logs
into the ICS console the ICS console is
the one-stop shop for designing
monitoring and managing your
integrations bob is presented with a
very simple landing page where he can
create connections to various SAS and
on-premise applications he can then
quickly build integrations between them
after he activates those integrations he
can monitor transactions and end on the
monitoring dashboard the connections
link displays a page where Bob can
review all existing connections to
various applications
from the create new connection option he
can connect to various applications from
Oracle third parties SAS on-premise
social productivity enterprise
technology endpoints
more back on the main connections page
Bob clicks the siebel connection to view
its configuration details he tests the
connection and verifies that it's
successful the Siebel connection is
ready to use in integrations from the
main connections page Bob navigates to
the integrations page here he can see
integrations he and his team have
created as well as the pre-built
integrations delivered by Oracle and its
partners Bob clicks create new
integration different integration
patterns are available for configuration
he provides basic details for the
service including a name and description
he can optionally provide a package name
so that related integrations can be
grouped together to simplify management
the version number is automatically
generated the integration canvas is
displayed with all the available fully
configured connections Bob drags and
drops the sales cloud adapter onto the
source tab and configures it to pass the
account object into ICS this means that
every time a new account is created an
Oracle sales cloud the details of the
account are passed in real time into ICS
so that they can be synchronized in real
time with the target applications in
question in this case Siebel Bob
provides a meaningful name and
description of the endpoint he
configures the endpoint to receive the
account business object as a request
from the oracle salescloud application
and then configures it to send an
account business object as a response
the configuration summary confirms his
changes Bob defines the target endpoint
by adding a Siebel adapter it gives the
endpoint a meaningful name and
configures the endpoint to pickup the
account object he wants to create an
account in Siebel so Bob specifies the
create account operation he verifies his
selections and exits next he creates the
request and response mappings he
specifies organization name as the
tracking field after clicking the
tracking icon on top he saves and
activates the flow Bob can now monitor
the transactions in real-time by
clicking on the monitor section it
provides dashboards for all the key
performance metrics of the transactions
