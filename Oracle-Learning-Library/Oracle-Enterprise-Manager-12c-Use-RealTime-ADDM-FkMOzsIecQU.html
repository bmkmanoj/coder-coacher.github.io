Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demo shows you a
possible example of using real-time addm
before we start the demo let's quickly
review what is real-time addm basically
real-time addm is a feature that allows
you to analyze your database performance
automatically when you cannot log in to
the database because it is hanging or
when your database runs very slowly due
to performance issues in these cases
real-time addm identifies the source of
Celia contention on global resources
real-time addm also performs allistic DB
time analysis similar to a DBM when
invoked on a database that is
experiencing and usually high database
activity in such cases real-time addm
detects the top performance issues
currently affecting the database and
find any major consumer of the database
time like sequel sessions etc etc the
big difference between a TDM and
real-time addm is that real-time addm
uses a diagnostic mode connection to
access ash data directly in the STA of
your database instance bypassing the
normal connection path and without using
any global resources like lexis and
queues or excessive amount of any host
resources
these demo shows you a typical real-time
addm use case when your database
instance is in a hanging situation okay
so first of all let's go to the database
on page we want to moneyto so you go to
the target menu and then you select the
databases this takes you to the
databases page from where you can select
the database you want to monitor so
let's take this one for example this
takes you to eat some page and let's
wait for it to refresh now let's try to
connect to this database instance using
sequel plus so we need to create a
terminal session like here and then use
a simple plus to connect to the database
instance as you can see the connection
is not established this is because the
database instance is ending in fact for
the purpose of this demonstration we
manually lock the table as part of the
demo setup and we created a logon
trigger that is attempting to lock that
same table because the table is already
locked any connection has to wait for
the table log to be released to proceed
this creates a hanging situation for
this database instance this is where
real time a DDM is going to be very
useful for the DBA to diagnose the
situation so let's start real time a DDM
on that database instance from the
database on page go to the performance
menu and from there select real time a
DDM which takes you to this page here in
this situation real time a DDM must use
a direct connection because the instance
is ending to establish this direct
connection you need to provide a CT be a
connection credential and this is what
we do here then you can submit them
it takes a while for the page to load as
we establish the diagnostic mode
connection and we read hash data
directly in memory once loaded you can
see at the top the top activity diagram
derived from the earth data in SGA this
represents around one hour of database
activity you can clearly see the cause
of the angling situation relates to the
application weight class now you need to
start the diagnostic to get more
insights on the issue so click the start
button to start this analysis real-time
addm is now looking at the past ten
minutes of hash samples to determine the
angle cause the analysis is now in
progress
there is now one finding so you can
either look at more details about it by
clicking on the findings tab here a
real-time addm recommends to kill a
particular session however to get more
information about the process that needs
to be terminated we will go to the hand
data tab in real-time a DDM recommended
that we kill a session for which we now
have the OS process ID let's start a new
terminal window and execute the
appropriate command to kill the culprit
session soon after that you can see that
the blocked session can proceed in the
meantime let's have a look at the top
activity snapshot this diagram
represents the top activity of the
database for the past 10 minutes it is
essentially a zoom of the first graphic
at the top of the page so real-time addm
helps you to identify why your database
instance was hanging this is the end of
the demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
