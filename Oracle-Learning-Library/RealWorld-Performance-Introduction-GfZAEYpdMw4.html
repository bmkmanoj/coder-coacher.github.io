president of real-world performance
within the database development group
here at Oracle
Iren been running the real world
performance group for nearly 20 years
and will look quite a large team and
really we're focused on improving the
performance of Oracle database in the
real world which is very often a
complicated subject in itself because
what really what we're interested in is
seeing people using our products better
and going orders of magnitude faster and
this is very much our target when my
team engages in things is to make things
10 times faster 100 times faster even a
thousand times faster now this is quite
an ambitious target and very often
people say oh we would just be happy if
it was twice as fast but in many
respects this is not interesting if we
were wanting to speed up things by 2x we
could just wait 18 months and let
Moore's law do the work for us and so
with that in mind we're always looking
to get ahead of Moore's law and do
better and really win terms of
real-world performance is a case of
getting ahead of Moore's law and being
smarter how we're using the database now
one of the unfortunate things about the
Oracle database is that in the real
world it's not used that well in fact is
not being used optimally or well at all
and with this in mind what the real
world performance group is actually in
the last few years is puts a large
amount of investment in education
techniques to try and get people to get
their money's worth out of the database
you spend a lot of money on hardware you
spend a lot of money on software
licenses and in many cases it's it's
very unfortunate
the lack of success people have for
their investment and so what we're
putting in the focus is to try and teach
people how to use the product better and
when people start using the product
better things run faster they become
more available they become more
predictable almost boring and less
exciting I mean in the IT industry they
say we're all boring and nerds but in
fact we actually create far too much
excitement for ourselves
in fact we make it way too exciting and
exciting to me means lost weekends
working all night and that's not my idea
of fun I like to use my weekends of
something else so with that in mind
let's start thinking about real-world
performance and the challenges that we
see but without even going into
technical specifics now one of the first
things we really notice is in many cases
the product is used incorrectly ok this
may be a legacy of not upgrading how you
use the product through the versions so
the product is configured like it was
done in nine version six or version
seven but now you're running version 11
and you're carrying a legacy of those
old parameters settings techniques ideas
through to working with version 11 and
eventually twelve now let's think about
what happened between version six and
seven and eleven and twelve look at what
happened to the CPU speeds the
scalability of multiple CPU multiple
core machines let us look at the size of
the memory and the size of the i/o
systems everything got bigger by orders
of magnitude
now in any engineering discipline when
things get bigger by orders of magnitude
something has to change and something
has to evolve and that thing that
usually needs to evolve is the
application code and logic and the
algorithms we've also been dealing with
the fact that data sets are being
increasing by in fact orders of
magnitude greater than Moore's law and
so this brings me and segments me into
the next challenge that we really see in
real-world performance in many cases
there is code and logic and
Meek's being applied to an information
problem
akin to what we would call a small data
problem for dealing for with a hundred
rows or ten rows or a handful of rows
and they're trying to apply those
techniques and those algorithms to
something that might have a million rows
or a billion rows or sometimes even a
trillion rows now you can not you can
see very quickly that this is a big
problem in in itself just imagine if you
had a small transaction that took a
millisecond okay if you had to do a
thousand of those in a sec it would take
one second if we start expanding that
and say okay we're going from a thousand
to a million you could see that would
take a thousand seconds in nearly twenty
minutes if we would take that into the
next level and take it even further
along and take it up to a trillion rows
the time to take into a trillion
transactions each executing within a
millisecond which may sound fantastic to
the developer would be thirty two years
so with that in mind we've got to work
at it understanding that we have to
adapt our algorithms and techniques as
the datasets increase and the types of
hardware and the performance of the
hardware and the software algorithms
associated with this and this is really
what real-world performance has become
learning to recognize are we using the
wrong product the wrong techniques and
the wrong algorithms be it either inside
the database or inside the application
logic because this is where the order of
magnitude gains come along the other
problem we've also faced with in
database performance is that if you have
noticed and I'm sure we've all looked at
LinkedIn once in a while
anybody who claims to be an Oracle
expert has tagged performance as their
expertise however so there's a millions
of Oracle experts so there's millions of
performance experts but this isn't
really true the real reality is that
somebody some once in their career has
fiddled with something and made things
go faster did
they understand why it went faster
probably not but they fiddled with it
they took the credit for it had success
with it and so suddenly they became a
newly minted performance expert without
really quite understanding the problem
so with this in mind we also see that
people's tuning techniques consists of
just literally crying and fiddling and
playing with parameters and settings and
hoping things will get better okay
in many cases people are jumping into
the solution space without really
understanding the problem this is called
hacking in ARB industry you know we just
fiddle and fiddle and hope and things
get better without really understanding
the problem now one of the things we
really teach with my engineers if they
can't articulate the problem they better
not propose a solution they better go
back work all night or whatever it takes
until they understand what the problem
is
because usually when you can articulate
the problem the solution is easy and so
one of the challenges for all real-world
performance engineers is figuring out
what the problem is if you can't figure
out what the problem is you better not
make a suggestion and this gets to
something else that we also see is that
people sound very eloquent in meetings
and sound like they understand what's
going on and making lots of intelligent
sounding suggestions but we should not
be jumping into solution space until we
understand the problem one of my other
engineers who also calls this activity
something else this was confusing
activity with progress you know we can
do a lot of busy work pretending to move
the needle but until you really move the
needle of performance an order of
magnitude two orders of magnitude three
orders of magnitude you actually haven't
done real-world performance and if you
can plan an engineer to make things a
thousand times faster because you
understand the problem you become a very
valuable useful real-world performance
