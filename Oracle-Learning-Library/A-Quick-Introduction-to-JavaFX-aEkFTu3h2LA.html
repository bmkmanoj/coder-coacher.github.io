the JavaFX team I'd like to present a
quick introduction to JavaFX
what is JavaFX JavaFX
is the evolution of the Java client Java
FX provides a rich set of graphics and
media api's Java is the primary
programming language for Java effects
and we embrace languages such as Scala
and groovy let me give you an overview
of the Java FX architecture glass is the
windowing API glass handles input events
and provides a drawing surface for prism
prism is the graphics API prism is
implemented using direct3d on Windows
and OpenGL on Mac and Linux on systems
that don't have a GPU or have a bad
graphics driver prism falls back to
using Java 2d we have a webview node
that interfaces with the web engine to
render web pages our web capabilities
are based on WebKit and we have a media
engine that enables us to play audio and
video based on GStreamer let's move on
to talking about HelloWorld in Java
effects what I'm going to show you in
the upper left hand corner is what
you'll see when you run java effects and
what you'll see in the upper right hand
corner is the stage scene and scene
graph I've color-coded the stage scene
and scene graph elements to the lines of
corresponds to in the code below let's
focus first on the hello world class
which extends application all JavaFX
applications are a subclass of
application and all you have to do in
the main method is call launch the entry
point into all Java FX applications is
the start method and the start method
takes a stage which I've color coded as
blue so the stage holds a scene which
holds the scene graph and of color coded
the scene as light yellow the scene
needs to have root node in this case
we're creating a group node for the root
node and that root node is color coded
as red and then we're adding in a text
node as a child of the group node
and all the text note says in this case
is hello world so instead of creating
text let's go ahead and create a shape
in this case a rectangle so we still
have the root node which is color-coded
red and we're going to create a
rectangle which is color-coded green in
the scene graph in the upper left hand
window it's going to be black by default
for now and then we set its position
width and height and add it to the scene
graph since we already know the
parameters for the position width and
height let's go ahead and hide that for
now so we've simplified it down to
creating a group node and adding the
rectangle to that group node and now
let's color a green so all we do in this
case is set the fill color to green and
let's give it a border so we'll leave
the fill is green and we'll set the
stroke color to black and give it a
stroke with the 5 let's go ahead and add
some scale to the x-value of the group
node so here we're setting scale X to 2
and note that the stroke is getting
scaled as well the stroke is getting
scaled as well because the entire group
note is being scaled as opposed to
setting the width of the rectangle to be
twice as wide and in this case instead
of modifying the scale we're setting the
rotation to be 30 on the group node and
here we're giving it rounded corners by
setting the arc width and arc height
let's talk a little bit about what you
saw in the upper right hand corner of
the previous slides initially the scene
graph only had one red group node and
one green leaf node but in fact you can
have as complex a tree structure as you
want with parent and child relationships
group nodes and leaf nodes what are some
of the types of leaf nodes you can have
you can have shapes such as circles
curves polygons rectangles and text and
you can have media such as image views
and media views and you can have UI
controls so let's talk about UI controls
UI controls are subclass from parent
nodes to support skinning which means
you can customize the look of the UI
controls
but UI controls are effectively seen as
atomic units so here we're looking at UI
controls as if they are leaf nodes so
that's how to create HelloWorld in Java
