environment to production let me show
you how to save a snapshot of your
pre-production service to a file and
then migrate the contents to a
production environment a snapshot is an
archive or backup file that enables you
to restore your cloud service
environment by capturing the data model
catalog and application roles at a
specific point in time snapshots contain
a data model that presents data for
analysis that reflects the structure of
your business a catalog which contains
analyses dashboards visual analyzer
projects and so on and application role
definitions that control access to
functionality in the cloud service
navigate to the snapshots and models in
your pre-production environment to take
a snapshot to begin save the information
that you want to migrate in a snapshot
it's useful to regularly backup your
cloud service to a snapshot consider
taking a snapshot before you model data
and extend application role definitions
and prior to anyone using the service
enter a meaningful description that will
help you remember something about the
snapshot you can save up to 10 snapshots
in the cloud next download the snapshot
to your local file system so that you
can use it to migrate the information to
your production environment you can take
a snapshot of your service at any time
and download as many as you like the
snapshot has a bar file type now you
need to log in to your production
service and upload the new snapshot that
contains the service artifacts navigate
back to the snapshots and models page
uploading makes the snapshot file
available to the service you must use
the restore option to make artifacts
saved in the file available in the
production environment finally restore
the snapshot to complete the migration
generally application roles differ
between pre-production and production so
you may not want to include the
application roles
note that restoring a snapshot can
impact users who are online in the cloud
service your production environment is
ready for use if you have an on-premises
data model that you want to upload to
the cloud you use the replace data model
option which is also located in the
console for detailed information about
how to upload on-premises data models to
the cloud visit the Oracle bi cloud
service Help Center now you know how to
take a snapshot of your cloud service
save it to a file and then use the
archive file to migrate content from a
pre-production environment to a
production environment thanks for
