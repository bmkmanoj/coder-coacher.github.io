the Oracle jet course the theme of the
first week was architecture modularity
and data binding at this point you
should have an understanding of the
kinds of enterprise problems that jet
helps you to solve you should also
understand the basics of existing open
source enterprise solutions that relate
to modularity and data binding provided
by requirejs and NACA ljs you should
have done some coding and NetBeans IDE
or in another tool while getting
comfortable with the creation of jet
applications if you've created a few
basic jet applications added some
modules integrated a few Oracle jet
components from the cookbook you are now
ready to continue with the second week
of the course the theme of the second
week is to explore Oracle jets features
use cases and scenarios but the end of
this week you will have explored the
Oracle jet component library
you also have explored techniques for
dealing with navigation routing
validation page layout and responsive
design you will wrap up the week by
exploring hybrid mobile application
development with oracle jet by the end
of the week you should have the full
range of our cadet coding techniques and
components at your disposal and be able
to comfortably create attractive oracle
jet applications let's start by
highlighting the main features of the
oracle jet website our quad jet dot-org
provides everything you need whether you
are learning and getting started with
Oracle jet or whether you are being
productive creating new applications
setting up your environment and coding
for production purposes the get started
page shows you how to set everything up
using the command line interface to
correct new applications whether for web
applications or for hybrid mobile
development the cookbook lists all of
the components that Oracle jets makes
available and for each component you
will see that there is a recipe with a
lot of related documentation you will
also see that there is a learned section
on the Oracle jet home page where the
tutorials the hands-on web templates and
other
related resources are found the success
stories page is a showcase of what
organizations around the world are doing
with jet once you start using jet in
production yourself your organization is
invited to make this kind of information
available to promote jet usage and to
show others what you are doing with it
finally the support page provides access
to a forum where you can ask questions
as well as an FAQ a blog videos and a
range of supporting resources take
special note of the developer guide
which provides a lot of detailed
information covering a range of typical
questions and problems you are likely to
face such as how to design responsive
applications how to set up single page
application architectures and these
kinds of concerns we're going to be
focusing on data visualization
components and data collection
components in the next parts of this
course be aware that aside from those
components there are several others the
firm components button components image
components menu components these work as
you might expect and have been included
in Oracle Jets so that all the user
interface components in your jet
application will have the same kind of
behavior and appearance in terms of
accessibility internationalization and
how they will look to the end-user in
this the first part of the second week
you have been introduced to the topics
that will be covered during this week
you have also been given a tour through
Oracle ejected org and you should now be
fully aware of all the resources that
are available to you to support you in
your work with jet for your homework for
this part spend a little time reviewing
the Oracle jet or a website and get
comfortable with what is available with
each section
look at the different categories of
components in the cookbook so that you
can quickly find the component that
you're looking for in the future
and with that we thank you for
participating in the oracle jet course
and look forward to having you again in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
