application testing suite open script
functional testing overview my name is
Yu Tong catechetical
I'm a group product manager of the
application testing suite collects and
here is today's agenda at the first ten
minutes I will quickly introduce
application testing suite and open
script just in case you are not familiar
with our products then I will show you
some of the tips starting up with open
circuit functional testing module and
that will take another 30 minutes and
the next 15 minutes we will see the
product demonstration open script and
finally discuss the features in current
and future version of open script I will
not cover ad a functional testing
introduction in this presentation as we
have more detailed training program
available okay so we are the application
testing suite but what is application
testing suite application testing suite
consists of three separate but
integrated products the first product we
have is the Oracle functional testing
where we usually call this product alton
script which allows you to automate a
functional regression testing and also
you can generate load testing scripts so
we are going to do the load testing the
first thing you need to do is to go to
the open script and create your load
testing script and once you create a
load testing script that you can bring
that script on to the oracle load
testing and 110-thousand Habra users
against your application and workable
testing has a built-in server monitoring
capability which we call this feature
service stats server stats can monitor
the backend application structure during
the load test and collect performance
metrics for example you can monitor the
performance counters from your web
server application server and for the
database server and also from the
operating systems that hosts those
application and you can later use this
information to identify the bar on a
career application and finally we have
oracle test manager that allows you to
manage your test case and these
requirements and you can also track the
effects that are funded during testing
and today's focus a
open script the naming is a little bit
confusing the Oracle functional testing
is usually called open script the reason
is probably because it is not just a
functional testing tool but also it is a
load testing scripts generation tool so
here are some of the key features for
open script so open script is a
functional in relation testing to over
with seoul-based SLA based in Oracle
packaged application and this is also a
script generator for the a load testing
script and also opens could also provide
specific custom accelerators which are
basically the scripting plates we have
oxidative for Oracle packaged
applications such as a vision suite a
Siebel and Fusion apps is one of the
oxidated we have in open script we also
have a oxygenators for the own specific
web technologies such as Adobe flex the
wave services for more efficient script
creation and the URL capture is shown at
the right hand side of the screen open
script it is designed to meet all the
level of the technical users in the
default view it provides a easy to
understand the interface to configure
your script so you do not need to know
the deep knowledge of the scripting
language to create most of your script
on the other hand the underlying script
language pure Java so the advanced users
if they are comfortable using code they
can flip the script view onto the Java
code view and write any Java code to
extend your script and in fact the open
script is actually built on top of
eclipse foundation so if your Java
programmer or comfortab using Java you
can flip the entire UI on to the Eclipse
IDE user interface and take advantage of
your Eclipse knowledge in order to add
the web and create your script on the
other hand the most of the case advanced
knowledge in Java or the knowledge in
Eclipse is not necessary you can write
code edit code with GUI interface and
only if you're comfortable using Java or
you have technical advanced knowledge in
Eclipse you can use these features as an
option
an open script the integrative Oracle
load testing and you can take the load
testing script on the oracle load
testing and assimilate the load to run
any number of concurrent browser users
against your application and this is
also integrated with oracle test manager
you can bring your functional testing
script onto the oracle test manager and
run your script as a part of the test
case you can run the script manually or
you can actually schedule to run the
script and store the result on to the
oracle database this diagram shows the
accelerators which is available in open
script for the total one release we have
oxidizers for well
Siebel EBS form and fusion EDF is one of
the oxidizer singleton script which is
inbuilt on top of the wave function
testing module but please keep in mind
however open script supports any
web-based applications as long as they
run in the web browser or deployed as a
soap based web services these
accelerators which is basically a script
templates are just an additional
capability built on top of that
in this section I would like to go
through some of the basic operation you
might want to do when you are starting
off with open script that is recording
your web transaction with open script
understanding the script commands which
was recorded the inter script and
playing back that recorded script and
finally customizing your script so you
have an installed open script in your
system the first thing you might want to
do is to recall the script recording the
script in open script is straightforward
basically what you navigate through the
browser will be automatically recorded
into your script and here is a super
basic recording steps in oulton script
first you will create a script and then
click the record button in a browser and
that will start the recording the
browser will launch you navigate through
your browser and as you navigate
commands are recorded into the script
and when your transaction is done press
the stop button in the toolbar to stop
the recording and your script is
recorded so this is the super basic
steps to record your script we'll go
through a little bit more detail in the
later in the product demonstration but
this is basically the flow you will do
when in order to create your basic
script okay so the script is recorded
but what are recorded into the script
the first of all opens have to record
the commands into the script as you
navigate through the browser as you can
see click text box the press tab set the
password click button click link these
are the glue commands that is going to
be passed to the browser at the playback
so that browser can emulate your
transaction you perform and during the
recording and in addition to the Greek
man the open script stores the content
information that was returned from the
server the contents information included
screenshot HTML and rendered HTML and
also the HTML Dom for the selected node
in the script view and open script does
this for both recorded and playback and
why is this important it is important
because you can later use this
information to compare the recorded and
playback
contents and use for the debug in your
script in case you have any script
errors okay so before playing back your
script let me give you information for
the backend mechanism how opens could
pre-chorus the browser transactions so
when you launch a services window in the
system you have open script installed
you'll see Oracle 80s helper service
running open script requires this
service up and running in order to
capture your web transaction from the
browser and this is actually not only
the service ATS setup installed into
your system if you selected to instead
of full ATS installation you may see
other ATS services as it is shown in the
bottom side of the screen in this slide
however as far as Oakland scripts
concerned
Oracle ATS helper is the only services
that you need to worry about other
services are either Oracle load testing
or Oracle test manager or both okay so
open circuit
ATS helper service is running all the
time when your machines up and what it
does is when you launch a browser it is
going to add the browser add-ons to your
browser and in case of the Internet
Explorer to browser as on or added
that's our openscad toolbar and opens
with pho or browser helper object and
you'll see them in the manage add-ons
and dialog in your IE and when your
browser and always enabled you'll also
see the open script toolbar in the is -
over menu please make sure the open sky
toolbar has a check here in your browser
otherwise the opposite will not be able
to start the recording and you'll
typically see cannot get the connection
from pho in 15 min 15 seconds that is
the typical error you will get when the
browser add-ons are not enabled so when
you see this message there are three
things to do first check whether the
helper services at the running
and second two add-ons are enabled opens
to the toolbar and opens with pho those
who has to be enabled in the your manage
and long window in 0ae
browser and also finally the toolbar
opens get to over in the i8 over menu
has to had a check otherwise open school
now be able to start recording okay so
that was the case when you're using
Internet Explorer for your recording
browser in case you're using Firefox you
have to have open script web done
extension enabled in your Firefox
browser otherwise again open script will
not be able to start the recording and
typically you'll get this error message
Connecticut the connection from a
browser helper after 15 seconds okay
so let me show you what are the
supported browsers for the 12.1 version
of the open script so open sweet foot 12
one supports Internet Explorer version
up to nine and Firefox version up to six
and we are planning to support the
Firefox version 10 ESR extended support
3ds in the 12.2 released which is coming
later this year we do hear a lot of
requests for supporting the higher
version of the firefox browser well as
for the total one it is Firefox version
up to six is the latest version we
support and at the right hand side you
see browsers and application which opens
give total one does not support at this
point and actually the ie9 and Firefox 6
browser support is a new feature in
total one if you're using 9.3 one
version of the open script we only
support Internet Explorer version up to
eight in the Firefox version three point
six
okay the next topic is reading the
script commands so you recorded the
script and use ugly commands written
down into the script but what are they
if you take a closer look at each of the
commands you'll see them in the like
this example in the screen this is when
you see the code in a Java code view
they have a form of expense action
format and XPath is a logic how opens
with identify the object and in this
example the blue part is expand and
click is action and you'll see many of
them in the script and what open script
does at the playback is to execute them
one by one until it gets to the end of
the script and here is how you can read
the XPath and this is the example when I
recorded a transaction for typing my
email address on the text box and
there's a number one to five and
actually one to four is the XPath and
what open script does is when executing
this command is first it will try to
find a window which has an attribute
title single sign-on login and it opens
could find that window and with that
within that window it will try to find a
document which is index 0 and within
that document it tries to find try to
find a form that has an attribute name
equals the login form
and if we find stat form then we'll try
to find an object to input which is type
text then I has an attribute as your
name SSO username or index 0 and the if
opens could find the object right and
finally we will try to enter my email
address onto the text box if open script
failed to find any of the attribute or
the object the arm in front one to four
they open to complain and give you an
error message to the object not fun only
when open sector was able to find the
object then it will try to execute the
action on to that object
okay so objects are identified one with
moral attributes and the open script is
using XPath as a syntax once that is
what we have learned in the previous
slide and this is the concept of object
identification which refers to on how
objects are located within your
application so that open script can
playback your script and also able to
identify the object and when you do the
object test and then order table test
and object attributes are recorded based
on the object identification rules and
you can specify this in an open circuit
preference and dialogue and we provide a
set of predefined object identification
rules which we believe works the best
but this is customizable and you can you
can customize this object identification
rule to best go with your application
and any application has a kind of
different set of the behavior and
separate object identification rules
apply for the separate technology module
so we have well from 0 ATF each of the
module has a different set of the object
identification rows the bottom side of
screen you see two diagrams which is the
object identification dialog and
basically what they allow you to do is
to you can define what set of attributes
you want to use to identify a particular
object okay so next topic is the
playback so let's play back your script
which you recorded so here is the super
basic steps to playback your script
first hit the record button to start the
playback this triangle button in the
toolbar and when you do that the browser
is going to launch and going to repeat
the same exact same transaction you have
done during the recording when the
playback is finished you will see the
playback result and also the on the
session reports in HTML format and this
is a closer look and the playback result
it will provide
you the details of script playback we
will show the duration of the each
command how long it took to execute to
each command and also the status which
is failed or passed and also some of the
data which was used during the execution
of the each command and in case you have
a script evader you also give you an
information on the error message and in
this case you can object not found error
and here are the Express which you can
identify which object was caused to fail
this script and mentioned earlier open
script restores two sets of data
so just as we store the recorded
information we also store the contents
information returned from the server
during the playback so if you select a
node in the script view then it will
show the contents information in the
details view if you select a node in the
result P which is bottom's on the screen
and it will show the contents
information returned from the server at
the playback and that includes screen
shot HTML and rendered HTML and also the
HTML done these are the same set of the
I information you also saw it at the
recording time but in addition you can
have a comparison view they playback
result which allows you to compare the
recorded in playback information and
which allows you to narrow down to the
cause in case with a script Vader if you
have any in the next section we will
talk about the basics of the customizing
your script by adding script assets
which are data bank objective Ivory's
tell the scripts and also user defined
functions ok so once you have a script
that can playback the next thing we want
to do is the data parameterization which
you can take a single script and run it
back with the multiple data inputs for
example you may want to run with a
different user ID or with a different
approaches order down drives a script an
open script provider
easy way of doing this by adding a data
bank as a script asset using data bank
you can substitute the script inputs
with variables that are associated with
the external data files we support CSV
and text file in a worker database as a
external indirect files there is a
feature of the current version of total
one but in the 1202 we are planning to
support the microsoft excel as a
external data sources file the dialogue
here I'm sorry the diagram here shows
the steps on how you can configure the
data bank and we will see this later in
the product demonstration next asset is
the object library object the paths are
specified in script with the XPath
notation but this can make the script to
lengthy and may be difficult to read so
as an option you can store the object
path in external object to the every
file and leave the script with the
simple object names for example in the
screenshot below in the screen there are
two code snippets the upper side is the
original script without object library
so you can see the expanse is this red
part here hard-coded into the script and
on the other hand the lower side is when
the object library is enabled you can
see the size difference this is the only
one command but if you have a 70 steps
in your script the size difference can
be significant and here are the steps to
configure an object every basically
there are two way of doing this one is
the select apply object libraries from
the meaning in the another is to go
directly into the script properties
dialog and add object library as a
script set as your case the point is you
have to do this before recording the
script and once you have done that then
you see the wizard dialog which you can
select to create a new library or apply
an existing library to your script then
you are all set when you start the
recording next time you will see the
object panel
taking out to the external object a
library file the next script asset is
the child scripts open script can have
multiple child scripts run from the
master JavaScript and why do you want to
do this it is typical that production
test flows have many steps and if you
try to implement that into a single
script that can make the street very
large in size and complex which makes
the script very hard to maintain hard to
debug so the solution is you can ma
july's the master test flow into a
multiple missile test flows and
implement those missile test flows into
multiple child scripts and you can run
them from the master driver script and
here are the steps to add a child script
to your master driver script first you
can create a master driver script which
is just a liquor web script and then
select a node in the script view and
right mouse click to show the menu ad
and this will launch the ad window which
allows you to manually insert the
command into the your script and here
you select run script and this will open
a list of the script which you can
select as a child script and once you
have done that this is how you see in
your script you'll see the run script
command added to your script and the
child 1 child 2 here are the script
names you have chosen from the the list
and by going through this process what
actually happening is the script is
adding these JavaScript as in script
asset into the master driver script so
if you go to the master driver script
and open it up the script properties
file then you'll see these two scripts
added as a script asset so that is the
current feature into the one and as an
option actually this is a new feature in
toad 1 you can also skip this entire
process and then load and run a child
script dynamically at the runtime and
without adding as a script asset so in
the red rectangle here run script
command which is default work to show
the three default is actually in the
repository and work to the workspace and
childÃ­s tree in the script names and
argument one here is the number of
iteration you want to run down script so
it is actually pointing the location of
the script and loading and running
dynamically from the script this is a
new feature in the total one and this is
about the script but in addition to the
script in twelve learn release also how
the new feature to dynamically load
other script assets as data bank and
also functions okay so the last script
asset is a user-defined function if you
have common transaction or repeated code
then you can take that out from the
original code and store in the separate
location and define as an ax function
and you can create a local function
within your script or create a dedicated
functional every script and place all
your functions in that script and share
among other script or other users in
your team and here are the steps to
create a local function first create a
script and select a node in the script
field and right mouse click to select
add and this is going to show up the add
window and just as we saw in the
previous slide and here you select a new
function and click OK and this is going
to launch up a dialog which assist you
to create a function template you can
sake the name of the function in here I
select I typed my local function and you
can type the description there and also
you can add arguments if you needed to
and after that and here the function
template is created and you may want to
add your code to make your function more
meaningful and once you create your
function you might you want to call that
function so how to call the local
function so this is a local function
the same script from the same script
select the node and right mouse click
and the select add the same and dialogue
is going to open up but in this case
please note the I see my local function
this is a function I created in my
previous slide so you'll see the your
custom function name appear in the add
window select tab and actually I skipped
one dialogue here but since I have
defined my argument so it will pop up
another dialog which allows you to enter
the argument value in there but this is
how you see when your local function
call is implemented so the red rectangle
here this is the function call and here
my local function this is the functional
function declaration okay so that was
how to create a local function calling a
function from your local script
everything is done in one script well
you may want to share your functions
with other scripts or other members in
your team in that case what you can do
is to create a dedicated function
library and share among the others and
the steps are very easy first go to the
script users and just like you create
your regular web script and before
clicking Next button
please note here you have checkbox
saying create script as a function
library this is a new feature in the
12.1 in 9 to 3 1 you didn't have this
checkbox here in this dialogue and when
you check this dialogue and click next
you'll see dialogue like this which
allows you to specify a unique package
name or and also close thing and if you
don't check this a the checkbox you're
not going to see this dialog and you
just going to create a web script okay
so after you receive a unique package
name in your class name and click finish
after that's all done and if you take a
close look at your script directly
you'll see live directly created in your
script directly and in the level of the
script you don't have this directly and
this is where the un-- function on
library files are
located in total one we actually have
rewritten the way how functional Avery's
are configured so if your 9.31 users or
9.3 users and have a function library in
the old format it is recommended to
convert to the new format in total 1 and
this is because we have a new feature
introduced in total one in this area
that only works with the new format and
you can still use the old for mental but
it is highly recommended to convert them
to the new format because another reason
they may be deprecated in future so here
are the steps to convert nidal next
format function library to the new
format first open the function library
in open script and go to menu tools and
select convert to function library then
rest of the procedures actually the same
you'll see the same dialog which you saw
in a previous slide and you specify the
unique package name your class name and
click finish and actually that's done
and this is also a same procedure to
convert regular script into a function
library script so if you wanted to
create a function library but you
actually missed it check that checkbox
we saw in a previous slide then this
option will give you a second chance to
convert the script into the function
library script ok so you have written
your function library script and but how
can you call the function from that
function library basically you have to
add the function library script as a
script asset in the calling script so
you have your functions library script
ready once that is done go to the
calling script and then open up the
script properties dialog and add the
function library script as a script
asset once you have done that in the
calling script you can see the functions
available in the function library file
either from the code view and from the
tree view and actually this code assist
in the code view is the new feature into
the one
in the total alone when you type the
library name and then type of period and
press Enter it will show up tooltips
that has a list of the available
function names you can select any also
able to see the what arguments are
available in those information but this
is a new feature in Twitter one and it
using 9.31 version there were no way to
see these information from the code view
and the attention to the 9.31 users we
have actually changed the syntax how you
can call the function library in Twitter
one so before a 12 1 which is 9 2 3 1
the syntax for calling function was get
scripted call function now the in 1201
is a library name dot function name
although the total one version open
scale supports both syntax but it is
highly highly recommended to use the the
new format as the code assist feature is
only available in the new format ok in
the next section let's see what we have
learned in actual product so this is the
open script product so I have one script
open and if I select one of the node in
a web page it shows the detailed
information recording if I select one of
the node in the playback result it will
show the detail information for the
playback I also see the comparison view
okay now I'm going to do is to going to
create a new script by selecting this
button new and this is the actually the
list of the oxidizers we have in the
total one Middies I have functional
testing I see orko EBS forms or
confusion ATF Siebel and have a similar
set of scripting load testing as well
and this demo I'm going to select the
functional testing well I'm going to
click Next and name my script name in
matrix 66 and this is manuscript I'm
going to start the recording by pressing
this record button
this is going to launch up the browser I
can type the URL of the application I
want to navigate but this time I'm going
to click this link in a tool bar to open
up the application I want to navigate to
this is a sample application comes with
the wave logic application medical
records application I'm going to insert
to enter the user name and password and
click Submit and as I navigate through
the browser's you can see the commands
are inserted into the script you see the
click text box set text box a password
click button these are the gray commands
that is going to be passed the browser
when I play back this script and
actually it is not only the command
record in interest rate but if I set the
way for page note in the scrip you it
can actually see the screenshot
information HTM information browser and
Dom tree information that was returned
from the server during the recording so
we are not just so I'm recording the
script command but also storing the
information returned from the server ok
I'm going to continue my transaction by
clicking this link and as you can see
the new nodes are added to the script
I'm going to click click this profile
and I'll go so this is the end of my
recording I'm going to click the desktop
button in the toolbar to stop the
transaction ok all right now I'm going
to play back the script by playing back
this richtung huh so this triangle
button playback and what actually
happens is then it is going to launch
your browser and navigate through the
big song transaction I have done during
the recording click profile logout and
this is the end of the end to playback
ok ok so now I have a result in the
result view if I expand this I can see
an information the how long it took to
execute each command
the result expected all past and also
the information I entered during the
recording so I see bali-ba calm this is
the username I typed during recording
and if I select one national waiver page
it shows screenshot HTM information
browser information which is rendered
HTML Dom tree of the selected node at
the playback and also the comparison
information so I have I'm recorded and
played back information showed us how
ending I can see some of the session ID
our difference between so I'm not
selecting the content information I can
also select the browser which will
render the HTML and also the screenshot
okay okay so this is the basics of 3m
the recorded recording and playback now
I want to parameterize this the value I
entered during the recording I'm going
to double click this node and then I can
see that the body is the hard-coded I'm
going to click this substitute variable
button which is going to open up this so
substitute variable window I'm going to
select add new data bank and I'm going
to select the CSV file and since I know
this CSV file has the data I wanted to
use so I'll select this a BTEC dot CSV
and I'm going to select the user name as
a on the column that I want to use to
substitute this value it has a list of
the other user name Fred golf calm very
very calm I want to click finish and the
value is the parameter s and yes you can
still see the body but comment it but
this is a default value which is going
to be used in case you are not able to
take the value from the their data bank
this is option you can still remove this
if you don't want to have a default body
and click OK ok so now I am going to
play back script but I want to iterate
this script so I'll click I trait button
from the toolbar and since I don't want
to run more than two
so just change the two and click OK
and now the Blazer is lunch and the take
a little closer the username I actually
use this to Fred golf comm Institute a
palpable calm and now it's actually more
in a second iteration and using the user
ID dari bball calm so if I expand this
and then we'll see again see which lab
data actually you state the use of Fred
dr. Fred golf talk on for the first
iteration and here's the very V pod calm
for the second iteration ok ok ok so
let's take a look at the script
properties so um since I added a data
bank what happens the back of the
background is actually um I have I was
adding the CSV file as a script asset
into this script okay so that was a lot
of the data bank now I'm going to create
another script and name Meldrick well 66
and this is my script and I'm going to
record the script but before that let me
add an object library to this file I'm
going to create my new object library
and click OK and let's take a look at
the script properties what happening is
that the I actually added the SQL this
object to file as a script asset to my
script now I'm going to record the
script going to the same application I
recorded earlier this
the medical record application for calm
password and click Submit I'm going to
stop the recording at this point and as
you can see what is recorded into the
script if we compare them to the MD the
script I recorded it earlier actually
they were recording the same application
same transaction however the know what
is recorded in the script is actually
different so let's take a look at this
in Java code view so at the left side is
that without object library you can see
the X staff hard-coded into the script
and the right-hand side is the the
script with the object library which I
just recorded and these are the same
command but you can see how short the
the command is although they recorded
the same transaction so we actually
where is this one path stored I can see
that indeed by selecting and finding
objects Lavery this is going to open the
object library file and actually it was
store installed here I can either see
from the on the on the tree view or the
empty the textual expanse in Java code
view okay alright so now I'm going to
create another script well name a master
66 and I want to create a on the master
driver script which is just basically
these just a web script and I'm going to
add a child script and I want to run
from the script what I'm going to do is
to select run also routed right mouse
click
like to add other and going to open the
general run script new and this will
show the list of the childÃ­s scripted
IO I'm able to add as a child script so
I'm going to select two metrics 66 and
metric oil 66 which is we just created
and click OK select post click OK and
that's it so in my master 66 script I
have two scripts configured as a child
script now I want to run the script
click playback and now it is going to
open up the browser and it starts the
first script and gravity running the on
file first magic 66 now running the
second script and it's done ok let's
take a look at the way back result I can
see each other script and two of the
child is good to run successfully in
this master script and I can also see
the the playback information in detail
for each script I don't have to go into
the each of the the script which is
added as a child script and if I take a
look at the script properties you can
see the the scripts are added as a
JavaScript okay alright next I'm going
to do is to create another script and I
want to create a dedicated function
library 66 and before click finish I'm
going to check this button create a
script as a function library and click
Next
I'm going to the adding a specified
unique package and class name I'm going
to accept the default value and click
finish
ok so this is my scripted ivory I'm
going to add a function they add other
and this time I'm going to the local
script
new function click ok my French six to
six and I'm going to add one argument
string argument and click OK
we are ok so this is my a script
template I'm going to Java code and add
one line ok so this is my function local
function in this script rivalry I'm
going to call this function from this
script so I'm going to call a local
function so if I go into if I open up
the add dialog I can see the the
function name I just created so I'm
going to select now click OK and I can
actually enter the argument value in the
dialogues I'm going to enter hello and
click OK
ok so I'm going to run the script if I
expand the comments are logged as hello
so the Mike local function was called
from my local script so this is the
local function call now I want to call
my function my function other script
since this is the I already configures
the script dedicated scripted ivory I
can call this function from other script
what I'm going to do is create a new we
have script going 66 this is just a wave
script and I want to call this my leave
66 script but I don't see from my script
function so what I need to do is to go
to the script properties and select the
script add and select the mildly of 66
as my script proper script asset apply
ok now let's go back to the add dialogue
okay now I see the function name from
this is the function library I just
added a descriptor set and this is the
function I created within that script
library I'm going to click OK
okay so um this time I will type
I'm step and click OK
alright let's play back the script and
script read a kiss done ok ok so this
was a quick demonstration for the what
we have learned in the previous slides
regarding the how to record and playback
to eat basic open script functional
testing script and also the basics of
the in customizing your script by adding
the script asset ok the next section
talks about opt-ins great features in
current and future releases this slide
shows a list of new features for opening
screen functional testing in 1201
we have actually already gone through
many of them during session for example
dynamical loading of script asset are
the new feature of the Twitter one we
have talked about the child script
actually then applied to the data banks
and functions you can load these script
asset dynamically at runtime without any
UI interactions you don't have to add as
a script set but you can dynamically
load from your code base and another
major feature in total one for the open
script functional testing area is the
new version of the function library we
have gone through how to create a
function library how to convert the old
format the new format and also the
browser support ie9 and firefox 6
support is also discussed this is the
end of the recording of the application
testing suite open script functional
testing or review thank you for
