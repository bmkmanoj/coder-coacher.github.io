for jboss I basically in charge of all
of a wuss engineering and today to talk
about says Java everywhere his Java
really ready for for the mobile wave is
it ready for cloud so we're gonna give a
quick overview of where we are today the
hardware forces that are brought us to
this point talk about mobile and cloud
and what their expectations are what the
requirements are and try and put this
into the context of what this actually
means for for Java middleware and over
there'll be time to go over briefly
about the future of Java and standards I
know that there's been a lot of concerns
over the last few years about you know
Java as an open vibrant standard
organization and you know particularly
in the area of mobile and cloud and then
kind of give you an idea of whether
whether we can whether we're really done
whether we don't really have to do too
much more research and development to
address mobile and cloud so to kind of
set the context this is I suppose high
performance computing of 30 years ago I
don't know many people hopefully more
than myself in the room who recognized
one or two of these we've got what's
called a Whitechapel over there is
basically the UK's equivalent of a Sun
360 we got a 6502 processor a bit yes we
did have 8-bit machines back then we've
got what could be described as a mass
storage device which is a five and a
quarter inch floppy disk and there's a
zx81 1k of RAM unless you got the 16k
expansion pack that you put on the back
and held in place with a milk bottle
well if anybody's used one you'll know
that I'm not exactly joking there and
the milk bottle was also really good
heat sink so you know back then as I
said 8-bit
processor wireless wireless was
literally something that people listen
to when they didn't have television it
wasn't Wi-Fi 10 mega mega @ % ethernet
that was just kind of getting roll it
rolled out into universities back in the
you know the 80s and if you had that you
know you were basically on the world's
backbone what many people on there i
remember receive you know if you
received a single email in the day from
some of the other side of the world it
was an event no spam did not exist at
that point and today it's significantly
different you know we have phones with
512 a gig of memory with many more
gigabytes of storage whether that's
actually onboard storage or with you
know a microSD card where you stick it
in down the bottom there we have a 256
gig USB stick there's actually a 512 gig
USB stick that you can now buy on the
market and obviously we have you know 10
gig Ethernet most people have said he
met megabit per second connections into
their home maybe even even faster over
here I'm kind of going by what what's
almost common in the UK and Europe you
know we're definitely many many many
generations away from the old Abe Meg S
or T 8-bit processor with 64-bit quad
cores in laptops and Wi-Fi in many many
cities in the US and kind of rolling out
into similarly in Europe so things are
very very different now than they were
30 years ago and just to kind of hammer
that home a little bit more but we have
a motorola 68000 40 chip here which is
what was one of the backbone processors
from the 1990s it was actually at the
heart of that machine i showed you
before the whitechapel and also used in
some some very early spur Sun machines
here we have from five years ago a
16-bit microcontroller which is about
the eighth the size of a penny
and it's more powerful than that 60 8040
and it also has a tcp stack so you can
communicate with it if you know the
protocol you know its IP address from
pretty much anywhere on the planet and
that's five years ago unfortunately
couldn't get a nice image for what its
successors are today but you know if you
fast-forward five years you can imagine
it's out there going to be a lot smaller
or it's going to and or it's going to
have orders of magnitude more processing
power and probably a lot more memory on
board as well if we look at where we
were just over a decade ago in terms of
Java you know we had j2se 13 we were
candid in between j2ee 1.2 and 1.3 your
typical laptop configuration and I know
because at that point i work for HP and
we were getting these hot off the hot
off the presses if you like they were
their cutting-edge machines was a 1
gigahertz pentium 3 with 512 mega memory
and 20 gig of disk and i thought i'll
never fill 20 gig at disk and you could
run the full j2ee stack there so you
know we were running the the Bluestone
app server or the HP app server as it
was renamed on these machines quite
nicely and you know doing editing an
email and now and then maybe were
processing at the same time mobile
devices were also kind of starting to
embrace Java in those days and again you
know using HP as a reference because
that's where I was but one of the
popular devices that HP was putting at
that point was called an HP janata and
they had various versions of it and the
720 here was kind of a clamshell thing
with a keyboard and screen and a pen and
it ran windows ce and you know it was 32
bit they to Meg machine where you had to
split the mem the memory between storage
and and runtime memory and it ran HP
zone JDK and those day in those days
called chai you could run some
components of j2ee on it we did you know
we we had transaction service running on
it
but young I say to make a memory okay
JVMs back then were a lot smaller than
jvms are today but even with a 2 mega
memory you were starting to push the
capability of how much storage you had
and also the the processing power of the
the device itself does anybody remember
an HP gene out of 720 ok just aged over
10 years here's a graph I found to again
try and hammer home the differences
between today roughly today and a decade
ago so this is from 2010 showing integer
floating-point performance
characteristics of a range of first
generation if you like smartphone
processors versus the very same pentium
3 that i mentioned before that was you
know cutting edge in two thousand and
with the exception of floating point
which you can kind of pretty much
understand certainly back then you've
got a nexus one with snapdragon
processor pretty much comparable with a
pentium three and again that's two years
ago so you know we've just seen the the
iphone 5 being released with an a6
processor many of the Android devices
was there samsung s3 or the pads have
quad-core NVIDIA Tegra processors so you
know if somebody was to do the same
experiments I'm convinced that most of
the bars would be much closer this way
and the Pentium 3 would be much further
that way and eventually you know in
another two or three years it's kind of
going to get lost in the noise and
hopefully most people in this room have
heard of one or more of these things a
very heard of a Raspberry Pi gooseberry
board beagleboard very very similar
things Raspberry Pi $29 hdmi output you
you can you know stream high-definition
video across this thing if you can get
it on board Ethernet USB 2 it has a
processor that is pretty powerful much
more powerful than the Pentium 3 say
for the beagleboard and the goose berry'
yeah the goose berry' is something that
came out a few months back which is very
very similar these and the the Raspberry
Pi is probably the lower end of the
spectrum because it is only like twenty
nine dollars the BeagleBoard is like a
hundred dollars one hundred and fifty
dollars these are all more powerful than
that pentium three significantly more
powerful and yet you know twenty-nine
dollars so if we look where Java is
today we have you know se7 pretty soon
we're going to have se8 we've got EE 6
next April will hopefully have a seven a
typical laptop configuration you know
2.2 gigahertz quad-core i7 four gig of
memory in fact that's probably on the
low side now eight gig seems to be
becoming the norm 500 gig disk and not
necessarily a traditional disk with
cylinders a solid state drive you know
Apple has kind of popularized that and
that configuration is sufficient to run
many more than one instance of a full ee
6 stack potentially on different
operating systems at the same time
because of virtualization smartphone so
I've got a galaxy s2 referenced here but
that's because I wrote this before the
s3 came out but you know dual-core
running it android for ah and it is
sufficient because i know because we've
done this but sufficient for the galaxy
s2 to be able to run many if not all of
the e6 components and an application
server on it and in fact now I am I was
going to miss the slide but one of the
slides that I thought I could have put
in here was actually going to show you
something that we we demoed at jboss
world Red Hat summit earlier this year
it was that we ran the full e6 profile
not the web profile but the full e6
profile of our application server on a
Raspberry Pi unmodified it didn't crash
it ran okay may not necessarily have
been as performant as you might like but
like I said you know the Raspberry Pi is
it's it's constrained but we didn't have
to make any changes to to the pie or to
the application server so let's talk
briefly about cloud you know we've heard
a lot about cloud at Java on this year
and last year and the year before and
you know even if you never been to a
Java one before in your life unless you
know unless you were squirreled away on
some island somewhere I don't think you
could have avoided cloud everybody is
has cloud as a buzzword in one way or
another public clouds are probably the
thing that's captured the public
perception more than anything else at
the moment with the likes of amazon but
i actually think that private clouds are
much more important whether you whether
you want to call them private clouds or
on-premise some of the issues with with
public clouds around reliability and
security tend not to be issues in a
private infrastructure so I actually
think I said private cloud is probably
going to be much more important in the
future but given everything that I've
said before about all these devices that
we've got whether they're in your mobile
phones whether their sensors whether
they're in your your your washing
machine or your you know your coffee
percolator I think that these are really
the cloud this is what the cloud is
going to become and about a decade or so
ago IBM and HP we're talking about the
the term they coined was ubiquitous
computing it was Everything Everything
Everywhere would have a processor and
one of the examples that that i was
using back then was that your light bulb
would have an IP address and you'd be
able to log onto it or maybe not
necessarily log on but certainly send a
message to switch itself on and often
and in query its status back then a
decade ago it was really blue sky
research you know it was it was
something too
of aim for but the technology wasn't
really there the hardware was not up to
this yeah it certainly wasn't as
powerful or as cheap as it is today but
it is now certainly is with everything
I've shown you before hopefully and
funnily enough last year I actually ran
into somebody who probably has more
money than sense but they've just built
a house and somewhere somebody is
manufacturing light bulbs that have IP
addresses and you can log onto them
inning switch them on and off and you
can find out their status so you know
ubiquitous computing is a reality today
it's no longer just blue sky research
there are processes out there in
everything that you're buying today I
mean I used the example of a washing
machine earlier but that's simply
because I have a washing machine it's
two years old and it has a processor and
that beats the Pentium 3 i was using 10
years or so ago has more memory if I can
just find out what protocol it uses I
can connect to it through TCP stack and
maybe I can use it to rip some DVDs Wade
sits idle most of the time so you know
that's exactly what i want to do you
know most these processes are idle you
want to tie into them you only use them
when when they're not being used for
something else however mobile is
actually very very important for cloud
as well as anybody heard of Shannon's
limit okay well I encourage you after
this to just go and look at Shannon's
limit a try I think there are some wiki
pages on it I'm never too sure about you
know how good wiki wiki czar try and
find some some more research papers on
the idea but basically you all you'll
understand what Shannon's limit is about
it because you love you love experienced
it cloud today so any public cloud today
works very very well because not
everybody is using it if everybody
starts to use public cloud whether it's
amazon Rackspace or whatever our
networks will not cope the networks will
become saturated because even if you're
pushing a lot of data to the cloud you
still need to do queries you still want
to get answers back from the confirm the
data that's being computed
and whether those answers are small 16
24 bytes or you know megabytes it
doesn't matter if everybody it's a six
or seven billion people who are on the
planet start using public cloud the
networks will get saturated and it's
going to take a long time for us to
update our networks Shannon's limit is
pretty much that in a nutshell so thin
clients as we tend to use today for
cloud they're fine up to a point but
mobile devices and more intelligence in
the in the infrastructure between
ourselves in the cloud whether it's my
laptop or you know or a gateway that's
that's going to have to become the norm
we're going to be doing a lot more
between our front ends and our clouds in
the infrastructure itself so with all
this with with clouds and with mobile
and I say cloud cloud has kind of been
on the proverbial hype hype curve for a
number of years mobile for maybe this
the same maybe slightly less I've heard
a number of these quotes on red a number
of these quotes in one way or another
the first one is well okay this is very
very important stuff cloud and mobile
but middleware has absolutely nothing to
do with it middleware is a 20th century
technology you know middleware is call
but middleware is DC middleware is net
we don't need middleware anymore but
yeah we have heard that many many times
when Web Services came along Web
Services was the death of middleware the
web when it came along it was going to
be the death of middleware and and
literally when Java came along in 96 it
was the death of the middleware that
that happened before it korber so it
wasn't true then what makes anybody
think it's true today middleware evolves
and then there's looking at mobile is
mobile needs new frameworks and
languages but the most popular mobile
development platforms today either use a
dialect of Java or objective c we all
know job has been around for well over a
decade objective-c predates Java by you
know almost a decade
they're not new languages okay we're
seeing a lot of work on JavaScript but
even that has been around for quite a
while and then there's the well okay but
cloud cloud needs completely new
infrastructures it needs completely new
services nothing now we have done in the
past is relevant for cloud well I think
that that's BS as well and I don't I
honestly try not to say that because I'm
Red Hat and yes we have a cloud offering
I'm trying to type trying to be
objective here because I think cloud if
it's to deliver on what it's what it's
been what we've been told it will
deliver on its it's kind of offshoring
if you like is another way of thinking
about it's taking your investments if
you want to move to public cloud and
giving them to somebody else to manage
but it's taking your existing
investments if you have to re-implement
all of your applications in order to
move them to the cloud then I think
cloud is not delivering on on its value
proposition and again if you look at the
most popular languages in cloud today
they're java there Ruby PHP Perl and
JavaScript which and a few others which
have all been around for a very long
time and they're all being used to it to
run existing applications there's also a
reality which percolates through all of
this whether it's it's probably more
specific to mobile at this point than it
is to cloud but many people look at
these areas and think well you know why
do we need middleware well particularly
when we're just running games another
thing that a lot of people use their
mobile device for all their pads is
reading the news or run playing angry
birds well you know there's variation of
Parkinson's Law which you know if you if
you looked back at what I had for some
of the machines that were 30 years ago
whether it's a zx81 or or a BBC model B
yes when they came out most people were
playing games on them or writing games
but quite soon after that we were doing
word processors on them and quite soon
after that the pc came along and then
the pc challenge the mainframe the kinds
of applications that we see that we've
seen over the last 30 odd years I that
have come on to these these new hardware
frontiers have grown in complexity quite
quickly after they've come along because
there's so much power around people it's
natural for people for developers to
find new uses for them as I said you
know if I could find a way of connecting
to my washing machine I would find a use
that the guys who put it together we're
probably not have even thought about so
see ya this is pretty much what I've
said already but the types of
applications are increasing in
complexity you know if you look at the
web the web today is significantly
different to what Tim berners-lee
imagined when he first put out you know
the first HTTP so it's not just a site
for serving documents we're doing online
commerce today the web is a backbone it
you know billions and billions of
dollars are generated on the web today I
don't think that Tim berners-lee had
that in mind when he when he produced
the first web server many of our
interactions now our peer-to-peer
they're not just client-server they are
increasingly complex and as they become
more complex they need more more
requirements that things that we pretty
much take for granted but they start to
need security and identity you know the
web works today because we have pretty
good security infrastructures in place
they start to need to have high
performance low latency reliable
messaging even I've got an example in
second so I'll show you that for mobile
the apps are now that we study developed
on on both Android and an iphone and
especially in the cloud aren't needing
distributed transactions updating
multiple databases updating something
and sending a message and we're starting
to see workflow based apps on mobile and
environments whether that's pads or
phones so here's an example of what I
mean by this so as I said before a lot
of the apps that we're now seeing are
having peer to peer interactions there's
no central coordinator for EM for
driving interactions between different
peers or different clients of different
servers this is a
is supposed to pick Tori represent
something a nap i was introduced to last
october or november before i start i
it's important that I'd say it's based
on social networking who's got facebook
account probably quite a lot of people
yeah so I'm not I'm not on the closest
thing I come to social network use
Twitter I don't do facebook in reality
my idea of a good social network is pub
on a friday night at five o'clock with a
few beers but apparently so this is
where it kind of goes off the edge a
little bit since i don't use facebook
you know please correct me if i start
use the wrong terms were apparently
Facebook has this concept of a wall
where you post things and Facebook
maintains its data and in their terms
and conditions they can or maybe they
can't now because they may have changed
things but they could do whatever they
wanted with that data and those and
those photographs that you might post
they could use them for advertising
purposes well as a research group in at
other MIT or CMU I decided that they
love social networking they love the
idea of facebook but they don't like the
idea of having a single site that
maintains this data so they have
developed a peer-to-peer social
networking infrastructure where there's
still a concept of a wall but only the
peers that are involved in the
conversations actually see the wall and
if you join you see the wall because it
you get a copy of it but as soon as you
leave the group the war vanishes you
cannot see the wall unless you're
involved in that in that conversation
and you can have different walls for
different groups different conversations
so they've implemented this they've
implemented on our Android and an iphone
and they needed a lot of the things that
you know we kind of take for granted
they needed high-performance messaging
they also had to do transactions because
they want to do they did to want to do
some state updates and they also needed
security that was very very critical to
them because as I said they did not want
a single organization whether it's a
facebook or whether it's even a CMU or
an MIT to maintain this wall information
it could only go to people who were
authorized to see it ie those people who
were involved in the in the chat
here's another example of how things are
changing you might think that maybe on
the left is a picture of call of duty
and on the right is a picture of halo
these aren't actually from consoles
there from the equivalents on mobile
devices and I actually think if you know
if you look at the way mobile devices
whether it's phones or pads have evolved
over the last couple of years and you
look at the way in which consoles have
evolved as in Playstations and Xbox and
the wii it's I don't think it should be
surprising to hear that I think that the
next generation of consoles will be the
last generation of consoles I don't
think we'll see a play station 5 or an
xbox you know 2,000 mobile devices are
so much so much more powerful today than
a ps3 and they gets going to keep going
that way I think the infrastructure is
going to change so maybe the Sony's in
the Microsoft of the world will just
make more money from games and they host
their own infrastructure their own
private cloud for people to do these
online collaborative games but there
really isn't a lot to be made by having
a console that's outdated within a year
of you bringing it out so just to kind
of recap some of the things that I've
said what I'm talking about ubiquitous
computing you know I'm talking about a
range of different types of devices
including obviously laptops desktops
mainframes but you know we've got
smartphones and tablets we've got you
know feel service or warehouse devices
somebody takes one of these things goes
around warehouse and does stopped it
stopped taking and then we've got the
embedded or the unattended sensors
whether that sensors on railway tracks
to check whether where the train is
sensor in your fridge or your or your
washing machine and all of these are
very very powerful very very capable
machines and and processes
and if you look at the types of apps
that people are developing today in the
mobile environment and in the ubiquitous
computing environment you've got the
devices down the side they've got IDs it
shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody
who's in this room as a developer that
other developers may be outside of the
Java world are using IDEs it's you know
I do use existed before Java and they
want to connect them to their bakit
back-end services they want to connect
them to their relational database you
know that they want to connect them to
Facebook and Twitter and they're using
HTTP they may be using rest over
different transports you know they're
they're using SMS in some cases or
they're using their own bespoke
high-performance messaging solutions and
obviously html5 plays a role in here
today hopefully all of this should sound
very very familiar to most if not
everybody in this room because
everything that I've indicated people
are needing whether it's messaging a
security are things like I said we've
taken for granted for years we've had
them in j2ee and we've got them in you
know II six and we're going to have them
for many years to come they're they're
not because when we were developing the
Java Enterprise middleware stacks we
thought these things were would be nice
to have they're there because they built
on the middle west acts that came before
them whether that was a cobra or DC etc
there these requirements do not change
it does not matter i think whether
you're developing an enterprise app in
the cloud or mobile or an enterprise app
for mainframes these requirements are
consistent and constant but obviously
you know java is not the only language
that people use you know i've referenced
objective-c reference pearl and PHP and
ruby but interesting interestingly there
are a lot of popular JVM based languages
out there today I did account a few
months back in there were you know well
over a dozen and a half if not close to
two dozen depending on how you define a
language from you know domain-specific
language or
a programming language but some of the
things some of the languages that run on
the JVM even surprised me I don't know
if anybody here remembers ADA there's an
ADA language that runs on the JVM and
obviously we've got python that runs on
the JVM possibly we should think about
renaming the JVM as a slight aside get
rid of the J because it really doesn't
stand for java anymore so yeah so before
2010 you know there was pretty much just
Java in the JVM then we made a change we
allowed the the JVM to run non Java
languages and here's an example example
of a few of them obviously there's Ruby
closure so jboss Red Hat is working on a
language course alone we've got jython
scarlet as there's many others it seems
today and you know I've been being
working in software for the best part of
30 years i I've seen languages come and
go I've never seen a language explosion
as I've seen over the last few years
there's just so many languages coming
and if a language doesn't start out on
the JVM it doesn't seem to be very long
before it becomes runnable on the JVM
you know there's Ruby there's also early
you know there's there's if anybody's
into our line you can run Erlang on the
JVM the JVM is a very very popular base
on which to run a language and I think
whether or not you like Java whether or
not you agree that maybe Java will will
decrease in popularity the JVM has a
much longer life span than any of the
languages that run on it today there's
just so much work has gone into the JVM
over the last decade that it makes a lot
of sense for people to want to leverage
it and you know if we look back to what
happened in 96 when you know son
released oak that was then renamed to
Java it didn't come into life with a
full enterprise middleware stack you
know there was no j2ee when Java first
came on the scene it took a few years
for us to get the first j2ee
and there are only two ways in which you
can really solve the problem adding
enterprise capabilities to to any
language but let's look at let's look at
how we did it with Java back in you know
96 298 you can either build those things
from scratch so you can say I'm going to
write my enterprise middleware in Java
one hundred percent pure Java so I'm
going to implement transactions
messaging security caching etc in Java
and no other language or you can
leverage existing implementations in
other languages so back in there you
know 96 we saw combination of these so
we saw some vendors going for the
hundred percent pure Java approach and
some vendors doing the latter with some
some implementation from scratch but
other but also layering Java over a thin
veneer a job or over something that was
written in C C++ or even cobalt because
ultimately you know you shouldn't as a
developer hopefully get to see the get
to see the cobalt so what does this mean
for Java middleware really as I said I
think that middleware is needed in in
the both of these evolving areas cloud
and mobile it's not specific to
mainframe servers and laptops just as it
wasn't specific to them in the past what
we need to do I think and this is kind
of what what red has doing but I think
it's not just a red hat thing it'sit's
Java developers that the whole java
community needs to try and do this is to
prevent mobile and cloud becoming new
silos becoming what we kind of had a
little bit when java and j2ee took over
from cawber becoming an area where
people do implement everything from
scratch just because they want to so
like I said you know there were these
two approaches back in 96 298 and those
groups that implement it from scratch
didn't always implement from scratch
because it made good technical sense
they did it because here's a nice new
cool language I want to learn it and I
want to convince
my boss or you know mess around with my
boss and tell him that it really is
better if we do it in this new language
rather than use something that he spend
money on and has been running nicely for
20 years and I know has no bugs we as a
community probably lost a few years
because people implemented things went
one hundred percent pure java approach
when really didn't need to do that I
think we should leverage a lot more of
what we've got I'm trying to suggest
that you know Java and the JVM are
really good platforms on which to build
even if you're not a Java developer even
if you're you know you're really into
Ruby or scholar re-implementing
everything from scratch is not what we
should be doing it's expensive and it's
time consuming and if we look at e6 you
know it's got pretty much everything I
think that we need may not need them in
the full p6 package you may want to pull
things out you know you may not want
security you may not want transactions
it's also standards-based which is very
very important in the cloud there's a at
this point unfortunate there is a lack
of standards which is kind of turning
back the clock allowing vendor lock-in
to start to dominate again but EE 6 is a
great evolution over the last 40 years
now i mentioned colbrunn dce it's got a
lot of the capabilities that we saw
people using whether it's rest or
high-performance messaging and e6 has
also had a lot of input from wider
community so it's really the first
implementation of the enterprise middle
west stack which was done in the open or
at least done some early semi in the
open and e7 is being done even more in
the open because of the changes we made
to the JCP so it's not just driven by
vendors for vendors we tried very very
hard with e6 to make it community
oriented as well and as I said you know
it has in it lots of things that we take
for granted whether that's transactions
persistence messaging security you know
various communication approaches whether
it's rest soap leaving not soap is still
used iop again if you if you've known
khobor then yes iop is still used
caching and management all these things
we tend as as Java developers and
certainly as Java middleware developers
to not really think about them which is
good we just if we want to trans
actually we create it we use it we end
it and that's it but if you step back
and you think about what went into maybe
just that's just defining that API
there's a lot of work gone into that and
then if you go back even further and
think about what's gone into
implementing the transaction service
underneath the covers there's a lot of
effort gone into that it's very very
similar arguments what I was saying
about the JVM there's a lot of man-hours
gone into the JVM likewise there's a lot
of man-hours gone into many of the
components that we you know we've come
to know and love in our favorite
application server and we shouldn't be
implementing them from scratch even if
it is in a completely new language or i
should say especially if it's in any
completely new language but you know
we've still got the detractors I have to
say I've heard a lot less detractors
this this year then I heard at javaone
last year for certainly for ie6 they say
you know well Java is bloated what they
really mean was maybe j2ee was bloated
in the past but you know you need to
differentiate from the implementation
from the standards there's absolutely
nothing if you read the e6 standard that
says you have to have a bloated
implementation you know this is like my
one marketing slide although it's not
marketing because it's it's actually the
truth you can implement a bloated
application server if you want to but
you don't have to you know if you if you
look at what we've gone and done with
with a s 7 which is re 6 compliant app
server it's extremely lightweight it
boots in in a second and that's the full
profile like I said we were running it
on a on a Raspberry Pi which it is
extremely resource constrained so if you
can do that the difference between
lightweight and heavy ways as gone
everything is lightweight
so I think again you know we need to
encourage adoption of the things that we
have been doing over the last decade or
so in the Java and the Java middleware
communities there are these new
communities as I say cloud and mobile
that rightly or wrongly at this point
are thinking about adding these
capabilities messaging etc and maybe
don't know about what exists elsewhere
or maybe think that because it's written
in Java it's completely it's not not
applicable to their domain and I think
we need to get out there we need to
embrace these communities and we need to
tell them that just because it's written
in Java does mean to say you have to use
it in Java we've got we got there's a
project called talk box which I don't
know if any of you've heard of but
basically it's a it's a ruby project
that has been developed by jboss
engineers who know Ruby and they've got
they've essentially it's an app server
but written in Ruby what they've done is
they've exposed some of the capabilities
messaging transactions that they get
from as7 in a way that is perfectly
consumable by the Ruby community but
they didn't go into that community like
storm troopers and saying this is how we
do it in Java so therefore this is how
you guys have to do it they went in and
they they became Ruby developers in fact
some of them don't want to come back as
Java developers but they came and they
understood what the Ruby community
wanted and they've exposed completely
new api's in Ruby that mean that many
people using tor box today do not even
know it's running on the app server they
know it's running on a JVM because it's
it's only jruby based but they don't
know that there's an app server running
under the covers the fact that a s7
boots in a second also helps there so I
think you know we need to be kind of
like the Ewoks and get it get involved
understand what these communities need
and try and persuade them not to
reinvent the wheel maybe some wheels do
need to be reinvented I'm not trying to
suggest that everything is perfect as I
said start middleware evolves it has
always evolved is going to continue to
evolve but I think there are some
perfectly good
girls out there that we should be
encouraging other people to use so just
quickly about the JCP standards you will
already have heard hopefully that the we
have two executive committees in the JCP
114 Emmy another for SCEE those are now
emerging and in fact they pretty much
have merged and we're now having an
election to have a single executive
committee there have been a number of
changes in the JCP over the last couple
of years and kind of mirroring the
changes that we've made in the way in
which e6 was developed getting much more
community involvement so there was a
time only a small number of years ago
where if you looked at the executive
committee you would have seen big bend a
big vendor big vendor you would have
seen no individuals and you certainly
wouldn't have seen any Java user groups
now we've got individual members and
we've got several big jar java user
groups there's the London Java youth
group and then the Sioux Java or the
biggest javi's group in the world
they're involved in the executive
committee so I think it's all for the
better as well because as I said you
know we're seeing it this influenced in
e6 and e7 and we're also seeing these
people who don't have any they don't
have their salaries aren't paid by the
number of units of you know jboss or
glassfish or whatever that gets old so
they have sometimes have the freedom to
say things that maybe one or two of us
would like to say but don't obviously
we've got you know JDK 18 e seven which
are more mobile and cloud friendly well
selling more mobile-friendly again I
don't know if you've seen the
announcement that happened in the last
day or so but in order to hit the e7
deadline of April next year we've had to
drop several of the things that were
making e7 more applicable for for cloud
modularity which was going to be in se8
that has already been pushed out so the
focus is really going to be much more
around mobile and hopefully we'll have
more
cloud in yet and se9 but I think we'll
see more of that in the community before
we get to standardization and open
source is definitely leading the way
whether it's with the these communities
that I've mentioned before people
rightly want to see these things in open
source so that they can kick the tires
on them before we go anywhere near
standards now we shouldn't standardized
far too early that was another reason
why we pushed some of the cloud stuff
out because we didn't have enough use
cases to verify that what was going to
be proposed was actually correct before
I opened up for for questions if there
are any I just want to point out that
it's not all the better roses as I said
there are some wheels that need to be
reinvented there are some significant
changes that this ubiquitous computing
world imposes on us that we didn't have
to worry about before because we have so
many potential processes out there you
know billions and billions and people
are going to want to try and use them
whether legitimately or not the scale of
the apps the scale of the data that's
being a generated by these apps grows
significantly so there's a reference
thereto a paper that was presented last
year at middleware 2011 I touched on
some of these the talk I gave a couple
of days ago which should be online after
Java one but basically there are a lot
of issues around things like
coordination and consensus typically
coordination protocols in the past have
been driven by a coordinate where you
have a single single point that
disseminates a protocol whether it's
two-phase commit for instance for
transactions gets it gets a response and
issues that everybody has the same
outcome the either/or commit or they all
roll back in this new world order
there's typically peer to peer
interactions there's typically a
synchronous interaction and true
asynchrony where it's fire-and-forget
and in a truly asynchronous world rather
than a fire off a thread to do a
synchronous RPC there's not necessarily
enough around on when the protocol will
terminate so there's a lot of work that
needs to go on to into what kind of
coordination and consensus protocols are
needed for this new new era
multi-tenancy is is a critical error
that we need to fix it's one of the
cloud things that we were going to try
and fix in EE 7 with with the modularity
jsr but we need to make sure that the
jvm can be much more multi-tenant to
where there are only two ways of really
increase increasing density certainly in
the Java world one is you make your jvm
so really small that running one app /
JVM does work and does scale so that if
it crashes it doesn't take down other
jvms because there's nothing else
running in that JVM that's the dalvik
approach or you make the JVM much more
like an operating system where you can
run multiple processes in it that are
red zone protected and the crash of a
process doesn't take down the other
crash of other processes that's your
typical laptop approach then this
thing's like no sequel and a new sequel
the amount of data that's being
generated today but by the end of 2012
apparently will be storing on the order
of 3 Z Z 2 bytes of information and to
put that into perspective if you were to
write that information to DVDs you'll be
able to to create a tower that stretched
from here to Mars and that's kind of
pushed the area of of no sequel so you
know relational databases are definitely
to stay but new databases are are on the
rise and we got negotiation enforcement
governance basically an accountability
so there are active areas of research
that do need to be to be tackled and are
being tackled in one way or another
unfortunately not all of them are being
tackled in the java community and if
java is to continue to be the dominant
language and certainly the jury and the
dominant platform one or more of these
needs to be tackled and needs to be
tackled relatively soon so i'll leave
you with this slide that I've pulled
together it's based on a speech that
Richard Hammond Gabe when he accepted
his 1968 cheering award basically he's
saying that not invented here syndrome
and reinventing the wheel has killed us
up to nineteen sixty eight I think if he
was accepting the Turing award speech
today he wouldn't say anything different
so with that I just like to open it up
to anybody who might have any questions
comments thoughts everybody agrees
everybody's asleep everybody's wondering
about going out and developing the next
middleware stack on the Android device
don't do it leverage what's already
there so any questions no questions yeah
Jacob Amy also i see that
so so I I disagree with the it c6 we
haven't called a j2ee for a number of
years but I disagree that II isn't
widely deployed and if you look at what
a lot of people are doing with spring
yeah okay some people deploy spring them
to tomcat but a lot of people deploy
spring onto e stacks so it's not an
either all there java Remy yeah that is
kind of the elephant in the room I know
that some people want to continue to cme
evolved yeah i have i have my own
thoughts on that they wouldn't
necessarily be investing in Emmy like
say it's an elephant in the room it's an
interesting meeting that we have as a JC
so I'm on the executive committee
whenever we have that conversation it's
it's interesting any other questions
seven was so what's the what what your
life's today what's the license yeah but
here's what it was Oh lgpl yeah okay if
there are more questions thank you very
much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
