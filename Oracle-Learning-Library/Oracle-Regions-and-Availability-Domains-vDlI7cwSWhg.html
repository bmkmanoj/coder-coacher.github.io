infrastructure regions and availability
domains Oracle cloud infrastructure is a
set of complementary cloud services that
enable you to build and run a wide range
of applications and services in a highly
available environment hosted within
specified regions and availability
domains
cloud infrastructure offers a multiple
availability domains in each region to
give you a great foundation for high
availability and disaster protection be
a high-performance physical network to
provide the lowest latency and no
resource contention see a virtual
network with off box virtualization to
optimize input-output performance and
offer unique services like bare metal
servers on-demand D integrated compute
storage database networking and platform
services to migrate existing apps
without change and build optimal new
apps e connectivity and edge services to
connect different oracle regions and
your data center as well as optimize end
user experience F finally simplified yet
powerful abilities to segment secure and
offer resources in complex organizations
hi can you explain how regions and
availability domains are defined
a region is a localized geographic area
a region is composed of several
availability domains an availability
domain is one or more data centers
located within a region
availability domains are isolated from
each other fault tolerant and a failure
at one availability domain is unlikely
to impact the availability of the others
because availability domains do not
share infrastructure such as power or
cooling or the internal availability
domain network for both high
availability and disaster recovery all
the availability domains in a region are
connected to each other by a low latency
high bandwidth network which makes it
possible for you to provide highly
available connectivity to the Internet
and customer premises and to build
replicated systems in multiple
availability domains note the names of
the availability domains have a prefix
that is specific to your tenancy
tenancy is a secure and isolated
partition within Oracle cloud
infrastructure where you can create
organize and administer your cloud
resources
what are the use cases for running
applications in various regions regions
are completely independent of other
regions and can be separated by vast
distances
across countries or even continents
generally you would deploy an
application in the region where it is
most heavily used since using nearby
resources is faster than using distant
resources
however you can also deploy applications
in different regions in order to
mitigate the risk of region wide events
such as large weather system or
earthquakes meet varying requirements
for legal jurisdictions tax domains and
other business or social criteria
your current region is displayed at the
top of the console if your tenancy is
subscribed to multiple regions you can
switch regions by selecting a different
region from the menu
Oracle assigns our home region and you
can't change it but you can write
policies that grant permissions in a
specified region only let's look at an
example policy here is the policy
created for the tenancy this policy
allows IAD admins to manage all aspects
of all the resources in the Ashburn or
IAD region assuming this tenancies home
region is Phoenix or pH X then this
policy does not allow IAD admins to
manage iam resources
what is a home region how do I know what
my home region is sign up for Oracle
cloud infrastructure services Oracle
creates a tenancy for you in one region
this is your home region your home
region is where your I am resources are
defined when you subscribe to another
region your I am resources are available
in the new region however the master
definitions reside in your home region
and can only be changed there
open the console click the region menu
in the upper left corner and then click
manage regions the list of regions
offered by Oracle cloud infrastructure
is displayed your home region is labeled
can you tell me more about the scope of
each type of resource sure the scope of
each type of resource falls into these
categories within a single availability
domain throughout a single region
available globally across regions within
a single availability domain subnets
instances volumes DB systems throughout
a single region buckets customer
premises equipment or CPE DHCP options
dynamic routing gateways or DRGs images
Internet gateways load balancers route
tables security lists virtual cloud
networks or VC ends volume backups
resources available globally across
regions our API signing keys policies
groups users compartments you can create
and update these resources only in the
home region
although a bucket is a regional resource
it can be accessed from any location as
long as you use the correct region
specific object storage URL for the API
calls instances can be attached only to
volumes in the same availability domain
volumes can be attached only to an
instance in the same availability domain
vol backups can be restored as new
volumes to any availability domain
within the same region they are stored
can I use the console to update my I am
resources
yes when you use the API to update your
iam resources you must use the endpoint
for your home region when you use the
console to update your iam resources the
console sends the request to the home
region for you you don't need to switch
to your home region first I am
automatically propagates the updates to
all regions in your tenancy note when
you create or update an I am resource be
aware that you need to allow up to
several minutes for the changes in your
home region to become available in all
regions
what about subscriptions can an
individual user subscribe to our region
a region subscription is at the tenancy
level an administrator can subscribe the
tenancy to a region all iam policies are
enforced in the new region so all users
in the tenancy will have the same access
and permissions in the new region as
soon as the region subscription becomes
active
great I am now familiar with the regions
and availability domains can I see my
existing resources in the new region
you can only see them when you select
the region where they were created the
exception is I am resources API signing
keys policies groups users and
compartments are global across all
regions
the console displays resources that are
in the current region so if your tenancy
has instances in compartment a in the
Phoenix region and instances in
compartment a in the Ashburn region you
can only view the instances in one
region at a time even though they are in
the same compartment
thanks for the detailed overview on
regions and availability domains this
will be very useful when I subscribe for
a tendency within a region you're most
welcome
