enterprise manager cloud control 12c
demo series and shows how to configure a
host with privilege delegation pseudo
and power broker / tools that enable
users to run privileged commands without
granting direct access to privileged
accounts such as root Enterprise Manager
includes a privileged delegation feature
that allows you to integrate these tools
this screen watch will demonstrate how
to configure privileged delegation for a
host that's been configured with pseudo
set up a privileged delegation consists
of three steps firstly you must
configure pseudo or power broker
appropriately on the host next you need
to configure the privileged delegation
settings for each host in enterprise
manager finally you should execute tasks
from enterprise manager using
credentials that use privileged
delegation the first step in configuring
Enterprise Manager for use with pseudo
power broker is to set up the target
host for use with enterprise manager
when executing commands for Enterprise
Manager using privileged delegation all
commands are executed via nmo pseudo
binary therefore if using sudo it's
necessary to configure pseudo so that
non privileged accounts can run n mo
pseudo with elevated privileges this is
done by editing the sudoers file I want
to login as user Scott and execute any
commanders room so I've added the
highlighted line to the sudoers file
which says that Scott can execute nmo
sudo is rude with any argument with the
argument being the command I want to
execute from enterprise manager
the commands that are allow can be
restricted further and details of how to
do this are in the enterprise manager
documentation once we've configured the
sudoers file we can configure privilege
delegation the enterprise manager for
this host the host already has an agent
deployed so we go to set up security
privilege delegation from this page we
can configure the privilege delegation
settings for each host I click on the
host I once and configure and select the
privilege delegation setting I'm
choosing sudo as this is what I'm using
on my hosts I enter the path and options
for my sudo command the runners and
command parameters will be passed in at
runtime when we try and execute
something from enterprise manager using
sudo
the configuration is now complete all
that we need to do now is set up
credentials that use sudo to do this we
can navigate to set up security named
credentials here I'm creating a global
host credential for the OS users Scott
I'm going to set the run privilege to
sudo and the run has user to root this
means that any action that I execute
using this credential will executors
route but using Scott's login
credentials I'll test the credential as
I save it using the host I've just
configured this credential can now be
used to execute roofs commands using
Scott's credentials to demonstrate this
I'm creating a simple OS job of my house
that runs the ID command
I select credential that I just created
and submit the job
upon completion the output shows that
the ID command was indeed executed as
