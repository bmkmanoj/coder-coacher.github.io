Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series and shows how to configure a
host with privileged delegation sudo and
power broker are tools that enable users
to run privileged commands without
granting direct access to privileged
accounts such as root Enterprise Manager
includes a privilege delegation feature
that allows you to integrate these tools
this screen watch will demonstrate how
to configure privilege delegation for a
host that's been configured with sudo
setup a privilege delegation consists of
three steps firstly you must configure
sudo or powerbroker appropriately on the
host next you need to configure the
privilege delegation settings for each
host in Enterprise Manager finally you
should execute tasks from enterprise
manager using credentials that use
privilege delegation the first step in
configuring Enterprise Manager for use
with sudo powerbroker is to set up the
target host for use with Enterprise
Manager when executing commands for
Enterprise Manager using privileged
delegation all commands are executed by
the nmos sudo binary therefore if using
sudo it's necessary to configure sudo so
that non privileged accounts can run
nmos sudo with elevated privileges this
is done by editing the sudo as file I
want to login as user Scott and execute
any commander's room so I've added the
highlighted line to the sudoers file
which says that Scott can execute nmos
sudo is rude with any argument with the
argument being the command I want to
execute from Enterprise Manager
the commands that are allowed can be
restricted further and details of how to
do this are in the enterprise manager
documentation once we've configured the
sudoers file we can configure privileged
delegation the Enterprise Manager for
this host the host already has an agent
deployed so we go to set up security
privileged delegation from this page we
can configure the privilege delegation
settings for each host I click on the
host that I want to configure and select
the privilege delegation setting I'm
choosing sudo as this is what I'm using
on my hosts I enter the path and options
for my sudo command the runners and
command parameters will be passed in at
runtime when we try and execute
something from Enterprise Manager using
sudo
the configurations now complete all that
we need to do now is set up credentials
that use sudo to do this we can navigate
to set up security named credentials
here I'm creating a global host
credential for the OS users Scott
I'm going to set the run privilege to
sudo and the run has user to root this
means that any action that I execute
using this credential will execute as
root but using Scott's login credentials
I'll test the credential as I save it
using the host I've just configured this
credential can now be used to execute
routes commands using Scott's
credentials to demonstrate this I'm
creating a simple OS job of my host that
runs the ID command
I select credential that I just created
and submit the job
upon completion the output shows that
the ID command was indeed executed as
root more Enterprise Manager demos can
