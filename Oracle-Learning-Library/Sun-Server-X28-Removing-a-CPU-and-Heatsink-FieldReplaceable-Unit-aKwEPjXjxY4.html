cpu and heatsink removal through step
one cpu and heatsink removal cpu and
heat sinks are designated as field
replaceable units fruisé step to locate
the faulty cpu press the mother board
mounted blue fault remind button to
identify the cpu and heatsink assembly
that you need to remove step 3 locate
the lift cpu fault LED when the blue
remind button is pushed a fault LED will
light to designate the faulty cpu and
heatsink step 4 note the cpu designation
the cpus are designated as cpu 0 and cpu
one from the front of the sea mod cpu 0
is on the right and cpu one is on the
left step 5 loosen the heatsink screws
press down on the center of the heatsink
and use a number two phillips screw
driver to completely loosen the two
spring-loaded captive heatsink retaining
screws pressing down on the heatsink
relieves the pressure generated by the
spring-loaded screws step 6 remove the
heatsink to remove the heat sink pull it
upward while slightly twisting it left
and right to break the adhesive seal
created by the thermal compound caution
do not allow the residual thermal
compound on the bottom of the heatsink
to contaminate other components or the
workspace step 7 set aside the heatsink
set aside and retain the heat sink step
8 clean off thermal compound if you plan
to reuse the heatsink carefully clean
off the thermal compound with an alcohol
wipe step 9 unlock the CPU retaining
cover to unlock the CPU retaining cover
push down on the spring loaded release
lever and move it slightly away from the
cpu and the release lever retaining clip
step 10 lift the CPU retaining cover
lift the cpu retaining cover to its
fully upright position caution the top
of the CPU has thermal compound applied
do not contaminate other components step
11 lift the CPU lift the seat
from the socket set the CPU aside taking
care that you did not allow the residual
thermal compound on top of the CPU to
contaminate other components or the
workspace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
