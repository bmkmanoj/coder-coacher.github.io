procedure you need a number two phillips
screwdriver and the processor
replacement tool caution unplugged the
server from the power the processors are
located inside the server remove the
server cover to identify the failed
processor press the fault remind button
a lit fault led indicates the failed
processor to replace the processor first
remove the heatsink
gently apply pressure to the top of the
heatsink while loosening each retaining
screw one and a half turns at a time
continue loosening the screws until all
four screws are completely disengaged a
thermal compound applied between the
heatsink and the processor acts as an
adhesive do not allow the thermal
compound to contaminate the workspace or
other components to separate the two
components gently wiggle the heatsink
left and right while pulling upward use
an alcohol pad to completely clean all
thermal compound from the underside of
the heatsink and top of the processor
keep the heatsink to use with the
replacement processor to access the
processor first release the two
processor cover retaining levers by
pushing down on the end of each lever
and moving it slightly away from the
processor lift each lever to its fully
open position to open the pressure frame
rotate the processor release lever on
the right side toward the closed
position and lift the frame to its fully
open position to extract the processor
use the replacement tool press the
center button on the tool to the down
position orient the replacement tool on
top of the processor so the triangle on
the corner of the tool aligns with the
mark on the processor
you
note the tool
correctly aligned to engage the tool
with the processor push the locking tab
on the removal tool away from the center
button
to remove the processor lift the tool
out of the server turn the tool upside
down to release the processor from the
tool push the center button upward to
remove the processor hold it by the
edges and lift it out of the tool
to attach the replacement processor to
the tool press down on the center button
and turn the tool upside down pick up
the replacement processor by its edges
with the circuit side facing upward
position the processor in the tool so
that the mark on the corner of the
processor is aligned with the triangle
on the side of the tool
set the processor in the tool
to lock the processor press the tool
release lever
an audible click indicates that the
processor is locked in place turn the
tool over and align the tool with a
processor socket gently lower the tool
until the processor sits in the socket
caution irreparable damage to the
processor our motherboard do not press
down on the processor
no ensure that the tool sits evenly in
the socket and is not misaligned
press the center button to release the
processor lift the tool from the
processor the processor remains in the
socket visually check the alignment of
the processor in the socket when
properly aligned the processor sits flat
in the socket close the processor
retaining cover
you
lower the socket retaining levers to
their fully closed and locked positions
use the supplied syringe to apply 0.1
milliliters of thermal compound to the
center of the top of the processor do
not allow the thermal compound to
contaminate components or the workspace
position the heatsink over the processor
and align the heatsink screws with the
screw holes in the motherboard lower the
heatsink onto the top of the processor
once the heatsink contacts the top of
the processor avoid moving the heatsink
gently apply pressure to the top of the
heatsink while tightening each retaining
screw one and a half turns at a time
continue tightening the screws until all
four screws are completely engaged
