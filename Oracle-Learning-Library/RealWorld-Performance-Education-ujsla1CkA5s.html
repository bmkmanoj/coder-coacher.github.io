activities that we do within the real
world performance group I've said many
times in many cases the problem we have
with real-world performances people
aren't really sure how to use our
products optimally and don't really know
haven't been shown and this is a big
problem we have in terms of education
getting people to use the products
properly in many cases most of the
performance losses that we incur is
because applications are not well
written from the beginning they're
written by people with very little
experience because they're the cheapest
programmers to hire and you get what you
deserve you get suboptimal code however
with the code not being moved or changed
or optimized as it goes through the
process we very oftenly lead us with a
big scalability problem or a performance
problem at some point in the future now
with that in mind we need to do some
more work on education and this is
something I feel very strongly about
because if there was more education at
the programmer level the DBA level and
actually particularly at the architect
level people would be able to again take
more advantage of the hardware the
software they have and get higher
performance higher availability and
generally have better systems and
simpler systems to run and so for this
reason my team spends about a third of
its time engaging in education
activities the top of type of education
we do well you're watching it this sort
of activity getting videos out on
youtubes to give you sound bites give
you ideas in many cases historically
these youtubes and videos are the links
to them are emailed to system architects
sent two designers as reference material
to say please think about these things
when you design the systems but really
what we need to talk about is education
for developers programmers architects
and DBAs and all of them need a little
bit of education and in many cases the
developers the DBAs and the architects
need to learn to talk to each other and
this is something that I have noticed
doesn't happen a lot and should happen a
lot more and other issues like
interaction with middleware in many
cases the architects are not
coordinating the effort where people
with different disciplines need to learn
to work together and this is again a big
problem we face so in terms of Education
opportunities the real world performance
team is putting out YouTube videos
we're also have a series of one-day
events that tends to be organized by the
user groups so you should coordinate
with your local user group and it takes
a little bit of booking but myself
Tom Kyte oh I'm sure many people have
read about and my colleague Graham wood
we ran a one-day seminar just to give
you an example of what the type of
techniques we advocate what possible how
to raise your game in terms of
performance in many cases you may have
thought that was the way to do it but it
gives you a chance to endorse your ideas
and elaborate your ideas and take
performance to the next level and that's
extremely important in addition the team
the real world performance team does
work one-on-one with customers and
partners we do have a real-world
performance class it used to take three
days it now takes three and a half days
I suspect by the end of this year it
will take four days and may eventually
take five days and this is a very
intense hands-on performance course a
mixture of coursework lecture work team
work involved in raising your game in
performance
really the course if you were to do it
through a classic Oracle University
would probably take six weeks but we do
it in a week because we recognize it's
really difficult to get people to take
that amount of time off to invest in
education so it's an intense course and
we do it for not only Oracle people
within Oracle we do it for the partner
organization and we do it for customers
and this again can be arranged in on an
ad hoc basis via your Oracle account
reps and things like that this is a
one-off course and it's intense you're
meant to be exhausted at the end of it
and believe it or not we actually have
had people who have come back to the
course three times and they've learned
something different every time and they
said they're still learning and we also
evolved the course the course currently
at the moment is evolving for version 12
as we actually get to hands on with it
and get real-world experience on using
the new features in version 12 and we'll
be doing the same for twelve two and
thirteen and fourteen and fifteen moving
forward so real-world performance
education it's real it happens it's
evolving and can you really afford not
to do it that's your question
you
