file system library edition planning and
installation in this video we are going
to cover how to install Oracle ltf SLE
these instructions can be found on the
storage tech Linear Tape file system
library edition planning an installation
guide
so so far we have installed all of our
hardware for a typical LT of SLE
installation got our LT of SLE server
our library our drives our AC SLS server
and then we've got a means by which we
connect our drives to our LT of SLE
server in this case a fibre channel
switch
we have also installed oracle enterprise
linux five dot 5 x 64 on the LT of SLE
server mr. bass installation and now we
are ready to install oracle LTFS le
first thing you're going to want to do
is on your LT of SLE server you're going
to want to check your etsy hosts file to
make sure that it was written correctly
during the installation so that we have
good network connectivity
so you see here the first line is all
the local host information to get the
local host IP localhost.localdomain and
then localhost second line here is for
ipv6 you can ignore it the next line
here the third line is the IP of your
LTI facilities server the fully
qualified domain name of your LT of SLE
server in this case the server's name is
bohemia the fully qualified domain name
is us at oracle com and we have Bohemian
so we've got a good etsy hosts file
we're ready to do a good installation of
LT of SLE
first thing we're going to want to do is
actually download the software
you get that from Oracle edelivery so
I'm go ahead and sign in here
go ahead and agree to the terms
once I'm in here you from the selector
product back it's already selected here
for me but you'll want to scroll down to
Oracle storage tech products linux x86
64 hit the Go button
you'll see here that we have oracle
storagetek mentor tape file system are
very edition media pack for linux
well it's like that
you'll see here we've got a download
here now for the purposes of this
video I've already downloaded the
software you see it's her three gigs so
take a little while went ahead and
downloaded downloaded the software
by CD what I've done is I've created a
downloads directory that's where I put
all on my downloads
I've already unpacked it too so
basically what you'll get is you'll
download this zip file you lens if it
he'll actually give you a tarp file and
you'll antar him and it will unpack all
of these other directories and files so
you have some release notes in there and
we'll be running some of the stuff in
here so that's the next step you'll want
to do is download your LT of SLE
software in preparation for installing
LT of SLE as the root user now what
you'll do next is you're going to go
ahead and create your users or your used
your oracle user for your installation
first of all we have to do those is uh
at a group
so to group ad
I'm gonna go ahead and give it an ID
Oh install called bill install group and
then we'll go ahead and add our user
give him an ID as well
senator the Oh install group
and give him his name
once we go now we want to give him a
password
alright so we've added our Oracle user
now there are some prerequisites that we
have to update to the system
particularly be etsy security limits com
file in order to install all the
components so we'll have to do that and
we'll have to reboot the system for
those changes to take effect so we'll do
that right now reboot the system so
that's taken care of so what we'll do is
well actually cd2
at directory
I'm gonna go ahead make a copy just in
case
just in case I'm making her
and then i'll go ahead and be i am
I got a little cheat sheet here I'm
gonna go ahead I've copied this right
out of the installation guide
I'm gonna go ahead and just for purposes
of this
video go ahead
just go down the bottom here
right here'll insert
subspace
alright so I've added that go ahead and
take it really quick
alright so go ahead went ahead and added
those I go ahead and reboot the system
alright so our system has rebooted gonna
go ahead and login here
as the road user
and we're going to go ahead and and
reinsert our installation CD because we
need to add a few more software packages
however these are optional
sort of it or sort of optional if you
are using IBM lto-5 drives you have to
perform these next steps that i'm bauer
a book to perform if not you will not
need to do these basically what we're
going to be doing is setting up our
server to be able to rebuild our pm's
we're going to go out to the IBM fix
central website and download their Lin
tape drivers so again if you are using
IBM lto-5 drives you will need to
download these drivers and install them
so first things first though we're going
to go ahead and put in our OS
installation CD or dvd we're going to go
ahead and install some other software so
you're going to see data media
surprised linux DVD do it LS here real
quick we'll see what what i like to do
first I would like to import
to make sure I got the keys
in court this key right here
then I'm going to see de to server
see if there that's where the software
there are cameras that we're going to
need to install are located and again
these are all in the installation guide
now I'm gonna I've got another like i
said i got my cheat sheet here i am
going to install the RPMs all at once
for purposes of this video the
installation guide has you install them
one at a time
certainly can do it either way so I'm
going to like that for the speed of this
video to get going on to the next step
when I go to do them all in one at a
time alright so looks like we got our
p.m. is installed we're ready to go to
the IBM fix central website and grab the
glint tape drivers and again back to the
diagram here
and our basic LT of SLE
installation we do have an IBM lto-5 so
for this particular installation we are
going to have to get the Lin tape and
then take the drivers so we do from here
close up a cheat sheet here
go out to
the IBM fix central website already got
a bookmarked here
one cheering here you want to go to the
product group you want to go to system
storage
you want to select tape systems
and I found that in some browsers don't
always come back with the next drop down
but so just hit continue and then it'll
drop it in there
jape systems you're going to want to
select select tape drivers and software
tenure here
and we're going to want to actually
select tape device drivers
under software
platform is going to be Linux 64-bit x86
underscore 64
to you here
are you gonna wanna continue
you want to select a red hat enterprise
linux five
get the latest drivers software here
let's just select that link
he's only
a little head of myself here all right
so once you're in here you're probably
gonna if you don't already have an IBM
fix central account you'll have to
create one go ahead and register for one
I've already got one here someone go and
sign here
I go ahead and select the default
download options
it continued
go ahead agree to the terms
alright so in here you're going to want
to always grab the install dot readme
file you're gonna grab the Lin tape
source RPM and then then tape the binary
RPM
now I've already like I said I've
already created a
directory downloads but then I've also
already created Lin tape directly
underneath that
so I'm going to save the readme file
oh i already downloaded once getting
ahead of myself here go ahead and just
replace it make sure I get it
again I'll grab the
then take the binary file as well binary
RPM
go do that later I so we're done here
check our downloads make sure we have
them all
so if we have them all here now you'll
see here that the Lin tape
RPM is a source rpm so this is the
reason we had to download some other
software from the Oracle Enterprise
Linux DVD was to be able to rebuild this
rpm into a binary RPM you have to
install this Lin tape RPM or build it
and install it prior to Lin tape beat go
through that process right now so first
what we'll do
is we will
make sure all our software zur see it's
there I'm gonna go ahead and just open
the readme
and the readme it tells you what I want
you to do
basically run RPM build dash dash
rebuilding the file name in this case
it'll be Lynn tape the Lynn tape source
RPM
go and open a terminal
city to downloads
tape
I think you may have to change the
permissions on those files
alright so what we're gonna want to do
is we're doing our piano
rebuild of this source RPM
you
so I guess I should go read the
directions again
Oh RPM build
ok rpm bill
that's dash
all right so he's finished now you'll
see here that he wrote the Lin tape
binary RPM to this directory so what I
like to do because I don't want to do
this again if i install another LT of
SLE server if I reinstall this one what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to copy
that file
to my then tape directors if I do an LS
now see I have this Lin tape RP our
binary RPM so now what I want to
actually keep these two files for any
other installations you might do that
whether they're done you don't have to
rebuild them anymore these are the 2008
go ahead and change the permissions on
this guy
all right now I'm gonna go ahead and
install the Lynn tape driver first
it
when installed my lint AP driver
alright so now I got the win tape
drivers from IBM done
next thing we want I want to do is
CD to your downloads directory or where
we figure LT of SLE software the star
file again I unpacked it already and I
have all these other files to run now
I'm gonna go ahead and run this course
is prepped SH to put a bunch of pretty
rugged software for the Oracle LTFS open
software that we're going to download if
the download it separately because it's
open software so what we'll go ahead and
do now is we're going to go ahead and
run
course subscribe got SH now if you see
here as you're watching this it's going
to go do a check on the limits comp file
so you see the system resource limits
passed for the root user so we did add
them for both the root and the oracle
user so you can see here that after that
reboot our limited stock on file looks
good the resource on his pass will do
another check when we actually install
the Oracle LT by selling software as the
oracle user but now we're like i said
we're going to install a bunch of
prerequisites software as the root user
clean up my desktop a little bit here I
don't need to see the readme anymore
because that goes out of some of these
directory all right so you'll see here
that he does do a quick check to see if
there is any LTFS open software under
the downloads LT Best Director basically
the director you're in there if there's
no toughest directory he'll look for
Terra and he's not going to find it so
he's just going to ask if you want to
continue with the installation just a
quick reminder say hey you're gonna have
to install the LTS open software after
you're done with this so go ahead and
say yes to continue with the LT of SLE
installation to see here that it's
installing a bunch of my sequel software
LTFS le does use a my sequel database
you do have to install the root user the
LT of SLE installation oh you I or
Oracle universal installer will not let
you Allah will not allow you to install
my sequel as the Oracle user so that's
why we're installing it as the root user
prior to running the oh you I alright so
we're done running the courses prep got
SH script and we go ahead and exit out
out of our command line window the next
step that we're going to want to perform
is go grab the Oracle LTFS open software
the Oracle website
see we have this sprint open source
software page I look over here on the
left so under Linear Tape file system we
go ahead and go to downloads and we're
going to want to go to the rpms we're
going to want to select LTFS 1025
and we're going to want to grab this
middle file here the binary rpm for LTFS
one or two to five
again I'm gonna say this file and I've
actually created a directory under my
downloads
directory called LTFS underscore open
save that file there
it's like it's done go ahead and get
outta
of our web page here CD to that
directory
again I think I want to change
permissions
go ahead and install him
all right so he's installed we're now
ready to actually to run the actual
oracle universal installer to install
the LT of SLE software first thing we
got to do though is we have to get out
as the root user and login as the oracle
user
that we created
little while ago go ahead and log out
okay login is Oracle
alright so now we'll go ahead and open a
terminal
so you did that downloads directory
you'll see here there's an install LTFS
le sh so you want to run that
and again he'll check some stuff he'll
check that limit com file for this user
it's he passed
now what he's going to ask you for here
in a couple minutes is for a weblogic
administrative console admin user and
password now we'll go ahead and add that
user to the WebLogic domain and we'll
set him up to be used with the LT of SLE
booing all right kind of gives you a
little explanation of what you can use
for a weblogic administrator username
and password
and we'll go ahead and add ours in this
case I'm going to add LTFS le
admin
give it a password
and he'll go ahead and launch the oracle
universal installer
this green we're just going to say next
hit next again now we've already created
some other stuff with that corset Vettes
eight script that he wants to create he
wrote the only you I so he just given
you Warren hey do you want me to proceed
with us go ahead and say yes
hit next and hit install
now of course to be liked it you can see
what's going on clicking the window here
behind the oh you I window
might be a good idea you might think
that sitting over here for a while it's
not doing much you see this window
behind here he's actually doing all the
work
alright so you see here that the Oracle
LT of SL the installation is complete
and that we must reboot the system in
order to start the services for LT of
SLE so we'll go to ro you I
go ahead and exit Lex it out of here now
what you're going to have to do though
is uh go ahead and
so you could switch you Jerome I go
ahead and log out as Oracle because you
have to shut down a reboot the system as
the root user or at least a user has
more privileges than the one we created
login into root
one thing all I will mention now I'm
using what's called integrated
lights-out man manager remote console
for our Oracle Sun servers and so
I've actually redirected to a cd-rom
image so for the to show you all the
stuff that we need to do with the Oracle
Linux DVD now for your server you may
might may have needed to re insert the
DVD into your server you're going to
want to pull that out once you're done
installing some rpms especially if the
first boot device is the BBD you don't
want to reinstall the OS so there's a
quick note to keep in mind that you
might you are going to want to pull that
DVD out
so what am I do here is I'm gonna go
ahead and restart system
now that we have LT of SLE installed
and we'll check the services once they
come up and we'll do a couple more
things and we're ready to configure
all right our server has been restarted
we're gonna go ahead and login as the
root user
I will go ahead and check our services
so what we do
so I'm just open a terminal go ahead and
open this up a little bit
I'm not type
managed capital LTFS le capital
services- I for information
see here there's different my sequel
database it's up and running gives you
the pit all the different components or
look like they're all running so let's
check that out really quick and at this
point we're ready to get ready to
configure ltf SLE the first thing you
want to do in order to get ready to
configure parity of SLE is we have to
take that LTFS le admin user and add him
to the ltf SLE admin role and we do that
through the weblogic administrative
console so go ahead and
open up a browser window here go ahead
and go to my server here
I my login
with that LTFS le admin user that I
created during the oh you I LTS le
install
alright so once i'm in the weblogic
server administrative console i'm gonna
go down to security realms
go to my realm
and go to users and groups go to the LT
vesely admin user that I created in am
now logged in as go to the group's tab
I'm going to see that there's some LT of
SLE roles here now which you're one
thing you're going to want to make sure
sure of is that anytime you create a
user or anytime you create this or add a
role to this user you can only add one
user or one role that it one role / user
so in this case this is our LT of SLE
admin user we're going to add him to the
health of SLE admin role just click in
hit the right arrow
he'll put them into the chosen roles and
we want to hit save so he's ready to go
what we want to do now is we're going to
want log out of the weblogic admin
console we're going to log into the elt
boselli Bowie or browser user interface
so we'll go ahead and use the same
address but after the port that has been
used I don't want to type a capital L
TFS
again we want to use the same
user
and we're in RL t of SLE Bowie now you
may get an error message if you once you
add the LG SLE admin role to this user
you may get a login error and all you
need to do is wait for you know maybe a
minute for weblogic to actually assign
that role or give access to that user in
order to log into the elder facility
Bowie so if you do see the login error
message just try again within a couple
minutes to it you should be get to be
able to get to this screen so at this
point your LT of us-led server is up and
running you're in here at the buoy of
course there's nothing in here so we
have compared your debt but this
concludes our video for installing LT of
SLE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
