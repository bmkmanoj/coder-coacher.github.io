repeated behavior of your users over
time
studies show that customer retention is
a strong predictor of a company's
financial success with analytics and its
integrated campaigns feature you can
deliver data-driven content that keeps
your customers coming back to
demonstrate suppose you have a line of
phone cases from some up-and-coming
designers you want to know if these new
products are leading to repeat purchases
first click retention and select a date
range for your report we'll choose a
custom date range add a filter for
active users and two events Add to Cart
and check-out now run the report when
the data is returned you can view
results by day week or month as well as
see users by percentage or number these
user groups are known as cohorts in
retention analysis in this example we're
viewing cohort behavior by week and
percentage the percentages show the
share of those users who returned on a
given week to complete the second event
we're tracking checkout looks like sales
were especially strong the week of
February 13th when you featured the
cases from that hot new designer let's
save that cohort as a segment for future
campaigns featuring products with
cutting edge style to create the segment
just click and drag on the data you're
interested in and give this segment a
name or you can create a segment from
the results of the entire report save
this report to favorites so you can
easily revisit it later then user saved
segments with campaigns to build cross
channel messages based on products your
customers loved that's how you keep them
