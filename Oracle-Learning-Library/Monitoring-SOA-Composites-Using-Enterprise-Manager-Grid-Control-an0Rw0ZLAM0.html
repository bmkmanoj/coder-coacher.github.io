principal curriculum developer here at
Oracle in this demonstration I'll give
you an overview of monitoring so
accomplices using Enterprise Manager
grid control you can monitor cell
composites and Enterprise Manager grid
control when you purchase the solar
management pack Enterprise Edition from
the Enterprise Manager grid control home
page will go to targets then middleware
and here we'll scroll down to this
application dependency and performance
link on this monitoring page we'll
expand
Oracle Enterprise Manager and let's look
at composites this page shows summary
metrics for the components across all of
the solar compasses noan to this
particular ADP manager and is the
starting point for navigating into the
solar composites that have been deployed
now let's expand composites and so a
fusion order demo and click on this
order booking composite here we see this
summary page which gives us an in-depth
overview of the performance of the
components of the services and of the
references you can quickly look across
the service engines and subsystems to
determine whether or not there are
performance anomalies in a particular
area
now let's look at the composites
topology on this page we can see the
static topology view for a so a
composite it shows all of the define
relationships that were discovered based
on the project metadata or defined
dependencies that as wires are shown
between the services references and
components within this composite using
this view you can understand what the
potential impact of changes or
performance issues on specific
components are based upon the deployed
configuration now let's look at the
dynamic view this view for us so a
composite shows you dependencies between
services references and components based
on invocation metrics lines in the graph
represent actual invitations that were
observed between two components using
this view you can understand how actual
invocations flowed between components
within the composite now let's expand
the order booking composite thin
components people and we'll look at the
order processor this page shows a
performance summary of this people
process the arrivals or process starts
and completions or process ends
occurring within the views timeframe are
displayed here in tabular form and below
in graphical form here you see the top
five process arrivals in the top five
process completions and here you see the
average maximum and minimum execution
time for processes which ended within
the time frame note that if you hover
your mouse over the graph you see the
values for individual data points
if we scroll back up to the table you
can see an error metric that indicates
the number of completions on fault
handlers in this case none occurred tabs
across the top allow you to access
additional details let's look at delay
analysis
this shows a relative breakdown of time
contribution per node in the beepo
process let's scroll down and then
across you can use this to identify
bottlenecks when users are experiencing
performance problems with process
executions
now let's right click order processor
and we'll select display functional view
let's reposition this pop-up window and
here we see the people functional view
this provides visibility into the
performance of each people activity
using visualization and navigation that
is native to the way people is
represented across the development and
deployment lifecycle this ensures that
all stakeholders from administrators to
developers use a common set of
terminology and share common context
let's scroll down and we'll look at this
callback client invoke nodes can have
additional functionality in them such as
sequel execution or external calls right
click this node and select display
architecture view
this architecture view is available for
people and VOC activities and shows a
breakdown of the time spent in the
execution of the specific activity the
left side diagram shows the call tree of
certain components that are commonly
present within invoked nodes the pie
chart breaks down the percentage time
contribution of each of the boxes shown
in the diagram in this case we see all
the time was spent in JDBC we can also
look at individual sequel statement
metrics these are executed within the
beetle activity if there is significant
time contribution spent in JDBC we see
the breakdown across sequel statements
here so that's it for this demonstration
on monitoring so accomplices using
Enterprise Manager grid control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
