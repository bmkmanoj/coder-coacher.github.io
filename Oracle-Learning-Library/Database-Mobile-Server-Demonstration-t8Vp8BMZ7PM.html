setup the synchronization for the
offline did access on the mobile devices
and the solution is Oracle database
mobile server the first step in this
process is to create publications of the
data so that the data is accessible to
the mobile devices second step is to add
Oracle sync library to the application
on the mobile device then we'll need to
set up access management so that the
data is provisioned specifically for
each device user then the application
that we develop in step two can be
packaged and deployed on the mobile
server once the applications package on
the mobile server or on any external app
store the application can be downloaded
and installed on the device
in the simple case for users who need
offline data access let's use for the
demo a smartphone application that helps
FedEx drivers track their packages so
the scenario that we want to support is
FedEx drivers in the beginning of the
day except all this and packages and
starts delivering down and the batteries
are deliberate or picked up the status
of the package is updated and once the
FedEx driver returns back to the base
they're able to synchronize put the
available Wi-Fi or any other network and
update their daily status
here in the stepper will publish the
data for the mobile clients the data is
on the mobile server and what was her
repository so I already created the
publication called transport and added a
couple of tables to trucks and packages
we also need to add another table called
routes so let's take a look and see what
are the steps required to create this
publication item right-click on
publication item create publication item
and they will go through the wizard that
will allow us to publish an object and
the Oracle database that we can
demoscene eyes to the mobile devices so
let's call it routes we want the
standardization to be fast refresh and
the table that were publishing routes is
actually in the schema master so look at
the master schema and we see the object
routes which is what we want most like
all the columns for this table the index
will be the primary key index with only
the other indexes and click Next this is
the publication I don't think we're
going to create the screen to cold
routes database object type of a client
is sequel Lite there and refresh mode is
fast finish and the routes is done
so once the all the tables that are sync
synonyms or views all the objects that
are needed for the mobile client
application are created then they should
be grouped together in publication which
basically groups all the objects that
are needed by an application on the
client so here we just added route and
we need to make sure that it's part of
publication so when you look at the
publication items so far we only have
charts and packages so we'll also need
to add route
it's already listed it doesn't need to
be updatable in this case because it's
just a lookup table for routes and we
can leave all the other options to be
equal to the direct default values
an interesting thing to note that mobile
server allows you to subset clients
there individually we have put known as
subscription parameters which allow you
to set parameter values for individual
clients and just in this example of the
transport demo we can see that for
example for publication item packages it
looked at the query we actually created
a query that does subset the backend is
only specifically for the client or the
driver that's during the synchronization
so we added the subsetting clause of the
word clause which specifically selects
four packages from the assignment table
where the client ID equals to this
client ID variable and that variable is
that for each individual driver when
they synchronize so that only there is
own data will be synchronized to the
device
so now that we have performed step one
which is to publish the definition for
the data on the client let's move on to
step two
heading Oracle sync library to your
existing app
so let's say I have an application on
the device in this case we'll use
Android device but I always do Isis or
the embedded devices could be used other
mobile devices so it's a simple
application that will do the management
of the packages so driver logs in and is
presented with the few buttons basically
want to pick up a package another button
to update existing packages and that's
pretty much attendant another driver
tool again with the driver and Driver
look and button so how do we add
synchronization component to this
application
first we'll at a constructor for the OSD
session which is the main class that is
used to control synchronization in the
client constructor is very simple we
just pass the username for that class
next we will save the password for the
user which is provided on the login
screen and finally we need to set the
mobile server URL again that could be
something that's pergurt into the
application if the mobile server URL is
set before an application is deployed
but in this case we'll allow the users
to enter the mobile through a URL next
looking at menu button was sink and the
menu button above once it's activated
the once it's pressed we'll call the
start sync function and the ferrocene
function the main purpose of this
function is to start thread and this
threat will to the synchronization
basically there's just one call the
synchronization and that am session sync
that will initiate the synchronization
and this is that function so let's see
what the app will look like once we
added the synchronization we're logged
in into the main screen right now I can
try to login let's the driver logs in
press the menu button and click sync
which will then synchronize any changes
that we have on the client back to the
database and bring any changes from the
database from the mobile server back to
the client and the client is in server
are in sync and that pretty much is all
that's needed to have a synchronization
library all the packages or whatever
needs to be updated can continue to be
updated and the next thing session will
propagate the changes back to the server
also this could be set up is that
America saying but for the purpose of
this demo we will allow the user to
invoke the sync manually
let's proceed to the next step step
three which is to package the
application and deploy it on the mobile
service that the clients can download
the package our application will use
another tool called packaging wizard
it's included again with the mobile
server SDK the packaging will allows us
to specify the application name virtual
path which is the location where the
files will be stored in the global
server the description of the
application local application directory
which is where we would put the
transport demo apk file and finally the
publication created in step one where we
publish the data that's needed by the
application so once all those are
specified we'll click button next and
then we will proceed to specify the
files for the application in this case
we have the transport demo click finish
and it's just a matter of creating the
jar file that we can tablet publish on
the mobile server so those are specified
create this packet under file specify
the location of this file and once
everything is done correctly
we'll get the prompt that everything is
successful now let's go to the mobile
manager which allows us to publish the
packaged application a good publish
application button and then just specify
the location of the file
and that's the chair file that we will
publish
once the file is published the
application is registered mobile server
and we can see it in the list of the
applications right here good X
we're done with the package packaging of
the application we need to provision the
application to the mobile server users
so that's going to be step four
application access management
I'm going to use mobile manager to
provide access to the application and
let's take a look at the application
that we raise the published FedEx
currently if we look at the access tab
for this application there are no users
or groups assigned to it so let's assign
drivers that the group is going to use
the application so let's provision the
application for them click the Save
button and the application now is
provisioned for drivers so all the
members of the group drivers should be
able to download and access the data for
this application and we're ready for the
final step in this demo which is install
the application and synchronize it with
the mobile server
in order to download the applications
users would need to open up the web
browser and go to the mobile server
setup page on a setup page they
presented a list of devices that are
enabled for the mobile server in this
case we will use the superlight Android
device it downloads the application the
certification which the users then
clicks and installs once the application
is installed we can register the user
with the mobile server so in this case
we'll use use there P Stevenson which is
one of the users who is in the drivers
group to use my password and the server
URL
in the CRL can be pre-loaded but in this
case we're letting the user specified
and was there installing the components
of the mobile inclined device management
agent occasional Update Manager and that
concludes installation of all the mobile
server components again those are this
could have been pre-installed but which
is gone through the full installations
in that process next step is we need to
run the Oracle update which will done
register the device for the mobile
server and why is the devices registered
we can see a list of assigned
applications to the user in this case we
can see that this the FedEx application
is assigned and we can click install and
then install the application goes to the
standard Android application
installation we can click open and
that's going to be our application and
in the application we can again log in
with the drivers credentials
enter all their quiet information then
dad to get a list of the packages
assigned to this driver look like the
sync button sync operation was
successful and we could take a look at
the packages assigned to the user in
this case the user just has one package
assigned to it and with the status new
once the package is delivered the user
can update the package to well first the
package is picked up so looking decided
to progress and update the database the
central database by going again to sync
so the updates updated status goes to
the backend and once the package is
delivered again the status can be
updated to complete it and once the user
is able to synchronize with the mobile
server the status will be propagated in
this Terezin made it faster will also be
updated and that's dramatically the end
of the demo for using mobile server for
enabling offline data access for mobile
devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
