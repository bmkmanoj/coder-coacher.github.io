talk is crowded and we are going to talk
about using our old Java me device not
just phone but device in general to make
cool projects and I am Vinicius anger I
work with Java more than 10 years I
writing code since I was 13 years old
and I create J home automation project
last year we want Dukes Choice Award
this year we are launching a new API
colored things API is a brand new API
for Internet of Things supporting Java
me Java C Java Bluetooth ZB IP device
and we are a company in Brazil call it
global code is a training company and
here is Marcel please introduce yourself
I'm from Brazil Joe I'm one of the
mobile teams API where's my mind yeah
everybody ok ok
I have master's degree in computer
science
Iowa why I am a mobile developer since
2007 I'm the tree and move or folder
well a company that builds mobile apps
for iOS Android Java me like Mary this
kind of platforms did I forget some some
of them focus on hardware and Java SE
and EE development why Oh Marcel used to
work more with mobile so we are together
to to to mix both things and show some
cool projects so we are going to show
how to give a new life for your Java EE
device or at least you will not leave
anybody to drop a Java ME device in a
trash because it can be very useful
we would like to talk about some
open-source Hardware initiatives and
explore some java ee hacking techniques
and we have some toys to make a demos if
demo god allow us so the agenda we are
going to make an introduction talk about
open source hardware arduino things api
for java me and the demos so we believe
that we have three different waves
happening in the world one wave is the
new device generation it's crazy
device like a Android device the Samsung
s3 is a crazy device you you walk with a
data center in your pocket compared to
ten years ago and we have touchscreen
your lad and everything happening in
this direction the modern device by
other hand we also have open source
hardware that is very growing very fast
especially here in u.s. we see companies
like sparkfun selling a lot of stuffs
for developers that want to do the
projects by themselves and we have our
Louie know sunny spot was a rad one of
the first open source famous open source
hardware running Java raspberry pi
BeagleBoard
and I just bought this weak electric a
pin is an ARM Cortex n3 Wireless is
inside a SD card and the kit cost $30 so
it's crazy
electric in
so and we also have in other hand what
we are calling as old but gold device
hardware generation the old device that
is two very useful for different kinds
of perfect like I love the Nokia e75 is
a great phone very strong phone the Java
Meera's perfects inside and we have some
sports or our koi sport someone had a
Oracle sport or sunny spot yeah okay
nice taste percent of different and we
have other words running Java me that
you can use to make a hacking projects
just to remember how NASA launched in
that moon and the computer behind Apollo
the clock was two megahertz and they
have four kilobytes of memory and they
they went to the moon and we are using
quad core advice to play Angry Birds so
this device the still they are very
powerful we can do many thing with this
kind of device it's not a tenant's but
the old one the user one can be very
useful and the power of processing is
very it's very good compare it to to
Apollo computer yeah and we have more
than 3 trillion Java and yet pocket
controllers or cosine we check today
yeah half of population of the world you
need to have observe any device three
billion
to give some sensors well it's better
than none they rocket from 11:00 and as
you can see here is the same market
share from Sabre 2011 we can see that CB
OS iOS as soon Android Sony Ericsson as
you can see here is a mobile operating
system right mobile operating systems
but Java me is not exactly operating
system platform supported by single
supported by my bada ring slowly like
BlackBerry OS so it's good for us we
have if we are not so smaller than
Android in iOS we are there we are
you is doing we are more than 50% of the
devices in the world
if the CBO please write other 55.2
people are not only having or not buying
Java EE cell phones but it's - using it
we have mobile who here have a Japanese
phone or BB old phone just the people
from the zoo yeah and we have a new type
of consumer here what's kind of consumer
me so it don't wait one one to waste
that is consumer I want to 20 smile in
95 don't you carry on with me
and we can take advantage of these to
create new experience new software and
some kind of new new trends today one of
the endless open source hardware touches
well research harder is the concept that
you can take the hardware distribute
make money you don't have paid patents
patents is mostly for do-it-yourself
consumers and is a very exciting market
because we open source hardware bring
back the control of the harder to the
user that's the good part and it's a
very big and growing community all
around the world in Brazil that people
are crazy about doing doing home
automation doing robotics project and
monitoring sensors we thought they need
to buy some something from the company
specific company some examples rapper
hat is our 3d printer very famous pretty
pin pretty makeymakey
I will be using tomorrow I have another
talk tomorrow morning I'm going to use a
banana to change my slides tomorrow part
of Internet of the thing are things
banana can be part of the internet it's
amazing this is the Segway the the
open-source agree that you can build by
yourself
less than half price of the you spend
two thousand dollars and you can build
one and have fun with your family if you
have to eat you can you can work during
the weekend so it's a it's kind of a
lifestyle to build you the things by
yourself and once you start you cannot
stop anymore and the place you and the
tools just get bigger it's great thing
hacking and having
fun with open-source hardware is the
most important part Arduino is one of
the most famous project the last five or
seven years I think that the they are
making a lot of noise all around the
world before microchip microcontroller
that is so small to to a k of ram memory
and you can do even for here
transforming inside an Arduino so it's
good Arduino is very simple and it's
update based on this microcontroller
from HTML you can do the PCB by
ourselves in Brazil with teach kids how
to produce an Arduino from the scratch
they do other parts of the process of
creating a board it's very easy to draw
and do it yourself it's chipped $30 now
we have Raspberry Pi with the same cost
but it's for different proposals I
believe and the full language is widely
which is based on C and C++ which is I
used to say that YT is almost shop it's
a programming language in that that
would like to be Java but can't be job
because the resource inside Arduino is
too small and well that's the board the
original board that's the model but is
the most famous board the blue one so
you have the microcontroller USB is very
strong you can touch the components you
can fix by yourself the components and
it's different pronounced when you have
an arm-based board I'm on board are very
sensitive
if you have some electrical contact with
that party you just so you lose the
board because it's hard to fix by
herself
so you have money advantage here
especially when you are starting in this
area and you have different types of
Arduino Arduino base card we know this
is the VB patch to put inside the
clothes and you can you can hack a
clothe and you can have some jackets
special for blind people you can think
about this kind of project Arduino mega
which is a most more powerful board and
this one is our Arduino that we are
producing in Brazil and we are using for
educational proposal and this one is
there we know that we are
demonstrating here but it's the same as
a regular Arduino but we already have
some sensors and a motor driver and just
with this board you can do home
automation and robotics project without
soldering the Bluetooth connector so
that's the idea well why use Java me we
far do you know or I'm talking about
early you know but you can think about
any other microcontroller
you used to use well if you work with
Arduino or some limited microcontroller
and you need to put and you need to put
a graphical LCD in the board you are
going to spend a lot of money and you
are going to use many ideas to do that a
lot of time a lot of time to and you
have a special library for Arduino
sometimes this library doesn't talk with
another library because I do you know
it's not Java so you have the life of
the C++ library hell and arduino plus
yep GPS can be expensive but we know the
the memory to to to restore data
you just have to K of memory so why not
use an Arduino and use your old Java me
phone choose debug and to have a screen
to debug your Arduino how we can do it
this integration we can do Wireless
integration using IP wireless network or
you can use Bluetooth the wireless
module for Arduino is kind of expensive
and now we have electric game and they
have a shield that you can plug the left
in these shoes and plug the shield into
an already know so is the cheaper
solution to have an Arduino Wi-Fi button
is energy consuming the Wi-Fi but you
can do it it's very easy you have
bluetooth bluetooth is little more quick
to to work with
but this also easy is not hard or you
can integrate widened like if you have a
sunspot you are going to integrate some
spot doesn't have Bluetooth and the
communication of the wireless
communication is not it's not Wi-Fi and
you can do it this integration while
using i2c SPI or you can have a youth
USB host device like the audio board the
same board that Google uses to make the
accessory development teach for Android
you can use it also for Germany there
are universe Bluetooth integration is
very easy we just need a model that we
change I have spread friend are giving
me BAE for England's very very very
cheap
we connect the model to Adrienne with
the Parthians growl power and air exp X
but so Arduino can make a serial
connection with other devices like a
Xiaomi device or any kind of of the by
step he use a serial communication we
crack needle in the Java B side where we
use the jsr 82 JSI 82 is supported by a
large amount of devices if you are
interested and you know oh this my
devices support JS r ET tube you can
enter in this URL bit of a tailpipe a
wench dey's our HQ list there's a all
devices and are the best supported of
device that supports jsr 82 days are 82
depends only on CRC two modes you can
use the seller that's the phone
as flying or as a server we have pushed
as you through the neighborhood you can
use headphone as that engine cap and opx
protocols for protocols there is device
in service you have to connect your
devices and as watts services are
provided let you be in our demo here be
used and have gone
yeah is a protocol that it's like a
serial connection and we'll need to
serial connection between the Java ME
device and they all advise connected
it's our first demo with matrix I hope
actually this is just the architecture
to think that we are presenting here we
have the Nokia cell phone we have these
two small two from Sparkfun this one the
$10 motto actually is the China one but
you can find here it's not 399 means
this one is 39 yeah but it's very good
especially if you are doing
presentations it can deal with the Wi-Fi
network if you have many sign all's that
this Bluetooth module can work together
with another kind of noise so in module
8 and origin have some some special
thing inside this model and we have our
Arduino board yeah we plug it this
module in this connector which is the RX
TX connector we have a relay board here
our board alhat already have light
sensor and temperature
so we can control using our device we
can control two apps and we can monitor
those two sensors also we have here this
is a RGB LED striped so we are going to
show how to change the colors of your
house using your phone this one is a
relay board
okay well let's shoulder that the
application
so let's see how we can do it
Keita you are the commander man so here
I'm going to start the application I'm
using things mobile which means which is
a reference a reference implementation
of our API for the Java me and let's
start the application the nightly build
version already have a splash screen
this one doesn't have in another phone
so that's the the application we are
using you it to make it like better the
design better the someone here knows the
way okay so the application already
knows that Bluetooth modules that we are
using here I did the setup before
thought because if I ask to discover it
will discover all the devices in the
audience and will take some time to to
make the presentation so we have a
framework colored things mobile that it
can help you to discover and store the
address of the Bluetooth module so we
are ready to set up here let's see the
relay so the first connection will take
more time I'm going to click here to
turn on the relay and the cellphone will
ask to connect using bluetooth so I'm
allowing the cellphone to use bluetooth
it's starting the connection so now we
are connected to the Bluetooth module
and I can click here turn on and turn
off the land or anything else plug in
the socket so we have a key here another
relay represented by a coffe machine but
it's not a coffee machine and ok no
problem
the white here is broken but there
really are no no I relay switching ok ok
the other one was the green so we have
the control is fast and the kids can
have a lot of fun doing this and the RGB
now let's see let's see the RGB LEDs
right so rad I can put I can set up the
amount of red that I want I can combine
the colors here so let's turn off the
rad turn on the green turn off the green
and the blue and let's combine some
green and red so design hmm this stripe
is very useful for Christmas time hey
christmas API you have here the light
sensor ok the light sensor and oops no
problem
medium medium so let's put my hand in
the light sensor and see how
so but dark/medium and the temperature
sensor the first reading is kind of
crazy but the next is okay 21
let's go school makes sense anyone and
okay this part of the things mobile is
for home automation the same ad can
control this robot so let's put the
robot here yeah
the the good thing is that our things
mobile framework can work with multiple
Bluetooth device in the same app and it
can help you to manage and restore the
Bluetooth address and everything
the first connection will take more time
leave
well right whoa crazy man
right okay go ahead stop back oh sorry
go ahead
and this kind of robot you can do it
ourselves expanding a little bit more
than $100 so it's very inexpensive and
it's another way by the same way that we
are controlling the motors here you can
open and close the gates of your house
so the same concept home automation and
robotics is almost the same thing that's
the reason why we are starting this new
API colored things API or Internet of
Things and we have all the support for
Java EE
so things API which is behind the robot
and the home automation board this is an
API that are things we understand things
as sensors motors robots coffee machine
lamps bananas and everything that you
can integrate in the internet our API
promotes the integration between Java EE
SCE
and we are using the GPS we have a layer
with a history schedule does the relay
so you can schedule your coffee machine
using Java EE and you can use JMS to
control all these stuffs using Twitter
you can tweet to your house and you can
follow your heart and follow the sensors
of your house using two either or
another social and the other good part
of things API is that we have an
abstraction for Bluetooth device serial
device ID device and also CB device so
we try to make something that it's very
easy to use you say like things things
one table something dot st. command so
it's very very simple API and is a
uniform API the same interface that mean
plan
Java me is the same in the Java EE space
so it's very nice and we are launching
this new API is not ready yet we have a
prototype if you want to to see the
prototype we can sing to you but we is
not a public project because we are
working on actually from the last year
to this year we just respector our home
automation project to support robotics
and we set all let's do something very
generic for Internet of Things there is
some opportunities for this kind of API
and tomorrow in our top we are going to
show connect instruments musical
instruments integrated with the things
API and will be very fun our session
tomorrow more demos this is a piece of
food of the prototype version the things
API the website will be things API not
far but it's not launched yet but I just
my Twitter the news of this kind of
project well we may have good news first
let me try to get your car which that's
try to not yet no we are hearing that
it's gonna bind all the devices that we
can in testing those crazy you by here
the other day UPS device here is the
paradise for us so the code is very
simple things that you specify the you
poof URL with the address of your
Bluetooth and send a command to the
Bluetooth to the device that you are
communicating as you can see the mirror
behind it allow you to to make easily
connect to your if you are given instant
even the discovery part of Bluetooth yes
more easy using our API Iranian this
much fun they have to model the sewer
and the gold and the cool the second
website that is our kind of 30 meters
but it's not these four kind of five
meters
max
oh no for desktop we are using our xjx
it's terrible but we now are experts of
our XCX communication but we don't have
we didn't use the goal because they just
stopped the prefix is not running
anymore but we've Internet of Things I
think that they are going to - to read
more sky love because we need for the
desktop Wow there is life beyond phones
and I have a slim spot
Roger Brinkley please never wash your
bring that I did not have or the Arco a
spot this is a very nice device and it
was expensive for the time that they
launched the device but like many things
that son used to do they are they I had
they were a hat so you will have the
board with a censor board with facility
leader LEDs light sensor - driver for
modesty mothers and you have a three
octal register so you can multiply your
I open one of the first heart project
that I did was to integrate my sense pot
with Arduino and I did using a the same
spot is a 3 volt device and Arduino you
have Arduino 3 both but I use at at 5
volts so I need to make a conversion and
I did the conversion by myself I didn't
you
than kind of CI to do that I use
transistors and it's just one way
communication it's like from six blocks
to Arduino and I for my project I didn't
have the need to communicate from
Arduino to the since port and this
project is just a reference you have a
video here where I'm talking about this
project and I am controlling a very very
nice robot many years ago when I went
for the egg paint there to an egg beater
egg pretty right there so we have some
links part for things API so in sport
our company sorry my company Triangulum
soul soit's dot count of PR so minutes
if you if you want to to make some
contact just draw a line and we can we
can contact you and give more
information piece of code and once we
started things like a project we will
look for how if you are interest in
working or if you already work with
open-source hardware I believe is the
things that guy is a nice project for
YouTube to use and they cooperate with
us so we have more five minutes or QE
yes tomorrow then first day right
something changed go change and we need
to wait more time to lunch and okay
that's our contact thanks a lot being
here it's great thing to choose the
talks Java won many many talks happening
we are happy to have you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
