to easily and quickly install agents in
your IT Estate the new Oracle management
cloud setup is now part of a simplified
IT environment with less agents involved
however if you opt to use Enterprise
Manager cloud control you can use data
collector agents to inform your Oracle
management cloud platform about your IT
environment or environments the new
agent installation covers any
combination of an agent type like a
gateway data collector or cloud agent
plus an operating system such as Linux
or Windows when it comes to deploying an
Oracle management cloud agent
kuroh is no longer required agent
binaries are now tenant agnostic and
platform specific therefore during
installations the tenant ID parameter
can be passed to install the agent
against that tenant ID the download page
is more user friendly as well it
provides the agent bits download which
includes everything you need for a full
installation the page also allows you to
save your download anywhere including
shared locations one of the most
significant improvements is the
implementation and use of the response
file it has a user-friendly structure
highlighting what parameters are
mandatory according to each installation
type in even providing examples of what
type of parameter values are expected
you can also reuse parameters already
saved in this file for subsequent
installations thanks to the response
file you type shorter commands which are
less prone to human errors during
installations we've added a multiple
layer prerequisite checker that will
help you detect common issues or issues
specific to your environment last but
not least our error messages are more
user-friendly where you can easily
comprehend the issue and therefore focus
your attention where troubleshooting is
needed you can perform the agent
installation in three simple steps one
download the agent installer to execute
the agent installer and three confirm
that you had a successful installation
to complete this demo you must have
access to Oracle management cloud you
will need to provide parameter values
for 10 an ad upload route
agent registration key an agent-based
directory
step 1 start by downloading the agent
installer from Oracle management clouds
homepage click their icon then
administration click agents
and select the tab download then from
the drop-down box select cloud agent for
operating system select Linux
unzip the agent installer
you are now ready for step number two
executing the installation script for
the cloud agent begin by providing
parameters and the response file open
the file and take a quick look at its
contents starting with a mandatory
parameter section which is required for
all agent installations the next section
includes mandatory parameters which are
needed for data collector installations
then there is a non mandatory proxy
parameters section here for example if
your agents are communicating with the
Oracle management cloud platform through
a proxy then values for these parameters
are required the rest of the file
includes additional non mandatory
parameters that are common for all agent
installations or particular to cloud
agents or data collector installations
going back to the mandatory section for
your cloud agent installation the tenant
ID and upload route values are provided
in the agents download page
the agent registration key can be
created and obtained from the agents
page select the tab registration keys
create a registration key
then copy and paste that enter the
response file last but not least provide
the agent-based directory this is the
location where the agent resides on the
host machine just a quick example to
show how this response file can be used
for troubleshooting during your
installations delete a character from
the registration key save the file and
execute the agent install script there
should be an error since the
registration key is incomplete there it
is the installation cannot continue
because there is an issue with this key
to continue with the agent installation
open the response file and add the
character back and the registration key
save and execute the script once again
this time the script should run smoothly
there it is
to complete the installation run the
route script
the third and final step is to confirm
the installation was successful first
check that Oracle management cloud
detects the newly installed cloud agent
then executes to Oracle management cloud
commands status agent and studies agent
connectivity the status agent command
shows a list of properties for the new
agent pay close attention to the date
for last successful upload and less
attempted upload they both coincide
the status agent connectivity shows that
there are no significant issues with
connections associated with the agent an
Oracle management cloud this confirms
that you had a successful installation
