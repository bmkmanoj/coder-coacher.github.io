Oracle Database 12c new feature series
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum
this demo shows you how to recover it
either from backups without affecting
other objects in the tablespace of
schema this recovery method can reduce
time and disk space compared with prior
recovery methods in a demo environment
the Oracle database 12 1 is up and
running and the test environment is
created the tasks are overall divided
into two demos first we confirm the
configuration of the demo environment
which is typically a one-time task and
in the second demo we test the table
recovery from our main backups in more
details in this first demonstration we
confirm and configure the empty
directory for the auxiliary instance
that arman automatically creates that we
are using the oracle environment
variables correctly then we log in to
Sigma plus where we check compatibility
is set to 12 0 or higher will confirm
the backup location that archive lock is
enabled and that the test data that we
expect exists then in our mean we check
that auto backup of the control file is
enabled the our main retention policies
that we have the data in the tests table
that we expect and overall that we have
a level 0 backup first we create a
confirm an empty directory for the
auxiliary instance that our mean will
automatically create when we recover a
table as we demo it here in this example
we use a recursive Linux command I am to
remove everything that in zone was here
you
we confirmed that the environment
variables are pointing to the you RCL
instance and then we log into sequel
plus is the SIS DBE your database should
be up and running if not use the start
up command to start the database to be
able to take advantage of features new
to the Oracle database twelve one you
need to ensure that the compatibility
parameter is set to twelve zero or
higher which it is next we confirm the
backup location and you can see that it
is pointing to a location on disk then
we also confirm that the database is an
archive log mode assist EBE
you could use the archive log list
command but by default I suspect up you
cannot but in either case you can use
the Select as we show here in the slide
we want to ensure that the setup has
been executed so we clear with the DBA
tables view after a few formatting
commands and no row selected is exactly
the result that we expect now we are
creating the test table 3 into the test
user schema the table is created and we
are inserting a few test rows in
committing them now we are switching to
the our main interface pointing of
course to our demo database the easiest
way to send our main output both to a
log file under standard output is to use
the Linux T command or its equivalent
this there is no need to do this if your
standard output allows you to scroll as
much as you wish but the army output can
be long so it's good to be prepared
logged in to our main we confirm a
couple of settings
before we back up our database so here
we confirm that control file auto backup
is set to on if not you would use the
equivalent configure command to ensure
it is on it's also always good to
confirm the retention policy which is
set to redundancy one and then we
display the schema you see here that our
test tablespace exists is data file five
next we list existing backups and find a
level 0 database backup as you see we
have a full a level 0 database backup in
this demonstration we showed you the
basic items which you might want to
check before starting a table recover
you from backups so obviously that you
have a previous backup and that all
these parameters are correctly set
please view the next demo where we
execute the actual table recovery thanks
for watching this demonstration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
