engagement and monitoring welcomes you
to navigating a message stream here I'll
show you how easy it is to navigate a
message stream using engage so to get
started choose engage from the main menu
drop-down the monitoring system looks
similar to an email inbox let's take a
quick tour messages appear in the right
panel and the filter bar is on the left
and that's where you can select what
types of messages you want to view by
clicking on a folder type or a specific
channel channels are the source of your
messages either owned social properties
such as your Facebook page or Twitter
account or customized topic channels
configured using our listen tool so you
can keep track of your conversations
with fans and followers as well as
conversations about your brand or
industry across the social sphere you
can also find filtering options that
we'll show you in just a minute let's
take a look at how messages appear in
the stream a highlighted message with
the dot indicates an unread message the
number in the middle of the dot shows
how many unread messages are contained
in that thread for Facebook it indicates
the number of posts and comments and for
Twitter it indicates a new tweet or a
replied to your tweet for read messages
the dot has disappeared and the message
is no longer highlighted Media is shown
with the photo a link or a video icon
for Facebook messages a like or comment
count will appear to the right of the
message a retweet count appears to the
right of the Twitter message
let's go back now and take a look at the
filters panel filters are a great way to
sort and manage your messages you can
filter by folder channel and channel
type in addition you can create custom
labels that categorize your messages
here is an example of sorted messages
that have the awsomeness filter applied
you can also use filters to find
messages assigned to other team members
and you can select date ranges you can
watch our other demos that show more
information on how to apply filters to
your messages and manage them internally
so that's how easy it is to navigate
your messages in social engagement and
monitoring be sure to see our
documentation at the URL listed and see
our demos at the Oracle Learning Library
