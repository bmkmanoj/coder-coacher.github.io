passing model where we're sharing sequel
statements and using bind variables and
we now have a secure application that
can Sid can't be sequel injected we can
actually take it a little bit further
and how about avoiding even the soft
pass by just re executing the same
cursor over and over again and all we do
is change the about behind variables and
you'll notice that we've taken the
performance up probably about another
25% even maybe more for certain types of
applications and getting the performance
up over 40,000 transactions per second
bearing in mind we've taken an
application now from in the order of 300
transactions stated per second and we've
taken it up to 40,000 transactions just
by the way you write code now these are
orders of magnitude gains these could
never be solved by buying more Hardware
these could never be solved by buying
more software licenses this is just as a
result of writing good code that
harnesses the power of the database now
we can take this even a little bit
higher if we choose not to even do a
soft pass as we can see over here with
soft parsing every sequel statement and
actually just reuse the cursors over and
over again it's possible to step the
performance up even higher and you're
gonna see a transition again but the
transition is quite dramatic in that
suddenly we're now nearly getting close
up to 48,000 transactions per second
we've got the CPU a little busier and
the response time has come down even
more interesting to note that just a
single node of an Exadata
node is pushing through a hundred and
fifty-three sequel statements per second
fifteen hundred and fifty three thousand
I apologize sequel statements per second
and this represents probably close to
optimal for this note in terms of the
amount of sequel we can push through on
the machine but this is increase the
transaction rate to nearly double what
the requirement was or in fact over
double what the requirement was and
you'll notice that the database is just
running on the CPU there's no tuning to
be done the CPU is now at a high level
of utilization and that's the sort of
performance we'd associate it with it
but remember where we came from we came
from 300 transactions per second we've
gone up to 48,000 transactions per
second and all of this has been done by
changing the application code to use the
database in the manner it was designed
to be used I use a session pool or a
connection pool keep your cursors open
and share the cursors by users bind
variables
