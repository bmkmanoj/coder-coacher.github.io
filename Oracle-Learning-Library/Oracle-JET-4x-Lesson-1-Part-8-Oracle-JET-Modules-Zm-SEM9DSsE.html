of the three weekly lessons about Oracle
yet in this part you'll learn how to
create your own modules in an Oracle jet
application Oracle jet applications are
inherently modular though it is possible
to correct non-modular jet applications
doing so would mean missing out on one
of the key advantages of jet as soon as
you have used one of the jet templates
to set up your application as shown in
the previous parts of this course you
have an application infrastructure that
has all the hooks and handouts you need
for creating modules what is a module
how large should a module be what should
a module represent in your application
these are typical questions you should
be asking yourself right now when you
think back to the parts of this course
dealing with require and of knock-out
you'll have a very good idea about what
a jet module looks like an Oracle jet
module has his business logic expressed
in JavaScript and it's view expressed in
HTML the business logic is defined
within a defined block as provided by
require the view is connected to the
business logic via two-way data-binding
is provided by knockout
typically a module represents a new
section within your application which
provides a new feature to the user let's
now create a first Oracle jet module
using the Oracle jet application we set
up in the previous tasks that is the
applications defined by means of the
Oracle Jets command-line interface will
define a new module in it and integrates
it into the application here we see the
application that we've been looking at
so far in this course take note of the
navigation list along the top of the
application when a different item in the
navigation list is clicked different
content is loaded the content that is
loaded comes from a module that is
associated with the item in the
navigation list what we are now going to
create is a new Oracle jet module that
will be loaded when a new item in the
navigation list is clicked each module
in Oracle jet application is define
by default by a JavaScript file in the
source j/s view models folder and an
HTML file in the source jeaious views
folder the HTML file and the javascript
file have by default the same name so
for example about HTML and about Jas
customers HTML and customer J's a simple
way therefore to create a new Oracle
Jack module is to copy one of the
existing JavaScript files and one of the
existing HTML files and to rename them
according to your requirements another
way is in NetBeans to go to new and
other and then at the end of the html5
JavaScript category in the new file
dialog you will see that there are two
templates the first of which you will be
using here this is called empty jet
module it will create a simple Oracle
jet module putting the JavaScript file
and the HTML file in the right location
there is also the knockout jet module
template which creates a slightly more
complex Oracle jet module with more
detailed content we start by specifying
exactly where we would like our Oracle
jet module to be created and source jas
view models and in source jeaious views
we provide a name for our module for
example employees we imagine that we
want to create a new Oracle jet module
to manage the employees in our
application and we click finish we now
have employees HTML and employees GIS
employees J's is a simple define block
with some placeholder content a starting
point for your own logic as well as an
employee's HTML file with a simple h1
which you can expand with our own
content now that we have our employees
module how do you hook it into our
application
I found that we have not looked at yet
is the app controller GIS file this is a
file that by default provides the global
settings for usage throughout our
application the file is loaded into the
main GIS file in the require block in
mango yes take a look at the require
block and notice that app controller is
loaded here and that this referenced as
pointed out in the previous part in this
course the order in which parameters are
specified in the function callback
should match the order in which the
related item is loaded into the require
block the third item is app controller
and therefore the third item in the
function callback is our app controller
this is where the global properties are
loaded into the application at startup
and here are all the global properties
that are provided by default by the
template that you used to set up the
application notice that there is here a
section called router which we're going
to look at in more detail later and
there is also a section here called nav
data intuitively we see dashboard
incidents customers and about which
matches the names of the different
oracle jet modules
provided by default and similarly in nav
data there is dashboard incidents
customers and about without any further
detailed knowledge about what all of
this means we can already copy and paste
and change customers here to employees
and specify as label employees and
secondly we can copy our nav data and
paste it and again change the references
to match our employee requirements
having done that we have updated on
navigation setup we have updated our
router setup we save and then you go
back into the browser
in the browser we see that we now have
in addition to the modules we had at the
start an additional module for managing
our employees it has been integrated
very easily into our application and in
the same way we can remove modules from
our application for example to remove
customers we simply delete customers
from the router setup similarly we will
remove it from the navigation data we
save the file go back into the browser
and we notice that we don't have a
customers module anymore in short
creating new Oracle jet modules is easy
and integrating them into the
application is easy as well you have now
seen how to add new modules to your
application whichever approach you take
be aware of the benefits of Oracle Jets
integrated support for modularity and
structure our application so that you
can make use of these benefits yourself
for your homework user steps you have
learned in this part of the lesson to
create your own jet modules and add them
to the applications that you've been
creating so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
