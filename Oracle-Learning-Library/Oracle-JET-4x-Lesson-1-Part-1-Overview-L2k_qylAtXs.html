first lesson about Oracle judge in this
course we're going to be looking at the
oracle javascript extension toolkit
known as oracle jet or simply jet jet is
a free and open source JavaScript
toolkit filled with useful architectures
patterns templates techniques and
components you'll learn that jet is
especially useful when you are creating
enterprise applications that is
applications intended for business users
in JavaScript html5 and css3 for the
desktop browser as well as for browsers
for tablets and phones the aim of this
course is to give you an idea about how
you can use jet to solve the typical
problems that arise when organizations
want to use JavaScript to create the
user interface of enterprise
applications so we will talk about the
various aspects of modern enterprise
application development as well as the
research that has been done in this area
over a number of years at Oracle
developers at Oracle have been using
javascript for the user interface of
front-end of the browser targeted
development work for some years together
with a range of other development styles
primarily for applications supporting
the Oracle cloud the Oracle cloud
consists of a range of different
services focused on SAS that is software
as a service as well as path switches
platform as a service together with es
which is infrastructure as a service
applications can be developed to
interact with data provided by Oracle
services in a number of different ways
customers need to be able to access
those applications on all the devices
that have become popular over the past
years from desktops and laptops to
tablets and mobile phones since the
browser is available on all these modern
devices and since javascript is the
native language of the browser doing
research on the different ways that
javascript can be used to interact with
Oracle cloud services makes a lot of
sense and jet is the result of that
research you can
see jet as being Oracle's
recommendations and best practices for
working with JavaScript in enterprise
applications jet combines these best
practices together with a set of
JavaScript components and design
patterns jet is freely available and has
been open sourced under the universal
permissive license you can use these
recommendations and best practices
yourself when you create your own
enterprise applications that use
JavaScript for the applications user
interface what the benefits of this
approach are how to get started and how
to continue learning is the focus of
this course the JavaScript ecosystem has
seen a lot of innovation over the past
years the reasons for this are several
most important of always the rise and
continually increasing popularity of
mobile devices whenever you create an
application nowadays you need to at
least consider the possibility that your
users are likely to want to access it
from a mobile device
creating native applications for mobile
devices is expensive since each kind of
device has different negative
requirements for that reason so-called
hybrid solutions have become popular
particularly in the enterprise space
where the benefits gained from native
application development unless relevant
a very wide variety of techniques
frameworks libraries and components are
available to support development in
JavaScript for mobile oriented platforms
while it makes the JavaScript ecosystem
an exciting place to be it also makes
for an unstable environment that is of
course a problem when you are creating
enterprise applications since ideally
you'd want applications targeted at
business users to remain maintainable
and relevant over a number of years with
jet the decision was made to not
introduce yet another framework or
library to the already unstable
JavaScript ecosystem instead jet gathers
a number of stable and popular open
source libraries that already exists
adds a set of GUI components on top of
them and helps you to get started via
patterns templates and tools
in this part you have been introduced to
the context in which jet has been put
together you have learned that jet is
not a framework and not itself a library
instead it is a toolkit of existing
JavaScript libraries that have been
gathered together to provide a stable
architecture on top of which browser
targeted applications can conveniently
be built this approach to web
browser-based application development is
the same used by Oracle itself for its
own Oracle cloud services in subsequent
parts of this course you will learn
about the stable architecture provided
budgets together with its rich set of
GUI components and many other features
relevant to enterprise applications
welcome to Oracle jet we wish you all
the best in learning about jet as the
basis of your enterprise applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
