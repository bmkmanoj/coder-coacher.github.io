Oracle Stream Explorer this is business
user friendly tooling enabling you to
create innovative sophisticated
real-time streaming analytics
applications in minutes first of all I'm
going to authenticate and login to the
Oracle Stream explorer here I'm
presented with the landing page which
provides the various industries in which
you can create your real-time streaming
analytics applications if I select the
Internet of Things here I can see the
section of a catalog of the OCO streams
floor those artifacts related to the IOT
section of the catalog is indicated by
using add tags here
IOT and you can see the various
artifacts supported by the Oracle Stream
explorer we have streams this allows you
to connect and define the relevant event
sources that provides the event shapes
that you'll use in your explorations a
reference allows you to define an Oracle
database table or any other database
tables supported by the Oracle stream
Explorer which can used to add context
to your streaming information we have
patterns patterns are predefined
solutions provided by the stream
Explorer to which you apply a various
stream definition and we support several
different patterns for your use in
different application use cases finally
we have explorations these are the
real-time streaming analytics at the
patience that you can dynamically create
using the old go stream Explorer if we
take a look at these artifacts at a
reference here you can see a data
reference used for an oracle database
table with define shape from the columns
in this oracle database table if we take
a look at a stream the oracle stream
explorer supports many types of streams
this is a serious file stream which
allows you to point to a local csv file
that you've defined to simulate event
data and then had the olga stream
explorer stream that information into
application your exploration through
your analysis if we take a look at an
exploration a device monitoring
aspiration you can see an exploration
has been defined that correlates between
a stream and an oracle database table
using this correlation of the device ID
to ID you can also see that we define a
filter which is the error code not equal
to zero zero zero zero which is actually
a cql a continuous query language
statement that has been defined
dynamically by the stream Explorer in
this application here you can see the
results of the streaming data from in
this case as CSV file and the streams
flower also provides graphical
information regarding the tabular data
that's flowing in the live view we have
various different graphs that you can
use within the stream Explorer to look
at the data and various ways which
include line and scatter charts
in the street Explorer we also can
configure targets these are the sinks
invent sinks for your applications that
can be CSV files pasted to be published
and subscribe event delivery network JMS
and the rest the string Explorer also
allows you to define information related
to application such as defining the tags
associated to identify the application
and specifics of the applications itself
description and obviously the name one
key area is the actions here you can
publish an application or expiration
which allows it to be used by other
business users other users of the system
as input to their own explorations you
can unpublish you can discard changes
you've made to the expiration and
importantly you can export the
expiration which can then be imported
into JDeveloper for further augmentation
and to add new functionality provided
within that development environment
within your catalog we have options to
sort the various artifacts by recent
name and favorites we also provide you
with preferences about to indicate the
version of the Oracle stream Explorer
and when you've completed your usage of
the oldest tree Explorer you can and
sign out of the environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
