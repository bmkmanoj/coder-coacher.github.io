lambdas and streams massive online open
course when java SE 8 was released last
year it included a number of significant
new futures in fact JDK 8 is the biggest
change to the platform since its launch
nearly 20 years ago the syntax of the
language to now support lambda
expressions and class libraries now
contain the new stream api these
features enable you to program in a more
concise flexible way that can take
advantage of multiple cores and CPUs in
your machine to help you understand how
to use these new features we've created
a three week massive open online course
that is completely free in the first
week we'll explain why we need lambda
expressions in Java and why we have
added this feature after 20 years to the
language we'll talk about the syntax of
lambda expressions where and when you
can use them and will explain the rules
that govern their use then we'll give
you some examples of where you can use
them places like the collections API
which has new methods such as remove it
and replace all in the second week of
the course we'll introduce the street
API itself which makes extensive use of
lambda expressions to define behaviors
when you use methods like filter map and
reduce we'll also show you how to create
streams the way you obtain stream
sources whether it's from a collection
from buffer reader a zip file a jar file
and so on we'll talk about how to use
intermediate operations things like
filter and map but other ones as well
and then we'll discuss how to get a
result from the stream using terminal
operations the other thing we're going
to talk about in this part of the course
is the optional class which again is new
in JDK 8 this class makes it easier to
avoid null pointer exceptions when for
example we're attempting to find the
maximum value in a stream but the stream
doesn't have any element
in the final week we're gonna look at
some more advanced topics related to
streams will discuss how to optimize our
code in terms of using parallel streams
the details of collectors and we'll also
look into how to use reductions
correctly at the end of the course
you'll receive a certificate of
completion verifying you've completed
all of the modules and exercises last
year we ran a MOOC for embedded Java
which was very popular we're really
hoping that this course is going to be
even more successful so please sign up
and find out how to use these great new
features in Java thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
