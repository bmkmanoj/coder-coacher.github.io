database
now you can define a sequel developer
connection to the database in your
autonomous data warehouse cloud service
open sequel developer and define a
connection
specify a connection name enter the
database username using the default
administrator database account admin
that is provided as part of the service
enter the admin users password that you
or your cloud administrator specified

to your autonomous data warehouse cloud
database use a sequel developer
worksheet to define database users
autonomous data warehouse cloud
databases come with a predefined
database role named DW role this role
provides the common privileges for a
data warehouse developer
for detailed steps on performing the
example shown in this video go to the
