work for Oracle server technologies this
is the sixth demo of seven
demonstrations about in-memory
columnstore new feature introduced in
Oracle database 12 100 - this one
illustrates how to handle I am : store
with Enterprise Manager cloud control
and we will first cover how to monitor I
am : store how to configure I am : store
and how to handle in memory segments and
their attributes
let's first monitor the current
situation about I am current store in
the ORCL database instance first login
to enterprise manager cloud control and
select the r CL database instance that
you want to monitor the I am Colin store
sighs click administration and then in
memory central for sections appear the
top left section displays the current I
am Colin store configuration the size of
the I am column store which corresponds
to the in-memory size instance parameter
value then the number of bytes in the I
am column store used by in memory
segments to understand the meaning of
this parameter watched the demo about
compression the bottom left section
displays I am current store information
about objects like statistics about the
number of bytes used by in memory
segments populated into the OEM con
story like the in-memory compression
factor the current one explaining that
one byte in am column stores tourist
1.25 fights from in memory segments on
disk the
same section displays the total size on
disk of all objects and the total size
on disk of all in memory objects you can
also see the distribution of in memory
objects currently only non partitioned
tables are in memory enabled the bottom
right section displays the list of in
memory objects currently populated into
the am column store there are two tables
completely populated into the I am :
store with distinct in-memory
compression to configure the I am column
store you can choose two methods first
method click Edit the focus is
immediately on in-memory parameters to
understand the meaning of the parameters
watch other demos like in memory
compression in memory columns and in
memory queries you can modify the
in-memory closed default instance
parameter value and keep it in the SP
file to use the second method click
performance and then advisors home you
are requested to provide credentials to
log in the or RCL instance as you intend
to set the I am : storage size in memory
you have to login as C's DBA then click
the memory advisers link you are now in
the memory advisers page scroll down to
see the current allocation you can see
that a SMM automatic shared memory
management is enabled which means that
the SGA target is the instance parameter
used to allocate bytes to the different
SG pools although a SMM is enabled the
warning says that automatic shared
memory management does not apply to the
in memory pool display the current value
of in memory size it is set to two
thousands megabytes the pie chart on the
right shows that it corresponds to forty
four point three percent of the SGA the
buffer cache is allocated one thousand
eight hundred and eight megabytes for
the moment disabled a yes mm so that you
can increase the in memory source
instance parameter value and keep the
current allocation for the buffer cache
said the in memory pool to two thousand
five hundred megabytes and click OK a
confirmation message says that the
changes have been made successfully but
because in memory size instance permit
is a static one the instance has to be
restarted if you want the new value to
be taken into account the secret
statement that corresponds to this
operation is outer system set in memory
size equal two thousand and five hundred
megabytes scope USB file lets now handle
in memory segments and their in-memory
attributes we are going to check in
memory attributes in place for a non
partition table click schema then
database objects and tables enter SSB in
the schema field and click go to find
all objects in the SSB schema select the
I am city table and click Edit the three
columns of the table structure appear
click the in-memory columnar tab the top
section allows you to modify the
in-memory attributes for the table
compression attribute the priority
attributes and the distribution
attribute if you are in a rack
environment the three colons are in
memory and check in memory for the c3
column change the in-memory compression
level for the currency to two query
based compression
click show sequel to see the sequel
statement that corresponds to these
changes click execute and multiple
databases enter host credentials in the
top right hand side of the screen and
database credentials at the bottom right
hand side of the screen then click run
wait until processing executing sigil
completes
once the statement completed the
succeeded value set to 1 means that the
operation succeeded to verify click
schemer again then database objects and
finally tables enter SSB in schema and
click go select the I am city table
again and click edit not the view option
because it does not show the column
details Cullen c1 c2 c3 appear click the
in-memory columnar tab to Collins only
are in memory Colin C 2 has an in-memory
compression level of query based
compression whereas Cullen C 1 may have
a different in memory compression level
it depends on the value set by default
in the in-memory close default instance
parameter now we are going to check in
memory attributes in place for a
partition table and its partitions click
schema then database objects and tables
enter SSB in the Skiba field and click
go to find all objects in SSB schemer
again select the country's per table and
click Edit C and seat columns are listed
c2 is the partition key click the
partitions tab to get all partitions of
the table 2 partitions are listed p1 and
p2 p1 is the active partition requiring
compression for query and p2 is the
history partition requiring compression
for capacity hi select partition 1
and click Advanced Options click the
in-memory columnar tab modify the
in-memory attributes compression
priority and distribution keep query
based compression for the active
partition query based compression
provides high performance while capacity
high provides a higher compression ratio
capacity low achieves balance between
performance and capacity click cancel
and select the partition P 2 and click
Advanced Options click the in-memory
columnar tab and set the capacity based
compression and high for the history
partition click OK the action is pending
until you click apply before applying
show the sequel statement used and now
click apply and you receive the message
that the partitions have been updated
this is the end of the demonstration and
