experience cloud when the Oracle content
desktop sync client is installed a
folder is created locally to store all
folders synced between the cloud and
your computers the easiest way to open
this folder and get started is to use
the Oracle content icon in the system
tray or Mac finder menu click the icon
to open a features menu use the features
menu to open your local Oracle content
folder you can also use it to open a
list of folders in the cloud that you
sync locally and select those you want
to add or remove notice how the icons of
your local folders change to reflect the
synced status of the folders right-click
on a local synced folder to view an
options menu allowing you to easily
share a folder view folder properties
and other tasks such as accessing
conversations note that if you stop
syncing a folder all of the folder
content is deleted locally but is still
available in the cloud if however you
delete content from a local directory
without stoping sync then the files will
also be deleted in the cloud
automatically as the folder syncs if you
ever want to pause sync for example
while you are editing a file select
pause all sync from the Oracle content
features menu when you want to resume
select resume all sync it's possible
that you may have more than one account
in Oracle content meaning that you may
log in to more than one server using
different server addresses if so you can
add multiple accounts to be accessed by
the desktop client in your preferences
open from your features menu where you
enter the server address and login
credentials used for each account
