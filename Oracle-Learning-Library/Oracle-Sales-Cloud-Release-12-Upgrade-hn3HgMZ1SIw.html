on preparing for your oracle salescloud
upgrade to release 12 my name is anne
and i'm a member of the customer
experience cloud center of excellence
best practices team during this
presentation I'm going to very quickly
review some of the released 12
highlights then I want to point you to
the materials that can help you
understand all the new features and see
quite a few of them in action after that
I'll review guidelines around upgrading
those are best practices or tasks that
you have to perform before your upgrade
and then I'll tie it all together under
a project plan with a recommended time
frame that you can follow so let's start
with the release twelve highlights now
on a high-level we can say that there
are four release twelve themes the new
enterprise mobile application data
visualization capabilities the new
engagement cloud and our expanded set of
customer experience industry solutions
now I'm not going to spend a lot of time
on these since other resources actually
present more details sometimes even
demos about each of these but one of
those that I think everyone will want to
use regardless of your industry is the
new Oracle sales cloud enterprise mobile
application now I'm sure you're familiar
with our other mobile applications but
this one was built to consolidate
multiple roles and functions spanning
really what was available in some of our
other add-on applications in addition to
being faster and of course easier to use
so briefly the enterprise mobile app
enables sales reps sales managers
channel account managers and partner
sales
it's to more effectively manage their
day and nurture customer relationships
using a smartphone or tablet now it also
has built-in analytics along with a new
mobile application composer that's
available directly from within the
current application composer and so that
provides really an array of
configuration options along with this
great drag and drop interface so again I
see huge benefits to every company
across the board as far as the timeframe
for the availability of this new
enterprise mobile app I believe it's not
available in the initial release 12
upgrade but will be available in a later
update in release 12 so keep an eye out
for that line of course and watch the
demo so you can let everyone know as
soon as it's available the next theme
Oracle data visualization is not new
it's been available as a platform
service for quite a while now but it's
now available as a separate license to
sales cloud it's intended to complement
business intelligence features that you
already have so that you can connect
data from Oracle's cloud applications
on-premise apps
third-party apps and even spreadsheets
and its many benefits are summarized
here on this slide about the new Oracle
engagement cloud
well it extends sales cloud to service
request management and knowledge
management capabilities so that sales
and service reps can capture and track
service issues and you also have the
option of configuring assignment rules
to automatically assign service requests
to the appropriate queue so the right
team is working on each issue and then
as the fourth team and this is really
just an FYI and to reinforce the fact
that we're constantly expanding our set
of solutions we now offer a solution for
higher education institutions in
addition to the currently available CX
solutions for the high-tech and
manufacturer
in financial services consumer goods and
communication industries now those are
our released 12 themes but as you know
there are lots of more features coming
with release 12 and one that I want to
introduce here is the group of
enhancements related to security and our
role based access control as you might
be aware we've been simplifying the role
structure that we deliver with the
product and that began with release 10
and what we called the simplified
reference role model so we're continuing
with that by simplifying the hierarchy
even further
beginning with release 12 we're also
locking down the predefined roles and
privileges so when you need to customize
a role this feature will force you to
copy those predefined roles and
customize the copies which is the best
practice that we've been advocating for
a while now along with that we'll be
resetting the predefined and I'm talking
about the standard roles and privileges
back to their original settings now
we're only talking about the predefined
roles that we delivered with oracle
salescloud
not any custom roles you might be
wondering why we did that and we did
that because it avoids conflicts when
you customize roles and privileges and
it also safeguards those roles for
future upgrades and another security
enhancement is that before release 12
all the security administration
functions were distributed across the
Oracle Identity Management the OEM and
the authorization policy manager the APM
but in release 12 these functions are
delivered through a single interface
that's the security console so oh I am
and a PM are no longer available in
release 12 that means that IT
administrators will use the Security
Council as the only tool where they can
perform functions such as user lifecycle
management role definition security
policy management
that's both functional and data role
hierarchy maintenance and both username
and password policy administration now
that you've been introduced to some
released twelve features how can you
find out more that's what I'd like to
cover next well if you've been around
for a few releases you're familiar with
the resources and sites to access them
in previous releases but I always like
to reiterate that information with each
upgrade basically we have three landing
pages to use as starting points for
getting up to speed on release twelve
the first is the site where you can
access the what's new guide and lots of
videos that product managers produce to
highlight the new features and that's on
the customer experience release
readiness page and then we have oracle
customer connect where you can find
upgrade information release update
schedules discussions and session
replays and the third one is on my
Oracle support where you'll see more
resources as we develop them for release
12 now I can't emphasize enough how
important it is to review these
materials to fully understand all the
benefits and changes in release 12
because you'll not only be advising
everyone about the upgrade schedule and
new features that will help them with
the work but you'll also be working with
let's say sales managers and sales
administrators to determine which new
features they want to set up at your
company after the upgrade so I want to
go into a little more detail on each one
of these starting with a customer
experience release readiness page and
here I've included the steps to get to
that page for your use and to pass along
to your sales team because this is
probably where you and others at your
organization want to begin educating
yourselves on release twelve you can
find videos and PDFs explaining those
things I mentioned at the beginning of
this presentation and then delve deeper
into all the resource 12 features and
that's where you'll find the what's new
guide which is organized around
functional areas in the product and it
describes all the new feature
and how to enable them it also links to
other resources such as the security
upgrade guide where we provide
information about those new features
tied to privileges in release 12 and
you'll notice that some features are
marked with a special icon a black
diamond which means that those features
will be phased in over the next few
updates but not with the initial
delivery of release 12 at the beginning
of the wets new guide is a table that
provides some useful information at a
glance it indicates which features are
automatically available to you as the
administrator or to your end users or to
your security manager etc now back on
the release readiness page you'll also
see an ever-increasing list of videos
illustrating some of the new features
and that will appear under a section
titled release training as I've
mentioned in previous sessions for my
own process I often start with a what's
new guide and then jump to the videos to
reinforce or really to see an action
what I've just read about in fact the
future description in the what's new
guide tells you which videos contain
more information or demos about that
feature so these resources really
complement each other and can help you
assess what can be leveraged to improve
your sales teams productivity you're
probably already a member of customer
connect but here's a reminder as to how
to access that site to find more upgrade
information and to attend events with
topics specific to release 12 now if you
tend these sessions in person of course
you can ask the experts at Oracle any
questions you might have but you also
have the option of watching the replace
which are linked from the customer
connect site itself the last landing
page as I mentioned is an article and my
Oracle support and it really serves as a
sort of index of available resources for
your upgrade so it contains a link to
this presentation a PDF file of these
slides and some other valuable
information as it becomes available
around upgrading or areas that you might
need to be aware of areas that might
affect you if you have certain features
or certain situations and because we can
update this medical support article in a
matter of minutes it might contain some
information that you'll want to know
about before that same information gets
integrated into the other resources so
just keep that in mind as you continue
to review materials related to your
upgrade so far I've talked about some
released 12 highlights and now you know
how to get the full range of info about
all the new features through those
resources and landing pages I just
listed now let's talk about some
guidelines I want to pass along and I
want to break this topic down into three
areas starting with a quick description
of what happens during an upgrade which
you probably already know but I just
want to quickly summarize and then I'll
talk about some activities you might
need to do before upgrading to release
twelve if and only if they apply to you
and then I'll do a quick review of
specific tasks everyone has to do before
every upgrade during an upgrade your
environment becomes unavailable during
your scheduled date sometimes
so first oracle updates your non
production environment where you do your
testing and at a later date oracle
upgrades your production environment
however some of you might have opted for
the concurrent update schedule if you're
not yet live and if you're on that
concurrent update schedule your
production environment is upgraded at
the same time as your non production
environments and with the upgrade the
new release 12 features are added now
out of those release twelve features as
I explained when I pointed out the table
at the beginning of the what's new guide
some features are automatically visible
to your users so some will be available
invisible to your sales administrators
some to your sales managers and sale
threats some to your IT security manager
etc now these are generally user
interface improvements or maybe a new
option that's available to users or
administrative enhancements so there's
no reason to keep these hidden there
automatically exposed but I do want to
introduce you to one important feature
to be aware of and that is this last
bullet point compliance with data
security requirements so Oracle now
protects confidential and sensitive
information
now with release twelve fields such as
social security number home address bank
account numbers and other personally
identifiable fields are now
automatically masked if you have
customized your page layouts by adding
those specific fields to your contact
pages so this helps our customers meet
legal regulations and limit liability
for them and safeguard personal
reputation so it's a big plus but if
your company relies on that information
to do its daily business then you'll
have to take steps to expose that
private information because after the
upgrade values for those fields will not
be visible and I'll talk about this a
little more in a minute so that's the
first bucket of features those features
that are automatically visible to users
the second bucket consists of features
that need to be enabled by the end-user
or an administrator but they can be done
with just a simple step or two and by
enabling them you really have minimal
risk of any functional interruptions so
for example I would classify the
enterprise mobile application as one of
those as well as anything that entails
adding a field or sub tab to a page
layout or changing the default setting
for profile options so all of these are
very straightforward and easy to do
and then there are the features that
might require some planning maybe it
calls for some discussion with other
people at your organization or just
something you really want to review
before setting it up so one example
would be if a new feature simply expands
an existing capability to another role
you might need to consult with others to
determine if that's something you want
to do another one of those is in the
area of user lifecycle settings with
respect to password policy and the rules
for generating user names when a new
user is added to your organization what
I mean is that going forward we support
a set of password and user name rules so
if you've customized those areas by
logging NSS and having Oracle set it up
for you you'll need to select from a set
of supported password policies username
generation rules and notification
templates now your users won't
experience a change in functionality but
new users you ad will have to conform to
the rules you select so depending on
who's in charge of that area of the
product that might be an area that you
need to discuss before implementing also
requiring some planning is any new
feature controlled by a privilege which
is part of security because your IT
security manager is probably the person
who will add those privileges to your
custom roles which is how you enable the
feature you may not already that the way
an upgrade works is if you have not
customized your security roles then new
features are automatically enabled for
those predefined roles this applies to
roles in the released and simplified
role model if you have customized your
security roles then privileges need to
be manually added to custom roles ok so
what do you have to do for each of these
buckets well with those features that
are automatically visible to users the
first group you really just need to make
sure that they're aware of
before the upgrade on your production
environment because you really don't
want your users to experience any
surprises on Monday morning when they
first log in to release 12 for the next
set of features you just want to wait
till the upgrade is stable and then roll
out those benefits communicating to your
users as you go and for the third bucket
you'll need to talk to stakeholders and
really set up a time frame to roll out
those new features also communicating
changes to all the affected users you
might be wondering how you know which
bucket each feature falls into well it's
all in the Westerner guide and release
training which often describes which
predefined or standard roles will
automatically inherit that feature and
often overlooked don't forget about the
release 12 documentation in the Oracle
Help Center that's the general
documentation which doesn't explain the
differences between releases but it
might provide insight into how that new
feature fits into the functional area as
a whole and you can download versions
for offline viewing now here are some
examples of these buckets that I've been
explaining so I'm looking at the table
in the front of the western new guide
and I see columns indicating if the
feature is available to any user at my
company and I see that for sales
forecasting there are several features
that sales reps and sales managers need
to know about so I might point them to
the what's new guide since it's publicly
available and send the relevant
information to the specific people at my
company
continuing with sales forecasting I see
a few features that the sales
administrator should probably understand
and enable if it's beneficial to our
business so I might ask them if they
want to expose the trend graph and
consider if they want sales reps to be
able to make revenue or quantity
adjustments to forecast items within
their territory currently only sales
managers
do that so if they do want to extend
that capability I'll have to set up a
time frame for them to perform those
steps at least a couple of weeks after
the upgrade is stable with regards to
features that require some planning I
want to go back to personally
identifiable information which is the
data security enhancement in release 12
meaning that if your company added
specific fields to hold personal
information about your contacts then
that data will be hidden after the
upgrade now Oracle has performed a scan
and will notify you if your environment
has those fields on your layouts and
this notification directs you to
resources you should review because
although this feature is not tied to a
privilege exposing that data is
controlled by a security privilege so
let's say that your sales reps or sales
managers need to see that information to
conduct their business then your IT
security manager will need to add
privileges to those roles and the
resources listed here provide
instructions to do that so have your IT
security manager test out the procedure
on your non production environment after
its upgrade to release 12 and then that
same person should be ready to do it on
your production environment after the
upgrade so your action items for this
feature would depend on if you need to
expose that information or not if it's
fine to have that data hidden then
you'll just want to tell those who use
that contact layout to expect to see the
pound signed masking that data and as I
just mentioned if you do need that
information available to certain users
then you have to add privileges to those
roles and it's really one privilege for
each field you need to expose as you can
see most features are opted in and this
capability has huge benefits it lets you
test the upgrade independently of its
new features take time to determine
which new features to roll out when and
to which roles and better utilize your
time and resource
is to schedule rolling out new features
continuing with other guidelines around
upgrading let's talk about what pre
upgrade activities you need to consider
before your upgrades release 12 and
these are really geared towards specific
customers just a subset of our customers
and I've listed them here now that first
one is if you started with relief 8 or
earlier you absolutely must perform this
task before your upgrade to release 12
so if you customize the Sales Account
object and haven't yet moved those
custom fields and custom child objects
to the account or contact object then
this is a critical task to perform now
it's a one time job that begins with
logging in sr4 Oracle to start the
process and you must do it now because
the sales account object will no longer
be available in release 12 and to help
you get started here are links to two
documents that explain what the process
entails so you can schedule it as soon
as possible by logging in SR and then
beginning with release 9 we've been
telling you to transition to your
simplified pages those duplicates of
your original desktop or classic pages
so if you haven't done this yet make
sure you're talking to your CSM's or
your is ms about what's really
preventing you from doing that and again
here are resources to help you with that
task remember that most of our resources
including help now describe strictly how
this simplified UI works so much of that
information really won't make sense
unless your sales team is using the
simplified pages so you really want to
get them on that as soon as possible if
you haven't already and the third task
is around the security enhancements in
release 12 and it applies to customers
who are on the release 10 simplified
role model and I mentioned that the
predefined the standard roles and
privileges that are delivered with
oracle salescloud are being reset to
their original settings so if you
directly customize those and I mean that
you did not copy them
first and customize the copies creating
custom roles and privileges but instead
you apply changes directly to the
standard roles or privileges then in
February
Oracle notified you about steps that
they were taking to preserve those
customizations which may or may not
require some follow up steps by you so
if you're unsure about this follow up
with your CSM or your is M you would
have already received these emails if
our scans identified you as having done
this and again we're not talking about
custom roles there untouched
only if you directly customize our
standard roles or privileges and here
are the resources that we pointed you to
in our notifications okay so those were
tasks for only some of our customers now
to the guidelines for everyone to follow
before they're upgrade regardless of
what release you started with so before
your upgrade make sure that your non
production and production environments
are in sync and that means that they
should not be significantly out of sync
with regards to business or
transactional data system setups
extensions and configurations that
define data structure page layouts
reports workflows etc so if they are out
of sync then you need to perform an
environment refresh or p2t as we
sometimes refer to it and you must do
this a minimum of four to six weeks in
advance of your non production upgrade
by logging in SR the environment refresh
article listed here provides more
information now keeping environments in
sync means that you need to plan when to
stop customizing and testing in
sandboxes because you must publish or
delete your sandbox before your upgrade
and if you're following our best
practice of phasing in new features over
time be sure to stop that in other words
don't introduce new features from
release 11 to close in time to the
upgrade to release 12 and then we always
include this warning
you must move all your customized
reports to a safe folder so now let's
move to the guidelines for the phase
after your upgrade you always want to
check if there are any post upgrade
tasks that are specific to this release
so look at the what's new guide where
there's a post upgrade task section and
check the performing your release 12
upgrade article in my Oracle support and
the second post upgrade task is to roll
out new features in phases for this task
follow our best practice about releasing
the basic upgrade to your users making
sure all the behavior is the same as
before the upgrade so you're waiting
till the upgrade is stable and then
phasing in the new features a few weeks
or months after the upgrade has been
successfully deployed in fact our
recommendation is to roll out just one
or two features at a time and as I
mentioned earlier in this presentation
some of those features are going to be
fairly straightforward while others
require some planning okay so now that
you have the details around many of the
tasks in our project plan let's take a
look at how it all fits together in a
time frame we've broken down the project
plan into several stages and I'll spend
the next few minutes describing each of
these in more detail it begins a few
weeks before the first phase of upgrades
and it ends where the deployment of
release 12 you do the steps for some of
the stages and Oracle does the actual
upgrade on your environments of course
we have different schedules for live
customers vs. not yet live customers and
by that we mean that live customers are
those who have deployed oracle
salescloud
on their production environment others
are all other customers who are still
implementing oracle salescloud
so notice that we factor in two more
weeks for you to validate your upgrade
on your non production environment if
you are a live customer and that's
really the only difference in the
schedule
we scheduled upgrades once or twice each
year and they're performed in waves we
first do an upgrade on your non
production environment or environments
if you have multiple non production
environments and then your production
environment now how do we determine your
initial upgrade dates well for most of
you you'll discuss that with your Oracle
contact and that's generally your CSM or
is M and based on your feedback that
Oracle contact will request an upgrade
wave that's early main or late phase and
dates within that wave and it's done
through an internal tool that's
available to them now the process is a
little different if you have a multi
pillar environment which is also known
as a global single instance or GSI
environment in that case because it does
involve several different applications
you select your dates from your my
services cloud portal from the dates
available to you and of course we try
our best to accommodate those dates when
we do accept those dates then we'll send
you an email with instructions on how to
approve or confirm your upgrade dates on
both your production and non production
environments and that notification
begins a series of emails and other
events to move you through your upgrade
so let's talk about those beginning with
that notification I just mentioned
everything on this slide is done by
Oracle except for the boxes in green
that I'm going to show you and that's
what you'll need to do so to begin as I
mentioned Oracle sends you the first
email again this email contains the
dates that Oracle has scheduled for
upgrades to both your production and non
production environments it also provides
instructions in the email to approve
these dates and beginning with this
release it will point you to your my
services cloud portal now this is a
change in the process up until now you
logged in SR to acknowledge the dates or
to request a different date now it's
through your my service
portal so be sure to do that within one
week even better if it's within 72 hours
of receiving the email at this point you
can request a different date but it must
be in the same wave as the initially
requested one I'll show you the my
services portal and describe the
approval flow in a minute but let's
continue focusing on the communications
you'll get from Oracle so next we'll
send you an email confirming those dates
for all your environments within 24
hours if you're planning to do an
environment refresh a p2t log your SR at
this time that will give Oracle and you
enough time before your upgrade to do
that now the next two emails are
reminders about your dates one is then
about six weeks before the upgrade of
your non production environment and
another one is then about four weeks
before the upgrade of your non
production environment so both of these
reminders contain the dates for both
environments so you will not get
separate reminders for each environment
the next emails that you'll get do apply
to each single environment they come
from operations to remind you of the
exact upgrade time and date which we
send three days before the upgrade of
the non production environment and then
again three days before the upgrade of
your production environment and then the
last ones are to notify you that the
upgrade has completed on that
environment and finally outside of this
email flow because it's so important for
live customers only an Oracle contact
will verify your schedule with you one
week before your upgrade is scheduled on
your production environment and that's
just your production environment now who
receives all these upgrade notifications
well all the users whose information we
have on the my services portal as shown
here so you want to carefully review
that information to verify that the
names and email addresses are up to date
and here's the change in the process
which involves approving or rescheduling
dates for your upgrades through my
services
not through my Oracle support once you
as a service administrator receives the
email that argyll sends requesting that
you approve your dates you sign into my
services for each of your environments
and on your dashboard click the link as
shown here this opens the calendar with
a date which is color-coded according to
the status in the process and you drill
down on the date to approve or
reschedule your dates and accept the
terms and conditions and the calendar
reflects the new status you're also
prompted in this new process to specify
a technical contact whom Oracle can call
if any problems arise during the actual
upgrade okay so that's the date approval
process through my services but what
happens if we don't receive confirmation
from you within that one-week window
well we'll send you several reminders
over several weeks with the last one
going out two weeks before the original
upgrade date and that gives you one last
chance to reschedule your upgrade if you
still don't respond within one week
after that final notification so that's
one week before your original upgrade
date you will be upgraded on the dates
that we originally sent to you now the
next stage is the review and update
material stage and we've listed the
specific tasks that you should do for
this stage document your current
customizations prepare or update your
test plans validate against third-party
products and review the upgrade
materials for the first one documenting
your current list of customizations well
that might entail updating your list
with changes you've made in release 11
or it might be creating the list for the
first time now for each item you'll want
to specify the user interface where the
change was made and you might even take
screenshots so that you can compare
pages and sections after the upgrade
so I provided a tickler to remind you of
the areas that you or others might have
customized by security settings we mean
changes your si might have made
or your IT security manager with
customizing roles to help you with
tracking security changes we have a
couple of resources so the security
console that was introduced in release
10 lets you compare roles to see what's
different between them and there's also
a role and user audit report and then we
provided a template that you can
download for my Oracle support which
helps you capture the exact information
you need to record and here's that link
the second task is to prepare or update
your test plans and that's for both a
non transactional as well as a
transactional plan so for the non
transactional test plan you want to
include the navigation to each user
interface that your users typically use
you want to make sure everything renders
as expected you want to perform a few
typical queries and be sure to test it
on all the clients used whether it's the
simplified UI or sales mobile etc now
the test plan should include running all
your reports and be sure to include
executing any non transactional web
services for your transactional test
plan that one should include generating
accounts contacts opportunities for
tests in short anything that your sales
users normally do and that means
following the task flows of your
different end users whether they be
sales reps sales managers or another
role be sure to include running any web
services that your company uses to
generate transactions as well as running
all critical ongoing file based data
import activities that you've set up and
for test three if you're using
third-party products from Oracle
marketplace or elsewhere make sure that
you include those in your test plans so
verify that the product has been
validated against release 12 scheduled
tests
with contacts at that company and factor
in time to fix any issues and tasks for
is to review upgrade materials now I've
already talked about this in detail but
here again are the three primary landing
pages to access information now in the
context of the project plan and remember
that the what's new guide as well as
videos are your primary resources for
release 12 since they illustrate the new
features and explain how to enable them
continuing with tasks for reviewing the
upgrade material as you review all the
new features we suggest that you
organize them into three categories and
I've touched on these in earlier in this
presentation so the first is changes to
features that you are using today those
visible right away to your users the
second is areas that may require some
adjustments as a result of the release
twelve changes and then those features
that you want to analyze for later
rollout after your upgrade is up and
running so for that first category of
changes to current features we use and
this is just an example
yours will likely be different but my
list might include these new features
which I want to communicate to the
appropriate salespeople at my company so
I want to tell sales reps and channel
managers for example about the new
enterprise mobile applications so that
they can install it and start seeing its
benefits or I want to warn sales reps
that they will no longer see values in
the PII fields or they'll have a new
option from the show drop-down list on
their opportunity detail page so that
they can see what territories are
assigned to an opportunity along with
The Associated territory team members
and then perhaps I want to communicate
to sales admins that there's a new tool
for drag-and-drop customizing of pages
for the new enterprise mobile and then
they can also manually assign a sales
reps territory to an opportunity line
when the territory is an assign
that lets sales reps forecast an
opportunity immediately while the
territory setup is being reviewed and
updated the second category is areas
that may require some adjustment as a
result of the release 12 changes one is
that you'll need to manually click a
button to run the script to update your
metadata
although most customizations made in
application composer are automatically
updated to the enhanced behavior in
release 12 there are a few exceptions so
you'll need to run this script to do
that it's super easy just follow the
instructions in the what's new guide and
then if your business requires use of
the personally identifiable information
data then your IT security manager will
need to allow those fields to be visible
by certain roles and then for group 3
the list of features that you want to
roll out after the upgrade is complete
and stable I would further categorize
these into ones that are easy to
implement versus those that might take
planning and discussion for example I
might add the additional name field to
the account layout since that would
allow sales teams to enter alternate
names for an account and then I might
make some test templates available or
maybe add analytics sub tabs or add the
ability to create call reports for more
areas in the product or add mass update
options for leads and opportunities to
the simplified pages these are all
features that I read about and watch
videos about but I might plan for even
later rollout features such as the use
of auxilary classifications to segment
customers for automated territory
assignment or set up additional
analytics pages with reports that my end
users would benefit from or create
global or role based layouts for sales
campaigns which might require some input
from my sales team and I've already
mentioned the two specific
steps that everyone needs to perform as
pre upgrade steps but now you can see
them in the context of the project plan
in the timeframe that we recommend the
first has to do with sandboxes you need
to publish any sandboxes containing
customizations that you want to preserve
during the upgrade and delete all other
sandboxes including those that are in
progress
so in that case either track the
customizations you're working on
somewhere outside of sales cloud or
finish testing them in time to determine
if they should be published or not and
the second task is to preserve
customized reports so any reports that
you've changed will get overwritten
unless you save them to specific folders
now by safe folder I'm talking about the
custom folder under shared folders if
you want the report to be available to
others or to my folders if you're not
sharing the report changes to reports
and other folders may be overwritten
during the upgrade as an optional step
if you want to save your customized
reports locally and then upload them
after the upgrade follow the
instructions in this document on my
Oracle support so during the next stage
Oracle upgrades your non production
environment and for most of you this is
your test or stage environment this
might take one or two days
although the upgrade duration does vary
with each release so now let's talk
about validating the upgrade starting
with the first task perform any post
upgrade test specific to release 12
which we talked about earlier so as you
perform that step on your non production
environment be sure to track how long it
takes because you'll need to repeat this
on your production environment after
you've done that work you'll want to run
your test plans so give test users
access to the upgraded non production
environment and then execute both your
non transactional and transactional test
plans and record the results you want to
evaluate the results of course of your
test plan and if it and if issues arise
work with Oracle support to resolve them
so one very important comment there's
only a small window of time between the
upgrade of your non production
environment and the upgrade of your
production environment so get ready to
validate the non production environment
immediately after you receive notice
that the upgrade has been completed it's
very important to tell us about any
issues as early as possible so we can
address them now as far as time is
concerned we really recommend that you
start testing within that first hour but
be sure to notify us within 48 hours of
the upgrade about any issues so
proactively engage with us as we work to
validate and correct any issues so if
you do run into issues log in SR right
away and that's log it in the normal way
there aren't any special tags to select
but you do want to indicate that it's an
upgrade issue and tell us what
environment the issue is on mark the
severity appropriately and then you'll
want to tell us the flow that produce it
issue and how it worked before versus
after the upgrade and you might want to
reiterate when the upgrade is going to
be done on the production environment so
that support is alerted to the timeframe
and you know that it's very difficult to
postpone a scheduled upgrade unless we
have at least a full week before the
upgrade and that's why it's so important
to start validating your upgrade right
away and notify as immediately of any
issues for test 3 and you want to
publicize the new release to your user
community so you want to specify the
date that you'll be deploying the new
release and let them know about all
those features that will impact them
immediately and that are relevant to
your company next Oracle upgrades your
production environment so the last stage
is deploying the release so you'll
receive notification that we've
completed the upgrade of your production
environment and then you'll need to do
these last three tasks listed here task
1 is repeat your post upgrade tasks on
your production environment task 2 is
quickly validate your
production environment so use your
non-transactional test plan to do a
quick check in your production
environment and again notify as
immediately if there are any problems
and test three is to make the
environment available to your users so
if you disabled the link during the
upgrade you'll need to enable it again
okay that's it your organization is now
in release twelve just to summarize the
keys to success become the expert on
release twelve because understanding
enhancement saves time you won't be
logging them as bugs you want to
communicate changes to your end users
because setting expectations for your
users minimizes surprises and possible
frustrations and follow the recommended
project plan shown in this presentation
