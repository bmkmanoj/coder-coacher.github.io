but not with me so you can share an
invitation if you want to you join us
tomorrow at the JCP party at the
infusion lounge it's at 63 be there to
about nine so you don't want to miss it
and got a few beer yeah we've got a few
beers over here where Martine is if
you'd like to help yourself and if you
are JCP members we have badge ribbons up
here as well that you can come and
collect if you get spec lead member EG
member and ec member if you haven't
picked that up yet anything else so wait
till Bruno comes up here well I was in
wait till you came up are you want stay
down there oh okay well they can't hear
you oh your course ok ok ok so I let me
test this here hello oh that works ok my
title is not showing oh there we go 101
ways to improve java wide developer
participation matters or introduce
yourself because i actually have your
ways starting off so we've got three of
us here as speakers do you know my name
is yourself so I'm Berta Sosa i'm one of
the founders of so Java that's the
Brazilian Java is a society and we are
part of the JCP for a long time but we
recently have joined that the JCP is
active committee and I'm the
representative of so Java sided ACP
hello I'm Martin Vivek I represent the
London java community for this talk and
we're trying to help kick-start some
global programs to get developers
involved in java standards and java
itself
Heather van kuren I work in the JCP
program office so we thought we'd just
start this off real quickly with
actually 101 ways and then we'll open it
up for some broader discussion so we'll
just kind of quickly run through these
ways and i will post them on the JCP
blog and yes our plan is that we have
101 ways here and we're going to
describe each one in very little detail
anything about 10 minutes and for each
of each one so it's about no tell them
in a choice for 101 ways right I did
three minutes per so you want superstar
out with ways we broke it up three
sections ways to participate in your
Java user group and Bruno's game oh so
that's how it started with me okay so
there's some user group guys here right
where do you group of guys so John is
here well so there are other so you got
some user group of guys and no Martin is
here so job is your groups I always like
to say the job is your groups are the
real Java coming right that's where you
come to meet other developers you come
to meet our other other Java people so I
really think it should get together and
find your job as a group cesar's user
group in your area John here leads the
java.net job is the group's community
where he yes so so he where you can find
a list of you know almost 500 user
groups or all over the words so I'm sure
there is one that you can that you can
identify with and if there's not you can
always create your own user group right
and there's a lot of little ways that
you can help you know just by showing up
in the meetings just by participating
you make your user group stronger so for
example when me and Martin we come to
the JCP meetings we're not ourselves
right we are representing everyone that
comes to our meetings everyone that
comes to our discussions everyone to
participate so but the simple fact that
you participate in the user group you
already making your user groups stronger
you're making your community stronger
you're helping us out and actually
coming and fighting with the big guys
for for the things that you think are
important right but also user groups
have a lot of little needs that's that
can be that you can help out Rivera
very little effort so for example if you
tweet your meeting or information about
your user group if you know if you share
to facebook if you do a like on a user
group page it just helps more people
children shapiro air there's a user
group in your area and the more people
that we were joining in and participate
and that's that's helps everyone right
but also you can you know you can give a
talk I use a group or you can find
someone you if you don't want to want to
give a talk but maybe you know someone
from your company that's that it's a
good speaker or you know someone that
you know or you have a contact with
someone you can huge javaone you've got
a good contact with a speaker you could
introduce the speaker or dispersants you
use a group to bring them there and help
you you know help teach more people
about that important technology or
something like this you know if you're
if you're working on a company even a
small or large company you can help out
by sponsoring the user group and when
you talk about supposed to be easy to
get a lot of people say oh yeah but I
know you don't have a lot of money but
you know you sponsor a few beers and
that's already sponsorship right you pay
for yeah exactly nothing so responsible
you have some beers here that's already
good right user groups we got you know
you buy ten pizzas for a meeting and you
already feed everyone that comes from
the meeting and that's already
sponsorship right so there's a lot of
little ways their company can do and
that that actually brings some good
things for your company because you know
the name is going to be so for example
on it I have a job easy to t-shirt here
and there's lots of companies in the
back right and this t-shirt is from a
few years ago and you know your
company's to shows up everywhere there
we go right so you know for sometimes
for a little lira for little money you
can you can you can help a lot other
things here you're organized activities
of you know join the mailing list right
who thought you could improve job by
John amalias yes it's true you know
you're joining mainly as you make your
group is stronger you can answer things
from time to time you start you get
involved and that helps us all of us to
do more things right you know answer
questions oh one thing it's nice to do
you know you don't have a lot of time
and I'll oh I know everyone is
you know it doesn't have time for
anything in those days but sometimes you
can volunteer for one activity right one
small thing that you can do and you and
you know we hope you have a couple of
hours a day a couple for one week
there's going to be an event that you
want to participate and and you know you
said okay so I said instead of you pay
your way into an events maybe one just
want to go there and volunteer to help
and that frees up the time of some other
people that are doing other things
should actually do more right so we know
if you can approach it to one activity
in your user group that's already a
great thing to do you know come early to
an events and help carry the piano right
a lot of us you know a lot of events
that we do we did they're completely
free so developers don't pay anything is
sponsored up the only paying for the
pizza everything else is a guy like John
or marching or band or someone so many
other user group leaders there you know
give it all right so all kinds of
musically there's everywhere and you
know if you come up you know come
earlier and you help packing things you
help with the tables in the right place
you know you you help those those things
then it makes life for all of us a lot
easier and makes more enjoyable so help
out a little bit no tiny little things
makes a big difference what else you
know yeah okay so one interesting thing
is a lot of people say you know we lot
of people come to us and say I don't
know what you need right well we at
least in so job we have every Monday
right at nine o'clock and nights we have
organization meeting over skype right we
learned that if you just come to the
meeting in here what's going on you're
going to find things that you want that
you want to help us so just participate
on the mailing list of the organization
of the user group or just coming to the
organizational meetings you're not going
to learn anything that's not going to be
any technical discussion we are
discussing how to organize the user
group but you're going to learn things
that way that you can help out you know
write a blog take a picture oh come on
can I help improve job I take a picture
yes you know you come here I'm here
giving a talk Marty's here giving a talk
if you
here take a picture of this talk and you
publish this picture then you know the
easy group gets stronger it gets more
attention and then we can come back to
the JCP and say hey we are strong guys
you know we need to to change things
right so even the small things matter a
lot another interesting thing you travel
here to java one right you either either
for another city or or you're out of job
you know out of your job today but you
come here some of us travel from far
away from different countries I bet not
every single colleague from you your
company we're able to do the same right
I bats not everyone from you use a group
or it was a little saber to be here with
you so when you get back do what do a
session about the best thing is Sarge
other one right present why you saw
presenter the topic that you heard right
it's spread this this idea to others i
think that's that's an easy thing to do
there helps what else other things is
maybe maybe should be teaching people
about java all right so that's a good
way to help how many times good okay
alright so you know hi my name is ok so
you know another way to help by
improving java and the more the more
developers that we have they are
proficient with java technology of the
better right in our levels so you know
presented a tutorial a lot of people
tell me oh but i know i don't know
enough how can i give a talk how can i
give a tutorial and the truth is think
about it if you spend a week right you
know nothing about a technology you
spend a week learning is technology on
and off and everything by the end of the
week you're able to run a simple
application you are able to know you
know you know what the documentation is
you know how to write a HelloWorld and
act on that particular technology if you
can do a talk about this about this one
week of work you're already helping a
lot of people that don't have a week to
learn that stuff right and you know you
make this in one hour talk and you're
helping a lot of people that can't know
that can
that's the amount of time right so you
know you're always able to give a talk
so I think you should do doing more you
know you can come and give talking
things that you heard here any already
jumping to the next step come on get
back there's a couple things I want to
say come that one all right there's a
cool things here I mentioned a few
project green foot Alice and blue jay
there's a great education project right
you can teach kids how to programming
job of those you can teach people
University how's your programming job of
those so learn how learn how they work
you know your job developers those those
tools are very simple for you learn how
they how they work get to a teacher you
know the school teacher or university
professor and teach them how they can
use that those tools to teach kids the
university students how to develop a
Java better it's a it's a it's a very
it's very easy for you and it's probably
not very easy for the teachers right
what else you know write blogs learn a
new Java API and present your coworkers
right it's probably getting prove the
way your company war it's also right and
and also improve job developer / overall
what else ok and then help out nor open
source project I know there's a lot of
very big open source projects that are
like the main java project in jdk
glassfish and other things like that but
there's a lot of other open source
projects out there on job one of the
most important things for Java is the
huge equities that we have it's not only
a small sets of technology which is a
huge ecosystem of open source projects
that does everything so just choose
something you like and come help out
right a documentation improve the
improve the project a little bit right a
bug report participate on the project a
little bit and then you improve the Java
ecosystem and the more open source
project there's more interesting things
that you can take a look at and
standardizing and bring back to the Java
platform so the more Java code is out
there the better and you can participate
in each one of these ok thanks that's it
thank you
the alcohol plus the list Tuesday right
yes okay let's say that's a tough act to
follow I don't have a cape I have a beer
because I'm from London so another
Londoner it clearly so yeah who here has
used some sort of java standard API
maybe the servlet specification or maybe
jax-rs or actually hit here's a good one
jsf who here has had to code jsf keep
your hand up if you liked it well one of
the back there's always one all right so
one of the things that we are sorry
Chyna miss you there one of the things
we found in London when we sit around a
pub and is always cold and dark and
rainy and miserable and makes us all
very cynical and sad is that we get
together and we complain about api's and
java and we sit there and we say the WTF
phrase and more of us get together and
more of us write a tech blogs and tell
people like the Simon Oracle folks that
they've just gone and gotten everything
completely wrong and then I for a couple
of years we were told well instead of
complaining why don't you actually help
us make it better so we decided okay
we'll give us a go and one of the things
that standards and Java and Java the
language itself is always really missed
is the day-to-day input of day-to-day
Java developers because at the end of
the day you guys and you and you ladies
are the end users of all these
specifications that come out you're the
end users of jobs the language you're
the end users of je Jeremy etc so we
started a program called a doctor Jessa
which is adopting Java specifications
and this is not to adopt them after
they've been done and dusted right this
is to adopt them as they are forming so
to give the sort of feedback and the
sort of test testing feedback and
implementation feedback which will
actually make these standards relevant
to you it's actually kind of a selfish
thing to do
right but by this little bit of feedback
that you can give early and by also
helping even build some of these
specifications you're impacting up to 9
10 million other developers out there
and goodness knows how many users right
so it's kind of your little chance to
make a big big difference in the world
and it might seem silly but I quite
happily say this at kind of some social
gatherings I go to so when people ask me
what does it you do oh you're you're a
computer geek and I say actually know
what I do is I impact the lives of
millions and millions of people and its
really kind of important so some of the
things we've been doing has you've lots
of Jess our program there so you can
pick off at your URL and we do all sorts
of things we help people who are trying
to run these specifications we try and
take away some of the low-hanging fruit
away from them right we want people like
Brian Gertz you saw at the keynote the
other day working on lambdas and to make
those really really good we don't want
to moderating the mailing list right and
this is the sort of thing you can help
out with clearly your developers most of
you here and you want to code you want
to hack that's what we will get together
java user groups especially so we do
things like get together right test
cases for specifications right this
cases for java itself which was really
fun by the way that's kind of difficult
we even helped actually write some of
the implementations so we got James go
over there who's been helping write the
implementation for j sr 3 10 which is
the new date and time api was coming
into java row right and jim himself
would admit you know a few months ago
that he's not any sort of world expert
in date and time and he's alert as he's
he's gone along and he is you know a
perfect example of a job of a user group
member who's absolutely impacting an API
that all of us here we'll be using and
if you in a year's time fantastic whole
bunch of stuff you can do as Bruno
mentioned before you can evangelize away
as simple tweet a simple like on a
Facebook or all useful stuff yep conduce
on the very top one is actually the one
that we found to be the most important
in London by giving a simple five-minute
talk
a group of a hundred people can actually
make a huge huge difference for a
specification because out of that 100
people five people will come up to us
afterwards and ask questions you take
those five people in you organize a
two-hour workshop to hack on some code
everybody talks about it cuz hacking on
code with your friends is fun it's
certainly better than converting javed
or XML and XML back java again because
that's freaking boring i can tell you
did that for three years paid well but
terrible and that in turn goes out
globally and you get groups in brazil
doing it groups and latvia doing it
groups in the USA during it okay and all
the sudden you've got a large group of
people helping the specification nice
nearly no more evil jsf hopefully oh I
got got booze there from John he loves
SF there's four just for you if you are
one of these curiously strange people if
you're on the buff downstairs before if
you love lesson or legal language then
it was actually a great great need to
turn some of the licensing and legal
areas of Java standardization and java
ee standardization into english that
developers can understand or other
languages that developers can understand
so Bruno for example is running a
Portuguese mailing list for all the
Brazilian developers about these sorts
of aspects all right so that's that's a
really important communication aspect
bit under the next one we also talked
about adopting openjdk itself so how
many people here know what openjdk is so
about half the room okay suppose you who
don't know openjdk is the reference
implementation for java the language and
platform itself okay and what what could
be cooler than actually working on the
land within the platform that we use
day-to-day right so help actually
literally help java itself by working on
the java code base most people think oh
I need a PhD in computer science to work
on the openjdk I do not have a PhD in
computer science and I tell you what my
colleagues at work for me and my company
will probably try and drag me away if I
ever try and write any code yet I still
contribute with small things like
javac warning fixes javadoc fixes right
turning an old piece of code that hasn't
been had generics applied to it these
are all very simple things that you can
do with in Java itself to make it you
know more performance safer to use and
again it's low-hanging fruit that you're
taking away from people who want you
want to be concentrating on more
difficult areas like the hot spot like
the new lambdas features etc as a whole
bunch of stuff you can do you can see
the list up there one of the interesting
things we're trying to explore is we
understand that not everybody can enjoin
a Java user group so we're really hoping
that people will hold brown bag sessions
at lunch times in their corporations at
the office grab two of your work
colleagues and actually look at the java
source code itself it's actually quite
simple to read start working on some
patch and some women back to Java and of
course be selfish put it on your CV and
that way if you are converting XML to
Java and Java backed XML again you can
leave that crappy job and you can
actually go sign up and work for Oracle
because they're hiring right now for
example or you can go work for an
organization who actually cares about
deep tech and get excited again and last
few things a whole bunch of stuff you
can do again actually testing the
OpenJDK early as a vital importance to
everyone right every tiny bug fix every
tiny bug that you report every time you
run across a method that you didn't
quite understand we felt wasn't nice to
use if you report that back now they'll
get resolved and again you've impacted
the lives of millions of developers and
last but not least because I come from
London we drink way too much beer always
make it fun always hold a party were you
doing
thanks Martine so good I've got another
one yeah all right so move on now two
ways to participate in the JCP program
the last thirty three ways who knows
what the JCP is most people in the room
that's good that's a good start so start
out with the participation just visiting
the website following us on Twitter
Facebook our blog our blog is where
we'll post this list you can also
register for the JCP site has anyone
registered for JC peanut org race yeah
few of you so you can go there and
register one of the things you can do
when you register is create a watch list
so you can follow the jsr as they are
interested in since we move in then to
one of the first ways you can
participate in influence the JCP is by
reviewing and commenting on the jsr s
that are in progress so you can create a
watch list there the jrs they are
interested in and every time you log
into JC out or you'll see the jrs that
you're interested in and there you can
download the latest draft and provide
feedback to the spec leads also if
you're more interested in taking the
next step to get involved JCP 2.8 j srs
which are some of the newer jrs as well
as some of the in-progress jsr that have
updated themselves to JCP 2.8 which is
the latest version of the JCP requires
transparency in how spike lee's run
their expert groups so we're looking for
people who are willing to help us
monitor what those spec leads are doing
check out their mailing lists check out
their projects on java net or github or
wherever they're hosting themselves they
have links on their jsr detail page
which is where you find the information
about each jsr on JCP org you'll find
links there to their projects so take a
look at the projects they are interested
in see how they're doing there are they
making their work transparent is it easy
to download the drafts is it working are
there broken links you can let the spec
Lee know as well as the PMO you can
reach the PMO at pmo at g
see org let us know if those links are
broken and we can follow up with the
spec lead to make sure those are fixed
if you're looking at taking it any
further you can join the projects on
java.net so create a login on Java net
and join the projects of the jsr s they
are interested in if they're hosting
themselves there you can also become a
JCB member so once you've registered for
JCP dog you can become a member members
can serve on expert groups so you can
nominate yourself to serve on an expert
group of a JSR once it's been submitted
and approved by the executive committee
you can nominate yourself and the spec
lead will approve your nomination or not
if they don't approve your nomination if
at JCP 2.8 spec needs to supply reason
why they wouldn't approve your
nomination you can serve on an expert
group it is a bigger time commitment so
I've kind of listed here you know more
progressive time commitments that's
heavy duty time commitment to serve on
an expert group but most of the jrs now
you can follow and see most everything
that's going on in their projects that
they host on java.net did you want to
say something in which 10 so we've got
what is it you're going to talk about
this one hey
microphone here we go okay so another
way to contribute is the short simple
concise and I can't Ibaka sscc II org
write it it helps you write good bug
reports oh yeah yeah exactly so
providing good concise to short code
examples as to what exactly is going on
is incredibly helpful to spec leads like
this look people down here so there you
go there's a shout out to that
organization okay that's great we yeah
we still have some beers over there who
are interested I don't have a hat or a
cape but Harold here has some giveaways
you have some role JCP things if people
want to walk around a little bit I do
have a few more ways but I definitely
want to leave time for questions from
okay what else all right submit Oh serve
on expert group yes you can also submit
bug reports good shout out for how to do
that now submit a JSR proposal and
become a spec lead very big commitment
there but that's possibility for any JCP
member you can submit jsr for approval
by the executive committee and even if
you're not expecting you can attend a
spec Lee calls that the program office
manages we put those on and record them
if you're interested in finding out more
about what it's like to be a spec lead
we host them on topics of interest to
the community so you can either suggest
the topic to the PMO PMO at JCP org or
attend one of those we also post those
recordings on our multimedia page of JCP
org when I post this list i'll put a URL
for we're fine this okay now we're
moving on from spec leads so you can
join you can become an expert you can
become a spec lead you could also serve
and then executive committee if you're
really interested in looking at
influencing the way the organization is
governed we actually raised up revised
the JCB program through the jsr process
and the executive committee serves the
role of the expert group in that case we
have annual elections right
now we have our nomination period open
so there are two open seats for the
executive committee any JCP member can
nominate themselves to be in the
election this year it's happening in
October and the seats will become
effective in november this year it's a
one-year term and everyone will be
running again in 2013 for an executive
committee seat since we are merging the
executive committee to executive
committee's into one effective November
2012 so have one executive committee and
you can also follow the executive
committee project on Java net I'll also
include a URL for that when I post this
list but executive committee has a
project on java.net they also have a
project they're called JCP next and you
can follow the progress there jay speed
our next has had a series of three jrs
mia jsr 348 which was JCP 2.8 finalized
now effective the latest version we had
jsr 355 which is the jsr to merge the 2
e season 21 and right now just approved
by the ec recently is jsr 358 which is
the third jsr and that will take a look
at some of the more complex issues
around revising the agreement to join
the JCP which is called the JSP a you
can also suggest agenda items for the ec
every year now with JCP 2.8 there are
open executive committee meetings which
are open to the java community not just
to members but anyone in the java
community can join these teleconferences
we hold them two times a year so you can
suggest agenda items for those we're
always looking for items that you're
interested in hearing about we're also
open to participating in your local Java
user group or meet up if you'd like to
hear from the JCP or want help in
getting spec leads to participate we can
assist you with that um this can also
attend things at javaone this last slide
has some things that are going on here
job one this week we had a ec meeting
yesterday
we also have annual awards is our 10th
annual JCP Awards so those nominations
are open to the public we've got our
nominations posted for this year now
next year get your nominations ready and
submit those we'll announce the winners
tomorrow night at the annual JCP party
find out who won the 10th annual awards
will have that at the infusion lounge
and those are the invitations that Bruno
passed out we actually have a few more
invitations but if you if you didn't get
an invitation here and you want one you
can find it at JCP org click on javaone
events and you can find their all the
details of the party it's tomorrow night
and fusion lounge at six thirty and we
have our last buff also tomorrow which
is meet the candidates for this year's
elections so come and ask your favorite
questions of the executive committee
what they're planning on doing if they
re-elected or elected this year and we
also encourage you to do just what Bruno
suggested blog about your experiences
what you think about what's happening in
JCP write articles on j srs or events
you've attended take pictures and that
concludes that's the last way 101
exactly well it's I think there's a
little bit more because i sent you mourn
you put all i know i consolidated them
because they had to fit with the title
okay so i'm a JCP we follow those we
have more than 100 ways of you helping
out with java and one of them is coming
to the party tomorrow if anyone didn't
get the invitation i have some extra
invitations here right but you know as
as i said you can only see online really
questions yeah we have 15 minutes left
so we wanted to leave time for questions
want to run through our ways but get
questions or feedback so why are you
guys thinking about your question
there's one other way they can help out
with if improving Java is writing your
job story but trying to collect stories
about your story of Java not only the
official story but why job was important
for you so I'll pass around some some
notes here where you can you can write
the story right so that's I'll pass this
okay let's and why you think about you
questions just do this on here yes
specimen please okay that's a very good
question so certainly so the JCP and
demo project management office for the
JCP oracle and the java user groups and
other vendors as well they're all
working together on on these adoption
programs to try and get developers again
mainly to get involved in java standards
we head up off a user group off on it
yesterday we'll have another one
tomorrow as well I believe and I think
we're going to try and do things like
webinars through Pele's calm to try and
you know get access try and get the
material out to more people get
workshops get practical material out to
people through through those kind of
e-learning platforms so I think there's
going to be a focus for Nick for next
year definitely and I wanted to say to
that next year for the annual awards we
are going to be introducing a new
category which will be for adopt a JSR
so have a new category for the
participants of adopted jsr cool is
there any participant of the objects are
here yeah there's a few cool thank you
guys for coming I think there's a
session right after this correct yep
what where's that same room you can go
out and rescan yourself and come back in
to learn more about your experience with
jsr 310 and adopt a GSR any other
comments questions suggestions say one
thing in it it's cari o pretties might
it it is probably the first time in my
15 years involved with Java
that you have had access and the buzz
you to actually influence java and the
entire ecosystem itself so please please
please do not waste this opportunity
okay if there's only one thing you do
when you leave this room and as to tell
your friends about what's been going on
here and to tell them that the standards
body is listening and they're actively
inviting participation as is Oracle and
the other large vendors please please do
that it really is a fantastic
opportunity you don't get us in the.net
platform you don't get us another
language communities so let's use it
thank you one thing I also wanted to
mention again is Java user groups if
your Java user group hasn't joined the
JCP yet java user groups can join the
JCP as an organization and will waive
the fee so and i want to remind you
again we have badge ribbons so if your
user groups a member you can pick up JCP
member bad driven yeah one of the things
that we have to understand is that job
is technology that where we can
participate all right there's a lot of
technologies out there that you're just
a user you know you just develop on top
of it you just and job is it is actually
technology we can participate as Martin
said from the whole thing right you can
you can participate from the inception
of office standard all the way to to the
creation of the final products and and
and there's a lot of space for
innovation around the Java ecosystem so
I think I think we are not what a
wonderful acquisition wonderful position
and the fact that we are here java
wonhui i think we all understand this
and what we are trying to show you here
is that when we talk about participation
it's not really you know get a
commitment eight hours a day for a month
that you can make a difference you can
actually make a difference before launch
for a lot less with smaller steps so
just take a look at some of the ideas
and implement some of them in your inner
in your time and you're going to see how
how much of a difference you can make
anybody else no problem all right so
everyone else if you're not a member
user group search for one if there's not
an easy group around your area you know
join two three people and and create a
user group right there's no there's a
lot of ways that we can help you know
contact me contact John we can help out
so in creation of user groups but there
there are a lot of user groups around
the word so search for one year areas
support
yeah I started starting to start a jerk
you know don't we have in some pollo we
have five job easy groups right in the
same city so yeah you can you know you
can start user group you know it's you
and a couple friends you can start user
group just just you don't you don't need
to to to wait for someone else to decide
to talk about interesting things or if
you want to do is something lighter is
just you know go to the local user group
even if you if they don't talk about the
interesting to you want to talk about go
there any proposed a different talks so
so the student direction the discussion
to your place where you like to be that
should be right but their resources on
the Java user group has a dominant net
project too right yeah if you go with
your job done that's there's a tab job
user groups and over there there's some
resources of how to create a user group
there's John Cena's they are my email
there every job you user groups of two
people all right 5000 we started with
three people about Torah half three
years ago right starts with two people
that's it yeah yeah so job is over
40,000 members today but so and we start
we started just so good for lunch yeah
directly
you're actually getting together and
sharing that technology and sharing a
microphone I love you bad is being
recorded ought to be imported is okay
wow that's gonna be an epic fail anyway
so if you want to participate it's all
about you learning and you know you're
learning and you taking responsibility
you know for where you want to go in
Java and if other folks come along you
know they can enjoy the ride as well or
they can actually take an active role
it's not necessarily all about getting
speakers I mean some of the things that
we were talking about earlier today was
how to make it easier for user groups
around the world to actually share
speakers or share talks and for example
where I'm located i'm in Greenville
South Carolina I've got Atlanta on one
side and I've got Charlotte on the other
folks will go to those areas you know
there are folks that are going to travel
to those areas they're not necessarily
going to come to greenville so one of
the things we were talking about is how
how do we get folks to either come to
where I'm at or how do we get the folks
that are at another user group how do we
tap into their resources so if
somebody's you know presenting in London
is it a convenient time that we can
actually say okay we're going to set up
our user group meeting at the same time
and share that speaker so it's open okay
excellent questions no questions okay
question here
that's a very good point my thesis yeah
the job the Java she grew up in Brazil
started with some guys that were decor
by using as many years ago I didn't
think about okay what else how much
thought pattern is to have oh yeah we're
about two more minutes so mom made us
one more efficient one last question no
questions ok guys so alright thanks for
having look like everyone thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
