something else that can possibly replace
signal is it impossible and other part
of that is is no single really here to
stay is there something we should we be
using it shouldn't be changing local
Artemis where do we stand with no sequel
so look and this is mainly target we
want to talk any two dresses first and
then if anybody has input input ok so
the first thing to understand is sequel
does not go back to the beginning of
time there were before the sequel
databases came out in the 80s there are
no sequel databases okay so people free
think no sequel something new no single
is actually prehistoric right it goes
back to the beginning of time of
information management when the first
computer was written somebody came up
with this idea let's have an index of a
tree basically and let's have an API too
and that's that would those were the
original key value stores there were
things like on the mainframe there's ice
AMV Sam informix eventually have this
product called see I am Burghley BB came
out so that these the idea of a key
value store is ancient and relational
databases were basically created in the
80s because developers want to write
reports and get information out of dirt
their databases and key value stores and
other related and fruit non no sequel
databases or incredibly unproductive in
writing reports they're there you take
weeks to write you know a report to get
a simple you know sorted list of
information out of you know sequel
database and that's where sequel
pain-free see quotas is a huge leap
forward in programmer productivity
couple lines of sequel was equal one in
no 10 pages of writing code against a no
sequel style API key value store style
API so no sequel has been around before
sequel and it will be round and sequin
and no single systems have coexisted for
30 years now and so this whole question
is sort of only relevant for people who
don't know their history which is all
the young developers out there of course
know nothing about what happened more
than 10 years ago right so of course
those single systems have a worlder
they're very good at what they do very
simple you know applications that don't
require you know the equivalent of
ratings reports and joins and order buys
and all the kinds of stuff you do
tripoli in sequel no signal is great at
that and always they're always there is
a use case for it and there were always
will be one the more modern no sequel
systems like you know the the MongoDB
xand cassandra is all those guys it
actually happens on DynamoDB is probably
look at the right one to actually look
at all amazon did is they were using
berkeley DB in their ecommerce system
and they they said you know wouldn't it
be great if we had any
p trees not just one and let's add a
hash distribution layer in front of
Berkeley to be and that's where dynamodb
came from and that's the direct ancestor
of all the more recent no sequel systems
so it's basically just a hashing layer
on top of me tree you know this is
trivial technology and that's why
there's about 40 or 50 companies that
have no sequel databases including
Oracle and again there's a great use
case for these kind of products they do
really simple applications really well
they scale nicely and if you have an
application that fits that that mold and
that's all you need it's great sequel
systems obviously are much more flexible
they do everything no sequel systems to
plus they make developers really
productive doing really doing compass
app publications that require you know
if you look at you know our fusion
applications or as AP applications real
commercial business applications you
know if you want to write those in a no
sequel product you need thousands of
diff developers you know sometime you
know thousand times the number of
developers to write the same code as you
would with sequel so you know and then
the size of the market really shows you
the difference between the use cases of
the two products in a relational
databases are over a 30 billion dollar
market no sequel databases are one of
these classical 0 billion dollar markets
you know maybe there's a few hundred
million there but basically they're free
products there's not a lot of value
there no mongodb huge lots of cute
downloads everybody playing with it but
almost nobody pays for it right and so
you know there's
a good business model but the business
model is actually another interesting
aspect of the gnosis of modern no sequel
databases you know they have the
freemium model where you download it for
free you play with it and then if you
want support which a few people will pay
for support you pay by subscription
model traditionally relational databases
on Prem have the licensing model where
you pay upfront and then you pay for
support and it's now that everybody's
moving to cloud that that model is now
becoming available for all the
relational databases as well so the
business model is also something that i
think it was interesting around no
sequel databases and is now becoming
pretty prevalent as everybody makes
their software available on clouds using
the same kind of subscription model
Hadoop is a whole different beast I
don't know if I really maybe just leave
that for another questioner but as far
as I'm concerned that dupe is just
becoming a relational database you know
the whole idea that MapReduce was
interesting was it was exciting a few
years ago and everybody is pretty much
society and you know MapReduce is not
interesting we're all going to offer
sequel on top of HDFS and there's 20
different sequel system so there what's
really have any other Duke is becoming a
data warehouse relational database and
you know I you know beyond that it's not
clear that there's much much other use
of the dude but a dip is here to stay
hdfs is a is a nice distributed file
system it's
vetted and all the offerings from all
the vendors including Oracle we have it
on our big date appliance we have it up
on our cloud now it's a nice technology
file systems again they go back 40 years
I Duke is just the latest generation
cool file system technology that
certainly will survive and everybody is
embracing Hadoop and you know MapReduce
you know that might survive but it's
certainly not not very popular and again
at the end of that you can always
measure success by you know revenue and
market share and all that and Hadoop you
can measure the fat of Hadoop declining
by looking at yogurt work stock parts
right you know a year ago they are one
half billion dollar company market cap
now they're 500 million right you know
so it's you know that's that pretty much
reflects a hype cycle what's going on
with a Ducas it's very popular but you
know it's not as it's not it's going to
be a successful people bought a couple
years ago I'll let you go on to the next
next questions
I guess I throw a quick one in oh no
sequel databases and I I think infamous
it's when you're dealing with data that
has a single use right so the big
benefit of relational is that you can
easily write reports on it you can do
other things with data no sequel
databases you could put it in one way
you can point out one way and that's it
it's very limited use data which is what
we had before relational matrix you lose
that flexibility and is this the
question does this question also include
will sleep will be sticking around where
we find something better than seek or is
that another question okay it's all
types of a little bit so I think one of
the things I find interesting about
sequel is that it is going so strong
after 35 years Andy has pointed out
previously that not only a sequel still
around but it's so innovative in
dramatic ways and it's keeping pace with
changes massive changes in the way that
data is being manipulated the way needs
to be delivered any hunters and all that
and I think really a part of sequels
lasting valued why I don't see anything
coming along to replace at any time soon
is that I get that sequel and set
operations and declarative ways of
thinking actually mirror the way our
brains work in the world so if you look
around the world if you're going
outdoors looking at things in the world
you think natural in terms of sets
cabinets and I can because of that the
relational model pretty much grew out of
it Nate brain processing and it actually
sinks up pretty well with the way to
look at the world and what's interesting
there then is that at the same
that I really believe that's true and
far for example superior to an object
model has a dominant way of addressing
and manipulating data the odd thing that
is how we not be intuitive to write and
think about sequel and said processing
and I think that's one of the NRV
challenges of our building in our
communities how do we figure out how to
teach people to think in sets were
effectively and how to build sequel
statements were effectively I find that
the secrecy laws a this impression
people have it as difficult and like a
lot about we don't want to do it so is
there a way to make it easier that's big
question but I mean this sequel is
difficult so it's harder to write to our
game going as a piece of sequel than it
is to pull the contents of all table
back into your application and the
contents of the other tank and join them
in your application that sounds like a
lot more work than just writing a single
statement yes so one part of problems a
lot of misunderstanding so if i'm gonna
make a java programmer i'm like i get
this off i get me of this data enjoy any
of this data and I dry some Java code
that doesn't not thinking I can just do
a single thing to do and join the
database I can question how you deal
with that I educate the public you know
I think a part of it is that partly
going back to see cool being run for so
long so there's basic single and then
there are advanced features analytics is
an advanced features evil that's the way
it's projected that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
