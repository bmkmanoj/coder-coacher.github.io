sells t-shirts and you want to create a
bot that can accept orders from
customers if the shirts you sell come in
a limited selection of colors so the bot
itself will be relatively simplistic
let's take a look at what the bot will
do the customer enters some text we call
an utterance text that the bot uses to
extract the customer's intent in this
case the customer wants to buy some
shirts the bot responds with a list of
available colors drawn from an entity
after the customer specifies the color
size and quantity the bot asks for
confirmation of the order and then gives
pickup instructions let's see how to
build this bot on the bots homepage
click new bot to create a new bot and
name it t-shirt order taker click intent
to add the first intent let's first add
the one we think will be most commonly
used the buy shirt intent then add
sample utterances these are the phrases
that make up the bots training corpus a
list of phrases related to the intent
buying t-shirts only 10 or so are needed
to get started later you'll do some
testing to see if the ones you've chosen
make a good set of samples an important
part of the intent definition is the
list of entities entities are like
variable types they're used in the
analysis of the text input there are two
types of entities predefined entities
that are built into the bot designer and
custom entities that you create you can
create custom entities as you add them
or you can create them first in the
entity designer and then add them to the
intent definitions later let's go to the
entity design page to create the color
and the size entities both will be of
type value lists so that the bot can
display a list of available options to
your customers click entity enter the
name color and click value to add the
values for the list because customers
can also type in their selection as
opposed to just tapping on the one they
want add some synonyms so the bot can
understand typos and spelling errors
when you're done creating the color and
size entities go back to the intent
design page to add the entities to the
buy shirt intent adding the entities to
the intent is optional but if you do add
them the
but we'll be able to recognize the
entities if they appear in the customers
input now it's time to train the bots
click train this might take a few
minutes but after training the bots can
understand phrases that are not part of
the training corpus let's see how the
bot processes intents try a phrase
that's not in the training corpus such
as I need a few red shirts you can see
that the bot is picked out a value for
the color entity which will be useful
later when we design the dialog flow
let's add a few more intense add the
goodbye greeting and return shirt
intents the same way that you added the
bye shirt intent these intents have no
entities associated with them don't
forget to train the bots again after
adding the new intents now we'll work on
dialogue flow which is the model for the
user bot exchange you define dialogue
flows using Oh bot ml o MCS yeah Moe
based language the bot is essentially a
finite state machine you must define
both the states that the bot can be in
and the rules for switching from one
state to another we won't show you how
to build the dialogue flow from scratch
and said here's the complete flow step
by step first is a bit of metadata then
the context section where we declare the
variables that we'll use in the flow
each variable declaration has a name and
a type here we have the variable color
of type color we define the color type
earlier it's an entity the others are
all entity types - note that the
variables can also have primitive types
such as integer and string but we don't
need those types in this pot we also
define a variable called input of type
NLP result this variable holds the NLP
engines results well then we have an
optional error state to handle internal
bot errors next we have a list of states
we've called the first state user intent
the purpose of this state is to route
the flow to the next state based on what
the customer typed into the bot if the
customer wants to buy a shirt the bot
goes to the detect shirt color state
when in the detect shirt color state the
bot looks for a color entity in the
customers input and if found assigns it
to the color variable then it looks for
a shirt size entity and then
want to see after looking for the
entities the bot goes through the get
color get size and get quantity states
automatically skipping those for which
it already has a value finally after all
the order details are known the bot
enters the confirm order state where it
waits for a yes or no response from the
customer and saves it in the confirm
variable when it gets the response the
bot compares the confirmed value to the
string yes and if equal completes the
transaction you've seen how to create a
simple customer service bot that does
nothing but take t-shirt orders to make
it more useful you could for example add
the ability to take Blue Gene orders
you'd do that by adding another intent
one that allows the bot to know when the
customer wants jeans instead of shirts
but for real usefulness like providing a
customer with an order number you need
to give the bot the ability to contact
an API to get that number which you can
