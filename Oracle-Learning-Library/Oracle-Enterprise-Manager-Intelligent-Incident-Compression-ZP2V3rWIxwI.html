video training Series in this video
we'll talk about intelligent incident
compression which is one of the frame-up
features in Enterprise Manager 13c my
name is utakata katsu I'm one of the
product managers in Enterprise Manager
product management team as an enterprise
manager user you may monitor multiple
targets in your data center and you may
think there are too many alerts
generated and this could be especially
true when multiple targets raise alerts
because of the same route caused by
problem so a question you may have is
this how can I reduce the number of
alerts in that situation and that is a
topic that I'm going to talk about in
this recording in the traditional IT
monitoring where there is a one-to-one
mapping between event and alert when one
of your target goes down you get one
alert then what happens when two of your
targets go down because the host went
down you get two alerts then what if
there is a site-wide outage and all of
your targets go down you get one alert
from each monitor the entity although
they went down with the same reason so
this is a flood of alerts problem in IT
monitoring because of the massive number
of alerts you receive effective
monitoring becomes impossible until the
root cause without it is fixed in
Enterprise Manager 13c we introduced
intelligent incident compression feature
to particularly address these types of
use cases using this feature when a host
or multiple hosts or even the entire
site goes down Enterprise Manager groups
related events into a single incident
and as a result you can configure to
send out only one email notification to
administrators this way you can focus on
real issues that truly need your
attention so this is a very high-level
overview of the incident compression
feature
so to reduce the number of others the
best practice here is to use the
compression feature to group events into
a single incident
if those events relate to the same issue
so that you only need to deal with a
single incident instead of managing
multiple events or incidents separately
and we have a screen shot of an incident
manager in 12c and this is when the
compression is not used each event or
incident shows up in list view down here
at the bottom side of the screen I have
an incident manager in 13c and this is
when the compression is used I only see
two incidents one for target down and
one for metric alert and each incident
has five members included so instead of
managing 10 different events you only
need to manage two incidents with
related events consolidated so basically
compression feature allows you to manage
multiple events in a single incident but
you may manage the alerting by email
primarily or you may Ford the events or
incident to third-party ticketing
systems such as ServiceNow then the
question you may have now is this how
can I reduce the number of notifications
such as number of alert emails or number
of tickets so the compression is
actually a new option in a bento feature
which is also a part of the incident row
feature so using the rule feature there
are two steps to reduce the number of
notifications the first step is to
create an event rule to compress the
related events into a single incident
and this is what we have been talking
about already in the previous slides in
addition to there as a step two you need
to create a separate incident row that
executes the notification so in order to
send out only one email notification
event rule an incident room they have to
be created separately and they have to
be related in the notification has to be
executed by the incident row side so
that was
quick overview for how the compression
feature works but you may still wonder
when and how exactly you can use this
feature to understand that better we
have a couple of use cases the first use
case is when a database administrator
who manages rack database systems wants
to receive only one email alert when one
or more members of the same rack system
go down and he can do this by first
creating an event rule for the target
down event then compress the events by
the same ancestor target in select
cluster database then create a new
incident based on the grouping criteria
and finally create an incident rule that
sends out the email notification and two
points here in order to send out only
one email alert first of all event row
an incident row they have to be created
separately and they have to come as a
pair and the second point is there no
email notification should be set at the
event level this has to be blank
otherwise you get tons of emails
emailing has to be done at the incident
row side so that you only get one email
for this issue another use case a better
Center site administrator once receive
only one email alert when there is a
site-wide outage and all of his targets
go down he doesn't want to have hundreds
of email coming into his mailbox but he
still wants to have a list of targets
that are affected by this outage and he
can do this by creating an event rule to
group agent and reachable events from
all the targets in a data center and
again there are two points to send out
only one email notification first of all
even true in in general they have to
come as a pair and alert notification
once again this should be set at the
incident roadside not at the event row
side so those are the two points in
common when configuring notification
with compression so that was a quick
introduction of
compression now let's see this in the
actual product so what I have here is
Enterprise Manager certain see I have a
database target home page open in my
screen and I have four database targets
configured and three of them are in a
downstate and in this enterprise mental
setup I don't have the compression
enabled so each downstate generates a
single alert so looking at that
situation in the incident manager page
as I expected I have so many incidents
showing up in my list view and each of
them sends us email notification what
that means is they're in my mailbox I
get so many alert emails sent from
Enterprise Manager although these alerts
relate to the same issue so this is a
flood of alerts problem that we are
trying to resolve with the incident
compression so let's see how that works
I'm going to open another browser window
where I have different Enterprise
Manager set up running and here the
compression is enabled so I'm logging in
to this site and unlike the other side
although my database targets are up and
running and the first thing I want to do
in this setup is to confirm the
compression is enabled so I'm going to
open a menu from setup incident incident
rules to go to the incident rule home
page expand this node and they are my
compression rules I have three rules in
my rosette the first two are event rules
and the last one is an insolent rule the
first row is to compress targetdown
events and create a single incident in
the second row
this is to compress the metric alert
events and create a single incident and
finally the third rule this is an
incident rule which sends out email
notification based on the incidents that
are created by the above two event rows
so they are my compression rules and I
can also confirm all of them are enabled
now let's take a quick look at the
configuration window to review the
grouping options
in this rule target down events are
compressed by the same host what this
means is that all the target down events
coming from the same host will be
consolidated into a single incident
alternatively you can select the
compressed events by the same target or
by the same ancestor target type such as
cluster database or WebLogic domain or
by the same generic systems or by the
category or specifically band name such
as target on closing this out okay so
now I confirm that my compression is
enabled the next thing I want to do is
to purposefully shut down the database
instances so that I can test out the
compression feature because I want to
see whether this is actually going to
reduce the number of notifications so
I'm going to open terminal windows each
running sequel plus and what I'm going
to do is to shut down my databases for
the test purpose okay so going back to
my database target home page and I could
confirm the three of my databases are
currently in a down state and this is
apparently because I just shut down the
database instances the next thing I want
to do is to verify whether this actually
reduced a number of incident so I'm
going to the incident manager page and I
only see two incidents open my screen
which is good one for target down and
one for metric alert and each incident
has five members included so what
happened here was there ten alerts were
compressed into two incidents so you
only need to work on two incidents
instead of managing ten different events
with separate efforts I'm going to
narrow down to one of the incident open
this in a different tab to see more
details and the summary says there are
five target ability events coming from
the same host and down here I see a list
of events that are compressed into this
incident because they happened around
the same time on the same host so this
demonstrated the capability of the
compressed
feature to reduce the number of incident
but what about the notification so I'm
going to my mailbox and just like we saw
in incident manager page I only got two
emails received from Enterprise Manager
one for target down and one for metric
Alert opening one of the email and
here's the content I see a list of
targets that are affected by this
particular outage or failure and in this
case they are the database instances
that I shut down myself so I only get
one email for target down but that
includes the information for what is
going on overall so if I want to see
more details I can click the link in the
message and this will bring me to the
corresponding incident page in
Enterprise Manager so that I can either
fix a problem there or perform more
investigation so this concludes the
demonstration of the incident
compression feature so the compression
feature in Enterprise Manager 13c
provides automatic compression of
multiple events into a single incident
which reduces volume of both incident
and notification and as a result it
promotes more efficiency in your system
management for more information we have
only documentation available from the
URL showing in the screen we also have a
mas note that provides step-by-step
instruction describing how to configure
a rule set to create one compress the
incident and to notify the administrator
of such compressed incident via email
this is the end of the recording of
intelligent incident compression
