cloud control 13c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to add
a web logic domain along with its
partitions clusters servers application
deployments and resources to Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control 13c I
will then highlight key functionality
that Cloud Control offers administrators
for monitoring administering and
managing domains while this
demonstration is using Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 13c release 2 with
the Fusion Middleware plug-in released
13 to 2 the capabilities shown are also
available in other versions as well
there are multiple methods for
discovering a WebLogic domain and cloud
control using the gutted discovery
process from the cloud control console
this method discovers and adds each
domain individually and is best used
when you have just one or two domains to
add to cloud control using discover WLS
VirB from the Enterprise Manager
command-line interface this method
discovers and adds multiple domains in a
single operation and is consequently
best used when you have several domains
to add using Auto discovery this method
performs discovery of domains across
hosts on a repeated scheduled basis it
is best used when you are not aware of
all the domains installed in your data
center for this demonstration we will
add a domain using the guided discovery
process from the cloud control console
to begin we will log in to the console
as an enterprise manager administrator
who has been granted the privileges to
add targets notice that there are
already several domains discovered in
Cloud Control most running on-premises
but one so a domain running in the
Oracle cloud and these domains range
from version 1035 to 12 1 3 to 12 to 1
when adding a new domain to cloud
control we are prompted for a variety of
inputs about the domain the host on
which the administration server is
installed and running
the administration server listened port
as well as its credentials to discover
node manager for the domain we need to
also provide the credentials to node
manager to ensure uniqueness of each
domain added to cloud control we need to
provide a unique domain identifier after
supplying these inputs Enterprise
Manager establishes a DMX connection to
the administration server and discovers
the domain and all members and resources
of the domain we can see the newly added
domain and its members on the middleware
summary page from here we can drill down
to any of these discover targets and
understand whether the target is up or
down if it is performing well as well as
fully manage the target from any targets
home page we gain a sense of the overall
health of the target from this domains
home page we find details on the
administration server any potential
problems for the domain and its members
cluster information server information
application information and if
multi-tenancy is configured for the
domain we can see an overview of the
partitions running in the domain from
the target menu we gain access to a wide
range of capabilities that Cloud Control
offers for web logic management we can
view performance data from either a
real-time or historical perspective we
can specify thresholds and corrective
actions for performance metrics diagnose
performance problems with JVM
Diagnostics or middleware diagnostics
advisor start or stop processes running
in the domain view and correlate
messages across log files
configure JDBC data sources as was other
settings of the domain also from the
target menu we can access the system
mbean browser to view configure or
invoke in the mbean we can understand
relationships between components with
the routing topology we can view the
latest configuration settings for the
domain compare those settings against
other domains to ensure there is no
configuration drift track the
configuration over time to understand
what changes have been made in the past
we can access compliance information to
see whether the domain has any
violations to best practices or IT
standards such as the WebLogic server
security technical implementation guide
or stake for short we can perform
provisioning tasks such as creating a
provisioning profile or gold image of
the domain from which we can later use
as the source to clone new domains or we
can deploy a new or updated Java EE
application to the domain will not
expose from the target menu we can also
use Cloud Control to receive patch
recommendations and apply patches to
Oracle homes of one or more domains
and also not exposed directly from the
target menu is the ability to create
schedule and track execution of wls T
scripts and lastly if we use the cloud
control console or command-line
interface we can also audit all
operations including WebLogic specific
operations so we can better monitor for
suspicious activity reduce the risk of
service disruption and provide
accountability of actions so that
