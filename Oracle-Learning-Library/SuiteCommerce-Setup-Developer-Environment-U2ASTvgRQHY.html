developer tools one for creating themes
and one for creating extensions these
tools simplify the process of creating
themes and extensions end up deploying
them to your suite commerce standard or
suite commerce advanced site before you
can create themes and extensions you
must set up your local development
environment before you begin setting up
your local development environment make
sure you have the extensions management
suite app installed in your NetSuite
account you also need to install either
this suite commerce standard suite app
or the suite commerce advanced suite out
if you're implementing suite commerce
advanced you must be on the Aconcagua
release or later during this video we
are going to install nodejs install golf
j/s download the suite commerce
extension developer tools and theme
developer tools extract the files into
top level development directories and
install dependent files in the developer
tools directories first installed nodejs
which is the java script development
platform required by gulp j/s the
version of nodejs you need depends on
the suite commerce product you are
implementing for your site check the
developers portal to see which version
of nodejs you need search the portal for
the topic named install nodejs and here
you find which release of suite commerce
requires which version of nodejs
after you find the version number you
need go to this URL and then scroll
through the list until you find the
version click the Downloads link for
your version and this takes you to a
page where you can download the install
package for your operating system scroll
through the list to locate the install
package and then click the filename to
download it when the download finishes
run the Installer and accept the default
installation settings next you need to
install gulp jeaious gulp j/s is an open
source tool that automates many of the
tasks of creating web-based applications
suite commerce uses Gulf Jas to compile
JavaScript files into a single
application file and to compile SAS
files into a single file that is
loaded into a browser to install gulp
jeaious opened a commander terminal
window and entered this command NPM
space install space - - global space
gulp this installation can take several
minutes next you need to download the
suite commerce developer tools and as I
mentioned earlier there are developer
tools for extensions and developer tools
for themes you may need only one or the
other or both depending upon the type of
development you will do check the suite
commerce developer portal to see which
version of the theme developer tools and
the extension developer tools you need
and where to find them in the file
cabinet search for the topics setup
theme developer tools and setup
extension developer tools you can access
the file cabinet by selecting documents
files and then file cabinet and then go
to the directory that contains your
developer tools and click the download
link for the files you need to download
next extract the zip files to your local
machine and create top level development
directories extract the tools into
different top-level directories one for
theme tools and one for extension tools
you can extract anywhere you want I
accepted the default folder names and
extracted to the root of my C Drive the
finish installation open a command or
terminal window and change to the tools
directory itch is created enter the
command and the p.m. space install this
command installs the dependencies
required to build and deploy your themes
and extensions and can take several
minutes to complete any to run this
command in the theme tools directory and
also in the extension tools directory
and that finishes the setup now it's
time to start creating themes and
extensions for more information on
themes and extensions consult the
developers portal at developers suite
