this session in the evening in this buff
you're going to see a number of
practical use cases where NetBeans IDE
was used to create JSF based
applications um my name is Karen I'm a
member of the NetBeans team and this is
actually the first of two parts so in
this part you'll see three use cases and
where NetBeans IDE tend to be very
useful tomorrow from 10 to 11 next door
in ballroom for there'll be another
session a part two of this where
there'll be a complete application
corrected from scratch and if we done by
myself together with a chat site jibiji
who is the lead developer and architect
and founder of the primefaces component
sweets so if you want to see how
primefaces is used in a real context
together with maven Java EE 6 come
tomorrow to see that application being
put together for today three speakers
each with a specific challenge the first
johannes vagrant who will show you how a
semantic search and navigate
functionality was built in to an
application using JSF and NetBeans and
what the benefits were of that
combination and secondly Glenn Homer
will show you another situation where
many different sites need to be
corrected from from the same codebase
with a small team of developers and
finally and David half a finger will
show and talk about how an application
was built in a couple of weeks so we
start immediately and at the end of
those three use cases we can open the
floor to any discussion questions and
follow-up that anyone might have so
let's start immediately with your
harness
thank you very much for your brief
welcome my name is Yana swag and I'm
from Germany Munich
I'm city of a small but excellent
software engineering company near Munich
Rosenheim it's located in the Bavarian
Alps and I'm also teacher lecturer at
the University of Applied Science and we
use for all our project in the
university NetBeans and we using last
time for more and more projects in our
company NetBeans that's growing in the
next 10 minutes I will show you about
the use case using NetBeans primefaces
GlassFish and Sola to move later plan
maven right and maybe right to filter
Enterprise Search application the
problem for such an for such application
is many customers has data in different
applications and data silos and you can
do a search over everything but you need
searches over everything so you get in
one system and look around and the other
and integrate everything by hand or on
paper or - or clipart in the system and
many customers need a solution for that
and we built a solution which is based
on Apache Solr
that's the backend it's an enterprise
search server for doing enterprise
search for indexing text data for
indexing real relational data or from
different data sources we have built
OSGi components on top of that for for
coffins and functionality and for the UI
functionality
the UI is done with brown faces with a
light framework it's called common UI in
the screenshot and the development is
done
NetBeans it's very interesting I will
show you this application shortly live
as you see here it's a normal search
application and you can look around and
search for things I find my customer
here's one car and the car itself has
relations to other to other business
objects like technical informations
documents in such a search system it's
fairly common to use a faceted search we
have here faceted search if I want to
see everything what's with the oil can
to do has to do I see here we have two
two documents which belongs to that that
case and I can look at this document and
and can from that document navigate to
other two other informations and can
click through everything in my system
and can navigate in search and this
application I want to show you how to
build with NetBeans maven and GlassFish
a little bit from the scratch and it
starts with a maven web application and
this is not from a plugin this is part
of the standard download of meetings ID
versus that standard NetBeans IDE I call
it say a search
it shows the GlassFish server I use and
I get an empty application with some
sample HTML files the first thing I want
to you to adjust the frameworks and I
can use I want to use the other server
faces and on the component Prem
framework I want to use primefaces which
is very very useful as we've seen before
and then I have a generated project
which compiles on every build server I
delete the sample files I don't not want
to use them the first thing if you
developer chase F application you need a
template for your for your style to make
every page common to have the same
footer and header and I name a template
and plate
and I instantiate that is a template
with a template client it's the index
page and I select the template and I
want to have another page a page for
search results and this page is uses
also the same template you can see it's
very easy to to to use chase after 10
templates so if we start and edit the
template the pages the index page has
only content the results page has only
content and the template defines the
header and the footer so I can define
the header and the footer
it's the header is J search or sample
the footer is travel 1
and here we go we have pages
whenever start to program JSP I can use
the auto completion of primefaces
but I've prepared a form normal HTTP
form HTML form and the only thing I have
to fix or some namespaces for for the
XML and here I have a output label input
text and comment button and the sec i
need a controller and the controller is
also done the wizard i say i make a
search controller and this is search
controller it's a normal Java object
with an annotation in pocho and it
stores my expression and it's had a list
of result shows and the list of results
is currently not known and here comes
maven I can look in my main repository
to find this type and NetBeans perfectly
recognizes that I have this type and in
a search component which I want to use
the search component itself is very
complicated you if you have to to adjust
your class path by hand you you add 20
or more libraries I insert some get a
code it's done
and I insert a search logic which I have
prepared and ten minutes is not not
possible to type everything so we have
the index page we have a result page
here I need a table I want to have a
chase F table and here we are I can
start the project and hopefully
everything gets right
it's deployed I see the head on the
footer you can easily adjust it with
with artwork and make it really
professional I have a search expression
field where can I do a search and as you
see the search goes into the solar
server and every record is shown
well the last thing I want to mention is
that means is not also a good idea in
the sense of the Wizards work and and
it's it's perfect to work and to rapid
prototyping and rapid things like shown
it's also open for all plugins this is a
application we did last year it's it's a
total separate application it's with the
NetBeans platform and you if you are not
very familiar with NetBeans you even
don't recognize that is NetBeans and you
can do your own code plugins to do
analyzers to do custom generators or
things like that with NetBeans platform
and that's very handy so for me and
former for our company
NetBeans is a very cool IDE the
functionality is good tested I'm the
most of the time it works as intended
I got no nasty bugs this is for
professional users more more important
than the last plug-in on the open source
market which doesn't work and we have
used IntelliJ for years and Eclipse
doesn't make a job for us we ever had
problems with warnings and and stuff
like that the main integration doesn't
work that wasn't a problem here NetBeans
this the best open-source IDE I think
and that would that's what I could
contribute here thank you okay thank you
very much
so next up we have planned he's going to
talk about a different use case but
equally interesting and challenging
perfect
all right so can everyone hear me okay
this is a little bit about me I guess
you can see from the list why I never
get anything done
our challenge is a little bit different
what Johannes was talking about is
creating a big app from scratch and in
our case we already have the big app and
we need to make more of them because
what happened with us like many other
companies our web business absolutely
exploded in recent years and we have a
number of different brands and
management said well we need another
website another website for this brand
and you know what we just bought out our
Australian licensee so we need yet
another website for that same brand and
it just went on and on from there and in
order to save our resources make the
most use out of our resources what we
did was we decided to make all of those
sites from a single NetBeans project I
don't know if any of you were at the
NetBeans day on Sunday I talked us a
little bit about how we how we use the
hooks in the NetBeans build scripts to
copy in the right facelets pages for
each site when we build so we just
basically push a button and get the
right website but this is the other part
of the story
here's a picture of some of the sites
they have the same database schema and
the same code underlying them but as you
can see there's a lot of difference in
the way they look the look and feel and
there are some subtle differences in the
way they behave as well and it's all
about selling shoes it's all about
selling shoes big shoes little shoes so
yeah so there is some commonality there
but we have to we we've had to create
new sites in as little as three weeks
and when the word comes down you know
you make it happen
so the features of JSF that helped us do
that that I want to talk about are first
of all JSF templating and a little bit
about view parameters and the little
things that NetBeans gives you the
little hints and tweaks that NetBeans
gives you to make this all possible
really what again like I say made it
possible for us to do this and then I'll
talk to us a little bit about component
library recognition it's kind of again
the other side of what Johannes was
talking about with primefaces because
we're we're on ice basis shop here so
here's just a little bit showing one of
the pages from inside the site this is
just a regular product grid page like
you see on a million web pages all over
the world how many people here are using
JSF 2.0 with faceless templating a lot
of people so you know this probably
looks very familiar to you you can see
that on the Left it's showing that that
style grid is the actual page that holds
everything in here and on the far right
you can see the template that it's made
from which is called main grid template
and then within that are all different
little tiny pieces of code that are just
strung together from that template and
when we need to create a new site it's
very simple we just pick one out say
well this is you know this new site is
very similar to what we're doing on this
site so we'll take a copy of that little
file from the source code stick it in
here but you know this other part is a
lot like this other site that we're
doing so we'll snip out a little part
from there and then we start tweaking it
and finally we get what we want here's a
picture of that outer containing page
that style grid page and you can see in
the first circle bit of code there that
it specifies the template that the
composition is made from and then
there's a define there those of you that
have worked with this before you know
this I'm sure this all looks very
familiar and then here's the template
itself excuse me so I'd like to just
flip over here if I could to NetBeans
and we'll take a little bit stronger
look at it closer look at it so here's
that do you have a terminal window right
in there yes I actually do this is I
don't know how many of you use this if
you're using NetBeans there's that
there's a you know oops
right so there's there's a terminal
right in there and I'll use that to
connect to databases and things like
that so I actually just started using
this recently it's yet another one of
those features that makes you never have
to leave NetBeans you know I have my
terminal there and everything so here I
hope everyone can see this here is this
is the head and here's the body and here
we're seeing where we're doing some
includes and so forth now if you look
what NetBeans is providing to us is this
area up here this is a relatively small
piece of code but you can imagine if you
had a giant thing you can be hard to
navigate and if you look up here these
are actually links so if I want to know
what geez I'm inside one of these which
is inside one of these which is inside
one of these where is that form and you
just click on it and there it is which
is very nice helps us a lot that's the
template this is the the outermost one
and also in that means you would expect
this but of course it gives you all
kinds of cold completions so we have
this kind of code completion here and
here right with all the Javadoc and
everything and it's really nice to have
this in the front end in the in the JSF
pages I mean obviously you're expecting
that in your java code but it's nice to
have it here as well because we're
making that link between the front end
and the back end code but just by
clicking on this stuff so here I think
there's the other one I wanted to show
well here yeah here's a real good
example of how deeply nested we are and
gee where did this all come from where
we're iterating through a panel series
here where did I put that panel series
well you just click up here and boom
there it is ah there it is it was right
up there so that helps us a lot
here's another example of the code
completion the class and the stuff that
goes with it
what NetBeans also gives you is the
ability to go straight to the java code
from the JSF page so if you hold on
control you'll see that it now
highlights and if I click here whoo
there's the there's the Java code that's
behind it so it's the things like that
the little things like that that are
really helpful to us let me just switch
back here for a minute
so another feature of JSF that's really
helped us a lot is view parameters how
many people are familiar with view
parameters and how that works in JSF
yeah so we have some searching here too
it's it's completely different than what
Hannes was doing and it's not
sophisticated either but what happens is
this ends up in the in the URL as
request parameters hmm so here we see
the code for that we've got the F per am
which which gives us the parameter that
we put in there and and of course
include view params means that it's
going to go out right on the URL as a
request parameter and these are the
reefs this is the receiving end of those
same variables so you can see here that
these are these are the I'm sorry these
are the these these here style size
width color those are actually the
I suppose it's running trust me okay so
those are actually the the different
search parameters in the drop down there
that I had on a previous slide so you
can see here the customer can search by
this way by that way by another way and
any one of those will come down I'm
sorry through these and into the URL and
again we're seeing the same thing here
with the the code completion and so
forth that NetBeans helps us with all
this stuff becomes so easy because you
just it's it's like it's like you have a
secretary they're saying oh excuse me is
this what you were looking for you know
and it's very easy to find things one
more thing I wanted to talk about here
is component library recognition no
Johannes was using primefaces
and we're using ice basis so primefaces
of course is bundled with NetBeans but
ice basis isn't notice though that it's
telling us if you want to include ice
bases here's what you have to do it's
telling us what to do and basically
laying out leg it out for us so if we go
back to the code and we step up here by
the way this is built excuse me this is
built as an enterprise app with the
enclosing project and then an EJB jar
project and to war projects one for the
storefront and one for the customer
service interface but if you look at the
properties for the storefront sub
application or sub project you can see
well sure enough frameworks JavaServer
faces and here's your choice of
components and it says yes we're using
eye spaces so when we click on more
that's when we get that dialogue in this
telling us oh yes by the way you need to
include ice faces jar would you like me
to help you create a library so you push
the button and it says okay I'm gonna
create this library and then you just
add what you need into it so in all
these ways NetBeans has helped us save a
lot of time and it's helped us to make
the most of a small team three
developers and and three Java developers
and to
developers we have nine sites out and
many more to come unfortunately thank
you and so the final contribution and
David have a finger talking on a similar
but different topic relating to JSF and
NetBeans
go back back
can everybody hear me yes yeah David
helpful finger I wrote a book on
NetBeans and Java EE development a
Polish medpac publishing I own a company
which is a one-man show just me so I'm
essentially a consultant I get to pick
my own title so I'm the CTO ain't nobody
else on that company alright
I just might tell a story like I said
with some consulting man based on
Washington DC and recently client hired
me to help them build Java web based
application now this client they had an
existing Java application but it was all
struts application running on a gate to
the application server of course I
wanted to convince them to upgrade their
application server so we could use the
newer technologies so I told them about
you know your your app server we can use
this modern api's that there's not as
much boilerplate code not as much
configuration so a lot more productivity
but this for you know business types and
manage them they weren't getting it so I
tried a different approach
I wrote a proof of concept using trying
phases and as you guys just saw
primefaces just renders beautifully out
of the box and I showed it to them and
say if you want the new application to
look like this you have to upgrade your
application server and that convinced
them they actually did start using
GlassFish so if you guys are having
trouble convincing your management to
upgrade that's one technique that you
you know you could try anyway once we
get that out of the way the client said
okay let's do it you're gonna have 30
developers to help you're gonna say yes
that's good news but they also say you
have three weeks to finish the whole
thing and that was some nuts such
goodness it's a big application lots of
pages lots of code so well it was a
challenge but I tried it so before the
three weeks started I do have some time
to go through the requirements and come
up with the initial architecture and
whatnot and
some framework code then met with the
development team the the 30 developments
the 30 developers but before that I
showed how to build a page somewhat not
using NetBeans and I know some people
can get very religious about the IDE so
I didn't require everybody to move to
NetBeans but it was recommended now when
they saw the things that I thought I was
doing with NetBeans how productive I was
our 30 developers 29 decided to move to
NetBeans but they have one IntelliJ IDEA
guy that just wouldn't budge and kept
using it we were using maven so we can
use different IDs so you know we
wouldn't we're entitled to specific ID
that's that's definitely a good way to
go if you don't want to be tied to an
IDE that's alright because they even
defined its own project and you know IDs
can can deal with that in some way
correct right so incredibly I mean it
was a lot of work lots of long hours was
very hectic but we were able to deliver
you know we even had some developers
that we're done at developers and we're
just starting with Java you know and we
did the liver in three weeks and this
are the features that you know from
NetBeans that I believe made it possible
the first thing was the glass of Senate
integration developers of the the whole
application for this client they had to
start the app server from the command
line and they had to deploy from the
command line there was no integration so
when they saw that during my demo that
they really liked that so that was
something that you know that really
helped us out like I mentioned all the
Java guys or most of the Java guys were
using Eclipse and NetBeans has Eclipse
key bindings we were under tight
deadlines so we didn't have time for the
developers to get used to new keyboard
shortcuts so using the Eclipse keyword
shortcuts helped us out just like you
kind of showed the generating faceless
pages from a template you know I wrote a
template that had the banner and the
maining all the common areas and
everybody just by pointing and clicking
we generated pages and fill in the
blanks you know so that helped us out
and the big big big thing was JPL code
generation both entities and daos
we had to write very little database
access code and most of it was generated
we essentially had to write a few JPA
queries here and there but for the most
part it was all generated it was a given
and without that I think we have we
would have ever made that deadline
mm-hmm we have time for a demo
definitely yeah we can switch to yes
this one okay I'm just gonna write an
application from scratch I mean when you
start a new project web project and you
select JSF and pick primefaces like
Johanna Stroh shall out of the box
immediately you get this page that is
generated by NetBeans so you have a
starting point that's using primefaces
what I want to show is the JPA and
regeneration so I'm going to use the
sample database that comes with NetBeans
that time
and that should do it
okay here are any just let's take a look
at one of them it's the JPA entity a
bunch of name quarries I generated a
pretty basic stuff but writing that by
hand will be time-consuming so once we
have that we can generate a Dao or
facade like all of them
again let's take a look at one of them
okay so we can see this very little coat
here
the reason is all of these do inherit
from a parent class and all the crud
operations are defined on the parent
class ok so now that we have that let's
create a JSF managed bean
okay we're gonna use the customer first
slide so we need the EJB annotation
right and we need a method that's gonna
be invoked when the observer
instantiates the beam so we need the
post construct annotation
okay
we're just gonna call find all of course
we need to assign that to a field so we
can just say refactor enter this field
okay and here it is and we need some
getters and setters Oh
insert now if we go we have our our
managed beans so now we need to make a
few changes to the faceless page
later table
customer customer
what did it co my manners being yeah in
the days of the default okay
I went here to column
and
name
I've run our application
should show up here and all this data
came from the database it looks nice it
looks beautiful - what five minutes to
generate that so this kind of
productivity is what allowed us to now
add another column in the table and and
save the page yourself sure my favorite
productivity feature coming up yeah
should I just bring something else from
the JPA entity let's try that city okay
so the page is saved they just save and
refresh the browser load so there's a
new column so there's no explicit need
to to redeploy the application make a
change save the change whatever it is
anywhere in the application refresh the
browser and you see the result done yeah
thanks very much are there any questions
from anyone about anything that you've
seen or would like to see
I believe you know I'm sorry I can't the
question was if you have your own
component library like primefaces rich
face I said but your own component
library doesn't it meet what net means
automatically provide the code
completion and and all these features
for you or would you need to create a
whole plugin that provides that no it
does when I was writing that three-week
application I was writing custom
components for the application a code
completion will work just fine yeah
perfect
yes you know someone was stretching us
well to round off the story
this is all fine and good but if you're
on the net means to the web page there's
also a Docs and support tab where you
see a lot of documentation including a
section on Java EE and Java web
applications so on here you find an
incredible amount of resources to help
you get started creating all kinds of
Java EE related applications including
NetBeans ecommerce tutorial so this
house section builds at a complete
application that is quite extensive oh
sorry oh that I'm doing you are not
seeing okay just to return to where I
started medicals with our story if
you're on the net installed org home
page and you click on the ducks and
support tab and you go to the Java EE
and Java web applications learning trail
there are a lot of tutorials there's a
long list of screencasts that's continue
growing pointing to YouTube and other
places but there's also a NetBeans
ecommerce tutorial and this house
section builds up one single application
very similar to the applications you've
seen and there is this application
if I'm correct yes so here is the live
application that you can create via the
steps
via the various parts of that particular
tutorial and so a real business
application and that you get at the end
of it with a shopping cart and and all
the expected functionality so there's
really a lot of tutorials helped to help
you get started with Java EE and using
the technologies you've seen are there
any other questions or points yes yes
how do you turn on eclipse keybindings I
don't actually have NetBeans started up
and someone else would yeah pins up okay
so we'll switch to David yes I can find
that this is under options
she meant
the things eclipse and Emacs you just
make that switch and you can use your
own keyboard shortcuts there's a VI
plug-in if anybody's used to VI yeah
well thank you very much for coming in
the evening and joining our session and
remember tomorrow is far too at 10
o'clock next door in ballroom for
unlocking the Java EE 6 platform where
the Java EE 6 specification is explained
by means of an extended demo so no
slides just code tomorrow thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
