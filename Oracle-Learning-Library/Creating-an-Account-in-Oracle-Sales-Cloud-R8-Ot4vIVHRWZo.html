going to show you how to create a new
account in Oracle sales cloud to begin
I'm going to go to the create accounts
page now the account name here is
required for the type i'm going to
choose customer because I've already
sold to this account before I would
choose prospect if this was a new
account and I know my primary contacts
name for this account so I'm going to
select them now note that this company
is in the US if I chose a different
country there might be different
required address fields now this is cool
when i start typing the city name it
automatically starts making suggestions
so i can just choose from the list now
we'll verify the address it
automatically filled in the correct zip
code for me here so now that i created
the account i can search for it and add
additional details
here on the overview page I can get a
quick summary of the account information
including a number of opportunities the
installed assets and product
recommendations and the last few
interactions with the account on the
profile tab I can upload attachments add
a parent account and view the entire
account hierarchy from the team tab I
can view all account related details the
account is also assigned to relevant
sales territories so I can view other
account team members and their function
on the account I can also view and
manage contacts assets for the account
opportunities and I can also understand
the circle of influence through
relationships with other accounts and
contacts I can also participate in
Oracle sales network conversations about
the account and collaborate on documents
as well as a lot you can do here this
concludes this demo and you can find
additional learning resources in the
Oracle Fusion application help the
Oracle Learning Library and in Oakland
University thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
