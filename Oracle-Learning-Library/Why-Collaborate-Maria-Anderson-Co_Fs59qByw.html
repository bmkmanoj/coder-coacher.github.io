attending collaborate would be to of
course come to sessions understand what
new technologies have come out or are
coming and also to network with other IT
professionals in the community and then
of course to meet Oracle folks as well
to understand Oracle's strategic
direction and of course to have a little
bit of fun so coming to collaborate and
working with Oracle for many years I
would say coming to collaborate is very
advantageous for me personally not only
do I understand the technology better
but I also know how to take that
technology back to my organization and
adviser applied the you know the
technology better in terms of
information sharing I'm a big fan of
conferences because there is that
face-to-face communication and in person
obviously we share a lot of information
over the internet and through through
through Twitter and the various other
channels but i find the face-to-face
communication is very very valuable we
have a lot of very highly respected
professionals associated with the iug a
lot of oracle aces and folks that really
understand the technology so for me the
benefit is getting to know these people
coming to collaborate attending their
sessions and and you know afterwards you
know getting to know them speaking with
them asking for their advice that for me
is really the benefit
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
