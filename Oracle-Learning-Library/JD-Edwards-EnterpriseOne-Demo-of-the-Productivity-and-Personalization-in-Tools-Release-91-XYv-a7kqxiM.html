of the new features that we've
introduced with JD edwards enterpriseone
tools released nine dot one that our
focus specifically on improving end-user
product productivity and personalization
capabilities what you're looking at here
is a system running enterprise
applications release nine dot 1990 I'm
sorry and on top of enterprise one tools
release nine dot one now to demonstrate
a lot of these features i'm going to go
ahead and enter into our standard
business process for order to cash and
from here very easily launch out the
sales order application now the first
thing you'll notice when the application
comes up is that it looks different than
the last releases that we've had the
color is different the banner looks
different the fonts of the application
look different the control such as the
tabs and everything looked different and
what we've done is we've actually
introduced a lot of the fusion you I
principles that are going into the
fusion applications into JD Edwards this
does a couple of things it gives us a
very crisp modern look and feel and also
keeps us consistent with other Oracle
Applications the other thing you'll
notice is we've streamlined the toolbar
we've gotten rid of a lot of the
additional text and stuff so that it is
much more streamlined and easier to work
with and we've improved a lot of the way
that the controls render to make sure
that they line up and aren't oversized
now as far as end user productivity some
of the things that we've done is try to
minimize the amount of movements mouse
movement and clicks that you have to do
for an application so one of the first
things we've done recently is allow the
right click capability in the grid and
in the form header to bring up
dynamically the row exits so you can see
I have all the row exits available in
the application with that right click
and I was also able to very easily set
up some of the favorites that I do every
day maybe I work with configuration or
availability the way I did that was just
drag-and-drop muro exits up into a
favorites area so a nice quick way to
get to those row exits same thing is
available up in the form X it's also now
as far as productivity goes also it's
easy the end user has to be able to see
the information that they want to see so
we've introduced a lot of capabilities
for dynamic grid capabilities to be able
to move fields back and forth and such
and to be able to rearrange and
reorganize your your grid information so
here's an example of maybe I want to see
the quantity over a couple more columns
I can just simply drag and drop that
or perhaps there's fields that I don't
want to see like the hold code is not of
importance to me I can hide that maybe
the revision number is not of importance
I can hide that or revision reason is
not important I could hide those so I
can change the grid the way I want to
look and feel if I want to get some of
those hidden fields back I can as easily
right click hit the unhide button and
then those are shown up into a list
where I can go ahead and select those
and have those displayed back in the
application again so very easy very
intuitive way to be able to modify the
grid also capabilities to be able to
resize controls so here's an example of
maybe this description is a little bit
longer I want to reclaim some space in
my application go ahead and do that very
simply their last thing in the grid i'll
show you is the ability to freeze
columns this is much like what you do in
a spreadsheet where you have the most
important information on the left hand
side you always want to be frozen and
then have the right hand side be able to
be scrollable in order to do that you
can just go on to the header of the
column that you want to freeze you right
click hit the freeze button you see the
blue line there and then now you can see
that you can scroll to the right hand
side of the screen and the left hand
information is left in place now the
interesting ass interesting aspect about
this is if this is an entry grid this
frozen blue line also acts as an auto
return so it helps in speed data entry
so if I was entering in data when I
tabbed and hit the blue line it would
automatically return to the next row
first column and that really aids into a
lot of capabilities where people are
doing heads down data entry of course
with all these capabilities you do have
the ability to do a one-off change and
throw it away maybe you just want to
look at this this one time and you want
you don't want to have this format look
that way all the time or you can save it
very simply by hitting the green disk
over here to save the grid format it
prompts you for the format name i'm just
going to call that my format hit OK and
then that will save that off in the
system and will be available so when I
come in later on I can take a look at
this format or I can't all go back to
any of the other formats that I'd like
to see so this is a quick run through
the few changes that we've made into
enterprise one tools released nine dot 1
keep your eye out for other videos that
are showing
things about how we've improved
graphical navigation enhanced query
capabilities some of the management
features an enterprise one thank you for
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
