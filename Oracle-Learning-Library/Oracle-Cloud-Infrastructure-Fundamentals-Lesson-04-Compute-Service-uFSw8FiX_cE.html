OCI compute service in this lecture we
will dive deeper into the ocean compute
service talk about the concepts and look
at various features of the OCI compute
service the first thing to keep in mind
is that OCI has bare-metal servers and
OCA is the only public cloud which
supports bare metal and virtual machines
using the same set of api's Hardware
firmware software stack and networking
infrastructure you can see the model in
this slide bare metal are inst bare
metal servers are instances where
customers get the whole the full
underlying server this is also referred
to as the single tenant model by
specified by some customers the
advantage here is that there is no
performance overhead no shared agents
and no noisy neighbors on the other
spectrum our virtual machines where the
underlying host is virtualized to
provide smaller Williams
and this this can also be referred to as
the multi tenant model that Wantage here
is the flexibility in drug in regards to
the instance shapes but keep in mind
that we have bare metal servers number
one and number two we are the only cloud
where the bare metal servers and the
virtual machines have the same
underlying set of API sand all the
related hardware and software stack now
Oracle compute cloud service enables you
to select from a range of predefined
shapes that determine the number of CPUs
amount of RAM and local storage and you
can select these predefined shapes for
both bare metal and virtual machine
instances so as you can see on this
slide we have Gen 2 and Gen 1 bare metal
shapes Gen to bare metal shapes are
being shown in in orange orange color
text and as you can see for Gen 2 we
have standard computer instances we have
dense IO compute instances and we also
have GPU instances now the GPU instances
have to Tesla p100 nvidia gpus and you
can see all the configuration here you
can also see gen1 bare-metal instances
now there are some differences between
gen 2 and genuine the first is that Gen
2 instances have significantly higher
network bandwidth so they have anywhere
you know they have something like 50
gbps so we have to Nick cards 25 Gbps
each if you add up the bandwidth that's
2 into 25 Gbps network bandwidth gen 1
instances only had a network bandwidth
up to 10 Gbps so that's number one
number two they have more coarse so if
you look at gen to the standard and
compute instances they have 52 course
compared to 36 course on genuine they
also have more Ram communities if you
look at Gen 1 million 22:56 gig of ram
jet do both in shapes have 768 gig of
ram right same thing with local and me
am a storage sort of double the size of
nvme storage compared to Gen 1 instances
and they also have you know
significantly higher Phoenix network
interface cuts so so what it means is
Gen 2 instances are more powerful more
cores more RAM more local storage higher
network bandwidth more network interface
cards but at the same time the pricing
is the same between Gen 2 and Gen 1 so
that's a big incentive for customers to
adopt Gen 2 instances if they are
already on Gen 1 or they are thinking of
using Oracle cloud infrastructure in on
this slide you can see some shapes for
for virtual machines starting with one
core going to 24 cores in standard
configuration and from 8 cores to 24
cores in the dense io configuration
right and you can see the network
bandwidth the number of virtual NIC but
they have block storage local storage
the thing to keep in mind is they are
more powerful than Gen 1 virtual
machines and the pricing is again
scene between genuine and Jen do similar
to what we have for our metal so again a
great incentive for customers to adopt
Jen too in case they are using genuine
instances so these are dislike shows all
the genuine install virtual machine
instance shapes for standard and dense
i/o configuration so one thing to keep
in mind is nvme SSD devices with with
Oracle Cosi I compute server that's
that's that's a big differentiator for
us so what do I mean here some instance
shapes in Oracle cloud infrastructure
include locally attached nvme devices
these devices provide extremely low
latency high performance storage that is
ideal for Big Data OLTP and any other
workload that can benefit from high
performance storage note that these
devices are not protected in any way
they are individual devices locally
installed on your instance OCI does not
take images backup or use raid or any
other methods to protect the data on
nvme devices it is solely your
responsibility to protect and manage the
durability of the data on these devices
now you can see the instance types and
the amount of nvme SSD devices which are
available offer for a particular
instance type you can see some some
numbers there
and if you go and list your block
devices you can see the you know the
list of you know the list of the nbme
devices here so I think this is for
genuine dense IO instance and when I
when I do that I can see there are nine
you know and give me SSD devices for
that particular instance now there are
different ways you can put so so one
question we get all the time is ok so if
these devices are not really protected
why should I put an OLTP one through
right on this instance the answer is you
know you you get in this a trade-off
right so you get really low latency you
get high performance and there are ways
you can protect your your data your
devices right so what are those ways now
you could use
a protected raid configuration this is
the this is a recommended way to protect
against an nvme device failure now there
are three predominant raid levels that
can be used for the majority of
workloads in in OCI so what are these
there is raid 1 where is an exact copy
or a mirror of a set of data exists on
two or more disks a classic raid one
mineral pair contains two disks as shown
here right so you can see raid 1 and you
have you know the exact copy or mirrored
their rate n stripes data across
multiple mirrored players as long as one
disk in each mirrored pair is functional
data can be retrieved and then there is
also red six which is block-level
striping with to parity blocks
distributed across all member disks now
remember eight six is more more complex
then then you know raid 1 or 8 10 but
you have flexibility in choosing
whichever raid configuration you want to
implement see if we pick up a particular
particular instance in this case this is
Gen 1 dense i/o instance you can do
different configurations right she can
have a raid 6 across all the 9 SSDs this
is the one I was showing in the earlier
slide you could do for rate and devices
and 5 device root 6 Eddy's you can do
rate and Eddie's across all the devices
and so on and so forth right and the way
you will set up raid is again really
simple you would use something called
m.d. admin utility within linux or any
kind of linux flavor distros you are
using you would go and you know you
would set up these devices and then
you're running a few commands you can
have your raid configuration set up
right so it's really simple to use and
this is our recommended approach if you
really want to use the nbme devices
assess the devices this is our
recommended approach to to go ahead and
use those for any kind of you know
protection protection of your local data
now we have this concept of images which
is basically nothing but a template of a
virtual hard drive that determines the
operating system and other software for
an instance images can be Oracle Croydon
custom or you can here on our image now
for Oracle priority images these are
this this is this table shows a listing
of all the available images and I think
this table is pretty much up to date but
I might be missing a few here so you
have Oracle the next you have sent OS
you have 1 2 and you have Windows Server
and I think there are bunch more Oracle
provided images which might be missing
here and keep in mind that we are
constantly updating this list right so
we are constantly adding more images
here but you know you can bring your own
image you can create a customized image
also so what is a custom image so it's
very much possible to create a custom
image of an instance boot disk and use
it to launch other instances now
typically in enterprises you have this
concept of a golden image right so you
have this golden image which where you
have configured things you have your own
operating system flavor and you you have
own security patches whatnot and you
want every one or most of the people
let's say in a particular project to use
that particular image right so so that's
this same concept here so custom images
when you when you create these the
instances you launch from your custom
image include all the customizations
configurations and software installed
when you when you created the image when
you when you create a custom image from
from a running instance the instance
shuts down and remains unavailable for
several minutes when the process
completes the instance restarts now it's
very important to keep in mind that
custom images only take only take into
consideration your boot disk if they
don't take into consideration any of the
attached I scuzzy lumps what we also
call them as is block volumes and there
are certain restrictions on the size and
you know whether you are using Linux or
Windows and and all that right so you
can look up the documentation but keep
in mind that you don't always have to
use the Oracle provided images you can
create your own custom
which is aspirin now how you launch a
compute instance basically you know
there are a few steps you you use it's
it's a single wizard one page you you
you on on which you you you click
multiple things and you launch your
instance some of the steps are listed
you right so first thing usually choose
and I choose a compartment you specify
your image source but there is a custom
image whether it's an Oracle priority to
image whatnot and then you choose a form
factor virtual machine bare-metal the
shape and remember we have the same ApS
between virtual machines and
environmentally it becomes more evident
here you choose a virtual cloud network
because remember you know from a network
topology you know instance lives within
a vision even though they might live in
two different compartments that's
completely possible from an access
perspective so you choose a VC and you
choose a subnet you launch an instance
if you're launching an Unix Linux
instance you would use a key pair and
then there are a lot of optional
optional capabilities so you could do
something like cloud in it where you
could write a startup script to
initialize your instance you could
determine whether your instances have
public IPS or not and a bunch of more
you know capabilities which will look
into latest slides so this is what the
wizard looks like as I was saying you
would you would first choose a
compartment you would give a name you
would choose an availability domain
remember the instances are specific to
an ad you would use an image a choose an
image source so this can be your own
image this can be article provided image
whatnot right you could you would choose
a shape but it's a virtual machine a
bare-metal machine you and whatever the
option is what are the shapes you would
choose our chill-out network you choose
a subnet and then you know you provide
your SSH keys and that's how you would
spin up an instance
spinning up and Linux instance takes
anywhere from 30 seconds to 45 seconds
of course less than a minute
windows takes around 5 minutes right
this is best-in-class if you go to any
cloud these are the the startup times
you would see in any cloud
it's a really simple really fast process
to boot up an image once the instance is
running you will see a page like this
where you have you know a few few
details on the left-hand side so what
are these things so a few things we will
discuss here and then in subsequent
lectures we have more details for each
of these items so the first two things
to keep in mind the first thing to keep
in mind is there is there is something
called your block volumes right and
these block volumes are high performance
I scuzzy lungs that can be used to
provide persistent and durable storage
so think about your computer had a ha
has a hard disk where you store all the
information for the instances you run in
OCI
you have this concept of block volumes
which are high performance I scuzzy LUNs
where you will where you where you would
store all your data and the idea is
persistence so we make multiple copies
of B's block volumes and even if your
instance dies you can take these block
Walliams and use it with other instances
so you can attach them you can detach
them and that's the whole point of
having block volumes and these are
durable you can even move you know you
can have you can actually do H around
them and subscribe to that's the whole
point of clock columns along with that
there is also you know as we talked
about earlier every instance has more
than one virtual network interface card
and every instance in in OCI whether
it's a bare metal instance or a virtual
machine has at least two Linux and
secondary winix can be used for bring
your own hypervisor network appliances
or if the instance just needs to connect
to multiple machines for whatever you
know you purpose you you are using them
for so so that's that you know this keep
in mind that every instance has at least
two virtual network interface cards and
you can see some of the details here
when you click on attach block volumes
you see a listing of all the block
volumes when you click on attach Phoenix
you see a listing of all the attached
meanings there is also this concept of a
boot volume and a boot volume is created
automatically when you launch a compute
instance you can be catch and keep the
boot volume at instance termination and
you can instantiate and
instance from it so this is typically
how a lot of customers would use boot
volumes where you know they they don't
have to you know they would use an
instance they would customize it and
they would detach it let's even if the
instance is dominated they would use it
and they would use the boot volume to
instantiate more instances from it
there's also something called a serial
console access and if you want to do
some kind of troubleshooting or you know
there's some malfunctioning instances
you could use this serial console access
so again a bunch of options features for
the compute service now the last thing
to keep in mind for our compute instance
is the instance lifecycle so start and
stop a pretty intuitive you start
basically you know start restart and
stopped instance stop is the sickly you
shut down the instance there is
something called reboot which is you
shut down the instance and then you
restart it and then terminate basically
means that you permanently delete
instances that you no longer need when
you terminate an instance your vmix and
volumes including the boot volume your
volumes are ought to be dashed boot
volume is deleted but you have the
ability to preserve it if you don't want
to delete it but your v-necks and
volumes are auto detached and they are
kept and then later only you can delete
them or you can keep it for other
instances there is a important thing to
note here is as far as resource billing
is concerned standard VM and bare metal
instances billing pauses in a step in a
stop state so when you stop an instance
you actually don't pay for the virtual
machine to compute you of course you pay
for the storage if you have let's say
you have block volumes on the boot
volumes but there is no no cost for the
compute instance now in case of high i/o
bare metal instances and dense i/o bare
metal and VM instances billing continues
because they have local storage right so
even though your your your nvme SSD
devices your your compute is stopped
you're still paying for that goes and me
me insist advices so important to keep
in mind so in this lesson we went
through the compute service will
describe the images shapes local storage
we looked at how you create and launch a
compute instance and then we look at
some of the advanced features like
volumes boot volumes virtual network
interface cards and serial console
access and keep in mind we are
constantly adding more features so you
would see many more features come up in
the compute service because again
compute is a core primitive for any
cloud service so that's all for for this
lecture folks thanks for joining me in
this lecture if you have time please
join me in the next module which is
about the block volumes thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
