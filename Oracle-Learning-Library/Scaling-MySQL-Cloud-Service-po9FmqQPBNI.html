scale a MySQL cloud service instance if
my database is performing poorly I might
determine that I need to scale up my
environment to a compute that has more
Oh CPUs and more memory my current
compute shape is listed in the service
overview and the o CPUs and memory for
that computes a par listed under the
service overview and also under
resources to scale up from the menu I
select scale up or down the dialog
reminds me that the service will be
unavailable during the scale up or down
operation from the list of compute chips
I select the next larger option than my
current shape this computes ape has
double the number of 0 CPUs and doubled
the amount of RAM compared to my current
compute shape after selecting the
compute shape I click yes scale up or
down vm the in progress operations
messages at the bottom indicate that the
scale application is in progress i
refresh the page and the number of 0
CPUs and memory are updated to the new
values an icon appears that indicates
that the service is stopping I continue
to refresh the page occasionally after a
few moments the icon changes to indicate
that the service is stopped Oh CPUs and
memory in the service overview appear as
zeros
I continue to refresh the page
occasionally
after a few moments the icon changes to
indicate that the service is starting in
the ocp use and memory in the service
overview appear as their new scaled up
values I continue to refresh the page
occasionally after a few moments the
in-progress operations messages
disappear in the environment is
available displaying the new computer
and the updated values 40 CPUs and
memory I will continue to monitor
performance in the future to determine
if I need to scale up even more or if I
can scale back down to a smaller compute
cape
