the native user interface is enabled by
default with version 11.1
you have the option to configure content
server with 11 1 1 8 content UI in
addition to the native UI the 11 1 1 8
content UI provides a search interface
at the top of the screen which includes
a category filter a snapshot of the
document information complete content
information along with document preview
previous document versions more document
options the notification bar as well as
sort and view options this video
provides an overview of the components
necessary to enable the 11 1 1 8 content
UI the native user interface server
configurations the 11 1 1 8 content UI
server configurations and how to verify
the 11 1 1 8 content UI installation and
configuration
as a component of Oracle Fusion
Middleware WebCenter content surveys
installed in an Oracle WebLogic server
domain the WebLogic server port for
administration server is typically 700 1
and 1 6 200 for web center content in
addition the optional inbound refinery
server should be installed in bound
refinery provides web viewable
renditions of files from the web Center
11 1 1 8 content UI and provides
thumbnailing functionality a second
installation of both WebLogic server and
content server are necessary since the
11 1 1 8 content UI requires a separate
domain our Oracle application
development framework is required on
this second installation in this video
example both the native UI and the 11 1
1 80 content UI reside on a single host
the 11 1 1 8 content you I could live on
a completely separate machine as well
there are several parameters required on
the first installation of content server
these are added from the general
configuration page
three components need to be enabled this
can be done from the content service
advanced component manager page access
control lists also known as ACLs for
short can be configured to control
individual access to individual content
items this level of security is optional
if you choose to enable this option you
can do so on the general configuration
page in order to get the content server
to communicate with the inbound refinery
you will need to create an outgoing
provider this is done from the providers
page from the inbound refinery server
you will need to enable PDF export
converter component and select the
desired primary web viewable rendition
the 11:1 1/8 content UI is built on
Oracle's application development
framework also known as ADF Oracle ADF
11 point one point one point six can be
downloaded from Oracle technology
Network OTN then installed in the second
middleware home the 11 one one eight
content UI artifacts are in a zip file
the zip file is found in the web center
content Oracle home directory of the
first middleware home in the /u CM /
distribution / WCC ADF UI directory
essentially you will create a directory
called WCC ADF at this location ford
slash oracle underscore common slash web
center of the second middleware home and
then unzip to the WCC ADF directory
which is located in the 11 1 1 8 content
UI software content server and the 11 1
1 8 content you I need to access the
same user directory out-of-the-box the
11 1 1 8 content UI requires one web
Center content administrator user to
function this administrator user was
defined in the cred username parameter
during the deployment process
the 11:1 1/8 content UI can be accessed
by typing in the URL typically in the
form of the continuous host :
the continuous port slash WCC if you
cannot connect to the 11:1 1/8 content
UI you can use the health script package
to verify the installation and
configuration and identify any issues
for complete instructions on enabling
the 11:1 1/8 content UI please refer to
the installing and configuring Oracle
WebCenter content guide thank you for
watching for more information please
