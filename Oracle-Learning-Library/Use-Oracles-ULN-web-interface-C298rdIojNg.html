the Oracle unbreakable' Linux Network
this tutorial is the second of a series
of three videos the first video
demonstrated how to register a system
with uln and this second video will
demonstrate using the uln web interface
now it's it's not essential or necessary
really to access the uln web interface
this system has already been registered
when you register it automatically
subscribes you to the latest channels
based upon the version of the OS and the
architecture so I can just run yum
update and update my system without
going to the web interface but I do want
to show you the interface and I do want
to point out the things that you can do
from the interface so the first thing
I'm going to do is open up a browser so
I'll click applications and Firefox web
browser
and once the browser opens I'm going to
maximize the window and the URL is for
you Ln is HTTP colon slash slash Linux
oracle.com
the UL u ln unbreakable linux network
login window appears so you see there's
a sign on button over here on the left
there's a lot of information a lot of
links that you you might find helpful
like getting access how to register how
to buy Oracle Linux support
subscriptions how to switch from Red
Hat's network to you Ln some information
white papers FAQ on you Ln how to create
a new ul end user more information about
Oracle Linux support information about
Oracle's unbreakable enterprise Colonel
ul then documentation case flies so
there's some good information here
so I'm going to click sign on
and it's going to prompt me for my
username and passwords I'll provide that
click sign-in and it takes me to the
unbreakable Linux Network homepage so
you can see there are different tabs
here home channel systems Arana CBE CSI
administration the home page shows me
recently registered systems and you can
see my uln video demo machine that I
just registered there's some information
about recently updated channels more of
those if you want to see more of those
there's information about recently added
channels
all of these are the links you can click
on I'm going to click on my system uln
video demo the top of this window is
some details the name the architecture
the version of the OS I can delete this
system from you all then right here I
can edit any of this information and in
the middle of this window are the
subscribed channels so you can see that
I have been automatically subscribed to
the Yui k release 3 for Oracle Linux 7
x86 latest and also the latest packages
for Oracle Linux 7 down at the bottom is
available errata you can see that the
errata is classified as either an
enhancement a bug fix or security you
can view summary information for each
errata on this page the release date the
number of packages there is a next
button down here that will take you to
the next screen so you can see there's
64 rows of errata that it's available
for my system you have the option to
download all available or rata for this
system you can click on an advisory link
I'll just click one of these and it
gives you more information about the
errata and it also gives you all the
affected packages so you can download up
an individual package if I click on one
of these it'll bring me bring up the
option to save this file or open it with
software install so I'm going to cancel
this I'm going to go back
and I'll scroll back up to subscribe
channels under under the subscribed
channels you have the option to manage
subscriptions so I'll go ahead and click
manage subscriptions and from here you
can see all the available channels for
my particular version of OS and the
architecture so there's a case splice
there's MySQL there's ofed there's
add-ons for Oracle Linux 7 there's
DTrace etc these are the channels that I
have currently subscribed to if I scroll
all the way down you can see all the
available channels and it gives you a
description of those it gives you the
number of packages I'm going to go ahead
and subscribe to this add-on channel so
I'll click add-ons I'll click the arrow
to move it over to subscribe channels
and then I'll click Save subscriptions
it will eventually tell me that my
subscriptions are saved
now I'm going to click the channels tab
and this window appears from here you
can see all the channels that are
available from you all in you can see a
description for each channel number of
packages you can also view channels for
a specific release and architecture so
if I select the drop down menu for
releases I'll select Oracle Linux 7 and
it just displays the o l7 of channels
now o l7 is only available for the x86
architecture so there's there's no no
additional options under under
architecture there's links for the
packages so if I click right here
package packages gives me all the
available packages and there's a search
feature here some of these packages have
descriptions but shows me a hundred and
I can go next to hit the next each one
of these can be downloaded I could I
could click on one of these and it'll
display information about it as well as
a download link it'll give me file list
information and also what packages are
required what it provides obsoletes
conflicts and so forth i click the
download it'll give me a chance to save
it to download the file cancel
and I'm gonna go back alright and back
again we've already seen the systems tab
so I'm gonna click on the errata tab and
this window lists all the errata that
has been published it has a search
feature you can also filter by advisory
type that is just the bugs or just the
enhancements or just this security
errata you can click the release drop
down and view errata for a particular
release of Oracle Linux and Oracle Linux
in Oracle VM so if I click the down
arrow here you'll see there's a Linux 3
Linux 4 5 6 7 and also Oracle VM 2.1 2.2
you can subscribe to mailing lists over
here on the right side so you can scribe
you can subscribe to the enterprise
linux errata mailing list you can also
subscribe to the oracle vm mailing list
i'll just click the enterprise linux so
it gives you some information here
prompts you for your email address pick
a password etc go ahead and go back
again you can click the advisory column
and it'll show you more information
about the errata detail all the affected
packages so forth go back and then the
last tab we'll look at is cv e cv e
stands for common vulnerabilities and
exposures it shows you all the Seavey's
by identifiers the synopsis release date
you can view by year or all years as
this case that we're viewing here
you can click on a CVE identifier to
bring up additional information all the
CVE details at the top there's metrics
in the middle and there's a rata
information down at the bottom so that
is really the web interface and the main
reason you'd want to come in here again
is to subscribe to an additional channel
or unsubscribe from a channel and also
to download packages individual packages
if you've had the need to do that so I'm
going to go ahead and log off of this
I'm back to the uln login page so I'll
go ahead and close my browser
this concludes the second video tutorial
on uln proceed to the third and final
video tutorial in the series which
demonstrates using the yum utility to
install available updates from ula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
