video training series this is a video
recording of Oracle Enterprise Manager
with a focus on integration with
third-party management systems my name
is carolyn lui
and i'm a principal product manager for
Enterprise Manager the program agenda is
as follows we will provide a brief
introduction of the various ways
Enterprise Manager can integrate with
third-party systems then we will go over
in detail what's involved for each
solution Enterprise Manager has a number
of management connectors to integrate
with popular third-party management
systems the management connectors
leverage EMS connector framework in
order to forward event and incident
details to third-party systems besides
the management connectors Enterprise
Manager also has a number of advanced
notification methods when a use case is
more complicated or when there is no
management connector available
Enterprise Manager is highly extensible
and provides a connector framework API
which leverages web service calls to
create and update events or tickets in
third-party systems we also provide an
integration guide for you to build your
own connector should you ever need to
let's start with an overview of
management connectors Enterprise Manager
cloud control provides management
connectors to integrate with the most
popular third-party management systems
there are two types of connectors one is
a service desk connector for our
ticketing system vendors this type of
connector allows eeehm to automatically
create service desk tickets in response
to Enterprise Manager incidents another
type of connector is an event connector
for our event management vendors this
type of connector allows cm2 for events
to third-party management systems of
which the third party system processes
the event payload and decides what to do
with it there are seven connectors
available in me and 13c which is shown
on the right-hand side of the screen for
HP we have connectors available for both
service manager and Operations Manager
so what does an e/m connector allow you
to do in essence it allows you to
forward the events and incidents
detected by Enterprise Manager to an
outside event management or service desk
system it is via this fashion that the
connector allows you to see incidents in
monitoring information spanning across
multiple systems in one location support
processes are streamlined because there
is one help desk system to triage last
but not least having all the relevant
information in one place allows you to
conduct cross-platform root cause
analysis and diagnosis in a more
efficient manner here are the key
features for Service Desk connectors the
third assess connector forwards eeehm
incidents from p.m. to the third-party
ticketing system doing so will trigger
the automatic creation of Service Desk
tickets on the third party system
lifecycle of the incident is
synchronized between a.m. and the third
party system which means ask the
severity changes to the incident
Enterprise Manager the equivalent ticket
is updated as well on the other system
all service desk connectors have a
feature to launch the service desk a
different within Enterprise managers
web-based UI this is what we call an in
context launch of the Service Desk
ticket on the other hand the Enterprise
Manager incident can also be launched
from the third-party ticketing system
because they link to the incident will
be forwarded as part of the payload for
both Service Desk and event connectors
there is default templates made
available from a.m. so you can utilize
these templates to create update and
closed tickets on the third-party
management system these templates can be
modified and customized to suit your
needs you can also create a new custom
template if desired all EMS connectors
have a retry feature which allows for
tolerance from system faults for example
if there was a network hiccup and the
forwarded incident was not acknowledged
by the receiving third party system iam
will retry forwarding of the incident
until an acknowledgment was received or
the retry period has expired when you
enable the retry option you can specify
whether you want to resend a create or
update request if
request sales the first time and specify
the time period after which you want to
abandon the retry enterprise manager
retrace every two minutes until the
request is successful or the retry
interval expires similar to Service Desk
connectors event connectors will forward
event information from a.m. to third
party event management systems life
cycle of the event is synchronized
between a.m. and the third party
management system which means as the
severity changes to the event a
Enterprise Manager the equivalent event
in the third party system is updated as
well similar to Service Desk connectors
the third party event will have a URL
reference to see the fourth event
detailing Enterprise Manager the only
difference is since this is not a ticket
there will not be a ticket ID reference
from Enterprise Manager instead the last
comment field will indicate the event
has been successfully updated on the
external system through the connector
default templates are provided for each
event management system connector to
create an update the event on the third
party system these templates are
customizable and this is where field
mapping can be changed as well as
mentioned previously all of EMS
connectors have a retry feature this
feature ensures delivery via retry for
failed requests which allows for
tolerance from third party system
unavailability this is an overview of
all the connectors available from
Enterprise Manager and the third party
vendor versions supported as always
please check the Enterprise Manager
documentation for updates on the latest
releases supported the documentation
link will be provided at a later slide
this is an example of a ticketing
connector in use in this case it is the
ServiceNow connector what we are looking
at is the Enterprise Manager incident
details which has both the e/m instant
ID and ServiceNow ticket ID behind the
things what's happening is when an event
is detected in Enterprise Manager an
incident is created which triggers the
ServiceNow connector to create a
ticketing service now from Enterprise
Manager the user can click on the
ServiceNow ticket ID which will prompt
the user to login to ServiceNow in order
to see the ticketing details and take
any actions next
theory a similar link is available from
within the service no ticket in order to
launch Enterprise Manager to see the
incident details this is an example of
an event management system connector in
use in this case it is the HP Operations
Manager connector what you see here is
an event detected by Enterprise Manager
where the memory utilization has crossed
the learning threshold this triggers an
event rule to invoke the connector to
forward the event to HP Operations
Manager on the receiving end once HP
operations manager has received the
event they will have an event record
which is viewable from its console
notice that the event details are
identical
including the reported date event class
event name and target type as all of
this information has been forwarded as
is from a.m. if we click on the URL it
will bring us to Enterprise Manager
event details page for more information
about connectors please visit the online
documentation library here you will find
a connector guide for each of our
connectors with each guide detailing the
supported versions installation and
configuration instructions how to work
with the event or ticketing templates
field mapping troubleshooting tips and
much more we have completed the overview
for management connectors we always
recommend to our customers that if there
is a connector available then it is the
best way to integrate with third-party
systems connectors are easy to set up
and configure and does not require a lot
of effort but for more complicated use
cases or when there is no management
connector available for the third-party
system we recommend our customers to
look into advanced notification methods
the next topic on our agenda is advanced
notification methods the Enterprise
Manager we allow our customers to define
their own custom notification methods
custom notification methods require more
upfront work however they are more
flexible to suit your needs
for example you have a ticketing system
with an exposed API that can be called
to create a ticket a custom
vacation method can be created to call
an operating system script to have the
appropriate API
once a custom notification method is
defined whenever an administrator needs
to send alerts to the third-party
ticketing system she simply needs to
invoke the globally available
notification method this is just one
example there are three ways to build a
custom notification method and we will
cover each one of them the first method
is building an OS command script in OS
command script is a script which runs on
the host where the Oracle management
service or OMS resides this script is
run by the user who started the
management service and needs to be
deployed to the host where the OMS lives
how this works is when an event matches
the conditions defined in an event rule
the event rule triggers the custom OS
command script the script gets event
information via environment variables
and this information is then forwarded
to the third party system there are four
steps to configure and OS command script
first you create the script and then you
deploy the script to each OS host then
you create a new OS command from a.m.
and point to the location of the script
which effectively registers it as a new
notification method
lastly you create a new event role and
then assign the OS command ask the
action to take when the event matches
the conditions specified in the role
effectively what this does is allow
Enterprise Manager to trigger the OS
command script each time the event
conditions are matched to the role which
results in the event information being
forwarded to the third party system for
detailed instructions please visit our
online documentation the second method
is an SNMP trap just like the OS command
SNMP trap is another way to forward
event information to a third party
system in order to do this the third
party system must accept incoming SNMP
traps how this works is you will set up
an SNMP trap method on EEM as the sender
and the third party system ask the
receiver when an event matches the
conditions defined in the rule
eeehm notification system invokes the
SNMP trap which forwards the event to
the third party system we support both
snmpv1 and v3 traps
v3 is a more secure protocol and a
support is starting from a m12 104 there
are three simple steps to setup and
snmpv1 trap first you create an SNMP v1
trap notification method from Enterprise
Manager next the notification method is
tested by sending a test trap which can
be achieved by clicking on the test SNMP
trap button from within Enterprise
Manager after verifying the trap is
received the final step is to add the
SNMP trap notification method to an
event rule for more information please
visit our online documentation the
configuration steps for SNMP v3 is very
similar to v1 except there are a couple
of additional steps to provide an
additional layer of security steps two
four and five is the same as snmpv1
steps one and three involve enabling the
OMS to send SNMP traps and defining user
security settings for SNMP trap
notifications there are five steps to
configure an SNMP v3 trap the first step
is to enable the OMS to send such apps
for SNMP v3 the OMS serves as an SNMP
agent which sends traps to the SNMP
manager that is monitoring all SNMP
agents deployed in the network the
second step is to create an SNMP v3
notification method from e/m third
create a user security model entry which
allows you to configure the
authentication and privacy settings of
SNMP v3 messages fourth verify the SNMP
trap is working fine and finally
configure event roles to use the SNMP v3
trap for more information please visit
our online documentation the third
method is a PL sequel procedure a PL
sequel procedure is a script that runs
on the oracle management repository or
OMR similar to the previous
methods when an event matches the event
role it triggers the PL sequel procedure
which then forwards the event to the
third party system there are four steps
to configure a PL sequel procedure first
the PL sequel procedure should be
defined to determine whether it is for
events incidents or problems second the
PL sequel procedure needs to be created
on the e/m repository using the database
account of the repository owners such as
system because this is where it will run
third the PL sequel notification method
needs to be created from emui and
reference to the fully qualified
procedure name which effectively
registers it finally the PL sequel
procedure should be assigned to in
general so it can be triggered when it
event matches the rule conditions for
more information please visit our online
documentation at the link you see below
we have completed the overview for
advanced notification methods advanced
notification methods should be used when
there is no management connector
available for the third party system or
when the use case is more complicated
and complete customization is desired
another option we will discuss is
creating a custom connector Oracle
provides a connector framework which
allows our customers and partners to
build custom connectors using the
extensibility development kit or ebk the
extensibility development kit is a
standalone tool designed to help with
the development of Enterprise Manager
extensions such as plugins or connectors
the process to do this is
well-documented after the custom
connector is developed you would package
and deploy it to e/m then configure it
once that happens the connector will
forward events to third-party systems
when the event matches the rule criteria
not many customers take this route
because there are other options
available and also because this approach
requires some development efforts
customers typically rely on Oracle
partners if they decide to build their
own connector there are four high-level
steps to create a connector as a
first step you need to analyze your
requirements and determine what
functionality to include in the
connector there is an entire section in
the documentation to help determine
which templates to use after that has
been decided then you can define the
connector descriptor file and then
package and deploy the connector to e/m
for more information please visit the
online documentation where you will find
step-by-step instructions along with
examples the accessibility exchange is
an online catalog where you can find
connectors from Oracle partners
third-party vendors and customers this
is a searchable repository of a
collection of connectors plugins and
other artifacts this is also a place
where you can share and promote your own
artifacts in the appendix section we
will cover the concept of rule sets if
you're already familiar with rosettes
then you may skip this section in each
and every one of the advanced
notification methods we mentioned
assigning the notification method to an
event rule an event rule is a rule that
is part of a rule set the Enterprise
Manager there are two types of role sets
they are enterprise and private primary
role sets can be created by anyone and
should be used when an administrator
wants to be notified about something the
only option a private role set can
perform is to send email to the rosette
owner Enterprise role sets require the
create enterprise role set privilege
enterprise role sets should be used to
implement operational practices within
your IT organization such as automating
tasks and notifications an enterprise
role set automates actions related to an
en event incident or problem it allows
creation of an incident based on an
event and provides notification actions
to notify administrators this includes
forwarding of the event to third-party
event management and ticketing systems
as part of a role set you can also
automate operations to manage the
incident workflow such as assigning the
incident to an owner setting priority to
the incident based on a defined set of
conditions or escalate the incident
a rule set can have one or more rules
that apply to a common set of objects
such as targets jobs metric extensions
or self updates and take appropriate
actions to automate the business
processes the roles within a rule set
are executed from top down order and so
are the rule sets themselves so it's
important that you organize rules in
role sets in the order of which you want
them to be evaluated by the EEM rule
engine please take a look at our online
documentation for more information about
rule sets this concludes the video
