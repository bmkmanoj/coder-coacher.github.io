this is job employment for mac OS 10 for
those of you we're looking at the
schedule and wondering well there's this
talk and there's another one that with a
very similar hang free plot this session
form an overview and I'm going to go a
little bit deeper into a bigger ways
that you can distribute grab a native
application on Mac OS 10 so that's
something a little more detail than this
one but this is going to get you good
overview away Oracle is doing the job on
that as far as how it's going native our
taking things over from apple and so on
silver so just give you an idea to give
you an idea what the talks are welcome
so my name is Scott Povich and my
official title is consulting number of
technical staff but really what my main
job is to be the lead for the mac OS Mac
os10 port of job right now that means
focusing on deployment which is like web
start and applets and getting the plane
without working but I also have my hands
in class for job FX little nubbins
opportunity the UW t but I've been
associated with job on Mac since 19-6
back to the Metro works and system eight
and that was Apple for about 28 years
and that way it's modern around with an
Oracle asking come back and when work
was decided to take java back from apple
i was offered the chance to come back
and get it going again
the world so that's very give you papa
such a glam Kris Benson is over here
he's been helping with the tapas the
past couple of weeks this is actually
new to job employment then open the past
and things along to him about the job on
the mac then he's got along to that
experience with the Mac as well so so
those of you wondering about that
horrible to the ceiling with the mat if
they're trying to do the right things
let's get going and give you a give you
know sort of road map but we're going
with these talks this afternoon so have
an interesting it a boy or slight here
don't plan anything about the state and
a contractor assume that if item should
show it to you today will ship you're
going to see this a lot this week so
well by about one thing I'll be able you
mentioned the cycle just go right on so
here show the agenda for today the theme
I want to do for this stock is how it
was versus how it's going to be this is
show against how many of you been doing
java on Mac os10 in some form growth for
a while okay good how many deep in the
WWDC okay how many of you see be given a
talking of the DC at Wisconsin oh ok
always it up those guys I even though
visits this week the same material with
them so again it I've been doing a
little bit outdated too early but uh
this is going to be very similar to talk
to what I've given to the past Alice
conference but it so basically what
we're going to focus on here is how
things were with the apples doing it as
opposed split or what's going to do this
there's going to be some subtle
differences then I'll give you a little
bit of a tour of Java 7 on macros tennis
like and how you're going to get it
going to get and the main thing I want
to focus on this so-called native
applications and since many of you
familiar with job on the macula the
recognizes pretty quickly but those you
need new the background this is going to
be hopefully soon a new deployment
alternative for you all items it will
focus on a Mac in this session and
finally doing it alright so how it was
the Java on Mac was that Apple was the
app has been a licensee actually still
is but the you got it from apple des of
right now it's six update 35 and they've
been doing a pretty good job tracking
the six updates on 10-6 is pre-installed
10-7 and sound on demand install and by
on the man that basically means that
anything that touches Java will prompt
the user to install and if you've been
you know had a macro value since we
probably are familiar with this little
video created a lion or an online but
any time you try to do anything the job
that offers to the salt out six
so one of the big differences between
what Apple did and what split well son
and our Oracle's stunt on other
platforms is that Apple is only ever
stood for JDK when you get an update for
the job and software update you're
getting a bulge anything from Java seen
everything whether you use our
development there as time went on I will
support a multiple JD case and you would
manage those or Java preferences that so
you could you know you're having
problems with the new version you could
go in and Java provinces shut it off and
run your a particular version and so on
and so forth it would also control how
if you're familiar with jnlp protocol
when you did it like 16 are on 6 plus
inaptly we would let you define the word
which those things to be evaluated as
opposed to the strict order that was
sort of hinted at by the genome he's fat
and the other thing now which is the
newer things that Java preferences also
turn off appleton web start some cases
automatic in front of a lot well the
things that are going to change set for
now on because we should give users I'm
making a very important this case for
your users should get java 7 from
downtown if you are a developer you want
to go to OTN or you can see a blue link
so that hit the slides later you'll be
able to get the click on that ninety two
Reitsma down before seven jtk when you
do in salt jdk they also insult area for
you automatically as opposed to windows
were asked you are you
put it and so on but we just put the
latest Jerry on there for you the easier
to develop right now you're at 7-7 on us
and if you'll notice that 77 with
release that came out the same time in
all battles since 76 that's been the
case and we certainly intend to keep
that being the case from now on pro the
match now just another platform so your
minimum OS is 10 74 and I know some
people complain about this you know I'm
long so on snow leopard and like why
can't around snow leopard and for better
for worse there was some things that we
rely on from Apple that they had to make
it only made public and an update like
this in 10 74 and as a result there are
things that we simply rely on we needed
to have a blow as close to us and pen 74
get the AWT to work and so as a result
we got to attend 74 that's unfortunate
but you know the general philosophy when
I was at appleone I think we're going to
try to keep this going as well on the
board what was it we always support
current OS minus one so mountain lion is
a terminal s fine its previous so we're
always going to make our best efforts to
support as some right now 10-7 intent
any of those weekend I'm ten nine thumbs
up I know and that's going to be a
course but you should expect that we
would drop whatever was running on sense
oven at that point don't take that as
gospel if it is found southern is 64-bit
only this is generally not a problem
because all systems today or run 64-bit
the only places problems if you rely on
Chrome which is 32-bit oh we have a way
to support Google
to right now if you use boy toolkit
which if you're familiar with that
already you know I'm talking about but
you'll hear more about that you week but
two points tool is already set up to
basically notify the user that you know
you can salt out of the truant Roger
that looked pretty able to run outlets
so we try to think easy for you to to
the plate in the some of the things
we're going to do that's a slightly
different really on compared to other
platforms is that there's only ever go
to one active Jerry young system one of
the headaches of deployment particularly
on Windows is that it's really easy to
get a lot of old Jerry's letter U system
and if those are unsecured chico VMs you
know that's a problem well the solution
to that is to how only wanted to keep it
up today and so that's what we're going
to start doing on a Mac like to see that
happen on windows as well and make that
promise but that's certainly something
you want to try to do as a developer you
have any number of JT case that's sort
of I actually that's also true now you
can insult just about any six you update
of the JDK they can all pose this time
uses but that's something we're always
going to support mountain seven now is
there only one actor Jerry but of course
fully believe this is going to be
supported you're not supporting and so
on demand right now we know that there
are certain vironment swear you rely on
a certain da police of the JRE if you
are one of those sites please let us
know because we're trying to come up
with uses the beacons we can better
support that but what we are not going
to do is have the ability for an
arbitrary unsigned a blur is a healthy
application to just say hey I need this
really old version of the GRE which
get it installed and we're not going to
do that on that the other big thing and
some green arrow system late but if you
have built a application without those
tools being executed or carve on there
it will not work instead of chops up the
job tools from Apple rely on some
private train routes that are not being
exposed to us and they have no intention
making them publicly available so sort
of as a drunk decision with us and added
we decided that it's time to make a
break from the old pal application
launcher private frameworks and it's
hard starting so if you have something
that you deployed with java 6 you must
be bundle it we're going to talk about
that today and in the next session in
more detail but if we're making that
break sorry Java side so what is the
data is up really this is actually one
of the better good things about work
will taking over the snap is that
basically what you got is a Mac os10
cell model with the JDK inside so if you
install the JDK on windows and you know
that folder structure and all the
libraries of life it's going to be the
same as on Matt the differences that
have got its packaged up in a mac OS 10
model which is basically a folder
structure designed to look like one file
on your desktop we're always going to
install it to library java java virtual
machines really no good change they're
coming up to apples to me but I be one
other distinction is that only the JDK
is that except is successful from the
family and I should be better i do that
is you can only access the
family we do not intend the support
situation where you have an appointment
that requires any way to install GTA
there are situations where it may need
tools a jar but it's okay to bundle up
with your application so there is should
be now unless you're writing a vulgar
tool and you want to rely on Java Sea
that's fine but you're not only in this
situation where you're telling your
users you must consult JT data on my
application so as I mentioned before the
JDK also installs a Jerry and that looks
a little bit different on Mac so what is
that now again it's just another bundle
but in this case we're putting the
library internet Williams this was due
to i want to say i want to say
unfortunate decision which we may change
in the future but but it work it works
right now so basically what we do is we
wrap up the JRE make it look like a plug
for the browser and then the assault
library internet plugins overriding
apples plugging for java 6 and when you
do that now the mac OS 10 is smart
enough to say Oh horrible Javas insult
I'm going to pass everything off to that
so but basically what you do that you
got something that's you gotta run time
that's used for web sorry these are
applets double-click little jars if you
write a native application and your dumb
computer on GRE will use that as well
but basically once you install that it
starts to get these for just about
anything and then user with running
once you that it's and also that's the
other good part is there's no
registration of all like and limits so
once you get that plugin in there you're
ready to go any browser that supports
NPAPI and right now that is Safari
bottle sorry five and six Netscape sorry
firebox beginning on a state like fire
are seven or eight I think we will
support back to the version something
new now is grant also install base of
preference pane dhaval preferences looks
like I'm like those in the control panel
on Windows and make sense to have it in
system preferences on Mac as well so
that is where you'll end up directing
users for so now found a reference the
control panel family speaking if you
have to tell the user to go there sounds
really bad criticism or they have some
special configuration that's unique to
you but for now on that we in system
preferences as opposed to stand on that
and there's going to transition there
and I'll talk about that towards at the
end of the stock so keep that in life
Jerry's are not available from family
one philosophy we thought we had an
apple Emily keep it going here as much
as I can that telling you users open
terminal about after you anything is a
failure on your part of the developer
that that is that's always been the
attic velocity and I think it's a good
one for users as well now maybe you
don't thump horse users type out of that
sharp I've got lots of options for it
too for deployment and sort of i'll try
that on week we want to keep the JRE and
accessible from the family it is well
not impossible to download that very
just just put an ordinary install so if
you go get any jdk and whatever reason
you hit above its like
it's only a lobby against this version
of the JDK I can go back and insult
little jdk not overwrite by Jerry I mean
I can take out that Jake the plug-in and
the JRE so I can duplicate my problem
but you will not accidentally downgrade
your front I'm just by installing
starting to see this visually I mean
this little graphic to show how this is
going to work so here we have library
Java Virtual Machine job VMs you can
happen to install your JD kaise you know
and Java 8 you can get java t2 weekly
builds now and you'll be able to see you
see them populate library java java VMs
and as you notice we don't overwrite
will keep them all unique for you so if
you got some special configuration for
development we're not going to cooperate
just because you get a new your jdk
where users things are a little bit
different the first time you install the
Jerry everything goes into java applet
plug-in that plugin inside it's got a
certain version of the JRE you can
figure that out if you want but
generally if we don't really advertise
it we also get a symlink in libraries
sighs Irish that's preference pains and
that links to the Java control panel
which is hidden inside the run time when
an update comes out we just slide it in
a new plug-in and everything stays the
same we don't have to read you know redo
control panels or anything like that
we're just going to get a new version of
Java applet plug-in to plug in you're
all good to go and so on down line we do
this forever in a day unfortunately I
stopped the three versions of the GRE so
when it comes time to deploy on Mac OS
10 well what can you do well you knew
all the standard things right you can do
applets we've got a web start support
now you're going to hear a in-depth talk
on what's new in deployed for java 7
later this week announcer and
those of you on the Mac for the first
time all of that will be completely
relevant to you as well because all that
stuff is going to be supported out of
the box so for applets and web start as
well you can do a jar if you want to you
know build a executable jar double click
it it'll work well we got some new
platform where choices native
applications in the mac OS when I worked
at Apple we used to call these bundled
apps for bundle java apps now for just
some consistency we're calling the
native applications just to make them a
little bit more distinction well what's
that now a lot of people raise their
hands here so you know I think you know
where you've seen this before but a
bundle that native app is I mean you
know what that is you work with them all
the time it's it's a hard to see the
name down there but it's being the
application app and it's just this one
file that the user drags brown and so
all the contents of your app stay
together it makes it easier to move
around if you want to so all
applications on the Mac are bubbles and
I briefly mentioned but what is that and
it just it's just a folder hierarchy and
in the finder it just looks like 15 it's
going to hide out all the support stuff
you can you know throw in whatever or
junk you need well throw whatever stuff
you need to make your application work
hide it away in the bundle users can
accidentally throw something away or
sale I don't eat that why do I need that
and break your application move around
copy it won't break anything and Here I
am I did a show package contents on text
editors to show you what's what's going
on inside so as you can see we've got it
inside that mac OS folder we've got the
fax
which is basically actual binary that's
going to be run and I'll get sanction
Kaplan description that's a metadata
which basically is what tells the finder
the name of the application if you
change the language that you're running
what you know the different language
that will be used and put let's get some
information to the system so it can find
your application later the executable
right because I said that that's like
the actual native Native object code
that starts up your app and then all the
localisation so all the strings for
different languages you put your icons
in there to a screen layouts and so on
so when you build route when you build
one of these for the Mac but what do you
have to do well you're going to provide
a few things you're going to provide
your jar files all the stuff that goes
into your application use whatever tool
you want eclipse NetBeans so I don't
care we don't care just make it into an
executable with a defined main and a
cool icon you have those two things
you're ready to go I mean you're in need
some metadata the information put in
that metadata we'll talk a little bit
more of that in the next session but
we're going to generate that for you
we're going to generate that metadata we
got this launcher stop that's pretty
generic and knows how to start off the
vm as you can see the runtime is
included inside your bundle this is
actually something that we're going to
talk about that a little bit more in a
later slide but this is something new
that if you're used to that how we how
apps are built for job on a Mac that's
actually knew you can actually include a
specific JRE that you want in your
application and we'll get to why that's
important here in a little bit so how do
you build one of these things well we've
got javafx packager
which is a standard tool that comes with
the JDK now we got out bundler which is
a open source project i'll talk about in
just a moment and we got some ant tasks
that are part of the JavaFX that you can
use if van is a part of your building
system so FX packager comes with the JDK
it was originally written as a nice
solution for wrapping up your code in
for web starter an applet basically what
you would tell it okay here's my
applicator here's my main and it would
generate HTML and the JLP for you and if
you've ever done webstart deployment
your development you know that Pam
coding gnop is pain in the neck and sun
we really don't want to be doing it was
originally geared towards java effects
is one nice thing about FX is that there
isn't a huge distinction between an
applet and application it's all america
employed well FX packager now in later
releases now also generates these native
apps for you it's basically another
thing that gets generated as part of the
of your build process the new thing
coming is that currently at all it only
handles a valve FX but in a upcoming
release hopefully very soon you can also
work with swing if you're not ready to
adopt FX but your existing swing or not
even on GUI apps can be packaged up at
FX packager it works as a samuel otoole
your thoughts on ant library but FX
packager basically uses that the ant
library in the background to do its work
okay what's at bundler I'm going to
mention that for completeness appeler is
basically the open source foundation on
which we build FX packager and it's open
source and java net right now all I can
do is build native apps for Wes 10 on OS
10 only whereas FX packager can generate
a mac format that app it can also do the
xes and msi is on windows as well
believe it supports a couple of Linux
flavors as well at bundler is an ant
library does not support FX that's the
main thing that mean addition that we
put into FX packager but because it's
open we support we're happy to take some
contributions and i'll have a link to
the project at the end of this talk if
you want to look into that but the other
thing you can do is you can take a look
at the native code that actually
launches the vm so you can understand
what's going on so i'm going to show you
a very quick demonstration of FX
packager and what I've got over here is
a pretty bare-bones hello world app
that's I think it just shows up window
and got to manifest so we can turn into
a jar and the script
pretty simple here
can you see that or so trying to make a
little bit bigger not terribly important
for this particular demo basically we
have right here we have the FX packager
command and a big pile of the arguments
passed to it and one of these is the
stash native and that is what's going to
generate the f course i also give us a
disk image so i'll go over here and
we'll actually do it
okay as you can see it's cranking away
in the background there we had a jar
file in the class well the raw class
files I've got turned into the jar now
we're creating our appt bundle and we
are also creating a disk image and
you're going to see a flash here in just
a moment as you see the disk image we
created
so there's our doubt and we're turning
it into a disk image with a nice you
know when one drag install sort of the
new way to be doing things for apps on
that so there we go we've got our HTML
and web start so this is an apple based
deployment of this app and here are my
bundles I've got my dot app and I've got
a disk image with that bat out so one
command I've got three deployment
choices right there as you can see it
shows up here in the dock with the right
name and everything so you know to the
user this is just yet another man
captain they run all in every day sure
and
package contents here
so there's my jar pile there's metadata
we need there's a little stuff that's
the actual native code that basically
it's jni that starts 2pm and sends your
main apple to hear your main class as
the startup plugins that has a jdk it's
got a it says she 8k because that's what
we're running against you I don't show
it here for simplicity but a feature of
FX packager in coming up and say you'll
be able to pick any GRE that you want
not just the one that you're running so
if your want to tie to JRE you can do
that but inside this is the absolute
bare minimum to run a vm so there's no
command line tools there's no deploy
bits there's no you know no the jars for
building FX and anything but the
absolute minimum i need to run an app
which is the dye ellipse and the jars
and lasts well as resources you know we
don't have a localization here but just
a basic icns and this
149 Meg part of that is because in this
version of BM FX builds both 32 and
64-bit and it doesn't need to so that'll
cut some cut some heft out of it as well
what's up Jerry only yeah yeah well okay
it so a jdk has it has a Jerry inside of
it we just don't copy in the jdk bits
correct
that's big benefit of doing it this way
so now I hope I don't have to ask the
user to install a Jerry just to get
their app okay one more question I want
to keep going yep and will not be
effective when the user updates to the
system theory alright so let's go into
the Java mailbag for some questions that
we get asked now this transition and a
common question we get is well I've
installed the jury but I Ron I don't
know netbeans not happiness but like
idea Eclipse want something like that
and asked me to run the to install Java
what's going on well remember what I
said before that your applications bills
or Devils tools cannot use the Java 7
Jerry and as of this point you know of
course nobody's had a chance to do that
so all current tools are currently going
to want to pull it in java 6 now eclipse
any ID that you want can use the jdk so
you can install the JDK and tell these
until your IDE hey target Java 7 or use
its compiler and so on but to run it
right now it still has to use Java 6
until until until the IDN developers and
other and other apps have a chance to
get around the bundling or adopting
native apps the new native app support
you do have you must repackage wrap we
would prefer that you bundle the JRE for
a long time I think we were saying that
you know you have to do this this is no
we're not going to support anything else
there was a significant pushback and I
think rightly so that basically says
that you know that's that's not really
realistic if I have a small app I her a
pretty huge overhead hit just to just to
deploy application so
the launcher stuff will look in the
shared look in the system JRE location
and we'll use that if you didn't bundle
a jerry for yourself so you have an
option to not do that will you package
but the launcher sub that we have knows
to look in look look inside the bundle
for Jerry you don't find one look in the
system one in library internet plugins
we don't find one there tell the user
now now you got to go get job and we
have a link to Joe calm for the one that
happens you'll notice I see you have
this green arrow again not acceptable
for the USX App Store bundle apps native
packaging and bundling a GRE inside the
app is what you must do if you want to
put something in the OS and apps core
that's what we're going to talk about in
depth in their necks talk but that's
actually the that was actually the
driving impetus for for improving the
native applications supporting is that
in the usn App Store and presumably
other app stores that like the windows 8
store or whatever other third party
stores we can think of that relying on a
third-party download is not going to be
allowed so you here well you can't put
java apps in the Western App Store well
that's not true what you cannot do is
put an app that relies on the user to
install java 6 which is a third-party
insult so that's not allowed but you are
allowed to include a java runtime on
your out and we've actually done that
for reasons i won't get into it was put
in i had to take it out right away but
we will get it back there but it had
nothing to do with the back of his job
so you can do this
sort of a summary here of so this chart
this table here is sort of designed to
you know give me one quick look at your
possibilities for deployment and what
what it's going to use when you do that
so if you use scripts or young custom
launcher it is possible to put the shell
script in an application and have it run
that way in that case we well we don't
know what you're going to end up using
if you're going to use your own JRE or
under JDK I say please don't do this but
this this is relying on a jdk to be
there too for your application around we
really don't want that the next step up
and act and the other thing too is that
this survey evolutionary charge of
people the next step what was the Apple
watch sure which is basically a java 6
based tools it will not use the JDK will
not use the GRE but it will use a jdk in
specifically apples jdk for japanese jdk
six your next choice which is better
than the previous tube is use oracle
launcher and unbundling tools with no
bundle Jerry so it will use a JRE it
will use the system JRE it will not use
the JDK and in which they are evil we
use well use the system one if it's
insulting and finally your best choice
would be the Oracle launcher with the
bundle charity which will not use a
system jury or the JDK it's going to use
the one that you include so you know
hopefully you can refer to this when
somebody asks you like well what are we
going to do for deployment on the mac
and you can you know hang up the slide
and say put a big circle around the
bottom one and say well we weren't try
to do this hopefully help keep you the
option straight in your head to view
when you leave here today go back and
try to actually do this so some more
questions and these two are related so I
put them in the same slide so I
installed the GRE so why do I still see
java 6 fine type javed s version or
something related very similar i
installed the JDK for java 7 but Java
dash versions give me something else do
I have to set Java home well java home
and setting a path is a windows ism
basically and so the short answer is no
you don't have to set Java home for the
first one well remember what I said I
said when you install the JRE that's not
available from the command line you have
to install the JDK to see java 7 on the
command now this chart is designed to
help reinforce great would've what we've
been saying is that if you want to do
something on the command line then you
need to be using either javis if you
need to be using a java jdk if you want
to anything else you should be relying
on the JRE you're having your users your
language airy it sounds like I'm
repeating myself and I am but this is
fundamentally different than what you've
been used to this point from Apple so
I'm trying to drive it home and you know
hopefully he will repeat it as a mantra
when you when you start doing your own
development you do not have to set Java
home you can set it there are some tools
that that like aunt for example that
want it there is a command line item
called user live exec you slash user
slash live exact / Java underscore home
that will tell you what the current
default version of Java it is they'll
also tell you what versions of Java are
available to you so if you haven't try
that out before you know and give it a
try and play around with it
so related to all that we've got this
thing job of preferences app it's an
applications utilities and as I
mentioned this controls which JDK that
would what the plug-in was using control
the JDK search order it also governs the
JDK that's and used by the command line
tools so if you run that you know that
the JDK at the top of the list is what
you get when you type Java dash version
Java Sea in Syria well in an upcoming
version from update from Apple which I
hopefully within the next month or two
but I can't promise that that app is
going away completely from now on the
latest JDK installed will always be used
by default if you want to use an over
JDK you can set up java home you just
use Java home and a pick another version
if that's which it that's important for
your needs but you know don't rely on
Java preference to stop being there and
instead for everything that you would
have done there you would go to the
control system preferences and run the
job of control panel from there that's a
big thing piss you know common question
I get is well I installed it and you
know i installed java 7 but you know how
do i do all these things that i could do
in java 6 it's like well you we're
making a cut over and the day is coming
when you will not be able to run java 64
applets or web start at all so try to
internalize this and you know start
planning ahead because it's going to
happen in the next within the next year
so sum up here seven really is a new
beginning for job I mean now that
Oracle's taking it over we're doing some
things differently than Apple did mainly
for consistency but mainly because you
know we're not part of the OS anymore
Java is its own third party in Seoul now
and that requires some changes
if you're into applets and web start for
your deployment needs there are a lot of
cool things that you can do now now that
we're based on Java 7 and sharing a lot
more code that we did in the past there
are lots of sessions as there are other
sessions this week and I'll have links
to them but you know you want to learn
about that don't rely on the mix jdk JRE
behavior of Apple 6 there is a distinct
split now of a jdk in a Jerry and try to
remember jdk for developers Jerry for
end users that's true on all platforms
but it's really important now on a mac
and finally hopefully you'll start to
taking the time to repackage whatever
you've been distributing for java 7 with
our with our new bundling tools and some
resources real quick we have one more
top this afternoon about deployment on
mac OS 10 we'll take a break and come
back in an hour and i'll go more in
depth on native applications we have the
in-depth talk on java deployment this
thursday and fortunately they're all in
the same room just have to remember the
times it's kind of hard to find times
and sessions this here so and find
that's where you go if you want to learn
about app longer which is the
open-source part of FX package so i will
leave that slide there and we'll just go
to QA start right here
so today app bundler will take care of
non FX and FX packager is in it's part
of what we ship now but it can only
handle FX and akin to native apps so
unfortunately every what I've been
talking to you about a perfect packager
is not and what we ship right now it
will come very soon we will start right
I'm gonna have to answer that later
because I don't know the first thing is
that you're talking about cradle but
it's something we can we type out later
look into it
so to create the dot app you do not need
you can do that on any platform because
it's just assembling a bunch of files
together and it is possible to do to
basically turn that into a zip and then
put it where you can't make a dmg on any
other platform other than the mac at
least not that i'm aware of our goal is
to be able to do to build from any
platform for any platform so in theory
you should be able to be on the mac and
build for Windows Linux Mac all at one
time or if you're on lenox build for
linux mac windows a long time that may
be an unrealistic goal we don't know yet
but that's what we want to try to do
Yeah right yes to if you want to build a
dmg for example you have to have apples
tools to do it
okay so yes it will up it will over it
will swap out the Jerry when you want to
go back you just go in the library
internet plugins delete the applet java
applet plug-in that plugin and install
the old one you'll be prompted to update
it but you don't have to accept the
update right here so the specifics on a
group talked to the 2d and swing teams
but most of them yes I believe we do
already okay uh some do some dope I
can't tell you right now which do know i
know that some do but i but i would
there's a meet the swing team tomorrow
it tomorrow afternoon we're bringing up
time and back
so today you would use a bundler if your
own if you're still touring the awt and
swing if you're targeting javafx then
you and what I actually showed you was
not yet released and it's going to come
hopefully very soon but right now your
best choice would be up it would be a
bummer break and very fun I'll
yeah as long as the jar has like a if
you would do like Java dash jar and then
the jar file yeah you can easily turn
that into a devil and to break behind
you actually we got a contribution to
make a maven plugin out of a polymer and
I forget where that is because it was in
like within the last week or two that we
got the actual actors but if it hasn't
happened yet it will be soon
example
seven
and
as I recall javafx can handle full
screen windows I don't know that swing I
don't know that an awt swing window can
do that I don't know that often
well that's true yeah but I think you're
going to see those advancements in FX
job FX you will be more likely to see
those in javafx
great
that is a tough question actually yeah
it is is Oracle's does Oracle intend to
support more native looking applications
is that yeah so how much native
integration are you ever going to see
right so okay here's what I do know is
going on is that we are we are trying to
make FX more how am I trying to push I
say this right now we've sort of got
this bolted on thing for getting at
things like the Apple menu and things
like that we are working on the cleaner
API and FX so it will just be part of
the platform you don't have to do
special casing for platform also for
things like the system menu bar that's
also in FX as well as far as a WT and
swing there's not going to be a ton of
new innovation there but I think we're
going to try to do the best we can to
carry over what we have from Apple as
far as like specific things you want to
see I mean the standard op the standard
thing I can say is file bugs and just
make sure that you know I had this thing
an apple in Jerry 6 where'd it go in jdk
so that's the best thing I can suggest
all the way back nope that's you yeah
so it's to you in the pool if the
answer today that I'm supposed to tell
you said if you want to do Java on iOS
ADF mobile was released today with
support for deploying to iOS four FX on
mobile Oracle continues to watch the
market and will release future
implementations as they see fit
the only way to deploy in iOS right now
is objective c the only way to deploy it
to ship an application for iOS is via
objective-c well okay there are other
there are no java-based FX solutions
right now for iOS that's probably the
better way to say because you can do
other things in objective-c but you
can't do FX right now mmm breaker
okay actually the guy main guy who works
on FX package or walked in about 10
minutes into the talk so he would be the
perfect person asked specifically about
that it is possible to put in
third-party jars as opposed to just what
you just what you wrote and netbeans
produced I believe you have to go into
the ant task use the aunt asked version
of FX packager to do that because you're
pulling in additional jars I don't know
how to do that top my head but I think
we can we can figure it out for you it
is possible to do it I can't tell you
right now exactly how they're good okay
two more not yet well okay it is
available but he can't produce new two
bundles yet so that the FX packager we
have right now will produce webstart and
applet deployment for you but
unfortunately not yet with the native
app name can't give you a date but soon
yes yes absolutely hit one
yes
ADF oracle application development
framework I think it's the full name of
it yes
so there is a very small there's a very
small profile vm that it's like an
embedded scale vm man was a very small
footprint and that's probably all i want
to say about right now ok ok thanks very
much and hopefully you'll come back in
an hour and see our next session on
further native apps in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
