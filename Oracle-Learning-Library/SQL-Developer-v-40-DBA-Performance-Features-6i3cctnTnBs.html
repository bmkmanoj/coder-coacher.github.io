demonstration in this demo I'll be
showing you the DBA performance feature
I'm using sequel developer version 4.0

collects statistics to help you tune
your database and diagnose any
performance issues in the performance
feature which we've added to the DBA
navigator this is where you can create
objects and reports on those statistics
if this is your first time accessing the
DBA navigator you'll need to create a
connection I'm going to connect to my
system user and here you have access to
all the DBA related features so we've
added in the performance feature this
feature is part of the Oracle diagnostic
packs so you want to make sure you have
a license before using it here you can
take a look at all your snapshots at

specific time period when you expand it
on the tree you'll notice that there's a
filter next to it that just means that
the most current 10 are displayed just
click on one and you can take a look at
the details or will generates a snapshot
for every hour and retains it for 8 days
but at any time you can go ahead and
just create a snapshot if you want to
take a look at all the snapshots you can
review it in the report similar to our
other reports you can do a sort and you
can sort by all the adv
and findings you can also do a filter
and you can drill down into the report
to get more detail

lines and you can create a baseline so
bass line is just a set of snapshots
here I'll create a baseline I'll select
a start and end period and before you

sequel

report on a regular basis you can create
a baseline template here you can view
the addm reports just double click on
any of you reports to drill down into
more detail here's the summary and the
findings and you can delete or change
the expiration of this report
