welcome to the Oracle Enterprise Manager
Cloud Control 12c cloud management demos
testing as a service testing as a
service is a self-service solution for
applications testing it is integrated
into the Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c
and it is designed to reduce the testing
times and therefore the applications
testing costs it is a private cloud
solution that automates and simplifies
the testing process and to end and
allows applications to be rolled out
into production much faster whether this
is a first release and an upgrade or
simply a patch application along with
the other cloud functionality testing as
a service is built on the Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c platform and
delivers its functionality via the
virtualization and self-service
application plugins it also includes the
option to use the chargeback
functionality let's take a look at some
terminology and concept testing as a
service introduces three different types
of administrators defined an enterprise
manager a test designer develops test
script scenarios in various test
environments a test designer has
built-in am task designer role and
creates test assets and test environment
the assets are prepackaged test
scenarios saved in the software library
and built using the Oracle application
testing suite while test environments
are based on the oracle assemblies and
are also saved in the software library a
test administrator defines the access to
the testing framework it has a built in
EMS si administrator role and can grant
access to test the assets and
environment a test admin also defines
quotas to be used during testing and
evaluates chargeback usage and costs if
this is set up in your environment
a test user is the consumer of
everything set up in a TAS environment
it has an m SS a user role and creates
test trials and analyzes the test
results before we begin this
demonstration notice the customizable
fields on the self-service application
log in you can add your own custom logos
and tag lines
let's begin by logging in as the
Enterprise Manager super administrator
and browse the setup for our environment
the enterprise manager administrators
are defined under set up security
administrators note that the super
administrator has set up procreate Lions
for each testing as a service role a
test administrator a test designer and a
test user
logging in is the cloud administrator we
can take a look at how the cloud
environment was set up
the cloud infrastructure is set up with
an Oracle Virtual Machine Manager one
zone and one pool where the Oracle
virtual server resides these are all
required elements to build a testing
environment in addition in the software
library the test designer has created
folders to store assemblies and
deployment plans
note also the privileges required on the
Virtual Machine Manager take a look at
our VM the tasks administrator designer
and users have you privileges on the vm
the designer and test user also have
operator privileges on a zone
now that all the basic infrastructure is
set up let's log in as a task
administrator and begin the setup for
our test environment
first we create a type of application we
want to test navigate to set up cloud
testing and select to add an application
type this demo we will set up an
environment and run a test for a medical
records application this is the
application we have all the scripts and
environments defined for and we will be
able to simulate a production
environment with various virtual users
click Add
a test administrator also needs to
register a known test driver that will
generate a workload against a test
system test drivers are test type
specific they can be either an Oracle
load testing drive or a custom for our
demo we select a register an Oracle load
testing driver this driver is based on a
predefined deployment plan saved in the
software library so we search for one we
select it and then we registered a
driver
at this time we can also define the
appropriate kodys for the various test
users we select quotas create select the
user role you're specifying this quota
for in this case the task SS a role
highlight it and select then you enter
quotas for the number of virtual
machines this user can deploy a number
of hardware resources quotas such as the
CPUs the amount of memory and storage
and then a test driver quota which is
the number of virtual users then select
create
the test designer has to define a few
more elements for our setup let's login
as the test designer
let's take another quick look at the
software library the designer typically
defines test environment in the form of
assemblies in our software library
indeed there are a couple of assemblies
that are defined they define a test
environment for our sample application
and a test driver environment as well
essentially to create a test environment
you must create a deployment plan and to
create a deployment plam you start by
simulating a deployment on a cloud zone
you select the image the assembly this
will be based on in our case the medical
records application assembly we give the
ones deployed instance a name click Next
you can defined a network or leave it as
specified and in our case this is an
assembly that requires an agent to be
pushed once it's configured it will be a
Linux environment we give it a password
this is for the operating system
password click Next and let's take a
look at what's defined within the
assembly there is product configuration
information most of it is not
configurable it's already predefined if
we look inside the guest VM there's
additional configuration there under the
guest VM configuration review the
different options and notice that
there's a root password that is required
so we enter that
next we take a look at the network
interfaces in this case it's already
defined with the DHCP configuration you
can edit that if needed there's also
another option of selecting a network
profile which we've had we have defined
in this cloud environment you can select
ok review the rest of the configuration
and click Next and at this point instead
of deploying the assembly you can select
to save it as a plan in the folder that
was already created in a software
library and you give it a name this will
be your test environment for the medical
records application
all the test entities must be defined
within the task framework by that
navigating to the enterprise menu we
select cloud testing home the designer
defines the test assets which are the
actions to be executed for a specific
workload and the environments these are
executed against a test environment
defines the entire application stack and
gives the tester control over some
parameters while a test asset defines
the stack that the application will run
on but with no test user control let's
take a look at how these are created we
select to create a test asset
specifically an Oracle load testing
asset I have already created one that i
will use in my demo but here's how i
created it you give it a name optionally
you can give it a description it is of
the application type that I've created
earlier the medical records application
and I specify the scenario a script that
encapsulates the scenarios for testing
all the test automation scripts are
basically encapsulated into this file we
selected and then we select the
configurable parameters parameters we
want to allow the test user to configure
at test time then we select submit and
that creates an Oracle load testing
asset to create a test environment you
select the test environment let's select
to create one I've already created one
that i will use for the demo but here's
how i created it i gave it a name
optionally a description
it is of the application type I've
created which is the medical records
application and it's based on a
deployment plan and it is a deployment
plan we've created earlier and saved
into the library we select that
deployment plan test environment for the
medical application medical records
application and because it also defines
a web application within this assembly
deployment plan we select that web
application from the menu and click okay
this is how an environment is created
and these are now available to be
published for the test consumers
all the test elements created must be
made available to the test users by the
test administrator let's log in as one
in order to publish the test components
you select the setup cloud testing menu
and everything that a designer has
defined is available for publishing
these could be asset test environment or
test drivers let's select to publish an
asset you simply select it and we can
continue with selecting a test
environment select and finally we select
the test driver one created earlier
select and all these will be published
to the roles that we define at the
bottom of this screen in our case it
will be a task SS a role that we publish
to and simply sick publish this creates
all these elements that are available to
test users
we are now ready to log in as a task
user and create a test and view its
results
logging in as a task user you're
presented with the infrastructure cloud
self-service portal under my tests you
have a list of all the tests you have
created in our case no tests have been
created just yet so let's go ahead and
create one create Oracle load testing we
get the test a name and a description
optionally the test will be based on the
Oracle on an Oracle no testing asset an
asset that was published to us we
selected note all the details about the
tests are encapsulated here on the
script we select a test environment from
our library this is again an environment
that was specifically designed for the
testing of this application it was
published to us it's available to us we
selected next note that you can select
to have the environment URLs mapped to
the assembly or you can define your own
mappings this way you do not have to
modify your test script when a new
environment is provisioned they
automatically get updated let's keep the
URLs the same in this case we select a
test driver and click OK and a test is
now created a test can have multiple
trials so you can adjust the different
parameters so next we create a trial for
this test we give it a name description
optionally this trial will be creating a
test instance we'll deploying this
instance and running the application in
it we give it a password continue we can
adjust any of the parameters for each
trial in this case let's adjust the
virtual users
and the number of iterations continued
it also creates a test instance instance
for the test driver we give that a
password and a trial can be scheduled to
run later or immediately let's just run
it immediately by clicking okay and
there there's your trial that's been
scheduled
a few tests and trials later let's take
a look at our environment as a test user
let's review the information under each
tab the my library tab displays all the
assets and environments available for
this user note our application test
environment and under assets the Oracle
load testing asset if the chargeback
functionality was enabled the chargeback
tab would have all its details the my
deployments displays all instances
created for all the tests this user has
run test driver environment and
application testing environment in our
case under my tests you can review all
the tests that were run and their
associated trials let's select one of
the tests and drill down into the
details of a completed trial select the
test drill down into the trial
the under the summary tab you can see a
roll up of all the tests results in
tabular form the test environment tab
has details about the environments
created or used for this particular
trial the configuration tab has the
details of all the configurable
parameters and there are values for this
particular trial and finally under
performance we can review all the
metrics collected during this trial you
can scroll horizontally into your test
time window you can adjust the scale if
needed and review all the metrics data
which is presented in a visual form and
two dimensional graphs this way you can
compare metrics and correlate them for
example if assessing a bottleneck there
are three types of Oracle load testing
metrics collected their user metrics
such as the hits per second or
transactions per second and so on there
are target metrics as well collected by
a enterprise manager because the
application components are treated as
regular discovered targets there are
four metrics for the entire stacks are
collected for example for web server or
database or host and so on in addition
database Diagnostics a BBM and a WR
reports can be reviewed based on the
time of the test there's also a facility
for comparing the reports from any two
trials of the same test this concludes
our demonstration thank you for watching
