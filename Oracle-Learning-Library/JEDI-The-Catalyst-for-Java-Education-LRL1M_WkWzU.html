of the Philippines Java R&amp;amp;D center I i
managed to that center and it's my I
think it's my fifth java one here and
third time to talk about the Jedi
project and it's been a while since we
started this project many things have
happened the transition from Sun to
Oracle was a bit of a challenge for us
and so I'm going to share with you these
experiences that you've had the reason
why I asked for a bit of a survey and
where you come from because we have this
deployed in different areas of the world
and we're continually looking for
partnership opportunities if this is
something that interests you we can we
can talk about it more after the session
for some you know you might just be
curious what because the title I would
say is a bit catchy but we're not trying
to brag really we just want to share our
experience and pretty much this title
here catalyst for java education is
something that was coined by one of the
organizations that we worked with so i
thought of using that as a title for
this session and fortunately we got
approved and so we're here right so we
also tried to think of a catchy name for
the project so we thought of Jedi no I'm
not Darth Vader nor do I have any any
plans to be a Jedi Master but we hope
that we'd be able to
impart the force and everyone who uses
this so Jedi is is an open source java
instruction project that we started six
seven years ago in this is in
partnership with the University and son
initially and now with oracle this is
driven by the community the growth that
we've had the past seven years is really
because of the partnerships with built
through different java user groups
through different companies that have
adopted this and of course the
universities that have integrated this
into their curriculum right so this was
lunch in 2005 in the Philippines
everyone has heard of the Philippines
Ricky you kind of know where it is it's
just below Taiwan and we've got 7,000
sorry 1107 islands depends if it's high
tide or low tide but we that is the that
is the composition of the country and
that plays a significant role in in how
we implemented this and I'm going to
share I'm going to go back to that in a
bit alright so the motivation for
starting Jedi was back in 2002 we
created so coming from the University of
the Philippines it's the state
university i would say it's the state
university because a lot of the other
state universities can look up to us for
technology so our computer science
program is something that is replicated
in other state university so the
motivation for that was
he started to do trainings for teachers
across the country we would go to
different islands okay not all 1000 plus
islands but a significant number of
violence and we would teach Java to them
with the hope of these teachers teaching
Java in their in their curriculum now we
would say it was successful because we
were able to reach a lot of teachers but
two years after that in 2004 we came
back and said okay so tell us what
happened and a lot of them said you know
the challenge for us is that we're not
able to deliver it properly or the way
we want to because we don't have the
right materials to deliver it we know we
know the technology that's not the
question the question is how are going
to be how are we going to piece
everything together if you remember the
Sun education of course before is it SL
25 I can't remember the exact code now
yeah that's right so they use that those
materials which of course as a teacher
is not sufficient because you you needed
more than what's in there and it it it's
really for I would say more a different
crowd a different audience so so we
thought of something to enhance that
training program that we had and we note
the Sun and we asked for you know just
one course to try to deploy will create
one course just specifically for the
teachers and help them in delivering
this to their students hey but son huh
when when son heard this they had other
plans they wanted pen and he said hold
on no doubt we just won we just want one
for the basic course and said no we see
the value of this one because we've
heard
based on their Sun tech days feedback
when they travel across the globe that
it is a common problem for for teachers
and students so we started with three
the first year and it was it was well
received a lot of teachers started using
it and we did trainings for them and I'm
going to talk about that in a little bit
now teachers would ask us okay so why
Jedi why why would we go for your course
this is something that you built with
son and what value can we get out of it
right so we tell them that we follow the
ACM suggested curriculum so we go after
that and we also have an industry focus
group that looks after the contents of
the course one of the challenges is that
the examples that are normally drawn up
in classroom setting is it's not real
world hey and we wanted to get real
world examples from the industry and
integrated into the curriculum so we had
a focus group industry focus group that
provided that feedback also we provided
training opportunities so we did teacher
training but the type of training we had
was it was one week but only two days
was allotted for the actual technical
training the three days was focused on
how to deliver it right and that was the
that was the trend ever since so all our
trainings are done that way employment
opportunities of course these people
from industry that we work with said
okay we know
quality of materials that you have and
we know that you know these universities
and colleges are using your materials so
if we were going to hire we would
probably choose one that has undergone
the Jedi training we have a suite of
materials rather than someone who has I
know just done some jeddak that's are in
Java training but not Jedi endorsed so
that was the that was the come on for
them because eventually when they come
out of the University you want them to
be employed at the same time companies
were having a hard time looking for good
developers so they were banking on that
so let me talk more about what we have
packaged in Jedi so we have the
teacher's manual hey and there's a
student's manual of course the answers
to all the questions are in via
teacher's manual and we have teaching
slides if that's something that we try
to standardize across all the courses we
want to ensure that the slides can be
taught standalone nice we include notes
on that we have sample exams this one is
big any sample exams and exercises what
normally happens is well it depends on
the teacher I'm not generalizing but you
know you can to rehash here your
materials right and you know there's
always a brilliant student who would
create an answer key for that and pass
it on to two others you want to avoid
that you wish they wouldn't do that but
you know some might do it so that is one
another is you always want to provide
relevant examples they up-to-date
example so we do have those sample exams
and exercises available we also get
reference materials from from Sun Oracle
right and they also provide Oracle
provides the development tool so for the
examples this can of course this can you
can use any IDE that you want but our
screenshots contain NetBeans samples
obviously because they had the steak on
it and we didn't have a problem with
that as long as we were able to show how
things work then we're fine with that so
I don't know this might be a little too
small but these are the courses that we
currently have you want to work harder
on other topics in terms of updates
right the past two years has been I
would say a bit of a stall everyone was
trying to find their way into the Oracle
organization and so are we as a partner
but I'm glad to say that we are on the
right track now and we've established a
stronger ties now with Oracle especially
with the with the clarity of roles that
has happened the past two years excuse
me so we're also in the process of
creating new courses these courses that
we rebuilt our based on feedback from
industry that's one they may want to see
certain courses or topics included also
we have updates coming from article so
we take that into consideration right
and of course we look at the ACM
curriculum if there's something that we
can built into it yep
sorry good question so each course is
good for a semester because that is the
timetable or universities but if you
plan to take this into your organization
then I can't remember the hours I'm
sorry for that but we just divide so if
it's a semester would be Jim can you can
you help me with this because i cannot i
cannot remember the 14 weeks and then
that's three hours a week so that would
be the duration for these courses now
for some of the horses that we have
there we have allotted extra weeks so
instead of 14 weeks we have 16 but we
put an asterisk and say these are what
they call this non-essential but if you
want to because because some schools
have 16 weeks right so they can use 16
if you're 14 then you can take off the
the ones with the asterisk so pretty
much that is the duration of of these
courses so yeah so 14 to 16 weeks x 3
hours a week so that is the number four
hours that you would need if you would
use this in your in your organization
now I mentioned earlier that the
community played a pivotal role here now
we are currently deployed in well
started in the Philippines so that would
be the home base and we're pretty much
in maintenance mode there we also have
brazil brazil was the next one who
joined back in two thousand so we
started in 2005 we got invited here the
same year scott mcnealy talked about
Jedi a bit in his keynote so that gave
us a bit of a leverage so that same year
Brazil joined in one of the Java user
groups bigger Java user groups in Brazil
joined in and in 2006 they launched tip
and they translated it in Portuguese so
I don't know where our Latin American
friends here are from but we have a
Portuguese version and there were about
200 volunteers who work on the
translation and they have some videos in
some of the courses so what they do is
they deploy it in Calais entrance it is
a bit of a different model than then
what we have each country would have a
different model but I'll get into that
in a little bit mom so we have about 400
plus universities and colleges adopting
this course in the Philippines
previously I would say about 50 schools
I had you know pretty decent materials
so now we can say more than 400 by the
way there are there are about a thousand
colleges universities and technical
schools in the Philippines so pretty
much jump from five percent to forty
percent in a matter of two years we have
3200 teachers we've trained half of them
face to face training and we've reached
about 175,000 students yeah so in Brazil
as I mentioned we have about 200
volunteers there of course the number
has lessened because there's less
translation now and then about 43,000
students from the telecentre second row
and in Vietnam hey Vietnam was the third
country to to join in we have 40 schools
300 teachers and 34,000 students touched
upon by the the Jedi project and in
Indonesia we have sorry heirs to dry
now we have about 10,000 students so in
the Philippines we work with the
Philippine society of IT educators so
pretty much teachers and universities
belong to this umbrella group so we work
through them to promote Jedi okay so for
each region we have 13 regions in the
1000 plus islands that we have so we
have we were able to go to each and
every region now we have representation
there when we do our training hey we
select a group of I would say our top
teachers or top contributors and we do
face-to-face training with them we bring
it to a strategic location and then they
volunteer to do teacher training within
their region hey Sookie there is
volunteer training because we don't
really have the funds to to pay for it
they do have their way of raising their
funds and we give them the liberty to do
that we just don't allow them to charge
for trade for the actual training so
maybe charge to be a member of the group
and use that money to host the training
okay so many creative ways to do that in
Brazil again they go through the telus
entrance we have jugs all over and jug
leaders who push this to their to their
group in Vietnam we have a partnership
with a local Oracle office and they have
they have a local group there that is
working with schools to deploy this and
Indonesia we have we have a jug leader
who partnered with a government to
deploy this so he's being funded by the
government and he's using our materials
to do that so that's fine in fact we
encourage that you we partner with with
the
government or with universities or with
industry if companies are willing to
take on the materials then that's good
okay and then we have user groups and
volunteers really the success of this
the growth of this was because of all
these partnerships and the communities
that will build we're looking for more
industry partners to help us with this
because we want to then this the focus
group that we have are all based in the
Philippines but we want to expand that
further yeah go ahead um well no one has
really we tried but there was not a
strong interest I'm not too sure what
okay so thanks for saying that I did I
didn't really want to say that but i
think that's that's a key point yeah
yeah so it was kind of difficult to
penetrate even in canada same thing yeah
sorry can you repeat that yes
yep exactly even even in other countries
that we've been to not only the u.s.
that that would be the situation so so
as I've said from in the Philippines
from five percent to forty percent view
we've had that reach for it for the
access to quality course where that we
have now we're working on on distance
learning Brazil has done it ahead of us
but we don't have the bandwidth and the
infrastructure before to do that so this
week when I met with Oracle we are
exploring the possibility of doing
distance learning so we might if
bandwidth is not available will have CDs
to distribute them and they can play it
in in their schools hey or just
distributed the students each each
partner in various countries have
project ownership so they are free to
use Jedi the way they want it the way
they feel it's more effective they're
free to partner with you know government
their own government or companies around
them however this has a Creative Commons
license I say however because for the
past five years we didn't have any
license not because we didn't want to
but there were a lot of legal obstacles
working with with large corporations so
only after five years have we gotten the
Creative Commons license and then we
have t3 or trained a teacher that's our
train the trainer sessions that a lot of
our volunteers do that that is a lot of
savings for us by the same
it's a way for them to promote either
their school being the top school
because they're doing the trainings to
their to their colleagues right also to
do fundraising for their group so again
as I've said we don't charge for the
training but they can say in order for
you to avail of the training you must be
a member and you have to pay this much
it's not it's not a lot really in the
Philippines it's ten dollars but for
them you know that's that's enough to
cover the expenses it's ten dollars per
person so these are the sites that you
can go to to read more about Jedi now
we're not I have to warn you though
we're not big on the web because that
wasn't the mandate initially but again
we are moving toward that so we are soon
will be revamping how will will be
offering the orses how you can download
the courses that is currently in the
works and we just want to make the
materials more accessible before there
were restrictions but now we we are
taking that away because we already have
the Creative Commons license but should
you have any any problems accessing the
materials or you are interested to be
our partner or maybe you want to use it
for your internal training then do drop
me an email I have my business card here
so I'll just leave it in front and I
really didn't put it there so that
you'll get my business card so so that's
that's Jedi it has it has influenced a
lot of people and being the the I would
say the face of this project interacting
with people especially in the isolated
areas where you know they use old
computers but functioning computers but
you would see the motivation for them
the learn because especially in Brazil
in the Philippines the way out of
poverty is to get into technology and so
this is a lot this provides a lot of
value for them and and yeah we're happy
that it's growing and it's going to
continue we're going to do more than
what we already have and we hope I know
every time I talk I get at least one who
partners with us and implements it as
I've said this is my third time to speak
and three times we got one each so if I
get one today I'd be happy if none
that's okay at least you have this at
the back of your mind the future you
might draw interest before that I wanted
to holla Jim he has a bit of an
announcement to to make did you need a
microwave
hold on Jim wasn't the ex deal you're
going to use one of the horses so you
don't need Oh entire Canadians or
Filipinos no sorry I'm dual citizen I'm
Canadian a filipina okay okay so not
applicable to me sorry yeah good point
good point that was the problem the past
two years so now because we are we've
restarted i would say rebooted this we
are in the we are starting with the
updates on these courses with the parent
versions of Java we will be working with
the team within Oracle to have this done
soon this one because them because we
have we have I would say a beta okay and
then we have that that's one that's out
there so the beta 1 are the ones that
we're sharing with these teachers that
we closely work with in there on seven
but this one is six yeah so yeah so
really it's not a big difference but you
know if we can keep it updated we prefer
that and we also need to to kind of
create the screenshots on the Ides maybe
add some tricks on tips and tricks and
the new features and stuff like that
yeah
good yeah yeah so good question because
that was a big discussion when we
started this how are we going to address
that concern right because there's even
in back in 2005 there were already a lot
available and what more now but no we we
stick to the poor and we leave the
creativity to do them so yeah the only
thing that we really use for this is
NetBeans but all the other tools
available out there we don't really
endorse nor do we use but we include in
the list of references well yeah correct
so that is what we're working on with a
group in Oracle to have this in high
schools because we sorry yeah that's
right we've heard a lot of feedback
about that but the initial mandate
really was for university students
because the industry had a lot of
interest in that but does this grill we
recognized that you know at least the
first two horses would be very very
important and useful
okay yes yep yep I've have had a lot of
young guys emailing me and of course I
didn't know before that and so I asked
them so where are you from what school
and I haven't even heard of that and I
google it oh it's a high school you'd be
surprised yeah yeah good question thank
you because I almost forgot to talk
about that so we have we've build
communities in these countries right so
we have a program where teachers can
provide feedback and that's why we are
fixing our web presence because we want
everything done there we have a group of
people who evaluate all these
contributions are contributions and then
integrate it into the course if we think
that's useful i would say ten fifteen
percent are useful the rest not quite so
yeah so that is our method they send it
to us email and the primitive but it
works but there can be better ways they
send it to us via email our team looks
at it on a weekly basis we don't have
the manpower to do it on a daily basis
and we don't get a daily daily email
some contributions it's we bundle it in
a month or bi-weekly evaluate top talk
it out as a group and then integrated
into the curriculum and then the big
ones would be the exercises that's where
we get a lot of contributions
well so any other questions I i hope the
session you I don't know if everyone
expected this type of session that is
going to be focused on the horse where
but I hope you find it Oh somehow
relevant and again we we are open to to
partnering with companies because
definitely you can use this for you know
if you have new hires instead of you
know getting your own materials or
paying for it and you can just stop into
this pool and choose your own course
yeah so there yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
