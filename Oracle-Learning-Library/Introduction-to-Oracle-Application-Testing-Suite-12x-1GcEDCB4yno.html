video training series this is a video
recording of application testing suite
introduction my name is utakata katsu
I'm a group product manager of the
application testing suite product here
is today's agenda there are three
products in application testing suite
were called functional testing were
called load testing and Oracle test
manager we'll go through them one by one
in this presentation so once again what
is application testing suite application
testing suite consists of three separate
but integrated products the first
product we have is Oracle functional
testing which we usually call this
product open script open script to
provide automated functional and
regression testing for web-based
applications this is also where you
create your load testing scripts so this
is a functional testing tool while it is
also a load testing script generator the
second product we have is Oracle load
testing which provides automated load
and performance testing so once you
create your load testing script you can
bring that script on to Oracle load
testing in the run hundreds and
thousands of concurrent virtual users
against the application and while doing
the load test you can monitor its
applications back-end structure such as
a web server application server and
database server and also the operating
system such as Windows or Linux that
hosts those applications and collect
performance metrics and store into the
Oracle database so that you can later
use them to identify the bottleneck of
the application and finally there is
Oracle test manager that allows you to
manage your test cases and requirements
and tracked effects that are fun during
the testing so here is Oracle functional
testing worker functional testing is
also called open script the reason is
because it is not just a functional
testing tool but also it is the low
testing scripts generator so either you
are going to do a functional testing or
load testing
this is the tool that you will be using
to create your script open script to
provide specific custom accelerators
which are basically the script templates
we have accelerators for oracle packaged
applications such as EBS and sweet civil
applications JD Edwards Fusion ATF and
others and we'll see this more in the
next slide and the UI capture is shown
in the screen open script is a GUI
application you can create in debug your
scripts using the graphical user
interface you do not need to have a deep
knowledge of the scripting language to
create most of your scripts on the other
hand the underlying script language is
pure Java so if you are comfortable
writing code especially Java you can
flip the UI to show the code base
interface and write any java code to
extend the scripts and actually open
script is built on top of eclipse
foundation so if you have expertise
using eclipse
then you can use all features Eclipse
IDE provides to create and debug your
load testing and functional testing
script however most of the case the
advanced knowledge in Java is not
necessary in order to create test
scripts you can do most of the
configuration using the graphical user
interface an open script is apparently
integrated with oracle load testing you
can bring the script to the oracle load
testing and simulate the load to run any
number of concurrent virtual users to
test the application performance under
load open script is integrated with
oracle test manager which is our test
management tool so you can take your
functional testing script to put them on
oracle test manager and run the script
as a part of the test plan and store the
test result onto the oracle database
this diagram shows a list of
accelerators available in open script
for the current authorities besides a
core module web HTTP that works with any
web based applications we have
accelerators that work especially with
the oracle packaged applications such as
civil applications ebusiness suite forms
applications fusion ADF or JD
édouard applications Hyperion and
PeopleSoft applications and they are
built on top of the web HTTP testing
notion when you select these
acceleration modules open script
provides pre-configured aps and
correlation libraries that are designed
specific to these applications in
addition to the basic capabilities of
the web HTTP module provides so
basically this is an option that
essentially makes your scripting life
much easier because it provides better
script automation that reduces your
manual work as a result please keep in
mind however open script supports any
web-based applications as long as they
run in web browsers or deployed as soap
based web services these accelerators
are just an additional capability built
on top of that the next product is
oracle load testing if you are to do the
load testing the first thing you need to
do is to create a load testing script in
open script once you are done with that
step the next thing you want to do is to
run a load test you can bring the script
to Oracle load testing product and
configure it as a part of that your load
testing scenario here are some of the
key feature in Oracle load testing it
provides a realistic load testing what
realistic here means is that the
transaction is based on the browser
navigation which you do during the
recording so whatever you do on the
browser will become a transaction and
that transaction is recorded into the
script and that is a script which is
going to be executed in the load testing
and the allows it to scale up to
thousands of concurrent virtual users to
simulate the peak load conditions so
basically what you can do here is you
can simulate a situation there are
certain number of users doing a certain
type of transactions that you would see
in the production and it delivers an
accurate load by performing validation
against the contents return from the
server
this means we are not just sending HTTP
requests but
actually checking the contents return
from the server to make sure the right
page is coming back
an Oracle load testing has a built-in
server monitoring capability during the
load test you can monitor the
performance metrics from the backend
application structure you can monitor
how the application server is doing or
database server is doing whether the CPU
in the system is overloaded or memory is
over consumed you can gather those
information in the store into the Oracle
database so looking at the report you
could get an understanding of where the
bottlenecks may reside within the
underlying infrastructure under load the
session reports can be shown in HTML or
with the Flex based graphical reports
post for the real-time and post runs
here is a diagram of Oracle load testing
architecture when you install
application testing suite you will see
three core components installed a TS
server ATS database and ATS agent olt
controller and oil to service status
modules run within the WebLogic server
and stored session data into the Oracle
database when you start the load test
olt controller communicates with the
agent process you can run more than one
agent process and distribute across the
multiple agent systems and the agent
process ranch's virtual users and
virtual users execute scripts and there
is a script which includes the
transactions that you recorded by
navigating through the browser which is
a realistic scenario this way you can
run realistic multiple concurrent users
to the application to simulate the peak
load condition when server starts
monitors are enabled worker load testing
will collect performance metrics from
the hardware and software on application
under load
agent process then return the gizzards
information to the OLT controller and
oil tea controller stores that
information into the Oracle database we
have Oracle Exadata base ship to its
application testing suite but you can
also use Oracle database 10g or 11g
enterprise or Standard Edition for the
production use restricted used license
the Oracle database also comes with
application testing suite the third
product is Oracle test manager Oracle
test manager is our test management
product in the product concept Oracle
test manager has five integrated modules
that provide the complete test process
management they are test plan test
requirements test cases test executions
and issues in the user interface they
are represented in different tabs using
these tabs you can design test process
in the test plan tab based on the
specific test requirements manage and
define test cases and manage the
execution of those test cases in the
test execution tab and finally in the
issues that you can document intricate
effects as you can see in the screen or
code test manager is a web-based
application that runs within a browser
so just like Oracle load testing or code
test manager runs on top of the WebLogic
server and stores its data onto the
centralized repository which is the
Oracle database so basically allows you
to manage your test modules will link
them together so that you can keep track
on the test status you can execute post
manual and automated tests you can run
manual tests using your eyes and hands
or you can run functional testing script
which was created by open script you can
also schedule to run that test without
attending in person
Oracle test manager provides a default
set of predefined user roles and UI
fields but they are customizable you can
create your own set of user roles and UI
feels that best go with your
organization needs
he also provides prepackaged reports
they are also customizable on your
preference this diagram shows how the
different test modules are integrated
within Oracle test manager the first
module in the left side is the test plan
in the test plan you will define how you
design the test flow for a specific
feature of the product based on specific
test requirements you may have multiple
test requirements for a single test plan
and that each of the test requirements
can have multiple test cases associated
and you may want to execute the selected
test cases together as a batch process
if any issues found by executing the
test cases then they need to be
documented and tracked the Oracle test
manager allows you to define manage
these test modules and links them
together so that you can keep track on
the testing status for more on ATS
