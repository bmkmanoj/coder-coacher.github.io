regarding sweet promotions I'm going to
demonstrate how to migrate to sweet
promotions and take advantage of their
new features in the previous video we
looked at the new features introduced
with sweet promotions
stackable promotions or to apply
promotions best offer the new UI and
their performance now let's see them in
action the first thing we need to do is
enable the sweet promotions and also
apply promotions features go to setup
company and enable features and on the
transactions sub tab scroll down to
sales and check the boxes for both
features
then click Save
for our demonstration we will use a
number of promotions to show how all of
these features impact on the sales order
we have a standard promotion offering a
discount of $100 and for sweet
promotions offering various discounts
three of these promotions can be auto
applied and three of them can be stacked
while one is exclusive we have already
created the standard promotion and the
first three sweet promotions so let's
quickly have a look at how to create the
buy one get one free three promotion
here we can see exactly how to set up
our BOGO promotion and some expected
results regarding the discount it will
provide for the purpose of this demo
this promotion will not be also applied
but is stackable this marketing
promotions and click new and on the new
promotions landing page click item
promotion under the Suite promotions
subheading
give the promotion a name and enter a
useful description by default new
promotions are combined able so we don't
change anything here and we do not want
this promotion to be auto applied select
the discount item and the eligibility is
based on the design address being added
to the transaction so select spend a
minimum order amount of buy specific
items check the specific items box that
appears and select design address in the
items list and click Add for a buy one
get one free promotion we will apply the
discount every time one unit is added to
the order at full price so select this
box and enter one in the units field
enter discount rate of 100% the discount
is applied to the design address so
select it from the items list and click
Add finally create a multiple use promo
code and click Save we have already
created a sales order that includes two
of the designer dresses worth $200 each
so let's take a look at how our
promotions are applied click the
promotions tab and as you can see the
automatically applied promotions box is
checked by default promotions 1 &amp;amp; 3 are
automatically applied because they offer
$150 discount this represents the best
offer available compared to the
exclusive promotion which only offers
$10 and of course cannot be combined as
you can see our standard promotion is
available but we cannot apply it at the
moment when we try a messaging forms as
they cannot be combined we can however
manually apply it to do so clearly
automatically apply promotions box clear
all lines and add the standard promotion
the $100 discount provided by this
promotion is applied to the sales or
if we try to add another promotion we
will again be informed that the
promotions cannot be combined the
automatically applied promotions box
cannot be checked while a standard or
advanced promotion is applied to the
transaction now let's see what happens
when we make promotion for exclusive and
also applied to demonstrate the best
offer logic first we edit the promotion
and save
now we return to the sales order and
edited
on the promotion sub-tab will clear all
lines and promotion for which offers a
200 dollar discount is automatically
applied as it represents the best offer
available because it is exclusive no
other promotions can be combined with it
in this video we have seen how to create
a sweet promotion and the stackable also
apply and best offer sweet promotion
features in action we've also seen our
standard promotion can still be applied
to a transaction but cannot take
advantage of the new sweet promotion
