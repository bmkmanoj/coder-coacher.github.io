of product management on oracle we've
been talking about some of the new
features in oracle soil suite
what are also money to talk about is a
companion companion product of source
weed which is called managed file
transfer this is the brand-new product
point reducing or that 12c release and
it's a very very exciting a new product
basically what happens is that today
organizations have a lot of ftp servers
all over the place and typically this is
pretty much unmanaged you've got ftp
servers here and there in each and every
department different implementations
different products none of this is
highly available none of this is really
managed none of this is really monitored
and on top of that people use this to
send a cross in and out of the
enterprise sensitive customer data
sometimes and this often trance trance
is transferred over a clear text so the
goal of a managed file transfer product
is to actually conflate all this and
basically bring this in the centralized
architecture why you can basically now
have complete visibility into all these
whole exchanges this infrastructure is
is 24 by 7 we're talking about
clustering more file transfers we still
support the same FTP protocols that you
were using before so you don't need to
even tell you your business partners
that you change infrastructure they can
keep on using their favorite FTP clients
and we also add security because now
basically that infrastructure can take
care of transparently for the user
encrypted it up before it goes out of
the enterprise so managed file transfer
is is a great new product or interesting
in 12c that is going to allow you to
bring all these disparate FTP servers in
central manage secure product so please
look for that product it's downloadable
on the Oracle technical network managed
file transfer or call MFT thank you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
