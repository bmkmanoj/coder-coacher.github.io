Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to add
a glassfish domain to the cloud control
console for centralized management and
monitoring
to access the GlassFish domain discovery
functionality navigate to the targets
menu and then click on middleware from
the middleware summary page locate the
ad drop down menu from the a drop-down
menu select Oracle glassfish domain
adding a glassfish domain to the console
whether the domain is open source or
otherwise is a two-step process the
first step involves providing details of
the administration server for the
GlassFish domain to be added for
instance I must provide the host name of
the machine on which the administration
server is running it is important to
highlight here that the administration
server must be up and running for
discovery to be successful however post
discovery the administration server need
not be up and running in order for cloud
control to be able to monitor the domain
and its members I must also provide the
listen port for the administration
server the credentials for logging on to
the GlassFish administration console the
unique domain identifier which will be
prepended to the domain name to ensure
uniqueness of the domain name in the
cloud control console the management
agent that will be used to perform the
initial discovery and if the GlassFish
domain is SSL enabled than within the
Advanced section of the page I must
choose the HTTPS protocol once this
information is provided the management
agent makes an HTTPS connection to the
administration server using the rest
interface in order to find the domain
its clusters and its servers the
discovery results are then displayed in
the cloud control console in this case
it looks like a total of six glassfish
targets were found the second step
involves reviewing the discovery
results here I see that two standalone
glassfish servers a glassfish cluster
with two glassfish servers have been
discovered within this domain I also see
that the same management agent that was
used for discovery will also be used for
monitoring all members of the domain
post discovery by default if there is a
management agent on the same host as a
glassfish server then that local
management agent would be identified as
the default monitoring agent of course I
could change which management agent
should be used for monitoring each
member of the domain but for the
purposes of this demonstration I will
accept the default values and choose to
add the discovered targets as managed
targets in the console when the targets
have been successfully added to the
management agent and the management
service has uploaded the data to the
management repository I can then begin
monitoring the domain and its members
from the cloud control console
