will learn how to create a service
catalog using Enterprise Manager 12c
database as a source first let's recap
on the feature set it provides
self-service provisioning and an
out-of-box self-service portal that can
enable consumers to provision databases
schemas and pluggable databases it
offers an enterprise wide service
catalog which helps organizations to
standardize and be compliant with best
practices it assists with cloning needs
such as creation of thin clones or snap
clones for time and Storage savings and
also full clones using Arman backups
metering chargeback and Kota features
allow organizations to ensure service
governance
performance and lifecycle management are
essential to guarantee service levels
and finally it helps automate complex
and time-consuming tasks like batch
upgrade and configuration management
thus freeing DBAs to do more critical
work and lowering the operational costs
so what is a Service Catalog it can be
defined as a collection of standardized
services available to selected consumers
for on-demand self-service provisioning
now there are three key words here
standardize which means a single set of
pre-approved standardized database
configurations selected consumers which
implies that access to this catalog can
be rolled based and finally self-service
provisioning which indicates that
service catalogs are typically exposed
via user-friendly portals so that
consumers can easily utilize or request
for these services some of the benefits
of a service catalog are and of course
enforces consistency and aids with
automation
more importantly it helps reduce the
database management overhead
now the process to design a Service
Catalog can be described thus you start
by creating your service tears now this
typically is represented by using metals
which are bronze silver gold and at
times even platinum next step is to
define the technical footprint of each
of these service tears now this can be
done by leveraging various database
features like rack Data Guard and
backups you can even define sizes like
small medium large etc to further
standardize on the configurations you
wish to offer next step is to determine
the service model that will be used to
provision these services typically this
would fall into either a pluggable
database a standard database or schemas
within a large shared database and
finally you choose the deployment
platform for this discussion we will
limit our capabilities to just private
cloud
so before we dive into the demo let's
look at this fictitious scenario let's
say there is a large chain of hotels
called star hotel that they have decided
to standardize by offering for service
levels where bronze is a single instance
database and platinum which is the other
extreme offers high availability by
using rack databases and then disaster
recovery by provisioning multiple
standbys
now star hotel has two data centers one
in Salt Lake City and one in Austin the
Platinum Service which is the most
complex to deploy have offers in near dr
and afar dr so the primary database runs
in in the Salt Lake City data center and
it has a near dr in the same data center
now this protects you from localized
damages to the server or to the
facilities now for larger disasters you
want a standby which is in a completely
different data center and this is the
far dr which has been created in austin
for sake of simplicity we have decided
to choose single size so we call that a
standard size but typically you can have
small medium large extra and the mode of
consolidation used here as databases so
the standard databases would be
provisioned by the various consumers of
this self-service portal and the service
catalog now let's dive into the product
now I'm logged into Enterprise Manager
as a system administrator you see the
standard Enterprise Manager menus the
setup menu the enterprise targets etc so
this is the Enterprise Manager interface
that you're very familiar with now we
are looking at the cloud deployment
topology at the top we have the root
node which is middleware and database
cloud under this we have modeled the two
data centers these in e/m parlance are
known as zones
so we have defined two zones one for
Salt Lake City and the other for Austin
within these zones are software pools
under Salt Lake City we have defined two
pools first the rack
11200 for Tier one pool and second the
rack 11200 for tier two pool these as
the name suggests are 2 to node rack
clusters which have been provisioned
with eleven 2:04 software now in the
other data center which is Austin we
have two similar pools but these pools
are for single instance databases and
have been provisioned with the same
11200 for software now if we hover over
the links between these pools you will
notice that rack
Derwin pool has a relationship of data
protected by single instance 11 204
this means that rack Tier one pool has
to stand by pools the first is for the
near dr which is another cluster and
second is the far dr which is a single
instance pool a similar relationship has
been established in the austin data
center as well so you have s11
204 as the primary pool and it has a
single standby pool which is the same
data center and that's tier 2
so let's see what it takes to create
this hierarchy zones are nothing but a
group of servers or group of physical or
virtual servers
whereas pools define the software
footprint required to create these
databases so we navigate to setup cloud
and database
this shows all the steps required to
complete the cloud setup we start by
looking at booths so let's see our rack
11 - a for tier 1
to create a pool you define the zone it
belongs to which is salt lake city you
define the database configuration which
is cluster platform which is Linux x86
64 and the version which is 11 204 using
this filter criteria you find all the
Oracle homes that have been registered
with Enterprise Manager if we scroll
down we see the additional region to
specify standby pools so in this case we
have added two pools which is the rack
tier 2 as I said this is the near dr
site and then we have the single
instance level 204 which comes in from
the Austin zone and will provide the far
dr
now with our basic infrastructure define
proceed with creating off the
standardized service templates or the
standardized service definitions we
talked about for service levels these
were Bronze Silver Gold and Platinum so
let's look at the most complex of these
which is the Platinum service
we start by creating a service template
now a service template is the end state
definition of the service desired now
this service template would be directly
exposed to the self-service users or
consumers and hence it's important to
provide a meaningful name and
description next we choose a profile
which is DBC a template that's that has
been captured from an ideal source
database the database definition allows
us to configure the primary database in
this case we desire or tune or track
database the database Sid would be
specified by the user at request time
and we have defined 2dr sites via the
enable standby database so to configure
the standby database we start by
selecting the protection mode you can
choose out of the three options here we
have selected to use maximum
availability the NIR layer site would
the near their site can be configured
from this area so let's edit one of
these the standby name would be near dr
this is a name used to identify the
standby the actual name would be
provided by the user when requesting
this entry in the Service Catalog we
want the near dr to be similar to
production and hence it is a to know
rack we want the reader to be
transported synchronously and we will
enable active Data Guard option on it it
is typical to associate and apply a
delay to standbys this is useful to
protect the standby from accepting any
block corruptions from the primary
similarly we have configured the 4dr as
well the only difference here is that
the standby database is a single
instance database and it accepts redo in
asynchronously and no active Data Guard
has been enabled on it next we associate
the pools in which these databases would
be created so for the rack gear one
primary database we have two standbys
the near dr which is associated with the
rack dear to pool and then a far dr
which would be created in the single and
since 11 204 pool and as we discussed
both these pools come from different
data centers
the next step is to provide various
database options so here we choose to
create the database on ASM and so we
have selected the appropriate this group
for primary storage and the disk groups
for fast recovery area since this is a
standby database it is important to
configure a sufficiently sized fast
recovery area we also choose the
listener and a temporary location for
backups finally you provide set of
credentials that will be used for sis
system and DBS and MB accounts
to model various sizes you can change
the values of the various init
parameters the typical parameters used
to set size are cpu count and memory
next if if we want to massage the data
or if you want to modify the database in
any manner either before or after
creation of the primary or standby
databases this can be done using the
custom scripts these can be provided for
creation deletion and creation of the
standby database finally role-based
access is built into the service catalog
hence we associate a role of
self-service users who would have access
to the service template we review all
the changes and we click
with this we have completed all the
setup required to enable our service
catalog and the for service levels
namely Bronze Silver Gold and Platinum
now let's switch roles again and login
as a self-service user and see how we
consume these services okay now we are
logged in as Cyrus Cyrus is a
self-service user let's say he is an
Apps DBA and requires databases to host
application for the development team now
the first thing you would notice in in
this page is that it looks nothing like
the standard Enterprise Manager console
the reason is this is a special
self-service portal that is accessed
because Cyrus has the self-service user
privileges granted to him now the now a
few areas to notice on this page firstly
you will notice the list of databases we
have created a bunch of these to
represent the different service levels
like bronze gold and platinum then below
that you see the region for requests
these are the requests which created
these databases next on the top left is
the notifications area and below
notifications we have usage now usage
shows the quota assigned to users and
this and the resources consumed against
that Gotha for example the user is
allowed to create ten databases of which
he has created three similarly we have
memory and storage now let's look at the
Platinum database service that has been
provisioned now if you recollect
platinum service entailed a primary rack
database in near dr which is another
rack database and finally a for dr so
this is on the left is the summary of
all the database components that have
been
provision as part of this service level
so we notice that there is the primary
database represented as the PLT and it
has two instances to represent the two
nor Drac database then we have two
physical standbys the first is the nd
our platinum and ER which is the near dr
and this is another rack to note
database and finally the far dr which is
the FDR which is a single instance
database now the the primary database
shows you certain details like summary
there are two instances both are up it
shows you the uptime which is about 15
hours the versions etc you can also see
the connection string below that now
this is a failover connection string
since we have multiple standbys
configured as part of this service if we
scroll we will see details about the
various standbys that have been
provisioned so from here it is possible
to view the lag applied the the
synchronous or asynchronous mode of
transfer and the mode of each standby so
we have a combination where some are
read-only while some are only mounted
state besides these details you do see
the regular activity and the resource
allocation to this primary database now
let's click on the near dr
now the new dr is an active Data Guard
instance hence we notice to connect
strings first is the failover Connect
string which can be used if the primary
fails and this instance becomes the new
primary you also see the direct connect
string and since this is an active Data
Guard environment you can use the
connect string to connect to this
database for reporting or read-only
operations similar to the primary you
can also see the lag and the mount modes
and other details about this database
since this is a standby the user is not
allowed to start or stop these instances
by themselves this can only be
controlled by admin or in case of a
failover now let's go back to the portal
page and see how to request a Platinum
service so we click on request
database and now the Service Catalog
shows us the for service levels we
choose platinum and say select
now this is a short wizard which will be
used to submit a request for the
Platinum service you provide the request
name which will help you identify the
progress you specify the zone in this
case we choose the Salt Lake City data
center you provide a SID this SID can be
selected by the user
since the option the relevant option was
enabled in the service template then you
also provide a dedicated service name
note the automation always checks for
duplicate names so if the name my app or
my apps service has been used before on
clicking submit validations will be run
and duplicate name errors would be
reported to the user this ensures that
no duplicate services are created in the
same Enterprise Manager instance now the
user can also optionally select the
standby database so here the user
desires to create a standby database and
so we check the option we again see our
near and far dr options so we can
provide database sid names for both
these instances next you supply the
schedule so you can provide a start time
and an end time for the service and
finally you provide the deployment input
which is a special user created in the
database who has who has all the
relevant access to create table schemas
in other database objects required to
host your application and that's it a
simple short wizard to request your
Platinum service once you submit this
request within a few minutes three sets
of databases in three separate locations
are created thus is the value of the
automation provided by Enterprise
Manager thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
