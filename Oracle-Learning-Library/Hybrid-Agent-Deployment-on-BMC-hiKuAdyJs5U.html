series today we are going to discuss how
to deploy hybrid agent on parameter
cloud instances for 24/7 monitoring and
automated management of cloud instances
so let's get started first let's see
what our prerequisites should be
completed before starting agent
deployment before creating pyramidal
cloud instance you need to generate
public and private key pair once
public/private key pair is ready you can
create a bare-metal cloud instance using
public key you need to also create SSH
credential in Enterprise Manager with
private key so Enterprise Manager can
connect to cloud host using SSH I have
such a biomatter cloud instance Here I
am on bare metal cloud portal and
currently looking at DB systems
available in my compartment
I see public IP of the instances here
using this public IP I can connect to
host or SSH as OPC user I am planning to
install hybrid agent as Oracle user so I
need to give sufficient privileges to
Oracle user to connect to cloud host and
drum solo scripts add after agent
deployment now let me go to Enterprise
Manager 13c instance I'm using 13.2
version of Enterprise Manager to deploy
agent on bare metal cloud host go to
setup our targets our targets manually
and click on install agent on host
option in our target wizard ad
bare-metal cloud host public IP address
this is same public IP address which we
saw on bare metal cloud portal then
select the platform on target cloud host
in this case it is Linux x86 64 bit move
to next page we see here a warning
advising to use fully qualified host
name instead of IP address but in this
case we skip the wine and move on on
next page I see a wizard with platform
available agent version hosts where
agent will be deployed and I need to add
values for installation based directory
where agent will be deployed on cloud
oast let me add a value of installation
based directory here
the instance directory is populated
automatically this is location where
agent instance related files are located
next I select configure hybrid cloud
agent checkbox then I have to said
hybrid cloud gateway agent this is any
other agent which is configured to
perform activities of hybrid routed wave
this is intermediary between OMS and
cloudy agent and all communications will
flow through this agent it can be any
agent on any host which is currently
monitored by OMS let me select a gateway
agent from the list of hybrid cloud
gateway agents configured in this
environment
hybrid cloud gateway proxy port is
defaulted to one seven four eight
automatically you can change this port
if you want then select named credential
to connect to glow instance in this case
it is ssh name credential with private
key which matches with the public key on
cloud instance if you have not created
name credential till now you can create
it on the fly by clicking on plus sign
here make sure that we are mentioning
correct solo path the configure
privilege delegation settings for this
host also agent port 3 f72 is populated
by default you can change it if you want
and that's all move on to next page
review all the inputs and submit the job
if you see any issues during alien
deployment make sure that required ports
for example 3 8 7 2 1 7 4 8 and 22 as in
this example are open for processes to
connect to also make sure that SSH keys
are correctly configured once a John
deployment is successful we can see host
by going to target's hosts now let us
see one such host where hybrid agent is
already deployed let's go return its
hosts and click on post where hybrid
agent is deployed all hosts home page we
see summary at the top as you scroll
down you can view CPU utilization memory
utilization CPU threads utilization file
system distributions and network usage
if you want to drill down into any of
these metrics you can go to specific
menus on right for example let's go to
storage and see file systems
here you see list of all file systems
with their utilization similarly we can
check all other metrics as well this
concludes video thank you for listening
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
