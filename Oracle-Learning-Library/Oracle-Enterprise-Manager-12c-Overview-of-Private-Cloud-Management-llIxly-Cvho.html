to Oracle's cloud management solution
Oracle provides comprehensive solution
for building and managing enterprise
clubs some of the enterprise manager
capabilities such as application
performance management lifecycle
management configuration management and
application quality management are
fundamental to the operations of a cloud
Enterprise Manager also provides out of
box features such as self-service
provisioning metering and chargeback
resources scheduling and consolidation
planning as a means to transition to the
cloud quickly the complete lifecycle of
the cloud can be managed through one
Enterprise Manager console all the way
from planning the cloud setting up the
cloud infrastructure delivering the
cloud services to metering billing and
performing the day-to-day operations on
the cloud infrastructure Enterprise
Manager covers the entire lifecycle of
the cloud some of the roles in a cloud
ecosystem are cloud administrator
self-service administrator and a
self-service user cloud in this traitor
or could be an individual or a team of
administrators that is responsible for
setting of the cloud infrastructure and
making sure that the storage networking
hardware and pools of cloud resources
are well managed a self-service
administrator
takes the infrastructure set up by the
cloud administrator and enables it for
self-service users they define Coda's
constraints access controls for the
self-service users a self-service
administrator also publishes the cloud
services to the cloud self-service
portal
once the setup is complete a
self-service user can browse the cloud
services through in a self-service
portal and deploy the service they can
also do basic administration on the
resources that are requested from the
cloud such as starting stopping the
machines scaling up scaling down their
deployments saving and cloning their
existing deployments or retiring the
resources that the cell service users no
longer need
