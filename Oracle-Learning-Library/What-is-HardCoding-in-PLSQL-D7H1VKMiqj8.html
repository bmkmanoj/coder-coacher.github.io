practically perfect pl/sql hey there i'm
steven feuerstein i'm a PL sequel
developer just like you and what i want
to talk about right now is what I
consider to be the number one issue and
the number one best practice for writing
really great code and it's a really
simple thing to say never repeat
anything if you can absorb that message
and figure out all the different ways
that it manifests in your code
repetitions and the ways to get rid of
repetitions you will have amazingly
clean code code that's easy to read code
that is easy to maintain
never repeat anything now avoiding
repetition syncs up really closely with
another concept in program in which
people are pretty well familiar with
hard coding and that the corollary of
never repeat anything is never
hard-coded anything so what I'd like to
do is talk about hard coding show you a
piece of code that is filled with hard
coatings and hopefully expand your mind
and maybe blow your mind a little bit
about what actually constitutes hard
coding and a piece of software so let's
take a look at this program process
employee it consists of 33 lines of code
it's very small and it is absolutely
packed with hard coatings so what I'm
going to do is simply go line by line
through this program and point out what
I consider to be hard coatings and then
I'm going to come back and dive into
each one of those different kinds of
hard coatings and talk about why they're
so bad and how to get rid of them and
some of them as you're going to see are
not as bad as others
line one process employee so what I'm
doing is passing in a single parameter
Department ID number and the hard-coding
in that line is the hard coding of the
data type I'm saying it is and will
always be a number because of course the
core concept of hard coding is that I've
assumed that something's not going to
change so I can expose its
implementation I can say here's how its
defined here's the underlying details of
this thing and I can do it in more than
one place because it's never going to
change so department ID hard-coded as a
data type of number now we'll come back
and talk about is that a big deal or not
but that's a hard coding same thing for
line 3 line 4 line 5 these are all
explicitly declared data types using
base data types like number in bark r2
and most importantly on lines four and
five constrained declarations so I'm
saying last name where the full name
tell me can be at most 100 characters
long it's never going to get to be
bigger than that that's what the code
actually says it's it's never going to
get bigger than 100 characters that's a
pretty big assumption Ming and that's
one of the other problems with our code
related to hard coding and repeating
things is we make assumptions but
focusing on the hard cuttings let's keep
going line 7 a comment a comment hard
coding yes that comment is a hard coding
because it's hard coding the rule how do
i construct the full name of an employee
last comma first and look there's a
reference to the document the
requirements document I'm actually
saying where this came from that's a
pretty good idea but I'm repeating the
rule what if the document changes and I
have to go change this too so that's a
hard coding line 10 in which I'm
selecting 3 different expressions the
employee ID of its salary and then I'm
constructing the full name I'm basically
taking the rule that's defined in line 7
back in the requirements document and
I'm expressing it as code and I'm doing
it that way because well it's so easy to
do last comma 4 what can be easier so
I'll just do it there and there
there and they're all over the place so
moving along into the body of my program
the executable section line 17 contains
a very interesting sort of trivial hard
coding at least trivial in its
resolution but potentially problematic
in terms of my code so what could be
hard-coded about fetching a cursor the
next row of my cursor into three
individual variables well the keyword is
three what I've done is hard code into
this fetch statement a dependency back
on the Select statement what I'm saying
in my code on line 17 is this cursor
will always return three different
expressions and I'll drop it into these
three different variables which I
previously declared using hard-coded
data types it's quite a little train of
thought or code there so the hard coding
is what if the Select statement changes
what if I add another column or
expression then I have to change the
fetch statement so there's a dependency
there's a hard-coding lines 19 and lines
24 well those are probably the examples
of hard coding that you're I immediately
went to when you saw this code because
it stands out with a different color and
it's also a literal value and as
software programmers even the most
beginner among us knows that you're not
supposed to hard-code literal values
because that's the sort of thing that
can change all the time but we do it
anyway
we'll talk about how to get rid of it
it's actually the easiest form of hard
coding to remove from your code
unfortunately also the most common but
in this case there are actually two hard
coatings on line 19 two of them in one
line one of them is the number itself
the other is the expression else salary
greater than 10 million though it's not
explicit in this piece of code clearly
there's an odd little rule in my company
that says to be the CEO you got to make
more than ten million dollars that's the
rule and if you make more than ten
million dollars you must be the CEO so
the literal itself is hard-coded and
probably likely to change and not go
down
go out but the other part of the
hard-coding is the expanded formula as
with line 10 where I expose the formula
how do you get the last name of the full
name of an employee on line 19 I'm
explaining how do I figure out if this
person is the CEO so I'm exposing the
implementation hard-coding it moving on
to line 24 we have another example of
the hard-coded literal I'm repeating the
10-million I assume that the analyzed
competition procedure has as its third
argument what is the boundary the floor
that defines the CEO salary again
implicitly there's the rule expressed
moving on down to line 28 commit yes I
do believe that commit is a form of
hard-coding
it's a different kind of hard-coding
than say the hard coding of a rule but
it's performing a similar role in my
code if I hard code a rule I'm exposing
the implementation when I hard code a
commit I'm hard coding and exposing my
transaction boundaries I'm saying at
this point I'm going to save my changes
and there's no going back and of course
you're saying yourself well Stephen
that's what commit is supposed to do
that's the whole point I agree that's
why I'm saying it's a bit different from
the others the difference here is that I
lose flexibility around testing
particularly around testing when I hard
code commits and we'll explore that in a
bit more detail moving down to the
bottom then line 32 we've got several
different hard coatings again some of
them will be obvious to you perhaps the
fact that I'm hard coding my error
message I'm hard coding my error number
those I think would stand out
immediately but one other point around
hard coding here is the raise
application error invocation on hard
coding the mechanism I'm using to raise
an error and again you might say well
yeah but that's what I have to do
because I need to raise this application
specific error maybe but maybe there's a
better way to call raise application
error and hide it from this layer of
color so 33 lines of code I don't know
10 12 different forms of hard coding and
there's a lot more that we can and will
explore but that should give you a sense
of a different way of looking at your
code a different way of understanding
the kind of pitfalls that we can
inadvertently enter into as we write our
code and next we'll explore the ways to
resolve all these hard coatings
