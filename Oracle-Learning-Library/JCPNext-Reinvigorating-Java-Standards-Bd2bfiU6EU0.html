sorry for the technical glitches I'm
Patrick current chair of the JCP we're
going to talk today about chasing you
dot next we have several of the
executive committee members here with us
what unless you guys to introduce
yourselves first we'll just go down the
line here so okay good afternoon I'm
Scott Jamison from hewlett-packard I'm
Kelton informa zillow systems I'm valla
kyla individual member Michael image
from the Eclipse Foundation a little red
hat Gables that is a java community
there quarter
and Ed Lynch from IBM okay so good
turnout you see members thanks the rest
of you for coming out ok so juicy butyl
next we keep hearing the phrase what is
it all about at slide please ok so
basically we use the process that you
have a community process to reform the
process to define how the organization
functionality so there's a formal
mechanism basically constitutional
change ok so we have planned total of
three two hours as I say we use the
process formally to modify the process
the geocell process typically up as you
know designed for creating and defining
technical specifications but since the
process document there are two documents
that define how the organization is
structured and functions one is the
process document which defines the
procedures for submitting jsr s and
stuff like that and one is the jsb a
which is a legal agreement between
members and oracle these two documents
together define how the organization
functions and we realize many years ago
that we're going to revise them in a
formal manner we already have a process
for defining new versions of documents
called specifications and these are
really no more than specifications for
how the organization functions so we use
the gsl process itself because it has
formal stages well defined process to
modify these documents so that's what we
plan to do we be realized in the end
that we wanted to do as soon as a 3gs RS
the first one jsr 348 with an external
over a year ago that's the one that
mandated transparency that was basically
what it was about it said expert groups
need to do their work out in the open so
you guys can see what they're up to so
public mailing list public issue
trackers and stuff like that that's in
effect now and doing pretty well the
second of the 3gs RS we completed
relatively recently to three months ago
that was 355 and this is the one that
will merge the two executive committee's
into one that's going to take place
starting in the elections for this year
which begins shortly and will be
completed next year more on that later
and the third of these is JCP don't next
up 33 58 which we have started and
that's the one that contains all the
difficult stuff all the things that we
postponed out of the first one 348
because we wanted to get that done in a
relatively short period of time so we
postponed the difficult things we
postponed the modification of the GSB a
and so on to 358 okay next slide please
so I'll go into each of them very
quickly have sort of touched on them 348
was the first of the three and basically
said do stuff out in the open at this
stage all new GSR that are submitted
have to follow the new procedures and do
they work out in the open and we have
done we leaned on all of the spec leads
for existing jsr that are still in
progress and asking them to voluntarily
adopt the new procedures we can't force
them to do so because when they started
they agreed to operate in a particular
way you can't kind of retro actively
apply and you contractual terms and
conditions to someone unless they
green but at this stage the majority of
the in-progress PSRs have adopted the
new processes and if you come across one
that is not when you look at it on JCP
dog it will tell you what version of the
JCP what version the process document
its is being run under and if it still
says to dot seven then you know they
have an adopter the new procedures go
lean on the spec lead and pressure them
to do so okay next slide second of the
three jrs is the merge pretty simple you
heard join the keynote yesterday about
the expected convergence between what we
used to go Java ME and java SE such that
any will become once again a strict
subset of se we figured that the time
for these distinctions between on the
one hand the Emmy executive committee
and on the other hand the SE and he
attractive committee time to get rid of
those or combine the two EC's into one
the same time we plan to reduce the
number of members slightly although we
can tweak that so the process that we're
going to follow is with these elections
which are starting in a couple of weeks
time we will merge the two EC's into one
so people are running for election this
year I'm going to be running for VEC not
for bme see or the SE e ec at this time
will also eliminate to duplicate seats
oracle at the moment has two seats 1-4
ET c as does IBM so one of our goals two
seats will go away and one of ibm's two
seats will go away we do have the option
to keep some of the
ratified seats open this year in
anticipation of reducing the numbers of
total number of members next year so we
may do that so you may find that after
this election we're in the region and 25
28 members something like that next year
this will be completed everybody's going
to have to run for re-election next year
so that's going to be an interesting
election usually it's one third of the
members but everybody will be running
next year so that should be a good
election and at that point since we will
be reducing the number of seats are
potentially at least some people who are
members will lose their seats due to
simply there not being enough chairs if
you know that kids can musical chairs
you know who take some chairs away some
people end up without a chair so we'll
see that's next year okay and then the
third is the complicated jsr JCP don't
next three this is the one that's going
to modify the jsb a which was the legal
document as well as the process document
because it's going to do that this is a
big deal because lawyers get involved if
you start touching legal language we're
going to be dealing with complicated
issues about licensing and intellectual
property and so on and for those who
enjoy realistic stuff it's great fun and
for those who don't it is astoundingly
boring but it is important sorry I can
see what God's help you so yeah we so we
are in progress we've had a bunch of
meetings we have a Java and project so
you can find us on java.net and next
slide I won't go into these in detail
but this is a example of some of the
stuff that's on our list
implementations what is an RI
intellectual property flow licensing the
role of individuals as opposed to
organizations and on and on so it's a
lot of stuff here to keep us busy some
of you at least probably interested in
if not all of these some of these items
the best way to understand them is to go
to the Java ternet project we have an
issue tracker the issue tracker has an
issue for each of the items on our list
and because this is public you guys can
actually comment on the particular issue
and let us know what you think so i
think that's about all that I had before
we going to plan an open discussion I
want to allow each of the panelists to
jump in and spend a couple of minutes
giving their perspective on what this is
about and what they think so we just
started all right thanks Patrick and
thanks for the introduction to the three
items from our perspective and I'm
speaking is represented from
hewlett-packard at this time we
certainly have applauded the work that's
been done thus far in terms of
transparency making the work going on
within the JCP within the expert groups
much more visible as well as the work
the that's just been completed to
combine the executive committee's into a
single executive committee Patrick noted
the technology is converging and
certainly from our perspective we've
been interested in both sides of the
Java ecosystem if you will the micro
edition side as well as the the big job
aside if you want to characterize that
and it's just will be a lot easier to
stay engaged be aware of what's going on
with them going to combined executive
committee here it'll also be a lot more
efficient
in as you've seen most of the work that
the ec deals with are not technology
issues per se there on that turn of
issues there wasn't anything that had to
do with technology it was all processes
legal type things and so having a
technology-based distinction really is
kind of irrelevant what we're looking at
governance sorts of issues here and that
so from the EC roles I think it makes a
lot more sense to have a combined group
with you know all interest of from all
across the community represented in a
single body certainly as we go forward
and looking at these new issues and the
legal issues in particular these are
incredibly important to us like many of
us in this room my company has made a
large investment in Java and so having
some kind of assurance and surety to be
able to continue to use the technology
is critically important not being
blindsided if you will by license terms
somewhere towards the end of the process
making sure that when we're contributing
intellectual property that you know it
can be used in ways that you know we
expect it to be used and not in ways
that we don't want it to be used so
these are all again they get the
attorneys excited I guess I'm one of
these that I'm not an attorney but I do
have a kind of warped sense of humor and
think this is interesting work you know
it but it is critically important to us
from both the risk standpoint and a
surety standpoint and so I think you
know I'm probably more pessimistic than
Patrick and others as to how rapidly
will be able to do this but I think it's
critically important for the ongoing
health of the java community in the java
ecosystem as a whole to really have some
this just continues the themes of
transparency and making sure that we
really do understand you what the IP
flows what the licensing terms are that
will be operating on you know for the
next 10 or 15 years just as we have over
the past you know 15 or so so I I don't
want to go into details hopefully you
know we'll have some opportunity for
questions that people want to ask about
specific ones and there's
bunch of other people who want to talk
to so next effects just since you
mentioned 10 years I should point out
that it is about 10 years since the JSP
a was last revised so a lot has changed
since then and his time for kind of
bring the organization up to date so Gil
so hi i'm i'm i'm representing a zoo and
we are an elected member of ec and i
think that as such we we look at it sort
of like being outsiders that were
elected in to be a little bit of a
watchful eye we're also young members
and we're learning as we go but having
looked at the JCP as a member not as
part of this he ec over the years and
actually looking at the turmoil that's
gone through in the last few years with
very public issues coming about with
with disagreements with changes of
direction we kind of chose to join in
rather than keep watching from the side
and to try and and help you know shaped
up the rules to be different in order to
be a little clearer for what we we care
about and what we think companies like
ours and customers of ours care about
and I think the JCP dot next effort is
is one of the main interests that we
have obviously there's you know the
technical parts of ongoing other Jas
ours and technical GS ours but really
the what does the JCP look like in the
future and how do we avoid some of the
things that we've had in the last few
years as far as basic disagreements on
the reading of the of the JSP a or
ambiguities in it so there are things in
there we we we want to both clarify and
insecure for the future hopefully our
view is we're very much focused on the
platform on the java SE platform our
view on SC vs emmy is really that
of the overlap with a time gap between
them really from a practicality point of
view when I started working on java SE
it was running on huge servers with 32
megabytes in them and my phone has a
gigabyte in it right now so you know
clearly there's been some I'm way to
hear ya I just I I dye my hair to look
like that's it yeah so so you know it's
it's it's a question of time and I think
that there is so much common to them and
more and more common over time that that
joining it together especially from
governance point of view makes sense
another side I think that one of the big
changes we've seen in the last few years
as the emergence of OpenJDK not as part
of the JCP but as an open development
platform for the Java platform and it
seems to be doing pretty well and we're
certainly rooting for it and hoping that
what it's doing very well now will not
be stopped and will not be taken away
one of the things we want to make sure
as we're going through the JSP a Rolls
is that projects like that will have a
secured well known into the future
access to the technology to the ability
to run T CK's do things like that so
that companies will feel comfortable
investing men power into that and not
just not not fear that at the end of
that investment suddenly things the
rules change and effort goes away and I
think that I don't think there's
actually a lot of contention around this
it's more securing things that seem to
actually be within sort of the consensus
of what everybody is looking for
including Oracle but securing it in a
way that will not be ambiguous and will
not be open to too much interpretation
in the future
thanks Gil very yeah I'm one of the few
individual members in the executive
committee actually at the moment it's
just too I've worked on many different
areas all the way from Emmy to large
enterprise service so merging those two
EC's is also something that i very much
appreciate i I was aspect lead once of a
standard that wasn't finalized and only
after that happened we found out there
actually has been something in the Emmy
for a very long time that covered a
similar area but even the respective
Emmy EC members who let that never
really share the word about that so it
was strictly separate almost as if there
was a wall between the two ecs at some
point and now that this is slowly going
away it definitely looks like there
should be more communication and some of
the may still be chase us that only are
relevant in certain areas but there
should also be others that are
definitely reusable across different
parts of the platform and as an
individual member i also appreciate some
of the steps towards hoping that with
JCP dot next we might be able to make it
easier for other individual members to
join the JCP or to also get actively
involved in expert groups or even trying
the executive committee if they're happy
with the stuff that we are doing here
okay thanks for Mike
this should be fun this look this has
gotta look stupid from your side right
okay just check it I'm Michael link
fetch I'm the executive director of the
Eclipse Foundation and I just I guess
what I think say is so far what we've
done is the low-hanging fruit right i
mean the transparency and the merging
and the two executive committees were
like drop-dead simple things to agree to
and drop dead simple things to implement
the stuff that we're doing now around
the JSP a is at least an order of
magnitude more complicated quite
possibly two orders of magnitude more
complicated because what you're doing
here is changing the the wiring of how
the java community works and let's face
it what it boils down to is who controls
what and where does the money go right
so that this is going to be a lot of fun
and if anybody thinks that it's going to
happen in a very in very short order I'm
sorry you will be disappointed my
personal I think the two things that I
care about the most going forward I've
sort of put into the buckets of open
innovation in open specifications open
innovation for me the stuff that we're
doing well there's a lot more
collaboration between the JCP and the
OpenJDK community is a huge step in the
right direction the only thing I find
regrettable and this is purely self
interested because I run the Eclipse
Foundation and also have a lot of
friends and colleagues over in the
Apache foundation as it seems like all
of the open source innovation is going
to OpenJDK which seems like a pretty
wildly bogus solution to to innovation
in the java community so opening up hope
and innovations of the stuff with
OpenJDK is great it's definitely a step
in the right direction having open
communities build reference
implementations instead of the toy r is
that we've some
seen in the past is a huge step in the
right direction but I want it even more
open and on the open specification side
it's really important to me that we get
to a solution where our the
specifications coming out of the the JCP
are truly open in the sense that an open
source community can implement them just
as well as a commercial entity and as we
saw with the departure from of Apache
and the field of use conversation and
went on for a long time we're not there
yet so I think that actually solving
some of those problems in the licensing
discussions will be definitely a big
criteria of success for me personally
thanks back unlike my other colleagues
I'm going to try and keep this short so
that we have time to ask some questions
and most of all I was going to say has
been said anywhere but i will say that
i've been involved with the ec for a
number of years and i think that what
we've seen over the last year with the
things that Patrick outlined earlier are
probably some of the biggest fundamental
shifts of the whole ec that I can recall
since probably it was created they're
very important as Mike said there's some
even more important things that we have
to do over the next few months and it's
probably not a small number of months as
we iron out all of the issues there's
other things I would like to just tackle
that or perhaps not yet on the horizon
one of my biggest issues with the whole
JCP process has at times it's it's
stifles innovation a little bit because
we haven't necessarily moved as quickly
as as we needed to and standards which
are pretty important if they can wait
long to evolve and by the time they have
evolved they're being irrelevant because
the innovation has happened outside of
the JCP so you know we need to see
things moving along at a much brisker
pace and I did have something else to
say but it's completely gone so I'll
pass over
hi so I represent one of the two user
groups who are on the executive
committee the other one is led by Bruno
Souza is very the very fetching
Brazilian flag here and being user
groups are our focuses of course
developers and we care about the the
fact that a lot of people who are
developers have invested a lot of time
and a lot of their careers in this
platform we want to ensure that that
value and those people are protected and
we see really that there are two large
forces which are at play here one of
which is the need for continued
innovation because that's what keeps the
platform alive but equally developers
need to have strong compatibility
requirements because without strong
compatibility requirements externalities
are imposed upon the entire user base of
the platform so deciding how the tension
between those two works is I think one
of our biggest challenges the second
thing is of course open source
implementations because as a user group
we have no commercial interest in the
space I mean not directly I mean
obviously everyone has their career
which they their java developer so
that's does kind of an indirect
commercial interest but you know unlike
the vendor companies we're not directly
commercially engaged in the space and so
to our mind to Mike's point ensuring
that open source implementations are
always possible and wherever possible we
will attempt to to to ensure that those
implementations are royalty free rather
than reasonable and non-discriminatory
okay thanks pal all right over to you
guys questions comments
really long time to do it because it's
kind of a point-to-point contact with
interesting legal we dirty inside each
of the others in particular this year
the possibility to suggest to water
legal eagles and actually get together
and discuss this can we furthermore on a
room together have you ever been in a
room with 20 lawyers that's gross I'm I
think to the extent we've had
discussions on this we have sort of
decided that before we bring the lawyers
in we have to come up with some kind of
high level excuse me some kind of high
levels specification for what it is we
want them to do otherwise they're just
going to go all over the place so I
think we we have to start well I mean
generally like I did I spent an
inordinate amount of my career doing
contract negotiations much to my chagrin
you never gets you never bring the
lawyers in before you have a term sheet
because it's bad enough right so we
don't have a term sheet yet to give to
the lawyers but certainly once we get to
that point then yeah yeah and just in
the past when we've done this we
actually have had tried to at least get
together subsets of the various
attorneys I mean first of all not every
member has an attorney I don't think I
mean but those of us that do and have an
interest they have there has been
separate attorneys calls on when we did
this last you know 10 or 12 years ago
was it quite as engaged as perhaps we've
been in this but it's definitely not a
one-to-one and we actually try to avoid
that I think it's again if we're doing a
community thing here we don't want
individual you know bilateral
discussions going on if we're trying to
come up with a multilateral agreement
that's potentially counterproductive
there so it's I think that one example
of something that we have already seen a
little bit of is rather than getting all
the lawyers together which you know
other than doing that in the North Sea
somewhere and looking for icebergs
you know as other but we've we've we
have gotten a good clear feedback from
Oracle specifically about where its
lines are for certain things which i
think is very helpful for us to figure
out you know what kind of pie in the sky
stuff we should be looking for in what
panic pinus guys is not it's not
something worth spending a lot of time
on and this time around at least so in I
think that that would be true not just
for a goal but for others to kind of
take home get in a get some position and
feedback and bring it back as the
discussions go on so I I don't think
that getting all the lawyers in a room
or work well at all even even at the
very end I think usually the process
just you know they all take the stuff
home and redline it and somebody
collates it and eventually it hammers
out into something semi acceptable
that's that's a discussion that that's
you should have
we worry about rushing and getting this
thing yeah it is something that's going
to be a problem yeah I don't think
anybody want to rush it I actually think
though that a reasonable goal to shoot
for is in the next one year term of the
executive committee because after that
everybody is up for re-election and God
forbid we have a whole new EC to start
all over with right I mean that would be
not helpful that that could well be true
well we we did do to jsr so there are
partial results so we didn't completely
screw up
I think there is I mean let me give one
example we we have one of the items on
the list is labeled which is it said the
one well I wasn't thinking of that man
weekend refactoring the JSP a so trying
to make things simpler for people who
actually want to join the organization
this is a kind of pet thing of mine ooh
the moment you have this big complicated
document it's scary it's legal and it
covers basically you have kind of three
use cases or three rolls that one level
there are people who want to casually
participate they want to view the
occasional mailing list throw in a few
comments maybe log about door too pretty
simple stuff you shouldn't have to sigh
in a 16-page legal document in order to
do that once you get further involved
there are still two levels of
involvement that participation in expert
group you're making a formal
contribution of IP so you have to have a
more formal agreement here but you're
not the spectrally you don't have all
those weird obligations of the spec lead
has in terms of publication so we've
talked of refactoring the document into
basically three levels one of those
three the lowest level would not
actually be the JSP a it'll be something
else it's a simple but common terms of
use that we want to apply to all jsr
projects whether they operate on
java.net or somewhere else now we
haven't we have a draft at least if we
have a term sheet for that and that's
something that we can implement in
advance of this other stuff so that the
tricky thing is going to be to find
stuff in here that doesn't require touch
in the jsb a we took the easy stuff
already the problem we're changing the
JSP a is that it is a big deal you don't
want to do it very often
because when you do it you've got to
persuade everyone to sign up again so if
it turns out that all of these things
require us to touch the jsb a then it's
all or nothing but if there are some of
them I think there are so we can
implement without a JSP a change either
just by doing it or by making a simple
process document change then in theory
we may end up with JCB don't X top three
and JSP da NEX don't four but we'll see
what we can do and by the way let me
remind people whose be over there so if
you guys need your tongues loosening go
help ok someone else well then have a
beer ok I think just an unreinforced
member of the JC of the of the EC now
you know I actually happen to think that
if we do do this within the year that's
that's fast compared to the ten years
since the last change and and i think
that the changes we're talking about
really are going to be about
reinvigoration if there's no escaping
the fact that due to the big you know
backing out of the JCP by some groups
and the changes in perceived rules
there's been some freezing of community
activity you know if you go back to the
to the java 6 jsr and real what it read
what the proposed license terms for that
were and what ended up happening there's
at least a strong interpretation by some
members are no longer members of the JCP
that the rules were changed halfway
through and i think that that creates a
freezing effect so clarifying this is
not a judgment of what is the right
rules or not but whether or not they can
change whether or not there's argument
on what they mean I think the
clarification and clarity is very
important for people to get back in the
boat because in the situation where
people look at it and say okay I'll put
in my workout put in my my effort ohh
contribute my IP and at the other end of
it you know that everything changes you
know that that disparages actual work
within it and and you know we're fairly
new to the process but it's my
impression that Oracle Sun slash Oracle
today ends up carrying a lot more of the
weight of jo soares then was before I
don't know if that's absolutely true or
not but I know it's partly a consequence
of consolidation the fact that article
seems to buy anybody up you know before
they bought son there was a fairly
reasonable split between son oracle
before that ba and so on but the
consolidation is pretty significant that
way now at the point where eighty
percent or more of the ongoing jsr s and
probably almost all of the important
ones are being run by Oracle I think
that's that I think that's unhealthy we
we need to fix that and that's not
really a process thing that it's sort of
orthogonal to this but it is an
important issue yeah but i do think
their their process symptoms that are
things that the process created as
symptoms that that constantly could be
yeah
I think yes all these say something
being one of the inspect these is
working with article
make the power
is Parker and you have
work for you that are on expert
make sure you give them time to work on
the export routes they sign up
join up and come in as a corporate
member
that's natural of course but you're in
this meeting under
you might have some influence projecting
down for your heart elect our expert
expert remembers that work for you
yep I was just going to say that one of
the kind of bullet points on the slide
which I'm not job implementations can
people come anymore they seem to be used
based around this change and also what
they seem to be the extent of kind of
technical review abilities people are
not job applications that's this is
something which is kind of a hangover
from the previous attempt to modify the
JSP a which didn't actually succeed jsr
306 I should actually have removed it
from this list because how shall I put
this delicately due to legal ongoing
legal issues Oracle's lawyers have said
don't touch this I would say even more
than that it's finally highly
contentious item within it your strong
position is that the JCP is there to
standardize and require compatibility of
a certain limitations which and ones
that don't have compatibility
requirements did not have a place in the
gcp so and that makes them spec
compliance so now things are nuts like
compliant in my opinion have no room
there I may not be an agreement with
others on it but you know I would not
want to see that in an EJ
I'm talking about some compatibility
requirements and by we don't see any
clearer way in which a non java
implementation could be genetically
compatible and so therefore we we feel
they should exist yep we know that there
are other be put on easy but it does
really know they can sensitive so it's
not just Oracle saying no to this yeah
okay we we only have five minutes left
so probably time for a couple more
questions together to the cool-headed
question like okay
public transportation
today there are a lot of organizations
sauce
products
sample
is really still the only answer
from what his victim as a as a as a
development yeah he's doing anything to
fruiting in the cutters when I open
source editors showed me the code Oh
Nancy only way to security fruit
something instead rots in case against
something ago I'd actually go a little
bit almost a little bit farther maybe in
a sense like I've often said you're
trying to innovate through
standardization is an inherently stupid
idea so I would go so far as to say is
if you don't have an implementation 2.2
to begin with you shouldn't even get a
JSR that's like what do you like what
are you doing because I would go further
mark private sadies we don't have parts
of at least two implementations then you
shouldn't be trying to study so i would
say that even if you only have a single
implementation but then you should have
startled eyes that and that's 42 is it
supposed to be because it could be we're
saying that the technology area is not
yet right of standardization and
certainly because it might be because
some nefarious company is trying to show
the standardization through the back
door so then they can have a thicker on
that product which is a cool the only
time God for built do you have any
specific examples that's cute one last
question yes sir
here's one of the things that bother
that you aren't necessarily aware that
this
I find it very hard to believe sometimes
just simply don't know
talking about reinvigorating the
standards
are there any steps being taken
Austin Tice
what's going on I think people think
open is definitely a step in the right
direction that it that makes up to is
definitely something that helps me
ability but how do you guys feel that
this
hmm oh man the better there's about nine
or ten sessions arigato what about a
program called the dr josiah and Jerry
ations on that and move off some things
in bed by JC so I think these guys have
been thinking about this for the last
two years and it really been actively
starting to push it we have Java user
groups are definitely starting push it
and I think next thing we want to do is
actually push it to corporation movers
we are still running across the day to
day that others here at Java SP and I
don't even wear that little fun stickers
and you talk like this long way to go
but we're all starting to try and work
together it's a very effective but that
one is very hardly does yet drugs and
many corporations and rely on these
types of things I can't wear but at that
point I mean one of things that we have
found my trial run these programs is
actually lot of developers really
unclear about the distinction between
openjdk and the JCP and part of the
problem is that the JCP is forgive me
it's a little bit process Evie and the
kind of thing which attracts policy
wonks insert in certain ways and that's
a days because we've got sports done
organizations are for but that's not
necessarily something with weird with it
which lets get a spirit here he's what a
lot of developers wouldn't be wrong with
so so you know when we started off we're
an adult saarland openjdk let's separate
projects but then we realize that the
outside develop that they're actually
those distinctions aren't that
meaningful so to bring people in to stop
and get getting involved in tasted as
ours you know actually you need to have
one umbrella organization which is that
the place you going to where you want to
get involved but it's always going to be
hard the fact is is developers want to
develop they became developers because
they like doing that governance and
standardization process and all that
stuff is just not what turns their crank
and I've never been called a wonk before
okay no no it's not it's it's used over
here I've just never been so insulted
another time guys thank you thank you
all for your participation before you
leave let me just point out some
additional events immediately after
there's 5 30 101 ways to improve Java
why develop the participation matters
that's in continental ballroom for
upstairs tomorrow if you are especially
we have a spectrum eat
in the afternoon three o'clock talk to
me or Heather about that and then at
four thirty tomorrow we have meet the EC
candidates for the election that's in
the Golden Gate Revere in the hilton so
0 plus most important part of austin
potent we have a party tomorrow evening
at the infusion lounge I have invite you
if you don't know where it is just come
and collect one okay thank you all
preciate you showing up in the New
Jersey is friendly and scholar by the
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
