foods has two departments that want to
automate their order entry process
each department has slight variations in
the processes so Gavin is going to
create a master QuickStart app with a
basic process
each department can then customize the
process based on their needs
Gavan starts by converting his generic
order entry app to a QuickStart master
he provides a name description and image
for the app and publishes the app the
department heads see this information in
the QuickStart app gallery when they go
to create their own app Gavin defines
what information in the process the
department heads can change the label
appears in the left pane
he enters text that is more instructive
in nature to let the department heads
know what they need to do the title
appears at the top of the page he uses
an abbreviated heading for this he could
have used the same name as the label if
he wanted he identifies what elements
and properties users can change each
element has unique properties that can
be changed when all the personalizations
are made gavin promotes the app to the
quick start app gallery for his
department heads to use
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
