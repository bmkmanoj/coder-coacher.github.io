Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series Enterprise Manager 12.1
contains a long and robust list of
features that support the entire
lifecycle of the database in an
enterprise the image in the middle
depicts the major functional areas in
Enterprise Manager and how they work
together to support the lifecycle of the
database now it all begins in the center
with the core capabilities of discovery
and configuration collection so for the
first time Enterprise Manager has the
ability to discover hosts on the network
services running on network and also
discover targets on the hosts that are
under management including the database
it can also discover dependencies and
relationships between those discovered
components and from a collection
perspective does a deep collection of
configuration for all target types
including for the database patches that
are installed to begin the process
Enterprise Manager gives advice to the
end users through its integration with
my Oracle support around patches and
upgrades as well as configuration policy
violations from an analysis perspective
there's a long list of capabilities at
the DBAs disposal including doing impact
analysis by using topology to view the
automatically discovered dependencies
and relationships to do drift analysis
by doing configuration comparison to
gold standards baselines to between
entire systems or specific database
instances the change management
capabilities now give the youth DBAs the
ability to actually do database
comparison and synchronization between
database instances and create change
plans to repeatedly deploy change
- lifecycle environments from a taking
action perspective users can create
patch plans either discreetly or using
the patch advisories from the my Oracle
support in the advice functional area
they can do mass deployments of gold
images for their databases by
provisioning entire database binaries
including the databases they can do
schema synchronization and also
configuration changes in from an
auditing perspective enterprise managers
new framework compliance capabilities
give users access immediately to
Oracle's best practices and
recommendations out-of-the-box and also
gives them the ability to create their
own compliance validations for their
internal regulations as well this now
includes the ability to do real-time
monitoring to know who and exactly when
a particular change was made to a file
or database object and from an ongoing
perspective they have access to in the
inventory and historical inventory
trending of installations as well
Enterprise Managers auto-discovery
capabilities allow users to discover
unmanage hosts and targets on those
hosts and quickly and easily get them
under management in Enterprise Manager
so to begin with we'll go to configure
auto discovery which is under the setup
Ed targets menu and what we'll see is
that there are essentially two types of
discovery agent less an agent based
agent lists leverages an existing agent
that's been deployed already and to
actually do an IP scan of the network
and I can choose one or more agents in
the same scan definition and give them
different IP ranges to allow for very
large scanning capabilities
and so we'll look at this definition
very quick here you can see that this
one has one agent that it's using and
it's been assigned a particular IP range
which can be discrete IPs CIDR notation
or - and comma separated it's also
configured with an out-of-the-box set of
services and default ports but users can
quickly select those and change them to
meet their internal best practices and
requirements and this can be can be
submitted immediately and also run on a
regular basis and we can see here the
discovery this time last time found 36
new targets these would be targets that
would not already be under management by
Enterprise Manager the output of both
the agent lists and agent based
discovery is in Auto base or auto
discovery results and here we see a more
detailed list of the same hosts that
were discovered in that IP skin
including their IP address their
operating system and the service names
that were running on them now to simply
get this host
under management by Enterprise Manager I
can select one or more of these and they
can be different platforms at the same
time and I click on the promote button
which would take me to the agent push
wizard wizard to automatically deploy
the agent to those posts and get them
under management
once the agent has been deployed it for
those targets that support auto
discovery the discovery scripts are
executed and the discovered software on
those hosts is automatically reported
back to Enterprise Manager and you can
see here it's a long list of hundreds or
thousands in this case of potential
targets that have been discovered on
already managed hosts to get this
particular database under management all
I need to do is follow the same
methodology which is the click on the
promote button which would take me to
the agent or to the database wizard
button this time or database add wizard
which would already be pre-populated
with the information that was
automatically discovered this is the end
of the demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
