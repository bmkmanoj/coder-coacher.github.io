of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet in this part we focus on testing and
debugging testing and debugging jet
applications using your favorite testing
and debugging tools for client-side
JavaScript applications you can use a
similar process to debug hybrid mobile
applications when run in the browser and
you can also test and debug hybrid
mobile applications on the simulator
emulator or device we will take a brief
look at the testing facilities related
to jet briefly we will look at the
support for Q unit selenium webdriver
the local web browser emulator or
simulator and attached devices and the
jet components themselves the important
point is that any tools and technologies
relating to testing and debugging that
you've been using before in the context
of JavaScript you can use as well with
oracle jet q unit is a javascript unit
testing framework that's able to test
any generic javascript code and it's
used by a number of libraries that are
used by jet such as jQuery and jQuery UI
as well as the jquery mobile project you
need to configure a number of different
parts of your HTML code and your
javascript as described in the developer
guide to make use of key unit the
selenium webdriver takes a different
approach the selenium webdriver makes
direct calls to the browser using each
browsers native support for automation
you are advised to examine both kun unit
and the selenium webdriver and consider
which of the two is maybe the best
approach for projects that you are
working on making use of jet when you
are doing test automation and you want
to wait for an animation to complete a
jet page to load or a data fetch to
complete be aware that there is the urge
a busy context API the purpose of the
urgent busy context API is to
accommodate sequential dependencies of
asynchronous operations take a look in
the developer guide and you will learn
about wait scenarios about determining
the busy context scope
determining the ready state and creating
wait conditions similar to when you are
testing when debugging you can also use
the tools that you are already familiar
with in the context of JavaScript
development for example when you are
using the Google Chrome browser you can
extend it by adding the knockout J's
context debugger extension and the
window resize her extension the knockout
J's context debugger extension lets you
examine the knockout context while the
window research our extension that you
change the browser resolution to match
the platform to which you want to deploy
the application furthermore there are
also of course the chrome developer
tools CDT and you can do normal
debugging including setting breakpoints
and inspecting the CSS using the chrome
inspector to do so finally what is also
really useful is being able to debug the
network sometimes you may be expecting
to see certain jet components in the
page and then I haven't been loaded yet
the way to check that is to look in a
network monitor jet is a modular library
based solution therefore being aware of
which are the libraries and which of the
individual JavaScript files have been
loaded into the network can be extremely
useful the more complicated georgette
application becomes the more critical a
network monitor will turn out to be in
this part of the course on oracle jets
we've explored a range of different
testing frameworks and debugging tools
for your homework explore the features
available in the tools that you are
already using and maybe explore a few
others become familiar with the facility
is available for testing and debugging
your jet applications and as always
thank you very much for participating in
the course on the oracle jet and see you
in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
