of installing or upgrading Chang code in
this particular setup we see Chang code
called vehicle net has already been
installed with version number of one
clicking through we can see this cheng
code is installed across four piers on
this network would now like to query the
chain code accordingly in this user
interface i can actually type in the
serial number of an existing part on the
network this particular part has been
transferred twice already we can see the
initial created state and the subsequent
transfers or updates on a network now
what we'd like to do is actually upgrade
this cheng code to support part recalls
as we can see this chain code initially
started with the fields of serial number
assembly assembly date name and owner
train code is essentially shared
business logic that operates on a block
chain to modify ledger state local
blockchain cloud service based on
typology fabric enables you to write
chain code or smart contracts with a go
programming language or plans to support
additional common languages such as java
in future releases this particular chain
code is what is currently modifying
state transitions on the ledger we just
queried as you can see there are two
objects here a vehicle part and a
vehicle the vehicle part object does not
have any field that deals with recalls
we'll need to do two things
first add the required additional fields
and then extend the chain code functions
to modify the recall state what we have
here is actually a proposed modification
to the chain code we see now the vehicle
part JSON object now has recall and
recalled date in addition there's been a
method added where we can actually use
this to modify the recall state of a
vehicle part to take advantage of the
modifications we've just made to the
chain code we're going to want to
install
and then instantiate it so it's
available to the peers for execution so
from the chain code tab you don't to
install chain code type in the name of
the King code it could be any name
essentially then upgrade version to
version number two then you're going to
want to select the actual modified King
curve install it now with the installed
chain code we have to head over to the
channel to then instantiate er across
the peers so on channel 1 which are
where a king code is installed we can
essentially see the instantiated chain
codes so we're going to want to update
vehicle net to version 2 with our chain
code installed will then head over to
the notes tab to make our new chain code
visible in rider s proxy so we'll then
configure that and restart our rest
proxy till you've restarted the next
step is to then execute a transaction
and see the updates to the ledger I'm
using postman this time to execute a
transaction we're specifying the channel
being channel 1 the name of the chain
code or smart contract the method that
we just added called set part we call
state then I'm specifying in the
arguments the serial number of the part
I want to modify and I'm setting the
recall state to true and evidently we've
changed the version from 1 to 2 with a
transaction successful we can actually
proceed now to query the ledger
what we have now are four state
transitions the fourth one being the
most recent edition where we're setting
the recall state to true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
