provision your Oracle Scylla cloud
service instance when the instance is
provisioned you create and configure an
Oracle Fusion Middleware infrastructure
domain that includes the resources you
need each Oracle solar cloud service
instance has one server instance that
hosts the administration server the
administration server maintains the
domains configuration documents and
distributes changes in those documents
to manage servers managed servers host
business applications application
components web services and their
associated resources when you create a
service instance you can configure up to
four managed servers and then scale out
as needed each Oracle so a cloud service
instance has one or more managed servers
your domain also includes a cluster
which consists of multiple Oracle
WebLogic server instances running
simultaneously and working together to
provide increased scalability and
reliability in a cluster most resources
and services are deployed identically to
each managed server as opposed to a
single managed server enabling failover
and load balancing Oracle so a cloud
service employs Oracle traffic director
as a load balancer the load balancer
manages routing requests across all
managed servers and provides failover
and replication although it's optional
it's recommended that you enable the
load balancer when you configure more
than one managed server in your
environment with a few clicks of the
mouse you'll create an Oracle WebLogic
server production environment in the
cloud that's based on best practices
optimized for high performance and
reliability and is integrated with your
Oracle database cloud service and Oracle
storage cloud service instances in this
hands-on activity you'll create an
instance by selecting the service type
you'll also select the version of the so
a suite software the cluster size and
compute shape finally you'll specify
whether or not to use a load balancer if
you elect to use one you'll also select
the policy of the load balancer and its
compute shape in this section you'll
need all those names and configuration
values we've recommended that you keep
close at hand you'll be asked for the
name and location
the public key file you created you'll
provide the name of your database and
the database administrator name and
password you'll need the name of the
storage container you created the
storage container username and password
as well
you'll also assign the WebLogic
administrator username and password if
you have that information at hand you're
ready to provision your Oracle so a
cloud service instance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
