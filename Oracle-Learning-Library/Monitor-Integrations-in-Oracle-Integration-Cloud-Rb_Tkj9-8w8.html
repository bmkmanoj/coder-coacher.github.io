integration cloud from the Oracle
integration cloud dashboard you can
track and manage integrations and
connections in an organized and seamless
manner the dashboard displays the number
of messages that have been processed how
many have been successful the number of
messages that have failed and the
success rate of the messages you can see
the percentage of connections that are
currently used and the percentage of
integrations that are currently active
the dashboard includes a graphical
representation of the hourly history of
integrations and connections for the
last 24 hours it also includes the daily
history of connections and integrations
over the last 30 days through the
Activity Stream of the running
integrations you can view detailed blogs
about successful responses received from
the target application successful
requests sent from the source
application and target application
invocations you can track errors on the
basis of integrations connections or
recovery jobs or you can choose to track
errors on the basis of different
timelines drill further down to see more
detailed information about these errors
and use business identifiers to track
the status of predefined payload fields
through the business identifiers z' that
were defined while designing the
integration you can track the
integration here the request that failed
is shown in red you can easily review
the text to the error message an audit
trail of the activity that led up to the
error condition is also available you
can cancel a message and market aborted
this allows you to change the execution
environment and then see if the problem
persists finally display the list of
business identifiers x' that you defined
for this integration the dashboard and
Oracle integration cloud provides a
graphical detailed overview of the
integrations and errors an easy and
efficient way to track and discard
errors and business identifiers x' to
track integrations and connections to
