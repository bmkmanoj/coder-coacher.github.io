work for Oracle server technologies this
is the seventh demonstration of seven
demos about in-memory columnstore new
feature introduced in Oracle database 12
100 to this demo illustrates how date
pump behaves while exporting and
importing in memory objects and their
attributes
let's first export an in-memory table
the imc tea table the table has the
following in-memory attributes in memory
compression for query no in-memory
priority and in-memory auto distribution
for rack environment we use export data
pump to export the in-memory table by
using the usual export data pump
parameters we drop the table in the
source database and now we re import the
in-memory table back in the same
database with all the current in-memory
attributes we therefore use import data
pump to import the in-memory table by
using the usual import data pump
parameters you can observe that the
import parameter transform which enables
you to tell data pump to modify the DDL
generated during import has a new
possible transform name in memory a
value of know tells Oracle data pump to
drop the in-memory Clause from all
objects that have the attribute assigned
during the import a value of yes tells
Oracle data pump to keep the in-memory
Clause the value PS is the default thus
it was useless to mention it for this
case in the import command check
that the table has been really the same
in memory attribute we dropped the table
again and now let's try to re-import the
in memory table back into the same
database as no in memory table and check
that the table has been reimpose in
memory attribute why the table he's
still an in memory table but with
different in-memory attributes like the
in memory priority the table inherited
the in memory attributes of the table
space it is taught in the in memory
transform name set to no is very useful
in case of database migration during
which the DBA wants the new database to
use in-memory features the GBA could
recreate the table spaces with
appropriate in-memory attributes and the
news transform in memory set to no on
the import data pump command without
this parameter the user would have to
outer every object to add the
appropriate in memory Clause if the DBA
wants to disable any in memory attribute
that would be inherited from the parent
tablespace the DBA would use another
transform name the in memory Clause set
to no in memory Oracle data pump uses
the contents of the string as the in
memory close for all objects being
imported that have an in memory clause
in their GDL this transform is useful
when you want to override the in-memory
clause for the object in the data pump
now the table is a no in memory table we
drop the table again and now we want to
re-import it back into the same database
with explicit new in-memory attributes
like
in memory compression for capacity high
and in memory priority medium we use the
transform parameter with the in memory
clothes transform name to explicitly set
our in memory compression and in memory
priority values check that the table has
been read as an in memory table with the
desired in memory attributes you
discovered two new transform names used
by Oracle data pump to import in memory
objects this is the end of the
demonstration and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
