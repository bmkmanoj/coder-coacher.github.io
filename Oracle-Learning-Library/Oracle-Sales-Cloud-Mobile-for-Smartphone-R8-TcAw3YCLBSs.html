mobile to check appointments and manage
my activities on the go I've got a busy
schedule ahead and I'm catching a flight
at the end of the day I like to be
prepared for meetings and know
everything about my contacts and
customers this week I've got a scheduled
meeting at pinnacle
my primary contact at pinnacle is Joshua
Baker I can easily send an email make a
call or send a follow up from here this
activity is automatically logged and
associated with the record I noticed
there's someone new Cole Mitchell that's
been invited to the meeting I want to
learn more about Cole so I use LinkedIn
to search for his profile
you
I can also access company information
using news feeds this way I'm never
caught off guard
after a successful meeting I typically
schedule a follow-up or can email
invitees directly from the event details
in this case I also update the wind
probability from fifty percent to
seventy percent
now the entire team has the latest
information at their fingertips with my
meeting results updated I focus on some
future activities I previously set up a
saved search on my browser called open
opportunities I can access this directly
from my smartphone and it saves me a lot
of time as I use this as a basis for new
searches for the green server upgrade
opportunity I check to see whether
there's been any response on the
contract posted a few weeks ago
without seeing any update on the
document I post another reminder
you
with the end of the quarter approaching
I decide to submit my forecast directly
from my smartphone so my managers up to
date with the quarterly revenue progress
later in the day and after i've boarded
my flight i switch to offline mode and
use Oracle sales cloud to continue
viewing accounts and other information
I've been working on I'll be prepared
for my next meeting when I arrived
with Oracle sales cloud mobile I can
spend more time selling and exceed my
quota</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
