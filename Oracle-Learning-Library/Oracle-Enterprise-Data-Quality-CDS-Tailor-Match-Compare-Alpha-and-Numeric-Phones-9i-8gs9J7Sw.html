in this video we're going to again look
at tailoring CD s and the stereo we're
going to take this time is tailoring one
of the matching services so that an Alfa
phone number the kind of phone number
you see advertised 180 to Best Buy for
example can be matched with its numeric
equivalent so you can see the the phone
pad on the on the die on the photo here
so things like 180 to Best Buy should
match with its numeric equivalent which
is one eight two two three seven eight
two eight nine so we'll look at how we
can tailor a match service to achieve
that let's start by looking at the
behavior of matching out-of-the-box then
so I'm going to use real time entity
matching as my example and I'm in the
web service test drive called the entity
match service and I've put in data for
two entity records record one at the top
on the left here so the data I've put in
is named oracle corporation website
WWAMI
you've got an alpha phone number there
and to start with in in record to just a
bit further down here that we're gonna
try and match with i've put exactly the
same information so again name oracle
corporation website WWll calm and phone
182's by so let's send that to the web
service there we go
and off to the entity match process and
you can see it's given us a result very
quickly match score eighty nine so it's
found a a match and look at the rule
that it's matched against full name
exact website phone number so if
matching has two alpha phone numbers
like one eighty to Best Buy or partially
alpha it's happy can still find the
match if those phone numbers are the
same but if I just replace one of those
phone numbers let's replace the first
one here with each numeric equivalent so
that would be one eight two two thirty
seven
eight two eight nine so that is now in
one of the phone number off the space I
don't think I make any difference anyway
because I think it will be got rid of
but let's hit Send and let's see what
happens to this match score and the rule
that we match against so let's do that
now and you can see the match score is
reduced to eighty-five and the rule is
changed and it's now matching just on
the the name and the website but not on
the phone number so what we want to do
is to adapt matching so that if we have
a numeric and an alpha phone number and
in fact they're equivalent if you if you
converted the Alpha phone number into
its numerical equivalent they'd be the
same then we want to still find the
match on the phone number and still get
that match or of in this case eighty
nine rather than going down to eighty
five and and and hitting a rule that
doesn't include the phone number so
that's our challenge and next we'll look
at how we're going to do it so what we
want to do is we want to match an alpha
or semi alpha phone number like one
eighth to Best Buy to it's numeric
equivalents and if you think about that
what it really means is that we need to
convert an alpha phone number like one
eighty to Best Buy to its numerical
equivalent in order to be able to do the
comparison we need to be able to compare
apples with apples not apples with pears
or whatever so how are we going to do
that conversion of a numeric photo soria
an alpha phone number or send me a phone
number to each numeric equivalent well
I'm gonna suggest we use this processor
which is in the transformation family
called character replace let's just drag
it on I've got a little process here
which is reading from a web service
called tester and that web service has a
single input called phone number and it
writes out to the same web service and
we can use that just to see how
character replace is going to work but
think about how we plug this into
matching in little while but let's just
get an idea for how a character replace
works so if I link up the character
replace processor to the reader and give
it the phone number field and look at
the options now
the character replace processor like a
lot of processors uses reference data
and it actually uses a set of reference
data that comes with the edq release
called standardized accented characters
and that's what character place is
usually used to do to standardize
accented characters often before
matching so we take for example an A
with an accent over the top and
standardize it to a regular ie because
that way we're gonna get more matches so
the quick look at the the the reference
data then and you can see this is it so
it's working with some character codes
on the left here and it's standardizing
them to standard characters so if we
just take a quick look let's take this
one as example code 1 9 8 now if you go
and have a look on the web you can
pretty soon get lists of these codes up
so code 1 9 8 here what is that that is
this character AE I think it's called a
ligature alright so in the standard
reference data if matching finds this a
ligature sorry if the character applies
processor finds a ligature it will
standardize it and it will standardize
it to a regular e ok so it takes that AE
ke character 1 9 8 standardizes it to
regular e and that's what all of these
do and you can actually put in as you
see here ranges of character references
so 1 9 2 2 1 97 get standardized to
regular a and if we go back to our table
1 9 to start is there look 1 9 7 is here
and everything in between that relates
to different forms of non-standard if
you like a's and they all get
standardized to a regular a by the
reference data yeah so we can apply this
same principle to take regular letters
and to standardize them to numbers which
is what we want to do and if we go up to
the top of this list or near the top
anyway you can see here are some of the
regular letters let abcdefgh set
and these are the codes we want okay so
what we need to do then is to create our
own sort of reference data and point the
character replace processor at that set
the week create now I've done this
already so let me show you I'm just
gonna point at my reference data now
that I've created I've kept it within
the c.d.s project and I've given it a
prefix tailored and it's tailored
standardized alpha phone numbers let's
select it and we'll have a quick look at
it by clicking here and this is what
it's doing so if I just bring over there
the web page again we can compare look
so the first line the reference data
characters between 65 and 67 number 65
and 67 so that's these three which are a
B and C get standardized to the letter
two and if you look at your phone's
phone pad you'll see that letter two or
number two sorry is equivalent to the
letters ABC all right and 68 to 70 and
those are characters let's find them
yeah whoops d e and F get standardized
to the number three and again look at
your phone pad and you see they're
equivalent and that's what I've done
here so this one standardized is G H and
I two for this one JK in L 2 5 etc I've
only dealt with uppercase and we'll come
back to that in a minute so having
something with lowercase yep so I've now
pointed the character replace processor
at that reference data so it should
hopefully standardize our numeric
characters to their equivalent numbers
on the phone pad so let's just hook that
up to the writer and I had it hooked up
before so it's already outputting the
phone number to a field called
standardized phone number and we'll just
run that remember it's associated with a
web service so we can run it in real
time and we can go into the web service
tester here and let's do a test so in my
input field on the Left I've put in 180
Best Buy and if we hit Send let's see
what it gets standardized to with that
will appear on the right so send it now
and there you go it's getting
standardized to one eight two two three
seven eight two eight nine which is what
it should be standardized tune again
look at your phone's numeric keypad and
you should be able to work out that
that's what one a to Best Buy should be
standardized to so that's a way that we
can standardize how alpha characters to
numeric characters by the way if I put
on the end here you can probably notice
anyway I've got some numeric characters
on the beginning but if I put in some
more anywhere within here they're left
alone just send that and you can see
here then the numeric characters on the
end there that I put in two three four
two three four are still on the end it's
just standardized and changed the Alpha
characters okay so that's the principle
we're going to use and we're going to
use character replace and in a moment
I'll show you how we can hook this in to
the matching process so we figured out
how we want to standardize our alpha
phone numbers to numeric characters and
the question was well where do we plug
that in to our entity matching well
let's do what we usually do and let's
start by looking at the job so if you go
the job snowed within CES and let's find
real time entity match there and we'll
just open that on the process canvas on
the canvas and we'll have a quick look
through this job and what I'd like to do
really is to to start with the matching
process so you know all of the the
symbols with three yellow balls here
these are all processes and here's the
the actual match process itself match
entity so let's start there that seems
like a good place to start so we'll open
that process up and we'll try and work
backwards from what matching is doing so
here is the match process
itself much entities I will open that
and let's go to the match rules and if I
just go to the match rules tab you may
remember that when we write at the
beginning of this video when we use the
webservice tester to to send two
entities to entity match the rule that
was fired against was either a twenty F
I think it was and it was named website
and phone number so the rules are here
and they're divided into groups these
are the groups at the top saying see
there's quite a few groups there and the
groups all have have reference codes
this one is either our 24 maybe site and
here are the rules within that group and
if we just go down then you can see here
is e 0 20 F that was the rule that how
two entities matched against remember
match score 89 their full name exact
website phone number so that's rule that
we matched against so let's start from
that rule that's quite a good place to
start a guess and here are the
comparisons on the right hand side and
let's see which ones are actually used
by this rule let's just go down the list
of comparisons well there is full name
exact that has to be true that
comparison is used there at near the
bottom is the web website that's word
match count that has to be have to have
at least one word in common but here's
the one we're really interested in phone
number phone number WMC value 1 + and
again WMC
well let's dive tell you in a minute
what that stands for
okay so just bear that in mind so phone
number WMC that's the comparison that is
key here because obviously it's the one
about phone numbers let's go to the
comparisons tab let's search I find that
comparison so what we see here is the
comparisons grouped by identifiers and
if we move down we'll be able to see the
phone number identifies and there are
actually three of them so we've got one
here called phone number another one
called phone numbers with an S on the
end and one called phone number last
and and if you if you look at the
comparison names this is the one that
we've just seen phone number WMC it has
code c-54 okay and WMC if we look at the
comparison type it's pretty clear it
stands for word match count now that
might seem a little bit strange at first
because phone numbers we don't tend to
think of as words but actually in this
field as we'll discover in a minute we
can have multiple phone numbers because
it's a string each different phone
number is treated as the word so we
could have a phone and an alternate
phone for example and one of those must
match that's what that same one of the
words spot of the phone numbers must be
in common must match that's what this
does and there you can see the results
band of 1+1 at least you know one or
more must match so that that comparison
is the one that's in our rule now anyway
we have these three identifiers for
phone numbers you can see them here
phone number phone numbers with an S and
phone number last n okay let's try and
trace that back let's go let's cancel
out of the the the the match tab but
staying in the matching processor let's
go to the identify sub processor and
that's where the identifiers are mapped
to fields or attributes if you like from
the incoming records so if we move down
let's try and find those phone number
identifies the three that we've just
seen and you can see them here phone
number phone numbers with an S and phone
numbers last end and we can see the
fields they're mapped to in the incoming
data there's two streams but but all the
field names are the same they're using
the same data interface phone
standardized so that's mapping to phone
number phone numbers is mapping to the
phone numbers identifier and finally
phone number last end here is mapping to
the phone numbers last n identifier okay
so these are the three attributes we're
really interested in in the day
- phone number standardized phone
numbers for the less on the end and
phone numbers last n okay let's bear
that in mind then those are the three
attributes from the data interface that
we really want to find out how they
prepared so having worked that out let's
go back we'll close down the match
process for now let's go back to the job
the real time entity match job and let's
take a quick tour through the various
different processes we'll work our way
backwards so art before match entity
we've got match prepare real time before
that we've got cluster real time and
then working up we've got something
called standardized entity and something
called standardized address and at the
top there input prepare entity now you'd
guess that probably the phone numbers
will be standardized and prepared in
this process called standardized entity
they're not part of the address so that
you won't happen there
so let's sir continue our investigations
in this standardized entity process so
let's right-click it and let's open that
process so here we go so data is coming
in there's the data preparation
interface let's just quickly look at
that it's got a lot of fields that it's
inputting but amongst those fields that
are being input if we move down we can
see I hope just bear with me I think
I've got a little bit too far there ok
we can see the phone there ok and an
alternate phone here all right now let's
have a look at the process then those
fields phone on alternate phone are
coming into this process and they're
going through this standardized entity
names that's dealing with names so don't
worry about that
but you can see pretty soon we get to
this processor called standardized
entity phone numbers ok so by the name
of it you guess that's that's going to
be pretty key for us so let's open that
processor it's a composite
it published processes so we can open it
looks look what's inside and this is
what's inside okay now it's fairly
complex stuff some of this doing some
interesting things with the phone
numbers and so if we look at this this
is also a composite processor
standardized phone number or right
within the composite processor we can
open that as well and there's some more
things happening here and there's some
regex going on I don't know how could
your regex is but there's some of that
happening so quite a lot of stuff
happening here fairly complex now we
could spend a long time walking through
exactly how this standardized entity or
standardized phone number rather
processor works and what it does but
let's not do that
instead of that what I've done is I've
taken a copy of that standardized entity
phone numbers processor and I've put it
I'll show you down here in a different
project
he's my copy in a process that I've
called tester so that's a copy of that
processor we've just seen the etc and
I've just hooked it up with a reader on
one end and writer on the other and most
that reader and writer are reading from
and writing to a web service and in the
web service we're supplying the phone
number and the alternate phone if we
look at this processor let's open it you
can see it's adding phone number dot
standardized alternate phone number not
standardized phone numbers not
standardized and phone number last end
okay now those are important because
they will feed into the attributes that
will ultimately become out three
identifies so three of these will be the
identifiers that are used in the match
process so this is pretty key sizes have
I've put this up to a little web service
called tester I'm gonna run it
and let's let that get started and then
we'll go to the web service tester and
then the web service test drive I've
called that tester service so I can now
run through some data against that
standardized entity phone number
processor and see what happens to that
data so over on the left here is the
input in the phone number I've put him
182 BestBuy and in the alternate phone
I've just put in a kind of random phone
number there - OH - five six seven seven
six four three
so let's hit Send and we should see the
outputs here on the right and there are
the outputs now what I want you to note
is this if you look at the alternate
phone first - OH - five six seven seven
six four three with dashes between the
three groups of numeric characters here
alternate phones standardized here is
the here was a standardized version of
that and all it's done is just taking
out the dashes so that's fine but if we
look at the phone of the main phone
number one eight to Best Buy what's
happened there well here's the
standardized form of it one eight two
so what it does this processor amongst
other things if there are any Alpha
characters in our phone number it
actually removes them and in fact if I
put in some more numeric characters
after the Alpha characters I've put in
seven six five four will hit send you
see the result again it removes anything
after the Alpha characters now this is a
problem for us isn't it because
obviously what we want to do is we want
to use those alpha characters and we
want to convert them into the
appropriate numeric cap which is using
that character replaced processor but
actually what's happening in this
standardized entity phone numbers
process is we're losing all those alpha
characters and anything after them
effectively okay that's what's going on
there so we have a bit of an issue and
we have to decide how we're going to of
we'd that issue or get around it okay
let's um just stop that little process
working that's kind of done its job
we've done a bit of Investigation then
we don't need to wait for that to stop
whatever happen in its own time
but if we just go back again and we take
a look at our real time entity match job
so what we know is if we pick up the
standardized versions of the phone
number coming out of this standardized
entity process
well that will will will have lost the
Alpha characters okay so if you start
thinking around this we've either got to
do something to change this process so
it works in a different way now I think
that could be a little bit fraught with
potential problems so what other options
that we have well I'm not saying that
I'm choosing the right option but the
option I'm going to choose actually is
to work with the original phone number
just going back to the web service
tester note that we can output the
original phone you can see here at the
bottom okay and that will be output so
rather than matching against our
prepared version of the phone number one
option is to work with the original
phone and I happen to have called the
output here original phone but in the
data interface it's just called phone
which is the name of the the attributes
that we input into this where does this
web service this tester here and and you
know so it's just called phone it's not
called original file that happens to be
why I've called it to make it clear that
that's what it is
in this little web service I've created
so let's take that option let's work
with the original phone number now what
we can do then is adapt our match
processor in this match entity process
and we can adapt it so that it uses the
original phone number instead of or as
well as
the standardized version of the phone
number okay so that's an option and
that's the option we're going to follow
now let's think through some of the
possible consequences of that if we just
go into this metric match entity process
and we change it then potentially what
we've done may not be very obvious or
visible to any observer who comes to
this further down the line if we're
dealing with an upgrade might be
difficult to see what we've changed so
perhaps what we could do is instead of
that let's find that match entity
process in the processes note there is
and let's take a copy of it so we
right-click and we'll choose copy and
let's just paste that copy into the
processes note and we'll change the name
and again we call it tailored if I can
spell it tailored match entity so
instead of changing the the you know the
original process let's take a copy and
let's change that copy so there we go
now let's find that copy tailored match
entity there it is
so we've got a copy we're changing the
original process by the way is used in
the batch entity matching as well as
real time so again any changes we made
would put change would affect both
things so you need to be aware of that
too you might want to do that you might
not but you need to be aware of it
here's our copy anyway and there is the
match processor now take a look at the
readers these readers are both reading
from the combined data preparation data
interface okay and one of the the fields
that they send into the match processor
is the original phone and that's just in
a field which is called phone their
release oops they're okay but going into
the match processor and we'll look at
identify first
if you look down the list of identifiers
Zand and the the fields in the data
interface that they relate to you won't
find phone there okay you'll find the
standardized versions of phone which are
output by that entity phone
standardization processor that we looked
at but you won't find the original phone
number just called phone so therefore we
need to create a new identifier so that
we can use the original phone number in
our matching processor so let's do that
now let's just get plus and we'll call
this identifier original phone there we
go and we'll map it in the incoming
records to the phone number field let's
just find that phone number field I've
got probably gone too far down there
okay no these are alphabetical they
sorry so if that's hadn't gone far
enough
and there it is okay and we'll do the
same thing for the reference data you
remember there's two streams of data
coming in so we need to map them both
there we are so there's a new identifier
called original phone mapping to the
phone number field from the data
interface which holds the original phone
number before it was standardized in any
way great let's go to the the matching
or the match sub processor now and let's
create a comparison on that original
phone number now you're properly
thinking well okay you create in
comparison but we said that we wanted to
convert the original phone number so
that any Alpha characters are converted
to their numeric equivalents so why are
you creating comparison already well let
me let me show you there's the original
phone identifier we created let's add a
comparison for it and we'll call this
original phone
now we'll just do to keep it simple for
the purposes of this demonstration we'll
just do an extract extreme lunch okay so
the two versions of phone number have to
be exactly the same now what we want to
do is we want to transform the original
phone number so that alpha characters
are converted to numeric characters and
actually within matching we can add a
transformation so we don't necessarily
have to do these transformations before
matching we could do okay but we can
actually just do it in matching so to
keep it simple let's do that
let's add a transformation in fact the
first one we'll do is not Kerry to
replace let's do an upper case first of
all all right you might remember in our
reference data for character replace we
just have upper case reference data
I didn't map the lower case characters
so if there are lower case characters
they will be converted to uppercase for
that won't matter and let's do another
transformation after the upper case
which will be our character replace they
remember character replace that's their
tool we're going to use to convert from
alpha to numeric there we go
now just like the character replace
processor character a place within the
match processor by default uses the
standardized actor accented characters
reference station of course we know we
want to point to our tailored reference
data let's find it there it is tailored
standardized now for phone numbers
instead so we've picked that tailored
standardized alpha phone numbers
reference data that we you saw earlier
okay so there's our comparison original
phone exact and two transformations are
happening before we try and do that
comparison
we're upper casing if there are any
lowercase letters in there and then
we're doing a carat to replace to
convert those letters to the appropriate
numbers as you would see on the phone's
keypad so that's our comparison now
let's go to our match rules tab and now
let's again look for
the rule that we we matched on when we
first did our web service test on entity
matching right at the beginning and
remember it was in this either a 20 full
name exact group and it was easy wrote
20 F there it is
full name exact website phone number now
we said before but that uses three
comparisons the full name exact still
want that website we still want that now
the phone number WNC word match count
that uses one of the standardized
versions of the phone number remember
the Alpha characters are dropped so we
don't want to use that one anymore let's
change that and instead we want to use
our new original phone exact comparison
at the bottom here and that needs to be
true okay now just to make it really
clear what we've done let's change the
name of this rule to tailored oops e 20
F now we could have created a new rule
and put it just below the original while
if we wanted to keep the original logic
as well as adding the new logic that
would be another thing we could do but
we've got a new rule in here with a name
which is indicating that it's tailored
that's probably a good idea to keep that
and it's looking at our original phone
number that's so Qaeda so we kind of
hope that that will have done the job
let's just go back to our tailored
version of the process and let's just do
something which is a good idea I think
which is let's add a canvas note and in
this canvas note we'll say something
like tailored oops there we go
kind of match rules to compare original
phone numbers add Alpha characters
converted to numerix there we go so
we've made little notes about what we've
done as well so that's making it really
clear for anyone who looks at this let's
save that so we've got a tailored
version of the match entity process
that's great but the job still looks at
the standard non tailored version of
that process right so what are we gonna
do there well again we've got several
options we can just go into the real
time entity match job and we could we
could change that or we could do
something similar to what we did with
the process which is we could take a
copy of it and paste it in and create
our own tailored version of that job so
we're not changing the original job but
we're gonna create a new job entirely a
copy of the at the job anyway and we're
gonna change that so here is our
tailored version of real time entity
match
let's open it and in that tailored
version we will take out the match
entity process that's the standard
process that's no good to us so let's
delete it and over here on the tool
pallet we should see our tailored
version of that process there it is
title of match entity let's drop that
into the job there we go and we'll just
hook that up so lip-sync
down a bit and we just hook it up so
it's joined to the process immediately
before it and it's writing to the
process whoops
after it there we are
alright so we've now got a tailored
version of match entity real time let's
just save that and it's using our
tailored process now the way that we
start the real time process is is we run
a job called
real time starts all here and let's just
open that job and it does some
preparation and then in this phase it
initiates all the real time services and
if we just hit configure these are all
triggers actually and each trigger runs
another job so here is the trigger that
runs real time entity match for example
okay now what I've done is I've created
my own little version of that at the
bottom here and show you that version
and in my own version I just close the
other two in my own version there are
the triggers okay and I've just set it
just to start real-time entity match not
any of the other jobs just just to make
it easy to test obviously you wouldn't
use this in reality again you might
wanna your own tailored version of real
time start all or you can just amend the
one that's there so that it's starting
off your tailored job not the standard
real time entity manage job anyway
there's my version so we want to
obviously try this all out make sure it
works so we go to the service the the
server console and we'll go to see yes
and let's find that little version of
real time start that I created there and
we'll run it and what that should do is
it should tell you the preparation
that's required and then once it's done
that it should start real time entity
match and it'll take a couple of minutes
to get everything started so when it
started I'll come back to you and we'll
do a little test in the web service
tester and we'll see whether our entity
matching is working in the way that we
want to with the alpha phone numbers
okay well welcome back
as you can see entity matching is now
running our tailored real time entity
match process that we created earlier so
let's go into the web service tester and
have already called the entity match
service here it is and I've put some
data in and I've put almost exactly the
same date room that we used for the
initial test at the beginning of the
video so in record one here I've got
name nc name oracle corporation phone
182 best buy website wwlp.com
corporation I've got the same website
www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam website and
the phone number with the Alpha
characters that we see up here converted
to their numerical equivalent so we
should get a match with the numeric
phone number below just just there okay
let's go to the top then and let's hit
Send and let's see what happens so I'll
hit send now and there is our result
it's a match score 89 and we've matched
against our tailored rule that we
created outside of version of either of
20f for name exact website phone number
so that shows that the change that we
made to transform the original phone
number within the matching process so
that the Alpha characters are
transformed into their numeric
equivalents using carrier to replace
that has worked so that's really good so
that's good news now I'm not going to do
all of the refinement that you might
want to do against this particular issue
for example you know what would happen
if I put a dash in between 182 and Best
Buy well actually you'd need to think
that one through and you need to do
something probably to remove that -
because I think if I just hit Send now
you probably find that we won't get the
same rule now we've got a different rule
now which doesn't include the phone
number so we want to do some preparation
or transformation in matching of the
phone number to get rid of that
- again probably in the comparison we
could add a denoise transformation that
will probably get rid of that - for us
and that will probably overcome that
problem so you need to think through
some issues like that the other thing
I'd like to point you out if we just go
back and let's open a copy of our
tailored process let's just find that
okay so there we go the match entity
process it's running so it's going to
tell us that it's lock doesn't matter we
only want to look at it anyway but we
just take a look at the match rules I'm
not sure if I can do that whilst it's
locked
let's tell you what I'll do instead I'll
just go into the non tailored version of
match entity because I can make the same
point equally well there let's look at
the match rules so obviously this is not
the tailored version this is the
standard version so we're not going to
see how new natural but you know all we
did we went to one of the match groups
either a twenty F and we put a new rule
in or we changed a rule and the rule we
changed was was this one wasn't it e 20
F so that it looks at the original phone
not the standardized version of the
phone but even within this group there's
another rule there that looks at the
phone I think if we go further down we
may see perhaps I won't go looking for
it oh yeah just there another one that
looks at the phone as well so even
within this group we haven't taken care
of all of the rules which look at the
phone which include the phone number the
other rules even in a standardized
version of the processor they will still
look at the standardized version of the
phone number which won't include the
Alpha characters and therefore won't hit
the mark as far as we're concerned so
we'd have to go through and we'd have to
change all of the relevant rules in this
match group and then we'd have to do the
same thing in all of the other match
groups because all of the other match
groups there's the next match group down
they all have rules we should look at
the phone as well they probably all have
similar rules the sim similar to that
the three that we saw within our first
group there's a number of groups ok
there's quite a lot
so we now have some time really just
going through and changing all of those
rules or as I said the other thing we
could do is just add new rules leave the
original rules there and add a new one
perhaps right below the original rule or
right above it and to look at the the
phone number with the original phone
number with the Alpha characters changed
the numerix so we've kind of done a
little proof of concepts if you like
about how we would take care of this
requirements to match phone numbers
including our four characters to their
numeric equivalents you can see how we
would do it there'd be more work to do
to actually finesse this and make it
work in a production environments but
hopefully you can get an idea of how we
could do it and more importantly perhaps
of how we'd investigate the match
process and the match jobs in order to
work out what we need to change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
