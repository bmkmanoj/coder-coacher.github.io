reviewer in the Oracle Learning Library
community repository fantastic from the
Oracle Learning Library homepage click
on collaborate and then what you'll see
at the bottom of the page are your
action items this is probably the first
place to go so click on the action items
button and then you'll see two major
tabs one is content that needs approval
and finalize content so as a reviewer
you're going to take content that has
been submitted but has not yet been
approved for viewing in usage and you're
going to work on that content until you
think it's really fantastic you might
ask a question of the author and then
hopefully finally you will approve it
let's take a look at the steps involved
now I'm going to drill down into this
copy table with or without data using
create table as command so this is a
piece of content that was previously
submitted but as not yet been approved
and now we're going to walk through
these different fields and make sure
that you know how to do everything
that's necessary with them first of all
since it's a link you've got a URL the
link to that item the most important
thing of course is to make sure that the
link is valid the way to do that is to
click on the validate URL button so i
click on it and yes it came up with the
article by manish on this topic so
fantastic it's there I'm going to move
that off to the side a little bit now
the next step is to actually review and
work with the content itself so the next
item on the page is the topic one of the
key things about the community
repository is that we don't just say
this is a article or this is a video
about sequel but it's about a very
specific topic within sequel so part of
your challenge is to go through that
knowledge tree and find the best match
so I click on little up arrow and here's
my treen you can see we've got all sorts
of different kinds of content out here
it's starting at the sequel area and
what I'm going to do is simply start
with well a create table as it be great
if that was there oh it's not there darn
okay well this is sequel of ddl as I can
tell by taking a look at it for creating
a table so about create table still
nothing let's drill down into the sequel
tree so sequel data definition language
statements table ddl let's open up that
one so we've got a high-level table ddl
item in the topics tree i'm going to
pick that one select it that's the
closest match so get the closest you can
or you can leave it at the top level
like sequel and somebody else can take a
look at finalizing it but don't approve
it if you don't feel like it's got a
decent topic then check the title make
sure it's the same as the article yes it
is and then you can set a source if it's
not selected but it's not important to
do that you will also want to make sure
that the content type is correct and
there are lots of different types of
content this is an article so that's
what it said to then we have the
description now the description is
really important as a general summary of
what this piece of content is about and
that's what somebody will see and then
decide if they want to drill in further
so here's some content that somebody put
in here to get things started and you
should go over it and review it and make
sure that it's accurate so for example I
really like to be correct with the
English language so I'm going to lower
case that how and the B and the x we got
the create table as command so this is
pretty good so as a basic description
that's fine we can leave that as is now
the next step is figure out how much
time you think somebody would take to
read this obviously it depends on
whether English is their first language
whether or not they're an expert in the
topic but essentially read through it
yourself and decide pretty much how long
you'd expect somebody to route to take
to read that okay well I'm going to say
probably 10 minutes is a good amount of
time for that difficulty level again
review the content decide for yourself
but this is basic to me and then select
the minimum version now in some cases it
might not be that relevant for example
create table as has been around inside
oracle database for as long as well
anybody can imagine at this point so you
could just leave a blank or you could
say well it was first introduced or in
some cases it will be first introduced
in a given version of the database and
you'll usually have to check the content
itself or know more about the database
to figure that out but hopefully you can
do it I'm just going to put it down as a
tie if there's a maximum version in
other words this is a feature that
worked until let's say 12 dot 1 and now
there's a better version of it or it's
been deprecated usually the maximum
version is left blank and then finally
if it's not English
might change it to something else if we
support that language once you feel
really good about it you can either
simply save and it goes back in the
queue and notice in addition to saving
we're also going to add a comment so we
want to make sure that the author can
see the changes you've made in other
reviewers as well cleaned up description
set the topic as closely as I could I
submit my comment and now it's going to
save my changes and you can see it's
still here because it's not yet approved
I go back in all my changes are there
and that's great so what I could do at
this point is click approve their or
right inside right at this top-level
report I can say this is good i'm ready
to go approve it and then it will
disappear from my list and I can keep
moving down through my list so the key
thing is to take your time take a close
look at the content make sure that it's
accurate make sure that it presents well
and then go through the edits make the
changes and approve and by doing this
you'll be ensuring that when people come
along later to learn about these
different areas of Oracle technology
will be getting the best representation
of that information they'll be able to
find it as quickly as possible so that's
content needing approval now in addition
we have a separate report called
finalized content and this is designed
more for very specific pieces of
information so in general what we're
doing here is finding all the different
content items that do not have
difficulty level minimum version or
duration how long it takes to watch it
or read it in place so this allows you
to very quickly go through in a single
form and say well let's see this one
there right tiny chunks of reusable code
so i click on the link it pops open the
video huh and I could of course watch it
and I will watch it if I haven't seen it
before and I'm editing it but I can just
check and see that it's 17 almost 18
minutes so back i go to my action items
it's 18 minutes long where is it right
tiny chunks of code 18 minutes long
minimum version while I would have to
watch the video to make sure but since I
did this video I know that there's
nothing in too
of recent versions that we need to be
worried about so I'm going to set it
down to oracle9i release 2 which is a
long time ago difficulty level is
intermediate and then i can say apply my
changes and write tiny chunks of code is
now off of this list so you can either a
drill into each one in detail but if
you'd like to just stay at a high level
and go through a lot of these different
items that may be up for finalization
you can if they're approved if they're
missing this information will show up
here then this allows you to very
quickly do that so you've got two
different reports that you can drive off
of the domains that your reviewer for
will serve up the content that needs
attention you drill into the report you
pick the items and then do the editing
as needed now suppose you are editing an
item let's drill down into bracket
expression in Oracle regular expressions
this is actually an ask Tom thread and
let's suppose that you need to get some
information from the person who
submitted this item you've got a
question about it you can scroll down a
bit and you'll find whoops you'll find
at the bottom an area for comments so
there are no comments yet here but you
can say add a comment and then I can
type a message I'd like to get a better
idea of why you submitted this content
item since it is not very well written
submit and now the person is submitted
this content can read this message and
respond to it now add another comment
please ignore prior comment just using
it for a video there so even if you're
not going to make any changes to this
this link but you have a question or a
comment you can add that into the into
the repository and others will pick it
up and respond so i hope that gives you
a nice clear sense of how you can
contribute with a relatively small
amount of your time in terms of helping
us build a very high quality repository
that everyone in the world can benefit
from when it comes to learning about
Oracle technology thanks and happy
