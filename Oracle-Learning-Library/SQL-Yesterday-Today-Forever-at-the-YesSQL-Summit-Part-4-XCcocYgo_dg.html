correctness and security it happen also
to get this bonus of optimal performance
nice that's the way to look at it and as
far as web scale is concerned well
that's the operation on the data in the
tables and it's agnostic at stage two
how you get it done whether it's
paralyzed one other stuff that that
that's not the domain of discourse of
bills equal reshaping so yeah see you're
having a talk tomorrow we can go people
can go in more detail with you yes you
don't need to know about the optimizer
it just works but it seems that these
days many people need to be reminded why
to use bail secret so that the neck was
the running time time we'll see if you
have any actually in but the next
question namely dressed from handy is a
horrible now released no single products
of the tongue is this saying that there
are situations are no sequels more
appropriate than the standard for
quality plus i guess i already talked
about this earlier but ya know there's
early use cases for no sequel databases
and there have been for 40 years and
there will continue to be so and so for
us we at work we want to have a complete
family of data management offerings
that's been all use cases that customers
want to use and so you made perfect
sense for us to take berkeley DB and
just like amazon we had a just a
distribution layer on top of it and we
have a great top notch no sequel product
that word
in quite significantly and we're
actually going to move out to the cloud
this year where I think we'll have a lot
of customers using our no sequel engine
there in the cloud abuse cases and so
yeah there's definitely a use case for
no sequel and we want to have a complete
family of data management products and
solve all of use cases and so yeah so
there any quick example of which cases
some I should be looking at more no
single solution that the standard panel
well it's one of these things where
relational databases can do everything
no sequel no sequel does a small subset
of what relational databases dude and so
it's after the sort of the developer ISM
to decide what they want to do know they
have a fairly complex application and
part of that application is simple when
I could use the no sequel database well
in that case you might as well just
write the whole thing I'm gonna see in
the work will seek one we've done with
it right why bother making your life
more complex by trying to now integrate
together multiple data stores and deal
with security across multiple data
stores but if you have a simple
application that doesn't really need
integration with lots of other data
scores sure but you know the classical
use case that sorted no sequel at Amazon
was you know I've got my product catalog
and people are browsing all my products
all I want to do is you know let people
know place you look up a product by name
and find the price
information about the product you know
great use case for no sequel user
profile for good use cases you know it
here's the user ID give me back all the
information about the user that I can
use to drive my front end people are
using it again like in fraud detection
systems you know you can do all the
heavy lifting in a data warehouse to
figure out you know people's credit
scores and all kinds of other attributes
and then when they do the transaction
you can have all that pre computed
sticking sitting in a no sequel database
and do quick credit checking fraud
detection checking you know those are
some examples there's there's lots of
these cases okay anybody else have a
sound lights on top
Sogard an extra Tony wants a shipping
line so it's it was the best language
for big data why did why that why was
that room in the market project had
become so popular so let me try to take
this one and he alluded on this a little
bit before the short answer here would
be what why I'd hope it's because it's
cheap and people think it's cool
although as ND said right the coolness
is starting to fade off a little bit and
whether it was ever as cool as Oracle
red shoes is a different story but now a
little bit more serious when we look at
the question itself the question itself
isn't very clearly defined because it
backs what is an open body sequel and
what are these things that we compared
with each other as any said before I do
PES multiple parts and you know some
dealing with the persistence of data and
some others dealing with the attempts of
processing data and the same is actually
true when we use the notation of sequel
a better question why people probably
when this question comes up
automatically imply that when i talk
about sequel i'm talking about freaks
structured data that resists somewhere
somehow on a physical device and this is
actually not true when we talk about
sequel or at least how we see the world
here is sequel in that context we talk
about the processing of data where it's
not necessarily relevant where the data
is starting so talking about sequel as
development language or data
manipulation data access language it
doesn't matter whether the data resides
in fixed structures on data over the
data is defined in a min in a more
loosely context whether this is a
chasing document or anything else or
whether the data is even start outside
the database and I think that is where
who comes into the picture looking
forward as any set line HDFS is
definitely a capable cool distributed
file system right and it's cheap and out
of here right someone has to take care
of it someone has to manage the data and
it definitely makes life easier you know
to put data into any kind of resistance
structure where there is no structure to
begin with that is similar to go see all
right you just put it in but and it
makes it easier just to potentially get
data it but at some point in time you
know the rubber hits the road and people
want to do something with the data and
that is where some kind of structure
comes into place as well and this is
where we actually want to combine these
two worlds and where we put a lot of
effort into the development of sequel as
as the data processing languages make it
easy and efficient to work on any kind
of structure we started as actually back
in the 90s
with the introduction of external tables
which was the very first step into
making Oracle a data processing engine
and this is what we are consequently
developing torts and we have made big
inroads here with with the combination
of data stored inside the database and
data stored outside the database with
big data sequel we're trying to optimize
the processing for multiple different
shades of data containers to work as
efficiently and as scalable as possible
with the data so i think that is that is
where we have to clearly say when we
look at what were you doing here from a
sequel perspective we dealing first and
foremost with the data process and then
we are trying to optimizing whatever
lies behind there in the data
persistence layer to make this as as
unified is global in as effective as
possible great thanks any other sandwich
on
well Stephen I ask you a little bit we
have two more questions up so it's the
next last question but what's the what's
the oil develop have a good team doing
to sort of bring sequel to the public
there you know cut through some of this
misunderstanding like we talked about
the Java programmers didn't join zan
Java not realizing the intuitive
database what do you guys like to so I'd
say the Oracle developer advocates team
is focused in two major areas one is
generally content generation so moving
away from white papers and powerpoints
to video it's primarily scripts and so
on so I already mentioned the Connie's
video series on keep it simple sequel
will be issuing our first episode of
schema wars in the next few months so
keep an eye out for that it's a little
riff on Star Wars for database
developers hopefully will be very
entertaining go viral so one area is
just providing a better content to help
developers in jets that make sense of
our technology the second is that we're
looking at modernizing integrating out
of a constellation of websites that
we're currently offering to our
development community that are just not
connected up and delivering enough value
though they're delivering Mazda what do
I mean esscom is so one of the most
popular technology sites google
developers and it's going to get better
well I've sequel how many of you have
used live sequel ok so live sequel as a
website you go to live single oracle com
where you can execute sequin PL single
on the 12 down one database you need to
install anything you can play around
with sequel you can download and run
script so it's a script repository it
will be upgrading that in terms of the
number of scripts the ability to comment
on the light let me show the ELSA cool
challenge is a quiz platform that will
be revamping and offering quizzes across
single appeal signal and starting next
month and out
Express so let me a connecting of a lot
of these different resources to really
give you the better tools to solve your
problems and also for newcomers can
begin to our arena to be able to get
their answers questions answered move
quickly so surveilling that so that
sounds like a lot of that's for the
oracle community of people come into
oracle community are we doing anything
