giving a bunch of time and it all flamey
make sure you enjoy the material and the
knowledge you're gonna be learning from
here so today we're going to talk about
how you can build a weapon at p.i
platform use a whole bunch of open
source solutions from scratch and
especially we're gonna build up this
platform in Java because this is a Joe
long conference and personal speaking
I'm a pretty big taller thing even
though a lot of other solutions are
available today
like for example notice is pretty
popular and how much Oh Ruby unreal guys
- but most of the concepts will apply no
matter which programming languages you
choose to use right and for this
particular session I'm gonna try to
share my real-world experience trying to
hacking up API platform to support my
employers requirement and we actually
leverage a lot of open-source solutions
and hopefully I'm gonna give you some
pointers to this open source solutions
when later on you try to do cherry
picking you can actually look at some of
the candidates we have been evaluating
and hopefully that's gonna give you a
jumpstart to your own solution too
all right a little bit by myself I work
for a company called chef light we are
online photo company which allows you to
upload your photos and do a lot of
physical gifts like greeting cards photo
books
iPhone case all fancy stuff but
premature saw open source guy I have
been working on Apache Software
Foundation for quite a bit about five
six years for now and I've been
contributing to a few Apache open-source
projects including Apache Tuscany wing
ember and I also wrote a book about the
Tuscany SCA which is SOA framework to
help you to organize the abyss project
in a component based approach and I have
the wrong time to handle all the
technical Plumbing's so that's the
framework we use as a back-end to
support service or any developer
approach and we open up the service as a
jack size resource so that becomes the
source of truth for the api's so I'm
going to briefly go through a few scenes
in this session the first one why we
need to have a PR platform right and I
also try to bring you into the back pass
look at some of the key components to
enable your server as API platform and
I'm going to live all the time for you
to do some Q&amp;amp;A stuff feel free to
interrupt me if you have questions in
the middle al well overview so first of
all why do we need to have a API
platform so I assume in a lot of
companies these days are trying to build
IP ice so that we can extend the reach
of the functionality provided by the
company it's not only just for third
party but also for internal consumption
as well in my opinion maybe the very
first step could be recognize your
system and open up your core
functionality as an end
by services and build nice IP around
that because today most of companies
they want to have mobile solutions right
and you have later of applications and
naturally all these functions all sudden
becomes a requirement you have to call
you to your system using an API in the
strategy device that gives you some
buffer how you you know build up your
API platform and incrementally
open up your core functions sipi so you
have the first set of alpha beta
customers from inside your company
they're gonna give you a lot of
feedbacks and you know make your app
platform make your API looks good before
you open up to the civil polity for
public consumption
so this talk we are not going to talk
about the philosophy how you build a
very nice API how much rest rest rest
but mostly focus on how we can build up
some back-end infrastructure most of the
time it's invisible and it's behind the
thing
hey when you hit a particular API
endpoint but I'm not gonna cover much
about ok what's a security model what
the philosophy old review just before
the API design and how you implement
your you know services as API I try to
group all the material following a
strategy ok mr. party application coming
into your system say from web or from a
mobile application most of time the
first thing they gonna do is make a
whole bunch of recipe I calls right so
assuming we have a album and the album
Kay allows you to store pictures right
so here's 2 sample IP ice you might want
to make a call
the first one is okay I'm gonna try to
get some information about all my albums
and second life I try to create an album
for myself under this particular use
but later I'm going to tell you what's
the magic behind this meeting and what's
this Corrie Pramod a call access token
Hey so before I jump into all the
details I try to give you a big picture
like how this whole thing will
potentially looked like so first of all
on the left side you have all kinds of
different client occasions right so the
apply application its term from us to
basically see whoever consumed your IP I
it becomes a client of your API and the
client could be a internal web
application could be a mobile
application can be a desktop application
that doesn't matter
so in the center with a web platform
basically it's a whole kind of
infrastructure try to deal with
different concerns for the API in
locations for example whenever a API
comes in running web make sure we have
enough authentication and authorization
in place we don't want to anybody from
the planet try to you know use your
function without knowing who they are
and do they have permissions to do so
especially if the data itself it's owned
by users say if the user registered with
your website and they have their own
albums right so you need to keep the
user especially in the austere term
called resource owner into the book and
whenever API hate your API endpoint so
we have to do a certain things to make
sure there's no security concerns and
the client application itself and the
permission granted by the user is
authorized then for some API is there
may be two certain things in the middle
like do some mediations if the client
only support a song and the
can only support XML also you want to do
XML JSON convolution and also you want
to track how many API calls are
happening for this particular client
application so we need to track the
usage of the api's and also from the
performance perspective say for this API
90% a long time the response time as we
see like a serious millisecond
once you finish all this stuff you need
to hit the real API logic basically some
back-end services to realize the
function behind API right so because the
API platform logically speaking there
can be a separate box from the real
services you are developing and
providing the real business logic so
this one Network hop between your API
server and the some of the back-end
service right so the the proxy the HTTP
proxy we use as kind of dispatch the
request from your IP our endpoints to
the corresponding pack and protect
resources or API larger right so this
sound trick you can play around the
proxy because you can do routing you can
do version Li and you can also
potentially inject some context from the
API request so if we remember the sample
API rest point point I give to you this
special segment called me right so that
me could be representing the logging
user itself and maybe your back-end API
then recognized me they only recognize
their user ID I so this is a perfect
timing we replace that me with real user
ID because the user ID is known to the
AHS to total and also we need to build
up a whole bunch of infrastructure so
that we can support the platform so the
the bottom line we showing some
for example we need to have some
distributed a grid suspected by
non-sequel database so we can register
all the backend services and also keep
track of the matrix information the
quota information and we also allows you
to do the client application
registration and also keep track of the
Austria talking so that we can know what
permissions are being granted for a
particular client application and how
they're going to use it you know we
definitely need to hook up with your
existing security infrastructure for
example you need to allow people to log
into your system you say you said he and
a password even though it's a protection
laws - that information will be captured
by your system instead of the third
party system but at the back you still
have to need to have some authenticate
to handle that and in a company with a
lot of divisions and if they don't have
a single sign-on potentially you need to
support different realms and allow you
login to the different sub system in
your company - so I so also went through
this list of key components that mean to
be complete but some IDs to run by so we
talked about the oscillation and all
sonication so that's built on top of the
Oz 2004 specification and we have a
trapeze reverse proxy which handles the
API disparity examinations some
monitoring framework and you can do some
analytics stuff and a definite you need
to have some back-end infrastructure for
example to manager the client
registration and Neos to token and
manage all the publisher services and
also you need to do this matrix
aggregation because you potentially have
multiple instances of your IP I platform
and you have physical endpoints coming
before not balancer but you want to
aggregate all this information so that
you can have consistent view like say
for this sell party application
we sing that Nassau how many calls
that's that application made and to
visualize that from the operational
perspective or from the developer
statistical perspective you might want
to provide some visualization so so you
need to have a way to get your
developers on ball a so first of most of
time for example if you go to Facebook
you need to register your client
application and provide a whole bunch of
information right and as your
application access and equality API is
sometimes you want to have a snapshot
see or what's going on how many calls
what's the most popular API being hit by
my system and for developers they
probably need to have a easy way to
discover how many IP is going available
and what's the signature of the API look
like and even better if you can just
from within your process that we play we
solve with some basic IP eyes I and this
slide gives you kind of sequential view
when a particular IP I hate the endpoint
right so yeah HP request coming we
launched through some raw base track
detection to make sure it's not a denial
of service or some invasions from
hackers right now after that you need to
check the AUSA to token see if this
Austin token is valid and if it's valid
does that match the client claim of the
client ID or the user permission if yes
and we need to check against the
resource that this API tried to hate and
make sure the token has the Scopes which
represents the set of permissions
against the resources and sure we need
to do some you know matrix written
limiting stuff and maybe to speed up the
performance we have some cash in there
and sometimes we do some meditation and
once we finish all this stuff we figure
out okay this API is meant
you call a back-end server so then we do
the routing and approximate stuff and
you can hook with some Ana text
framework to give you a view like how
your API both behaved and what's the
best opportunities behind that right and
finally it hits the API logic which
could be a jack science resource which
talk to database and produce json or xml
representation of the response so I'm
going to spend some time look at us to
the low so maybe before I jump into the
details a quick poll like how many of
you are aware of force to the law and
how many of you actually are deploying
me us to the Lahaul as your server-side
infrastructure because I know a lot of
people using us to talk to Facebook talk
to Twitter well three days now loss to
the or yet but many talk to other
providers or to becomes the de facto
standard right and my trend we saw store
Austin Elektra's that was open source
project called Apache amber it's still
on the incubation but the whole stack
had pretty straightforward because as
you know the Oscars specification itself
is pretty straightforward but really to
make that available as a server side
solution you still have to build a bit
infrastructure to support and I sort of
identify some SP is which becomes the
integration point between the r2
framework or protocol against your
metadata infrastructure or security
infrastructure level overview of some of
the austere concepts also try to define
for different things
the first one is resource owner some
people call that the user that's the the
guy who actually almost the resource and
he tried
protect against being while a finger boy
if you create an album on Instagram like
you are the guy actually own your album
second why is the resource server that's
pretty much the back aim resource end
point to open up the restful resource of
some other information for example if
you go to Facebook the song server which
gives you a list of your friends at the
servants most confusing term because
when we talk about clients sometimes we
talk about fine server but nias to term
the client really represents a consumer
of the resource so it's basically a
application and also to try to
differentiate between a client and the
resource owner because when you try to
make a repair cost potentially two
identities are involved why is who which
application is to make the call
and secondly who's on behalf is the
application working because when you go
to a third party and they say I'm
Raymond mime try to you know use a
application from company XYZ try to
access my facebook resources the first
one is the infrastructure for us to call
authorization server so that's the one
responsible doing the authentication and
authorization and try to build up the
token has one level of interaction so
that you don't expose your credential
with your resource server directly to
the third party application this 45
Austria flows support and that can be
used for different scenarios so I just
kind of left here for the companies of
the material so the first one is also
chinko that's mostly for the server-side
web application the second one is in
place that that's based on the process
retraction and I try to exchange Neos
talking and the credentials URI
processor web page retraction
the third one and the fourth one most of
the time either can be used by your
internal components or used by trusted
third-party application because that
somehow involves a little bit sensitive
information for example the resource
owner password credential which try to
support a password based on
authentication and the password has the
opportunity to be captured by the
consumer side the client side and I try
to map some of the flaws into different
use cases so the first one it's the
trusted Klein I mean you really trust
the client application and that client
application could be a internal
application could be a mobile clients
developed by your own company and
release into the App Store so this to
potential flow you can use the first
flow is client credential for access
token and this one can be used for two
different cases wise for some resources
which don't really have an owner for
example you have a tax calculation
service right and the tax calculation
services economic to the user but you
don't want to have everybody from the
panel to use your tax calculation
service right so you want to protect our
resource with client credential which is
a client ID / client secret the second
one is if that resource also involve
like a user login for example if you
have a mobile application and you login
with your membership and you try to see
all your albums right well a floor you
can use this this resource on a password
flow but for third-party applications
even though we can stuff from the
internal consumers but at the end of the
day you want to be able to open up your
IP I to say party so that your ecosystem
will grow exponentially right so all
students
for that purpose and works pretty well
to support that kind of use cases so we
have two different flows to support that
the first one is the authorization code
flow right so that one the difference is
who actually gave the control of the
security information both of flow don't
expose the user ID and well at least
don't expose the user password to the
third party application but for the
first flow the server side application
gets the authorization code and exchange
for the AUSA to talking but for the
force flow the talkin goes directly back
to the browser with HTTP fragment and
that fragment is not sending back to the
suicide so only the user agent the
resource owner itself can use that us
talking from inside the JavaScript okay
so enough our view allows - so I guess
what's more interesting as all of
infrastructure plug-in point
so definitely to support us - you need
to have a concept of applying
application you need to register the
information with your system right so
for example you have the name of your
application and how are you going to do
authentication with the backend what's
important here is for some of the flows
because we don't ask for the client
secret
so this callback URI becomes pretty
critical because when we make a
redirection of the browser we want to
make sure the URI we are hitting it's a
safe URI and we use this registration
process to verify to validate to make
sure that you are as majestic URI right
so that's how to use this scheme to
guarantee the the flow is secure
second one because you try to open up a
whole bunch of resources right so the
resource has to be protected and the
typically you can partition your
resource or classify your resource into
a few different categories why it's okay
it's a popular resource and anybody can
hit it I don't care
the second one is okay sure it's not
related to the resource owner and then
really have a owner but I still want to
protect that resource I only allow
certain clients to access my resource so
that's the use case of a tax calculation
engine right now so let's say Y is the
most popular one basically it's a
resource which involves some user data
and we need to have a way to figure okay
based on the UI can you tell who's the
resource owner so some REST API has a
pattern to put the user ID as part of
your endpoint so therefore that one we
can actually use the pattern match to
figure out okay who owns the resource
and if not then we need to have a more
involved logic for example some back-end
resource and I have to do double check
to make sure it's the right user ID
hating these protected resources and
also you have this concept of the scope
so scope basically is a abstraction of
permissions for example I have address
book I have albums I have certain things
with a particular company right so how
you differentiate that is a different
sensitivity of the information for
example when you log into Facebook as a
third party can get some basic
information but if you want to ask the
email address you need to have
additional information right so that's
been model as a scoping oz2 and here's
some JSON representation of these two
set of metadata the then we talked about
the authentication and authorization
right so we have to do certain things to
make sure first of the client s the
register client and it has corresponding
cloudy and the client secret and when we
see our off to a token or authorization
code
I mean we need to do some database
lookup or checking to the signature to
make sure the talkin the code is valid
so there are few different ways to do
authentication
you can also make it against the client
application so that establish your
identity for your client application now
if you can do second level or what's
indication basically you can also
indicate against the resource owner
using the user credentials right now you
have build up access control less so
when a particular request coming you
make sure that identity has the right
permission to come into your system we
have been talking about the talkin quite
a bit and the talkin basically is up
extreme being generated by the
authorization server to represent the
permissions and a it's also related to
the identity being established for your
client application and the user
credentials and also has the expiration
date attached to that instead of
directly asking for the user ID password
basically all the protected resources
need to ask for me to access token right
so the token encapsulate all the
permissions the application has to
access the resources and in my extreme
we decide to use MongoDB as a way to
store the AWS to talk the use of the
pattern of AWS - token as typically you
request a token that's going to be a
write access right once you write a
record into your system for a period of
time before the Austin Hawkin get
expired
you actually most of the time - in lock
up using the AUSA to token as the
private key and the MongoDB actually
works pretty well for this kind of use
cases and it also is pre performed for
with heavy access so so far so good so
here's some timeline which kind of grew
all the different pieces we have been
talking about together right so here's
the typical us to service our
infrastructure you might have to build
up to support your system as the astute
other provider right so we kind of list
all the different pieces and I try to
group the different end point into the
Austin concept for example if you look
at your also issue server we have two
end points why it's the oscillation end
point and the other one is a token end
point right name the resource server
actually have kind of like a resource
filter look at the Austin talking and
make sure that token actually represent
the right set of information and if you
look at the other boxes basically that's
the SPI implementations to deal with
some of the metadata for example you
have a client registration manager which
understand all the client registrations
and we have the O's indicators which
understand the resource owner
authentication and we have the token
manager which understand or the
authorization code and also some tokens
right and we have the resource access
manager which do is the SEO stuff and a
behind-the-scenes they're whole bunch o
database or store used to pack all this
infrastructure component right and
finally if everything is fine then we
goes to this HCP reverse proxy to hit
the protected resources at the back end
so Oliver diagram about the scope so we
talked about the scope as a
representation of permissions so
whenever all still talkin come see it
actually has a few attribute a ch2 yet
so first of all we understand which
client application the talking was
generated before right and the secondary
who's the resource owner behind the
token and then we have one or more
scopes to decide okay if this token is a
lot to access your friends list
if this token is allows you to see your
email right so that's a scope concept
and for
of the protecta resources you can
potentially say okay for this path we
need to allow require while this goes
for example you try to get an email and
then we probably need to have an email
scope for that to support all the
different things we have kind of UML
diagram to show some of the attribute
required to make this happen
right so the most critical is the
current registration and the arts to
talking so it gives you some basic idea
like when you try to model your oz to
pack and the metadata here's the things
you probably have to look at it and
because we're talking about API sway so
who are used we need develop
applications against api's so we need to
have developers coming on board and
because API gives you a lot of things
and we need to have a way to manage the
client resource that kind of stuff so we
need to build up some UI to handle that
and potentially when we provide a
dashboard for developers for your enemy
Stratos so that you can see what's going
on right so you can actually monitor all
the API usage by the client ID by the
resource owner ID by the resource your
eyes or by a timeline and you probably
need to allow the developers coming into
your system say ok how many times my API
is being called and what's the average
of performance what the permissions
being graded and how many token becomes
expired that kind of stuff what's
interesting we find out a pretty nice
approach to handle the validator I saw
basically we open up the metadata itself
as a whole bunch of recipe eyes so you
can directly access this metadata or the
usage through the API so you can
actually get a list of defined scope so
you
some detailed information about a scope
you can also get a list of protected
resources
what do you our pattern and you can
display what's behind a token that owned
by you right so certain things like that
and we can actually apply the same
infrastructure for this set of metadata
API is basically we use the oz2 api to
protect all this metadata API especially
for the sensitive information like a
level performance information so we used
to emit a to give up a whole bunch o not
testing right so the the picture is of a
smoke if you look at the numbers most of
them to get us talking as on the 10
millisecond kind of scope right and this
was kind of master against some
government servers so if we have high
end server it could be better
all right so switchgear assuming we
already have a stew infrastructure which
can do all the authentication
authorization stuff right now the API
need to hit the real logic so we need to
have a proxy a reverse proxy built into
the API server which understand how to
do the routing how to dispatch large B
request from the API server to the real
server that hosts the resources so my
ideas don't try to mix this two type of
traffic onto one server box because for
API server most of time they just do
authentication authorization and we need
to have the trooper to handle the skill
we need to support right and it's pretty
much like I all intensive because we
take the HB request and we kind of fell
off to different back-end servers so we
don't really do any magic so we pretty
much take the Apache HTTP
component especially the httpclient to
fill out this proxy and actually the
code is pretty straightforward
it's Nam it's probably only a three or
four pages of code but in the real
deployment we actually run into quite a
few issues with this proxy stuff
especially from the connection
management perspective because we try to
maintain a pool of persistent HTTP
connections so that the API server can
have pre performed connection back to
the backend service but it turns out we
have a few issues for example the keeper
life that's how long you're going to
keep your presence tonight should be
connection alive for reuse it's really
depending on the backend server for
example if your back-end server is a
tomcat server and you set up your keeper
life for cert 8 30 seconds that means if
the connection becomes idle for 30
seconds the service is can you close
that connection right so that means your
can now reuse that connection anymore so
my idea could be for the API server you
can have a different connector being
config for the Tomcat server which try
to support this nature of the
persistency but if the connection is for
the public access then you don't want to
make the keep alive for two now the
second one is some engines back home
because that's another popular web
server for PHP word some version of the
engine server tends to pull the trunk
mode so when you dispatch the request
from the Internet to the backend you
might have to get the whole same build
up the content names they shoot to the
backend sometimes the the service is
pretty tricky sometimes when you try to
get attribute connection so you retrieve
the information back from the response
for the HP client one important IPI you
need to remember
no matter if the response is a normal
response or itself or one of I mean 500
response
make sure you consume the content so
that's how you notify the connection
pool you are done with the HIV
connection then that connection can be
released back to the pool right so I put
a link here so if you want to look at
how you can make this super flexible and
fit your requirements you can take a
look at that so loading proxy we
actually just do a pretty
straightforward routing so we decide to
adopt the check size templating as a way
to describe the the routing table so
incoming requests with some passed
fragments right then we dispatch to the
back end right so this sort of explains
like how we can potentially allows you
to construct an API that's friendly to
login user for example you put a be
yourself then because for each other all
still talking where I should know which
resource owners behind that so we can't
use that one to replace me so that the
back camp can see the use ID instead of
her code the user ID in the system so we
also experiment a little bit like
between event-driven proxy or just
synchronous proxy so I played Alaba with
the Tomcat 6 with the 7 at $2 of 5
engine and using the Apache HTTP client
directly and I also used the Comcast
server which supports the 300 and there
you see apache HPA Sandra's Kline the
beta 2 so here sell a backer if you want
to do the asynchronous fashion but
performance wise sure we are seeing a
little boost by the asynchronous
invocation but not so much so really
depend on the nature of your IP I so if
it's very I owe in 10 step
and you want to have the maximum
throughput you probably need to try
async but for most of the case the
synchronous invocation works pretty well
even though I'm pretty much like Java
but not the GS is pretty attractive to
you so we did some extreme and say ok
what if we use not address as the
platform for API server even though we
we like the event driven model but the
result at least from our testing is not
impressive so we see job goes well
beyond the the benchmark we are seeing
from the knowledge s even a lot of
people argue about that but at least
from my own testing for my use case
looks like Java is doing much better job
now I have a few more slides kind of
talk about some additional things
so one thing we have been talking about
as the API tracking
so I finally a pre-clear open source
framework called it's actually being
open source by Yama it's really in Java
and they provide the base infrastructure
to do the matrix stuff for example
suppose a contest timers and and for
timers and support like the standard
deviation maximum anymore 90th
percentile that kind of stuff right but
what seem just even more interesting is
support a whole bunch of reporters some
reporters hook up with DMX some
reporters talk to the crowd for tied API
server that the visualization server
right so that gives us a basic way to
plugging the matrix mediation to support
systems a few more slides are because we
talked about we need to have a way to
get developers on board right and I find
out a few interesting things around this
area
so typically we need to build up some
API soar tools
the application developers to discover
and explore the api's because when we
start the portal with our internal
consumers the most commonly asked
question is okay sure you have this API
can you give me a like a sample like a
JSON input output whatever Hatters
should it be that and what the
expectations for the HCP code that kind
of stuff right so we need to have
something to serve that purpose and
especially we model the backend resource
using Jack sighs so a has a lot of
interesting annotations which give us a
picture how your API sort of looks like
so we study a few open source tools and
we kind of like the first one the best
it's a cost wagger and second one is
from Google
that's a Google API discovery so I put a
snapshot of this swagger UI for your
reference so it gives you a list of all
the IP eyes and the first column using
different color to represent okay if
it's a get a delete or pool then the UI
or pattern right then you can actually
have some information so what what does
this API do and even more better as it
gives you the sandbox which allows you
to fill in all this information for
example this one try to get something by
old ID so you have actually tapping all
IDs so you can run the API directly from
here right so it's pretty nice and this
framework actually have innovation with
a lot of common checks ice pack hands so
it can do a lot job to interest back and
a build up API spec so that the UI can
work against this back and the you got
the UI itself as reading html5 and the
decoupled from the backend you know
annotation so a what's against the spec
so if you can come up with respect from
some other sources this UI works pretty
well too and this set of open source
framework also allows you to based on
the API spec to generate the client code
support like all kind of programming
languages Java PHP
Ruby objective-c so if you have this
tour it could be a quick stutter for you
alright so that's pretty much all for
the material so I'm going to live maybe
