four short videos looking at the sample
otbi dashboards and reports that I've
posted on customer connect my name is
Caroline gladwyn and I work as a
solution consultant in the Oracle UK HCM
team in this final video we'll be having
a look at some of the more complex
reports that use a union query will then
be looking at how you can add and extend
content to these samples by creating a
new page and adding some new reports and
dashboards so the first thing we're
going to look at in this demonstration
is to have a look at the use of a union
query and some of the more complex
reports now a union query can be really
useful where you're wanting to maybe
combine a condition where something has
happened with a condition where it
hasn't happened so the example I'm going
to use to take you through this is
around performance documents and whether
or not those documents have been created
or not so if I come into my performance
document not created report we can see
an example of using a union query now
the display of the results tab is a
little different on a union query
because on the left hand side it gives
you the message saying that the
information can't be displayed in effect
because there's more than one set of
criteria to display now this particular
report is returning me any assignments
that don't have a performance document
associated with them how is it doing
that so if I look at the criteria tab
let's have a look at how the report is
set up it's basically made of two
separate queries so the top query is
going to return me a list of everybody I
have who has an assignment so we can see
here the information that's returned is
simply the assignment number and the
conditions that are applied to the
report now I do check that the person's
start date is actually after the date
that the performance document is valid
so hopefully I won't get people who
shouldn't have this performance document
anyway what I then do is I have a second
query and this returns all of the people
who do have a performance document of
the type in question at the right pit
time period
and then what I do is I use the union
operator to do your - between those two
sets of data so in reality what I'm
doing here is I'm taking all of my
people and then subtracting away those
people who have already got a
performance document which is why this
report then returns me a list of
assignments where there is no
performance document created for that
assignment now you'll notice where I've
got my mouse pointing that you can do
all sorts of different types of Union
operators so intersections and unions
are also supported and if you're unsure
how to add it to the report it's using
this icon over here on the right hand
side now I recommend you take a little
bit of time to work through these
particular reports that use Union
operators and make sure you understand
what's happening with them there are
also several examples in the succession
area of the sample dashboards now the
final thing I'd like to talk about in
this video is about adding and extending
the content that we've provided and I'd
like you to take you through an example
of adding a new dashboard page with some
content and talking about some of the
things that you might wish to think
about doing with your reports so let's
take a look at adding a particular
dashboard page the example I'm going to
show you is adding a page around absence
accruals
so what I've done is taking the standard
layout of the dashboard pages that we've
looked at I've created a dashboard
prompt that will go on the left-hand
side of the page and I've created a
report that I want to have on the
right-hand side so let's see how easy it
is to add this new page to the existing
sample dashboards if I go up and have a
look at the sample dashboards then we
can see the pages that already exist so
I want to add this one in after my
absence tab so here's my absence
information and the way that I add a new
page is by choosing the Edit dashboard
link once I'm into the dashboard
designer the first thing I need to do is
to add the new page so I'll click on the
add dashboard page and I'm going to call
this accruals I may then wish to put it
in a specific place so I can choose the
dashboard properties
to move the taps around so I'd like my
accruals to display between absence and
profiles so I'm going to highlight my
accruals tab move it all the way to the
front and then move it back to between
absence and profiles I can also at this
point choose some of the other page
settings now if I want this page should
look similar to the other ones a quick
way to do that is to go to the shared
folders custom dashboards and actually
copy the content from one of the
existing pages onto my page to get me
started
so say for example I want to copy the
information from the absence tab then I
can basically just drag that on to my
accruals page and say yes now what this
gives me is the basic layout of the
columns and the sections now clearly I
don't want the same content as I've got
at the moment so I can remove the
existing prompt and all of the other
reports and dashboards that are there to
make sure that my page is basically of
the right format but doesn't have any
content in it so you can see how easy it
is to delete that content out what I
have in my accruals area is one prompt
and one - one-on-one report that I would
like to include so if I go down to where
I've built that content I find the
folder that I've built my new content in
and it's simply a question of picking up
the content and dragging it into the
appropriate area on the page so there's
my accrual prompt in the prompt section
and here's my report the accrual balance
by employee
I'd like to drag that in twice because
I'm going to take advantage of a
technique I talked about in the earlier
video of having the same report on the
dashboard page twice but with a
different view highlighted now I'm not
going to need these two extra sections
down at the bottom here so I can now
delete those out and I've got the basics
of the page that I want but I still need
to update a couple of other things so I
don't want this page to be called the
absence management summary I'd like it
to be called the accruals management
summary so I can simply update that
textual
and because I copied the absence page
originally that's why I'm not having to
set up all of these different sections
from scratch on this top area the
accrual balance by employee I'd like to
make sure that it's showing the metrics
view so here I can see I can specify the
metrics view on the second entry I'm
quite happy for it to show the default
compound so I'll just leave that as it
is but what I would like is I'd like for
this section not to be called absence
breakdown but instead to be called
accruals breakdown so I'll change the
word absence and just type in my new
title you can see here how quick and
easy it is to create a page when you cut
start by copying another one the other
thing I'm going to do at this point
which I didn't have in any of the pages
but I thought it'd be interesting for
you to see is to drag across this folder
icon and place it underneath the
sections that I've already got what the
folder icon allows me to do is just
point this part of the dashboard to a
folder of reports which allows the end
user to just select a report and run it
as opposed to having to have everything
displayed directly in the screen it can
be useful where you've got numerous
maybe listing styles of reports and
allows easy access to a number of
different areas so here we can see my
accruals page folder and I'm just going
to specify that this particular folder
icon points at that location and I'm
going to ask for it to be expanded as
standard so we'll see how that looks now
if I just save this page away and then
run what I'm going to have is a
dashboard page which shows me my
accruals information and has the same
basic layout and format as the other
dashboards delivered in the sample
information so here we can see on the
left-hand side I have my selections on
the right hand side I have a textual
piece of information for my summary for
my title and I also have the metrics
underneath and the supporting detail
below that we can see here I've produced
a couple of reports that look at the
number of days that employees have left
to use on their accruals and also down
here at the bottom I've got a couple of
additional report
around team absence balances which I'll
mention in a second now one of the
things that's slightly different about
this example and isn't specifically
covered in the samples that I've
provided on customer connect is the
ability in the dashboard prompts to
provide an area where people can enter
some information simply by typing that
value in so here what I've got is I've
got a dashboard that allows me to look
at the extent to which my employees are
taking their holidays early enough in
the year so I've specified a target that
I'd like everyone to take at least one
and a half days of holiday per month
during the year so that now that we're
in June of this particular year people
should have taken nine days and I'm then
comparing that to where they are in
terms of their remaining balances and
this chart on the right hand side here
is being colored accordingly now if I
wanted to update that target maybe I
want everyone to have taken three days
each month then I can simply overwrite
the one and a half and click out of the
box and it will then update the reports
you can see that because I'm now
expected people to have taken 18 days of
holiday by this point in the year that
all of the employees are now showing in
red you can include this kind of
interaction on any of the dashboard
prompts it uses a technique called
presentation variables which I haven't
covered in this video but you can easily
look up on the internet instructions on
how to use presentation variables link
to a dashboard prompt now the final
thing that I'd like to just mention on
this particular dashboard is the folder
information at the bottom as this users
will more technique than you may find of
use if I open up the team absence
balance report I'm logged in as a
manager called Richard McIntyre and what
this report is going to look for is any
holiday that's been taken within Richard
McIntyre's team within the current year
and I've deliberately set it up such
that Richards team have not taken any
holiday and therefore he's not able to
see any information but the way this
report is built behind the
means is that it understands who's
currently logged into the system it
understands what the current year is and
it therefore only brings back the
relevant holiday so let's briefly have a
look at how that's set up and then let's
log in as a manager who does have some
holiday within their team and see that
the report does return data for them so
first of all let's have a look at the
report if I go to the report within the
catalog then you'll be able to see
exactly how that's been set up so here's
my team absence balance report and it's
using a couple of different techniques
if I have a look at the criteria tab
then one of the things it does is it
limits the absence date to only be
within the current year so again this is
one of these filters that we talked
about in the earlier videos that make
reports flexible based on the time year
is a standard function that simply
returns the year of whatever date it's
told about the second condition enables
us to limit this report to the person
who's logged in so what this is looking
for is any absences where the manager of
the person being absent is equal to the
person who's currently logged into the
system so if I just edit that condition
you can see it's very simple to setup
you simply pick the standard column
within the accrual real time subject
there it'll call manager user name and
you make that equal to a session
variable called user you can use this
same technique on any subject area that
has the manager username exposed once
you've done that the report basically
checks prior to running who is logged
into the system what their user name is
and then only returns absences for that
particular manager so let's have a look
at that in practice if I just sign out
of the system now is Richard McIntyre
I'm going to sign back in as a lady
called Cassandra Dale who has some
absences within her team so here we are
you can see I'm now logged in as
Cassandra Dale she's a manager of a team
who've taken some absence it's exactly
the same report as we were just looking
at
so you can see here the team absence
balance report but this time if I go in
and have a look at it as Cassandra then
because her manager username matches
some of the people who've taken absence
she gets returned to her her own team's
view of the absence that's been taken
now this is an incredibly useful
technique where you're trying to build
for example a manager dashboard you
might want to limit all of the reports
to only bring back the data for that
managers team and this technique using
the manager username and linking it to
the username of the person currently
logged into the system is a very
effective way of delivering that type of
information so that ends this final
video where we've had a look at the use
of Union queries in some of the more
complex reports which can be very useful
where you're trying to combine a
condition where something is true with a
condition where it isn't we've then
finished off by looking at a couple of
examples of how you might like to extend
the sample content that's been provided
the example I used was around accruals
and the ability to build a page quickly
to be able to include a dashboard prompt
that used a presentation variable to
allow the end user to overwrite some
numbers and do some simple scenarios and
then finally the team absence report
that limited the data that was returned
to the manager that was currently logged
into the system and if that manager had
no absence it returned no data but where
the manager had absence it returned the
information for their particular team I
hope you found these four videos of use
and that you're now in a position to
take advantage of the valley delivered
by these sample otbi dashboards they
have been designed to give you a quick
start to delivering your reports and
dashboards
