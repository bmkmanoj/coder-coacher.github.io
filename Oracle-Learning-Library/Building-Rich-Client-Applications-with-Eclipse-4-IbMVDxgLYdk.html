Eclipse Foundation my role there is a
director of open source projects
basically that means a couple of things
first off my my job is to help the great
many projects and committers at Eclipse
we actually have about 260 odd different
open source projects running at the
Eclipse Foundation and a little over a
thousand committers people who actually
have write access to our source code
repositories and my job is to help make
them successful one of the unfortunate
implications of that is helping
everybody else and be successful means
that I don't get to play with technology
quite as much as I as I as I'm
comfortable with my training is actually
in software development and that's what
I prefer to do so I've been using
eclipse rich client platform RF for
Eclipse from Eclipse for for a little
while but to be honest I haven't done
anything real with it so if you push me
too hard with questions Michael I may
not have a good answer
but anyway I'm hoping that I can give
you a good overview of what's what's in
the Eclipse for riches for and from
there you can take that for further
study and ultimately success with the
Eclipse platform before I begin who is
an eclipse user today in just a show of
hands anybody not in Eclipse user does
anybody who here has an eclipse Bugzilla
account it's always heartwarming for me
to to look out on a crowd and realize
that there are so many people out there
who have just never had a problem with
Eclipse thank you so much for laughing
anyway so my agenda today talk about
what Eclipse RCP is now inevitably when
I deliver a talk along these lines
somebody is here to learn about what's
new for IDE users so I'll talk a little
bit about that give you a couple of
hints about what's that but primarily
this is about the
client platform people building
applications based on top of eclipse
technology and with that I'll spend a
considerable amount of time talking
about the dependency injection mechanism
and the Model Gy and a few other aspects
of user interface construction I'll wrap
up with a little discussion about JavaFX
and I don't have too much to say about
that unfortunately the experts in that
field well hi just fortunately the
experts in that field are actually at
the conference if you do run into Tom
Jindal his he carries a considerable
expertise in that particular area so
start off with just a little bit of an
overview eclipse is probably best known
for being an IDE it's a pretty darn good
Java IDE it has a few warts here and
there but by and large it revolutionized
the IDE market and continues to be the
front runner in terms of adoption in the
IDE space now it may actually come as a
surprise to some people in the audience
that eclipse was never actually intended
or certainly wasn't exclusively intended
to be an IDE Eclipse was intended to
solve an integration problem the problem
that software development faced in the
late 90s was that we had lots of
different tools that use lots of
different technologies and the the
intersection points between the tools
were a little bit rough so the Eclipse
was originally created to provide a
platform onto which different tools
could be integrated and part of that was
to build an IDE framework in fact most
of us have probably heard of Eclipse
being a modular environment built using
plugins I generally you're oftentimes
comes as a surprise to people to learn
that Eclipse is almost entirely plugins
there's a very small tiny tiny core of
stuff in Eclipse that's not a plug-in
but everything the workbench the package
manager the package Explorer all of the
menu items that you see all of the menu
items that you see are actually
contributed through plugins and you can
turn Eclipse into a very
resting IDE by removing the Java
development tools plugins with that you
wind up with an IDE that manages files
and has some cool menus and stackable
views and all that cool stuff but if you
take that that core base Eclipse IDE you
can put the CDT on top of it for c and
c++ c n + C and C++ development as
support the PHP development tools
through the PDT project provides some
plugins for that so the idea is we have
this platform for providing
functionality to developers of different
forms so if you were to look at my
Eclipse environment you'll see that I
have the Java tools I have PHP support I
have some JavaScript support I have some
server management stuff and I do all of
that work from within Eclipse one of my
favorite little tools that almost nobody
knows about is the remote systems
Explorer RSC which you can get out of
our Juneau repository with that you can
connect directly to SFTP server's FTP
servers and whatnot and just directly
edit files on an FTP server from within
eclipse and certainly you know the
obvious stuff moving files back and
forth is really easy to more general
than that more than general than just
being an IDE framework we've we see
Eclipse being used as a generic tools
framework so you have the BIRT project
for example builds reporting tools and
these tools are used by not software
developers but business analysts to
build reports and run reports and do all
that kind of wonderful stuff we have
modeling tools web development tools
lots of other tools that sit on top of
this this wonderful framework and
integrate very well the plug-in
architecture lets you do some fairly
tight integration on the glass with some
very loose coupling on the back which is
which is pretty cool you know
functionality appears just by virtue of
plugins existing in the in the mix more
general than that and this this actually
started to happen around the Eclipse 2.1
time frame that's a long time ago some
organizations started to recognize that
more than just tools and I des
the Eclipse framework which provides
stackable views and man
aged windows and managed menus and a
component model that allowed you to
bring a whole bunch of neat stuff
together and have it all integrate very
very well was just a generally useful
thing to have
we had organizations like NASA for
example had a had a problem with their
heads had a similar integration problem
and they actually have they actually use
Eclipse RCP as a base for the Prada
programs that their mission controllers
use to control the spaceships and
experiments running on on rockets and
all that kind of neat stuff there's
actually some RCP base stuff running in
some of the new Rovers and sorry not the
Rovers they've got these moon buggies
there they're working on the JPL we're
showing this showed this off at the at
one of our Eclipse con conferences so
it's very cool it got Eclipse as an
application framework controlling space
vehicles the Star Trek nerd in me is
terribly excited about this so basically
if you take all the things that make an
eclipse an IDE and that's things like
refactoring support and the team support
integration with git or CVS or
subversion or all those sorts of things
you take all of those out you're left
with just a generally useful framework
for building applications that sits at a
higher level than a lot of the widget
toolkits that are out there a lot of
people build applications for the
desktop based on swing or JavaFX or
other component models this is a little
higher level of abstraction above those
sorts of things something actually that
came about a few years ago is a group of
people decided that this framework was
generally interesting and they adapted
the Eclipse application framework that
what we call the rich client platform
into a web based Ajax platform so so the
idea is you build your application using
standard Eclipse tools to build your
plugins with views and all of that and
then it renders in a browser so it runs
Eclipse runs on the server rendering in
the browser and that that's come about
through the the Eclipse Rapp project
which currently stands for rich ajax
platform there
changing their name but anyway that's
some cool stuff so you can you can use
rich Ajax platform to build using the
the wonderful Eclipse tools and deploy
to a browser so as promised a little bit
of a discussion of what's in Eclipse for
the four users if you're just using
Eclipse to build Java applications we
have a new look for you with some fancy
gradients and the quick access menu is
pretty cool in eclipse 3.7 3.6 I think
supported it if you type control 3 and
just start typing something it will find
commands or views or preferences that
match what you're typing and take you
directly to them the quick access does
something similar if you just put your
cursor in there and type JRE it'll it'll
it'll take you directly to the JRE
preferences page and in the Preferences
dialog that's pretty cool stuff but
anyway that's been around for a little
while the other thing that you can do is
that you can click now at the corners of
where the different view stacks join and
you can you can move in both directions
I know I know I know
so this is not meant to be little the
the accomplishments of the Eclipse
platform team which have actually been
been fantastic the probably what it
really more just lets you know that
there's not a lot of new stuff in
Eclipse for for people who are just
using the IDE to to build to build job
applications that wasn't the focus the
focus was to make it easier to build
Eclipse based products now having said
that there's a lot of other things going
on at Eclipse and a lot of the stuff
that I'm showing on this slide has been
coming for a very long time we have the
Hudson project has moved to eclipse so
we have some some build technologies
brewing there and now the value that
Hudson is getting from being at Eclipse
is we have some IP management some
community involvement there's lots of
wonderful stuff going on there but the
Milan project also has some direct
integration from the Eclipse from an
eclipse based IDE to Hudson or Jenkins
so you can do direct management of your
build technologies directly from the
Eclipse IDE and then there's some
wonderful integration between that and
issue trackers so you can connect to
bugzilla or track or JIRA lots of
different issue trackers can be directly
accessed from within the Eclipse IDE and
again there's some integration between
that and the build technology
integration with maven with the mtoui
project that we have ability to support
for building and managing pom files and
and running B maven doing maven based
build sorts of things the Milan project
also has a reviews Milan reviews project
provides integration with Garrett so
again I can do direct integration with
my Garrett server and with from directly
within the IDE and of course get is
something that's been coming coming on
very strong at eclipse we started
looking at git in 2006 I think was the
first time we started looking at it
where we dismissed it and said this is
ridiculous but over the years we've
really come to embrace it and now we're
we're actually we're at a point now
where at the Eclipse Foundation we have
deprecated the use of CVS for open
source projects and all of our open
source projects are migrating to get
we're upwards of about a little over 60%
of our projects are now running git
exclusively and of course integration
with git based repositories is an
important part of that and the egit
project and the jacott project are
providing that I encourage everybody to
get directly involved with these
projects if these are things that you're
you're curious about and frankly if
you're trying to get involved in a
project and they're not being helpful
tell me Wayne it eclipse.org I try
really hard to encourage a work I work a
lot to encourage our projects to operate
openly so that they are accepting of
contributions from the committed
community so application lifecycle
management is to become a huge thing at
Eclipse and in fact we a lot of our
projects use a lot of this technology as
part of their of their their build
processes and their their sort of
day-to-day processes we have projects
for example that use garrett integrate
garrett with Hudson so when somebody
contributes something through
it kicks off a Hudson build and Hudson
tells Garrett hey this thing built okay
and there's some wonderful very
wonderful technology that happens with
with this application lifecycle
management technology this one's a
little bit subtle it's something that
many of you if you've been using eclipse
4.2 for a little while now you've been
using it and may not have even
recognized that you realize that you
were using it one of the bigger
challenges that we as developers face is
finding what what it is that we need to
do the Milan project actually does
anyone use Milan you need to look up
Milan Milan will change your life
Milan and code recommenders are about
making your life as a developer easier
if you look at I got - I've got an
editor screenshot of an editor open here
I've created a table viewer which is a
user interface widget I think it's
probably obvious what it is the first
thing I next thing I do is viewer dot
now what's happening is if I look at all
of the methods that Viewer supports
there's a lot of them and I'm really not
always sure what'll make enough of these
to remember what you know what the steps
are that I need to do but code
recommenders is saying you know
everybody that makes a table viewer sort
of the thing they're most likely to do
after they create a table viewer is
provide a content provider so that that
table can show content less often
they're providing a label provider right
so basically they've taken usage
statistics the kinds of things that
developers are actually doing and they
figure out what you're most likely going
to want to do and they put those options
at the top that will save you some time
I know that it really helped me go
through some of these examples like I
said I don't get the right code all that
often anymore so I kind of forget this
sort of this stuff and recommenders did
a great job of helping me figure out
what I needed to do another thing and I
can't talk about this for too long
because I can get caught taken away by
this is a Ryan Oh Ryan is our
to basically a new run at its a new
technology that runs in a browser so
Ryan Orion is primarily JavaScript
although there is some server some
Eclipse server aspects to it as well but
the idea is that you connect to a Ryan
hub or you can go to a Ryan hub hub org
today get an account and start using
this
it's basically JavaScript editing in the
browser also supports CSS there's some
work going on to support PHP there's a
lot of talk about Java support but we
haven't gotten there yet so the idea is
that your browser becomes the IDE and
one browser page is an editor you go to
another browser page and that's a
navigator one of the things that they've
done is they've learned a lesson we
tried a few years ago as part of the
Eclipse four effort to bring Eclipse
into the browser and we found that we
spend entirely too much time fighting
the browser browsers like doing things
one way I des sort of like doing things
another way so what they've done is
started over with Orion and this is
acknowledging that the browser is in
charge and I'm working with that so you
can actually have multiple multiple
editors open and they're just other
pages there's other tabs in your browser
you can move you know just whatever the
browser supports if you can turn you
know your browser let you have open
multiple windows so you can have
multiple windows open it'll actually
allows you to run your JavaScript the
you know it does sort of mini servers
that allow you to run run your
JavaScript directly from the source code
itself on the server anyway some very
cool stuff I invite you to take a look
at Orion if you care about JavaScript
editing and like I said Oh Ryan hub org
is a place you can go to try it out the
one thing that I will advise you is
Orion hub lets you do things like pull
from other git repositories and and work
on a Ryan hub it doesn't do so securely
right now it doesn't support SSL the
other caveat is every once in a while we
have to blow away the contents of the
server so don't leave anything there
that you like
apparently the porn industry has gotten
us to a point where if somebody was to
put something unsavory on the server
we'd have to deal with that and right
now how we deal with that is blow
everything away anyway so back to the
topic what is the rich client rich
client runs on the desktop can run in a
browser too and again live with rap we
support that sort of thing
platform independent managed windows
menus and toolbars it's got to be
something more than just a widget
toolkit we first have to have widgets
you need to have tables and trees and
labels and push buttons and all that
kind of neat stuff a component model
when I looked up rich client the first
time I started talking about rich
clients I said I looked it up and it
said see fat client I contend that they
are different fat clients tend to be
these monolithic things that we built in
the early 90s rich clients tend to be
more dynamic that you know again
factored into components updatable
extensible having a decent component
model makes both of those things really
easy I have a picture down here this is
sort of the mental model that I tended
to tend to form when I think of a rich
client is a rich client is talking to
some back-end service which is then
talking to a database some parts of the
application are there on the application
server some parts are actually in the
client although that's not necessarily
the case rich clients can just be
completely standalone things there's no
no restriction for this from a an
eclipse ecosystem point of view the
Eclipse rich client platform sort of
fits in here somewhere
we have Equinox at the bottom Equinox is
our component model it's based on the
OSGi spec OSGi is the component model
that you can use in java today why wait
till Jeff of 15 for a component model
okay no that was supposed to be funny
all right and thank you for laughing at
me thinking it was supposed to be funny
so Equinox again OSGi if you're looking
for a component model for something
today take a look at OSGi equinox is the
reference implementation on top of
equinox it's the rich client platform on
top of that there's the tools platform
on top of tools is the IDE platform so
you have all these sort of layers of
plugins that provide increasing levels
of functionality on top of which
everything sits so I got the Java
development tools and the plug-in
development environment on top of the
Java development tools so if we if we
just look over
here on the the right side though I have
my rich client application sits on top
of the rich client platform and you know
kind of does it can actually you can
actually use other aspects there's no
rules that say you can't use aspects
from the tool tools platform but simply
simply put it's the it's just the stuff
on top they're rich server applications
or something we started to see around
the 3.0 time frame a lot of
organizations started to recognize that
the OSGi Equinox thing that we had that
was our component model underneath
everything was just generally useful for
building headless applications and
servers to the point now where we see
application servers many of them are
running on OSGi including GlassFish and
Jonas and WebSphere sort of so OSGi is
an equinox in particular used by a lot
of organizations just to build servers
now sometimes here eclipse four and
efore used interchangeably just just for
those of you that are that care
efore is actually what we call an
incubator project in Eclipse it's a
place where some ideas are experimented
on and grown incubated at some point
things leave the incubator many things
left the e4 incubator to become part of
Eclipse for some of those things
actually became part of three eclipse
3.7 and 3.8 as well we've actually got
some compatibility layers that allow the
Eclipse 3x plugins to function on the on
the new technology so in terms of the
differences if you've been building
stuff with Eclipse 3-3 and yet with the
clips for now we've got an updated
programming model almost everything now
was running on Java 5 prior to that we
were almost all of our plugins in the 3x
stream ran on a Java 1 4 which was a
little bit limiting but what in terms of
functionality that could be used but it
meant that the platform could be used in
lots of different environments so on
small devices and and and whatnot that
didn't have the job of 5 support but
anyway so we've updated we're all the
way up to Java 5 now some plugins are
actually being very radical
going as far as Java six it's exciting
times we have the modeled workbench
which we'll talk about briefly much of
of the new stuff in four is all services
based heavy use of dependency injection
one of the big design points for Eclipse
for was to remove the heavy dependence
on the singleton pattern there's a lot
of Singleton's in the 3x stream which
made it really hard to do things like
make a server based on eclipse that
served more than one customer so so a
lot of the work was done to remove all
those Singleton's and they've done a
fantastic job of that and we're pretty
well situated right now to say set up an
eclipse for base server on the backend
that did all your compiling static
analysis all that neat stuff
serving Orion based clients within
browsers which I think would be a pretty
cool thing to have if anyone's
interested in working on that please
come and see me and the simplified API
the the modeled UI is based on the
Eclipse modeling framework EMF and we
have these wonderful xmi files which are
files that you can force someone to read
if you really hate them
so the the center point is this
application dottie for xmi file and it
describes i'll show you with a little
bit hint of what this looks like
i won't show you the xmi because that's
just cruel but it just describes the
structure of your application and you
have the ability to add fragments to
that so you can say I've got this core
bit of my application it's got these
window these these views or these parts
and then add other views and parts and
menus and other types of contributions
into that core bit of application so
what we wind up with in this model is a
hierarchy of parts so I'm showing here
on the on the Left this is actually a
snapshot of a win of an editor that we
have for defining the the model and
you'll notice if I scroll it if you move
down to
controls there's a perspective stack
inside the perspective stack I have a
perspective inside the perspective I
have some controls a part sash container
a and then the part sash container
contains a part stack that has a couple
of parts and there's another part in
here so now that model renders on the
screen as I show here on the right
you'll see that extra info and producer
are stacked on top of each other and
have tabs these are two parts that are
sitting in a part or sorry there's that
are sitting in a part stack by sitting
in the part stack they wind up with tabs
so that you can switch between them and
they sit on top of each other
the consumer however is sitting outside
of the part stack and it as you'll
notice doesn't have the tab or all of
that neat stuff it doesn't conform to
you know what we traditionally think
when in Eclipse they're all these view
stacks that all have tabs and stuff well
we can set components outside of those
those tabs if we choose I've got some
linkage between them I click on
something in producer and then consumer
displays it that's just sort of some
implementation stuff so if I change
things around a little bit inside my
perspective I just have a part stack now
under the controls I have a part stack
and that part stack has three different
parts and those three different parts
are all stacked on top of each other
with tabs because that's what I've
specified there's no let me go back
there's no sash container the sash
container gives me two halves in this
case I have a sash container that
destroyed splits the screen vertically I
can also make a sash container sorry a
sash container split the screen
horizontally you'll notice too that the
tabs here are a little bit different in
shape I was messing around with the CSS
a little bit and I'll show you that in a
few slides
so another variation here I have a
perspective stack that has two parts
Ashe containers I've got one part sash
container it contained within another so
the the top one under
Controls has a horizontal split and the
the one that nested underneath it has a
vertical split so we see that the
producer and the consumer are beside
each other and that puts the extra info
down at the bottom anyway just a couple
of ideas so basically by manipulating
the model I can change how my
application gets rendered and then again
I can put you I can use fragments to
insert other components so if I if I
needed another type of part and I wanted
it to participate in this as well I can
have a separate plug-in that contributes
that and then it will dynamically decide
if I'm going to include that plug-in or
not at runtime so to edit the model I
have this wonderful editor the editor
itself if you want to get access to it
it's actually not been released this is
a we're still kind of in the early days
of Eclipse 4 and the some of the tools
that we use for actually building this
stuff are still in the incubator so in
order to get access to the the model
editor you need to load it or edit a
pull it in from the from the efore
repository actually in here I'm showing
the git repository it's actually
available there's a built version of it
that you can just install directly into
your Eclipse workbench
I should have provided a link to that
unfortunately don't remember it off the
top of my head from here I'm showing
I've got a part selected and in this
part I've got a bunch of things that I
can specify the ID of the part that'll
be useful for referring to the part in
code or for extending it through through
fragments label what label will it have
in the tab I tool tip tip stuff is there
an icon that kind of neat stuff the
class URI is the implementation of this
how does this view get rendered on the
screen how do I create the contents of
it and then there's some other things as
a closeable will it be rendered is it
visible some does it have a toolbar and
then there's some other other things
that honestly I don't understand no I'm
just getting I'm still experimenting
with so
other things to implement the part I
provide a class and that class is
referenced from that class URI field I
have an implementation class in this
case I've not actually implemented
anything this has been generated by the
tools for me I make a class called
something in this case I called it more
info the name it doesn't really matter
actually and I specify some number of
methods in fact I don't really even have
to specify any methods that that doesn't
really help me do anything but there's
no there's no explicit contract in terms
of implementing specific interfaces or
naming conventions or anything along
those lines it's all done through
annotations so I have the more info
constructor and I'm telling it that I'm
going to do an inject onto that so this
is the dependency injection kicks in and
says hey when I create an instance of
this thing I need to give it a composite
I need to give it a parent something to
actually draw itself on or render itself
on and I'll show you how it gets that in
a minute I have some other other
annotations post construct so after I've
constructed run this after I before I
destroy this component run that when
time comes to give this this part focus
in the in the in the window this is what
I want you to do so a lot of plugins
will put focus into a particular entry
field or into a particular widget or
something like that in 3.0 and the
three-point Xtreme pardon me we had to
jump through a lot of Hoops and this is
a actually a simplified implementation
of adding a selection listener basically
the workbench has this concept of
selection so when a selection occurs
somewhere the selection service kicks in
and says oh I'll take that and I'll tell
anybody who cares
that the selection has changed so in
Eclipse 3 I go and get the workbench and
I have to make sure that I'm running in
the
Ã¤Ãºi thread I tell the selection
service or sorry I get the workbench set
of workbench window there was a time
when I could do this from memory but I'm
finding it harder and harder thankfully
code recommenders actually helps with
this but anyway eventually I get down to
a method that I will invoke whenever the
selection so basically idea is whenever
the selection changes in the workbench
do this where the clips for it gets a
little bit easier instead of of going
and hunting down the selection service I
just ask the framework to inject it give
it to me please so my part
implementation which again is just some
class that has some annotations in it
I tell it I want to inject the selection
service I give it a type II selection
service and it knows how to find the
selection service and give it to me if
it exists if it doesn't exist in this
case if it doesn't exist my part
wouldn't load it wouldn't run at all it
would just stop because it doesn't have
the information that it needs I could
specify that it's optional with an
optional annotation there if it's
optional then it null is a valid value
for that field and and the injection
service would would move on so basically
I tell that I've got the selection
service in order to add a selection
listener I just tell the selection
service to add this selection listener
that's a lot easier but actually gets a
little bit easier than that although
easier may be subjective in this case
actually one of the things you'll notice
is that my selection change the thing
that I'm going to do when I change the
selection I left empty here on this
example I actually provided an
implementation so the last three lines
are actually the implementation of this
so I forget all about the selection
service altogether I don't really care
about the selection service all I want
to know is that a selection has occurred
so I create a method in my part class
called whatever doesn't matter what it's
called
I put the inject annotation on top of
that that method and for the parameter I
say that first off is an optional
parameter if there is no selection life
goes on
I want to find a named thing I'll tell
you what that thing is in a second I'm
getting there
give me the active selection and that
active selection will probably be an I
structured selection if it's not a nice
structured selection this won't get
called so if you selected something in
another view in a table that produces a
nice structured so an instance of
structured selection which implements I
structured selection passes that to the
selection service Eclipse then wakes up
and says hey this part cares about the
selection and I'll just give it to them
right so this method will be invoked any
time the selection changes in the
workbench so I've simplified
considerably again if you consider that
the last the actual three lines of code
that are in here I didn't actually show
on either of the two previous slides
this is really one line replacing like a
dozen lines of code I think that
qualifies as easier the dependency
injection stuff is like magic it's very
cool and a little creepy all at the same
time but even better than that one of
the things that I like to do is I don't
not everything that I'm working with is
necessarily a generic selection
sometimes I'm working with things that
are very specific there's a concept in
there oh I want to have a concept in the
workbench of the product that I care
about so what I do I do instead is
instead of working with the selection
service I have at the top there I have a
producer the producer basically says
give me the context that I'm running in
talk about context in a second give me
the context that I'm said I'm in and
when when the user clicks on the the
the entry in the table I will tell the
context to set the products that it
cares about that it knows about I'm
actually talking about the parent again
I'll tell you that what that means in a
minute on the consumer side of things
the consumer says I care about the
product or the products I guess so I'm
going to add another method on the
consumer so these are two different
classes the consumer says when the
products are changed so I care about the
thing named products tell me about it
right so instead of having some service
that manages the the product of the
current product selected product or the
current product in my in my workbench I
can just shove a value into the context
and the context and eclipse framework
takes care of making sure that anybody
who cares about that thing is told about
it you can inject lots of different
stuff into your implementation the
context again I'll talk about what that
is in a minute but it describes the you
know the state of the application at
different levels I can say give me the
active part so if I'm clicking from view
to view to view that changes the active
part in my workbench and I can be told
about those changes and and do things
based on on those changes I could say
what is the shell the shell is or the
top-level window into which everything
is rendered I can gain access to all
different aspects of my application
directly through this dependency
injection I don't have to go hunt it
down I don't have to ask a singleton for
it I don't have to walk up some
component hierarchy to find it I just
inject it and it gets given to me now
the way this all works is it's going
through the Eclipse context the idea is
we have this container containment
hierarchy of things part being the
smallest thing application being the
biggest thing parts perspectives and
applications each have their own context
so there's certain values it's basically
key value pairs keys or strings values
our objects of some kind and I can shove
things in to the context at different
levels and everything that cares at that
level or below will have an opportunity
to receive the injection of that change
right so in my previous example I had
set the products I told the context of
my part right I've injected the context
first thing I'm doing is injecting the
contacts that would be the context of my
part I'm telling the context of my part
give me your parent that's the context
of the perspective this is your product
by putting it into the perspective of
the sorry I'm putting it in the context
of the perspective everything underneath
that perspective is given an opportunity
to receive that thing receive
notification that that has changed so
since I have a consumer and a producer
they're both in the same perspective I
change the perspectives value in the
context my producer can then basically
talk indirectly to my consumer cool not
cool all right
if I just put it if in this slide here
if I if I just put the products into the
context that would have been in the park
context the park context is specific to
one part so all the other parts would
never be told about it okay okay so this
context is an important aspect of making
the modeled workbench work and of course
it it goes up multiple levels we have a
the window context a window key there
could be you can have more than one
perspective you can switch between
perspectives just like you can do in the
Eclipse workbench today if I put
something in the perspective context the
only things contained in that
perspective will know about it if I put
something in the window context all of
the perspectives would be given an
opportunity to see it and then of course
I can override in lower levels of the
context I can have a wind a value in the
window context and then a different
value in one of the perspective contexts
and everything contained below is is
sent different injection information I'm
hoping this makes sense not seeing
anyone screaming at me so ok so I'm
going to move
that's kind of the model and the the
context I want to talk a little bit
about styling before before we go before
we have to leave one of the criticisms
that we've gotten about Eclipse which
client did platform in the back in the
past is that it looks way too much like
an IDE I would contend that a lot of
applications just look like IDs anyway
but so this is there's an attempt here
to make it not look quite so much like
an IDE and in fact I'm not sure this
actually this example actually gets us
there because it still looks awfully IDE
like but there's a lot of flexibility
you know for example details of kaito
tour is you know I could remove that tab
pretty easily by instead of putting this
into a part stack just having the parts
hit by itself
that gives me some flexibility and
there's lots of other things that you
can do styling is one thing that allows
me to make it look at least so it
doesn't look like eclipse I've got an
example here of some CSS and how it
renders so I talked about the the things
in my UI using things that are very
simillar to people who understand CSS
the just a straight class name composite
I can reference any any composites that
are there that are built on the page or
I guess the top one label any label on
the page I can say this is the font
you're going to use this is the color
that you're going to use color would be
the font color for a label that appears
inside a composite though this is ad if
you're going to use different colors
separator label is the hash mark is an
ID so if I if I have a yeah if I have an
ID on one of my parts that in my model I
can model I can directly modify the CSS
of just that of things that can adjust
that ID I can also do clam there's a dot
one too sorry I just lost context anyway
so it's very familiar to CSS kinds of
people you'll notice certainly that
things like background color and color
and
border and and and other things like
that allow us to do some very similar
things that you can do in CSS some of
this stuff you can actually update live
not everything unfortunately this is
something that they're still working on
and you are of course limited by what
the underlying platform can allow if the
underlying platform doesn't support
changing the color of a label this we
can't do anything about that we use
platform we use native platform widgets
under most most stuff another slightly
different example I've changed around a
few a few of the colors and things that
get a slightly different look it's
exactly the same code just with a
different CSS changes the appearance of
the application this example did I
provide a link yeah there's an example
link to the example here in the wiki
Eclipse org if you're curious it it can
it can change its theme on the fly this
slide I find distracting because Kaito
ders avatar is the greatest avatar I
think I've ever seen yeah just me all
right is this thing on hello so if I'm
doing just SWT sorts of things I have oh
here we go the M part stack so the the
dot if I'm I can address different types
in my model directly so if I have a part
stack in this case I do have a part
stack with three parts in it I can do
things like change the the way that the
borders are rendered at the radius key
line information padding that kind of
neat stuff colors so you have the great
deal of control over your appearance
without doing a lot of coding right we
could do a lot of this stuff in Eclipse
before but you had to jump through hoops
to make it happen and then it was a bit
of a pain to change and maintain there
are some tools to help you with this
again these tools are a little on the
rough side they're part of the e4
incubator they're not not yet been
released I'm showing the CSS spy this is
pretty cool you basically just include
the CSS spy
plug in in your RCP application hit the
magic key combination which on Linux
means switch to a different terminal
control shift f4 I change it to be just
f4 anyway what this does it allows you
to look at the hierarchy of parts and
you can actually modify things and see
the change immediately in the UI a lot
of things work not everything
so changing colors we're exchanging
fonts does not but it does allow you to
have a you know fighting chance of
figuring out what manipulating your UI
in a custom way the thing that I have
selected in the CSS spy is highlighted
on the window which is also handy for
telling me what I'm looking at the CSS
editor also a little on the rough side
it helps you with some code completion
options to build your CSS invite you to
take a look if you're curious and please
provide feedback to the developers
through your your bugzilla account which
everyone's going to need so is there's
lots of things going on with the Eclipse
for talked a little bit about renderers
to sort of start my wrap up here one of
the things that some members of the
community did is they well thread back
up a little bit the Eclipse for team put
a lot of effort into separating how the
application is modeled versus how it is
rendered so someone from the community
step forward
I was actually Cayenne Tom Jindal is
actually here at the conference step
forward and they built a Java FX
renderer so you basically use Eclipse to
define your applications model you know
the fragment thing all works and the
dependency injection all that stuff just
works but instead of rendering it using
our SWT simple standard widget pill crap
standard widget to Steve's widget
toolkit that's funny to the insiders but
anyway instead of using SWT we put Java
FX underneath it so
this is the JavaFX version of the same
application we've been looking at and
then there's also an sw3 a swing
renderer and this is the swing version
using the napkin look and feel which
pretty cool so the the model is reused
there's opportunity to reuse a lot of
code ultimately though when you're
building the contents of the part you're
using the platform specific thing so on
SWT you're using table viewers and and
composites on JavaFX you're using border
panes and other kinds of things but the
implementation I showed an
implementation in SWT before let me see
show donessa this is the SWT version the
constructor takes a composite as its as
its as the palette on whereas the the
platform that coat the thing that it's
going to build on top of there's nothing
particularly clever here though the
composite is something that the context
knows about and when I do this injection
the injection just pulls the composite
out of the context and gives it to you
when we're doing something on when we're
doing the same thing on JavaFX the
context contains a border pain and the
dependency injection just says hey you
want a border pain this is the one I
know about in my context here you go and
then your constructor can then go about
building on top of that and then say
post construct work spree destroy works
on focus all these things sort of work
the same way but with a JavaFX
implementation similarly a swing
implementation would have not a border
pain probably what a jframe jpanel a
jpanel ER or would be injected in this
case so it's not free right you can't
just take the you know can't just build
one of these using SWT is your renderer
and move it over to JavaFX for free but
a lot of your application infrastructure
can be moved over for free
so I just want to talk briefly about
components I mentioned Equinox is the
component model that sits underneath
eclipse equinox actually is a pretty
pretty robust component model it's
eclipse is a pretty big thing
your average Eclipse installation sports
hundreds not thousands I don't think but
hundreds of different plugins and
Equinox
manages all of those it dynamically
loads things when they're necessary it
maintains that manages dependencies it
actually manages different versions of
dependencies so if I for whatever reason
needed two different versions of the
same library Equinox is capable of
loading and managing the relationships
between the components and actually
having two different versions of a
library used by different aspects of
your application so it supports
versioning of your components it
dynamically figures out the dependencies
and loads loads the right versions of
the right components when it needs to it
also supports the concepts of dynamic
update and install a lot of application
servers leverage this functionality to
dynamically unload functionality and
load alternate forms of that
functionality even things as simple as
servlets doing this without restarting
your application server RCP style
architectures tend to be basically you
have your application you make a couple
of plugins they sit on top of all of our
plugins what we call the reclip switch
client platform over time organizations
mature a little bit and I realize that
they have more than one of these
applications and they factor out some
common sub-domain of components which is
commonly is shared by the different
applications
this is something that NASA did with
their their maestro application they
took a clips rich client platform on top
of the clips rich client platform they
put a whole bunch of components that
really the nor that are really good at
talking to spaceships and running
experiments and doing those kinds of
some sort of generic talking to
spaceship II kinds of things and then
each of the project teams then builds an
eclipse plug-in or two
it sits on top of this framework then
they integrate it all together into a
single package at the mission
controllers use when they when they
control some experiments that are
running up up in space so the idea is
again you start off by just building a
couple of components over time we start
to find common things that are just
generally useful and build our own
platform on top of the rich client
platform now we see things like even the
Eclipse Rihanna project it does this
sort of thing the Eclipse Scout project
does this and there are other
organizations doing similar things you
see this within large banks they have
their own little frameworks that they
the platform that they they built on top
of the RCP so some wrap up if you are
curious to learn more information go to
the Eclipse wiki wiki dead eclipse at
org slash e for this is proof that even
the Eclipse for verses e for naming
thing is confusing to our own people
there are numerous tutorials and
resources online Lars Vogel is a
prolific creator of tutorials he's also
an excellent instructor if you ever
happened to be in Europe there's some
links there to its vogue Ella actually
oh it is vogue Ella de he some great
stuff if you want to learn more a lot of
the content for this presentation came
from some some people that are been very
heavily involved in our community and
just acknowledge that their help was
invaluable and with that I'm done the
main portion of my talk if there's any
questions I I'll take them now yes oh
hold on hold on
mm-hm
well well NetBeans is yucky and awful
they probably said the same thing about
Eclipse the differences they were wrong
no so we actually have a couple of
different JavaScript things going on we
have a JavaScript project within the
that's part of our web tools stuff a new
project just came in it's called V jet
that it's basically the code that that
eBay uses to build JavaScript stuff and
that's something that we are we're
onboarding at this at this point and I'm
hopeful that that will become a real
project and start producing deliverables
shortly our JavaScript implementation
right now is I would say pretty good I'm
I can't give you a ringing endorsement
of it it's you know I think right now
the Orion stuff is a little further
ahead than our our standard JavaScript
you know Eclipse IDE based JavaScript
the Orion stuff is really fantastic it
supports content assist it's super fast
the editor as actually feels faster than
running in a browser feels faster than
the Eclipse IDE editor so I would
encourage you to look at Orion question
I am not aware of any right to left
language support in the model dua but I
haven't needed that so I I would be
surprised if we didn't have it but if I
can the best way to best place to ask
that question is on the eclipse project
forum go to eclipse org slash forums
slash eclipse type platform that would
be the best place to ask that sort of
question yeah I'm sorry I can't hear you
can use eclipse for and Eclipse three
time is that the question
well a great deal of effort has gone
into a compatibility layer that allows
you to run 3x plugins in the 4.0 and a
4.0 RCP application so yes that's
possible other questions yes yes rap so
so so one of the one of they're actually
they're morphing the project a little
bits are changing their scope the the
current version of the current form of
the project is you use SWT to build your
application and they actually render it
in they render it is it's a JavaScript
use a JavaScript library whose name is
escaping me to render it in the browser
but it all starts from SWT components
yes
yeah I wouldn't know the swing
components I don't believe that that
could work no other questions yes
okay so the question is using jnlp to
deploy JavaFX based application I don't
know so that would be a question again
for the the forum eclipse.org slash
forum slash a clip stop platform would
get you some help on that other
questions yes what are we use for unit
testing that varies from project to
project some projects just use J unit we
have SWT bot which is another option
that some projects use some of our
projects are now using jus Beulah which
is the GUI dancer is a commercial GUI
testing software package that was
reasonable two years ago now I guess
they contributed it to open source at
eclipse so there's lots of different
options for GUI testing I've never tried
there's no reason why I shouldn't though
it did the nature of how its implemented
it should just work question yeah that's
a little out of scope the html5 css3
actually we're sort of the CSS stuff is
evolving I think we're approaching a CSS
2.0 compatibility it's really not we're
not we're not we're not we're not
attempting to compete with html5 that's
just not the just not the space that
this occupies all right with that if
there's other questions please feel free
to hound me after thank you so much for
your attention I hope you enjoy the rest
of the conference thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
