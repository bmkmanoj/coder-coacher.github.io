either in or passing through the cloud
as part of this massive user base you
demand a complete platform and
infrastructure cloud solution for
creating deploying and managing your
java applications that solution is
Oracle Java cloud service powered by
Oracle WebLogic server the number one
application server across cloud
environments Oracle Java cloud service
lets you create and maintain a complete
cloud based application environment from
a single intuitive user interface and
without worrying about the underlying
architecture system maintenance or
security
the Java cloud service console shows
service details such as the number of
instances you have the number of CPUs
running and the amount of memory and
storage allocated it also lists
summaries of all the instances in your
service
laughs instance creation wizard and with
just a few clicks you create an instance
in the cloud when it's time to deploy an
application whether it's Java EE or ADF
access the desired administration
console be a WebLogic server or Fusion
Middleware control and deploy it the
same way you would in an on-premises
environment frantic convenience and
flexibility you can also deploy
applications by using the WebLogic
scripting tool or your favorite ide such
as eclipse with so much data reliant on
the cloud it's critical that you can
manage it there you want to be able to
back up and restore instances patch them
without causing undue system to delay
and manage your clusters Oracle Java
cloud service makes these tasks easy
through its instance page this page is
really three pages in one the overview
page shows critical information about
the specific instance such as how many
nodes the instance is using how many
CPUs are running and how much memory and
storage has been allocated it also lists
summaries of the virtual machines and
service Oracle Java cloud service will
perform automatic daily and weekly
backups for you go to the administration
pages backup tab to configure your
backup schedule and how long you want
the backups retained from here you can
also want an immediate backup on demand
note that Oracle Java cloud service will
coordinate backups with your database to
ensure a consistent backup between your
application and your data
you can restore it
students to return it to a previous
state or to recover it after a loss of
data or if necessary you can delete the
backup completely
go to the patching tab if you need to
patch an instance
you can give more specific information
about a patch by drilling into it
or you can simply apply the patch open
the patch history section of the tab to
rollback a patch something you might
want to do if you find that the patch is
incompatible with applications deployed
on your service or for any other reason
Oracle Java cloud service applies
patches one note at a time so if your
service is clustered with two or more
nodes your application will experience
zero downtime if your instance is
running in a cluster you can enable or
disable a load balancer from the load
balancer tab
speaking of clusters fluctuating demands
on your system load can affect how
applications perform on the topology
page you can scale instances on the fly
to ensure optimal performance this page
shows all the nodes in a cluster
including the administration server and
load balancer and if provisioned a
coherence data tier
scale-out the cluster by adding a node
or scale it in by removing one
if a coherence data tear has been
provisioned you can scale it here too by
adding or removing capacity units
every operation you complete with Oracle
Java cloud service is audited so you can
see the history of your activity in the
Operations history or activity section
for example you can see scaling history
by expanding the scaling activity
section and drilling in to the desired
scaling operation
regardless of what
you're performing with horrible Java
cloud service you can always get
additional help or access other valuable
learning resources from the help menu
Oracle Java cloud service is a critical
component of any cloud computing
solution
it's an easy-to-use tool that gives you
the power and flexibility to create
deploy and manage your java applications
