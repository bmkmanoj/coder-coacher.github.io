how to perform agent upgrade using EMS
arrived from 1200 one with BP one or 12
10 to 2 12 10 3 log in to emc lie within
the OMS home
run get a credible agent work to obtain
list of agents that can be upgradeable
due to the recording dimensions the
output is you crumbled if you want to
know more about syntax of get upgradable
agents then run mcl I helped get
upgradable agents
the help shows you example and syntax
note parameters in bracket are optional
if you just want to run the prerequisite
check on agent before running the
upgrade you can do it by passing
parameter hyphen validate only let's run
the ball clear the screen the value of
agent was picked up from the previous
verb get upgradeable agents in this
output we have a warning that blue dot
SH cannot be run post upgrade as prefer
credentials are not set you can run this
emc like command with parameter hyphen
validate on n number of agents so that
you can make sure that they all meet
prerequisites before actually doing the
upgrade note that to perform agent
upgrade from 12 oh no one with vp 1 or 4
10 2 to 12 or three we do not need any
credentials we use existing OMS to agent
communication and through job system to
execute commands we do not use SSH we
only need credentials to run through dot
SH now if you have a use case where you
do not know the password for agent user
or the agent user password constraint
every few minutes or ours then you can
still perform the agent upgrade and then
run route or SH separately to perform an
agent upgrade run the upgrade underscore
agent work to view the status of
submitted agent of great job run get
underscore agent upgrade status work to
view the details of this job run get
agent of reg status with job parameter
to know more about what's happening on
agent upgrade on this host we can run
this command get agent upgrade status
job name and the agent the output of
this command tells us what are the
different steps that are executed as a
part of agent upgrade and where r be so
as per the output we are actually
upgrading the agent right now if upgrade
fails check the input and log file under
agent home back up
new agent / suspend directory and run
the upgrade agent work again note that
there is no retry verb while doing agent
upgrade you have to resubmit the upgrade
agent Shaw again
let's run the verb get a credible agent
to see the agent that we have upgraded
is no longer visible so we performed the
agent upgrade on Linux 32-bit that agent
is no longer visible here let's perform
agent upgrade on windows agent before
that we will validate the agent to make
sure that it meets all the prerequisite
check note that the agent parameter can
have multiple agent separated by comma
the output of the validate command tells
us that the agent on this host has met
all the prerequisites and we can go
ahead with the upgrade run the worm
upgrade agent to check the status of the
upgrade job we will run get agent
upgrade status clear the screen this
letter know more about the agent of
great job we can run get agent upgrade
status with job and H parameter
you
you can clean up old agent home all
target home backup directory of old
agent using AMC lie or agent of a
console run get sign of status 0 up to
view set of agents for cleaner no agent
displayed in the output our agents that
are upgraded successfully and can be
deleted run sign of agent work to clean
up the agent you can refer EMC li help
sign of agent % x and examples let's
execute command sign of agent run get
sign-off status work to view the status
of agent clean up shop the output of
this job tells us the agent clean up on
both the host is successful to view more
details of what happened on each host
what are the detail steps you can run
this command this is the end of the demo
