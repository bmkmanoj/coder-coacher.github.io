relational source and a comma-separated
value file source into a provisioned
cloud service install and configure data
sync begin by downloading and unzipping
the data sync tool from the Oracle
technology Network edit the
configuration file to ensure that it
points to the correct Java home the java
1.7 or later version of java developer
kit must already be installed run the
data sync batch file the first time that
you run the process data sync recognizes
that this is an initial run so it opens
a configuration setup wizard you're
prompted for a repository name just in
case you have multiple repositories and
a password this password is used to
access the client you also need to
create a project projects are workspaces
that help organize and define what you
upload they define metadata about
relational and file sources columns
target tables and indexes setup email
and email recipients for jobs configure
an email administrator account to enable
recipients to receive email
notifications data sync has a login
authentication based SMTP email client
that can connect to any login
authenticating SMTP server once you've
setup the administrator's email account
you can create additional email
recipient accounts as well
now set up the target connection to your
Oracle cloud service provide the
username password and URL for your
service
omit the forward slash analytics at the
end of the service URL test the
connection to ensure that your
connection details are accurate setup
the source connection to your
on-premises relational source provide
the name connection type table owner
user password service name host and port
for your on-premises data source data
sync supports multiple relational
databases including Oracle Oracle times
10 db2 Microsoft sequel server mysql and
tera data you can also create
connections for comma separated value
file finally set the maximum number of
run history entries and the system
properties to configure the data file
root directory the maximum number of run
history entries indicates how many run
history entries should be preserved
while the data file root directory sets
the default location for registering a
file to be uploaded now you know how to
install Data Sync configure connections
create email recipients for job
notifications and change the setup
properties thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
