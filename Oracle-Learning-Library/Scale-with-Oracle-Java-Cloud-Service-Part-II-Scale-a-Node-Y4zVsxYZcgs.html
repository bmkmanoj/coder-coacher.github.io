Java cloud service instance requires it
I can use this gala scale down feature
to change the compute shape of a node
increase its RAM or when space starts to
run low add block storage conversely
when the load eases I can reduce server
capacity to a less expensive
configuration we call this scaling a
node or vertical scaling let's say the
load on one of the nodes in my cluster
has grown to a point where the
performance is degraded significantly in
this case I'll want to increase the
capacity of that node by scaling it up I
can launch my scale up from the specific
nodes Action menu my note is currently
using the default compute shape one cpu
and seven and a half gigabytes of ram I
believe the single CPU will be
satisfactory but will want to increase
the RAM so I'll select this computes ape
if I wanted to increase the size of the
node I can also add more block storage
however if i increase block storage now
i won't be able to reduce it later and
need to consider if I want that
permanent added expense I think I'll
pass if I were adding block storage I
would select the volume to which I've
wanted to add the storage here but this
exercise I can ignore this field and
proceed with the scaling operation I can
see here the scaling operation is
underway as with other scaling
operations when Oracle Java cloud
service is applying my changes it puts
the service instance into a maintenance
mode and stops any servers running on
the node after a few minutes I'll track
its progress here on the activity page
and here i can see more granular details
of the scaling operation and now i'll
return to the service details page this
tells
the scaling is complete and the
operation is successful Oracle Java
cloud service now starts any servers
that should run on this node when the
workload eases I can reduce or scale
down the size of the node again working
from the service details page I'll scale
down the node the same way i scaled up
only this time I'll select compute shape
with less ram since I can't remove block
storage I can ignore this field and
proceed I can see here that the scaling
operation is underway and can track it
on the activity page I successfully
scaled down the node to learn more about
scaling and all other aspects of Oracle
Java cloud service visit us at
cloud.oracle.com europe alerting library
or any of these oracle website and
