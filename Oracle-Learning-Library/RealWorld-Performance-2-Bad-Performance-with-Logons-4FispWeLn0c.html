about is the use of cursors and sessions
now this demo that we're going to look
at we're going to start the
demonstration running along and we'll
see it running at its most suboptimal
the reasons for this will become very
obvious because you will notice that the
number of log ons taking place on this
demo per second is almost identical to
the transaction rate in this case the
developer had made the mistake to log on
for every transaction taking place in
the database now logging on to the
database is extremely expensive
operation likewise logging off from the
database is a extremely expensive
operation so as people evolve their
applications they need to learn how to
use a connection pool so they share the
connections to the database and you
don't incur the cost of logging on an
off to the database this is a big deal
okay back in 1999 when the.com craziness
was taking place people forgot this and
they wrote per se stateless middleware
and stateless middleware meant that they
just basically disconnected from the
database until they actually needed to
make a sequel request and then they
logged back on to the database
made a request and then log back off
these companies lasted between three and
six months before they either learnt to
use a connection pool or they literally
ran out of business and this is you know
a harsh fact very often it's very quick
to prototype an application that looks
great on a laptop with one user by doing
these sort of techniques but when they
scale up to enterprise class and web
scale type of things they just will not
scale
and so here we are demonstrating an
application running that may be built by
say an intern student or something like
that and you can see the performance in
terms of response time is nothing clever
it should be one or two milliseconds
you'll notice it's much greater than
that and we should be hitting thousands
of transactions per second but we're
barely achieving 300 if we actually look
at the operating system will notice that
the operating system is getting up there
to be 50% busy and if you actually
subdivide where we're spending the busy
time in the operating system you'll
notice that half the time itself is
actually being in spent inside the Linux
kernel that means that we're not even
executing database code were executing
code in the operating system code inside
the operating system doesn't get you any
work done it just utilizes the CPU
managing the system and in this case
what we're seeing is that when we log on
and off to the database it costs us a
lot in terms of kernel time literally
mapping the SGA in and out of process
address space as we create processes and
tear them down
this is incredibly resource intensive
you'll also notice that it's we can't
actually get the CPU Glu's use fully
utilized because eventually the Linux
kernel will serialize just managing all
those shared memory pages so we're
talking about here is an application
that's been written fairly sub-optimally
in fact completely sub-optimally as a
result it had a target response time of
over 20,000 transactions a second but
it's out if we actually have a look at
it and we interrogate the screen in the
top lines we can see that we're only
achieving about 200 to 300 transactions
a second and the response time for the
transactions at the screen level is
about quarter of a second 230
milliseconds so you can see not a great
transaction rate not a great response
time and if we look at the database
level we can see that we've got
relatively few sessions active inside
the database and they're all on the CPU
we're not seeing any contention of any
note to be concerned about so the
database looks fine everything looks
great so the clue to the bad performance
actually comes from the operating system
in that if we interrogate the operating
system you can see that we're spending
as much time inside the operating system
kernel as we do in times of user space
and really you know this is CPU being
utilized for running the operating
system that's not executing database
code at all and so you can see there's
something not right with this system and
by looking at the database statistics
you can see that the actual number of
connections or the logins per second to
the database is almost identical to the
transaction rate and that in itself
gives you the clue as to ask you what is
wrong with this application is that the
application is logging on to the
database executing a transaction and
logging off and as a result we're
getting degraded performance because the
operating system is working too hard
it's really difficult to get all the
CPUs busy and the response time as you
can see is choppy and erratic and in
summary it's a suboptimal application
it's functionally correct but it's not a
performance application
