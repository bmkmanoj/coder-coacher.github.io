service implementation of your managed
api's but you're concerned about
impacting the API consumers after a
redeployment would you like to deploy or
redeploy your managed API so changes
like the updated service request URL or
added policies can be applied to further
requests Oracle API platform cloud
service allows you to easily manage
deployments and redeployments to make
the API is available after applying
changes to them to successfully deploy
an api grants to the api and to a
registered and active gateway are needed
here bob has implemented api's through
the API platform cloud service
management portal he's able to redeploy
api's to the gateway for which he has
the proper grants from the API
implementation page changes to the API
are applied such as updating the service
request URL or adding different policy
types Bob needs to update the service
request URL for this API whenever he
makes changes to the API he has to save
those changes before deploying or
redeploying it deployments are managed
from the deployments page where options
like deactivate redeploy a nun deploy
are available for deployed api's in this
case the latest iteration is redeployed
to the same gateway the deployment
request appears on the waiting tab until
it's automatically updated after
completion bob was granted to deploy a
gateway grant for the deployment to
happen without approval the Gateway gets
updated with the new API deployment
details to verify that the updated API
is now available for consumption bob
invokes it from a rest client he
receives a response from the service
located at the updated service request
