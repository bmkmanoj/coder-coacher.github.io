marketing my name is Nick and in this
video i'll demonstrate publishing photos
to Facebook and creating new albums and
publish I'm creating a new post and I
want to create a new Facebook album so
I'll select this check box create a new
Facebook album if you publish photos
without checking this box they'll appear
on your timeline or your wall album
instead let's enter a title and
description now let's select the photos
by clicking the add Media button you can
always upload additional photos by
clicking here on the add button but the
photos we want have already been
uploaded and they're right here in the
menu first let's make sure these photos
have descriptions I can do this by
clicking the upper right corner of the
photos
they all have descriptions except this
one so I'll add a description and click
the check mark now let's select the
foils we want for the album I'll select
asparagus mushrooms onions and peppers
the photos show in the preview but this
might not be how they actually look when
the post is finally published to
Facebook the photos are also listed here
with asparagus being the album cover
I want onions to be the album cover
instead so I'll make that happen I click
on the name with a photo I want to be
the album cover and I don't think I want
mushrooms anymore so I remove that photo
by clicking the X as an aside if you
want to add photos to an existing album
or do a link post you'd go down to your
social network settings and click the
photo options here you have the option
to publish the photo to a news feed
which is used when you post a link that
will also be the thumbnail in your link
or you can publish to your wall or
timeline album or to a new album which
is the same as what I just showed you
you can also publish to an existing
album your administrator will decide the
default option for your site now let's
publish the post
so now on Facebook in my timeline you
can see the photos followers will see a
single post in their newsfeed with the
three photos and album description and
here in photos you can see the new album
and here you can see each photo with
this description so that's how easy it
is to publish photos on Facebook if you
need more information our documentation
can be found here or if you'd like to
see more demos you can find those at our
Learning Library
