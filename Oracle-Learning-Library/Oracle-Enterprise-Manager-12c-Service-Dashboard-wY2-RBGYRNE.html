dashboard part of the Oracle Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c demo series in
this demo we will touch base on new
functionalities regarding service
management in Enterprise Manager 12c the
under the services features from the
server's over you have the main menu
main menu has this new button which is
called dashboard when we come to the
dashboard basically there's a list of
predefined dashboards that are in here
and let me first go through one of those
so that can explain what it is and later
on I will create one myself so let's
take the dashboard of cloud services I
click it the dashboard is opened up and
it displays all the services that are
part of your defined dashboard as you
can see for each service there is a
quick overview of all relevant metrics
this entire over you can also be emailed
to my peers or from my manager so I put
in your button it asks me who to send
this to you now to simply send it every
service can also be viewed from a
perspective that I can drill down into
the details so what we see here is
different performance metrics
different usage metrics overviews of
vessel ace key components and system
incidents I have the same view that we
had of the dashboard now more on that
easily to consume with any view that you
see here can be adjusted by the View
button saying which columns I want to be
visible which columns I do not
happen do I want everything there or do
I want the metric lost value or do I
want that trend analysis as it is
showing now for instance another thing
II can be doing is looking into that
particular service so when I click on
this it actually shows me the details of
that particular service so now goes
through a detail page I stayed on my
dashboard and I just opened up the
information about cloud service it gives
me an overview of what happened in the
service gives me an overview of what
happened to the components it shows me
all the essays that are related to that
particular service and it exactly shows
me ok this is the SLA and these are the
matters that I've defined for each and
every metric CPU performance the status
was in August ok Tuesday or 99% and if
you look up the trend the last 24 hours
you can still see the value and the
overview can be collapsed so that you
only see different values from SLA
perspective but you can open it up and
get the additional details then last you
have the metrics
and in the metrics tab we'll find all
the metrics that we've defined as a part
of the service compared if there are
multiple metrics by usage and by
performance we also find all the
incidents that are related to the
components that are part of your service
you go back to the dashboard itself
because I want to show you some more
functionality that we have there so one
of the functions that we have for an
existing dashboard is that you can
personalize so I can change the way that
this page is set up when I do that it
allows me to for instance add metrics
set up new services maybe I want to add
services and that I find here so maybe I
want to add generic services and search
now I get all the services that were
part of this system I could easily say
okay create that and different selector
I can also add metrics I already have
the services so the only
that I have to do now is add another
metric I select a metric from the list
add it to my selected metrics list and
then apply the view should change from
one metric to two metrics in the
dashboard so you'll see the update
coming up right now so the system now
all of the sudden has an additional
metric being added to this system so I
can add multiple metric to the same
system when I'm done I simply close the
personalization and how every time I
open up the service it will actually
have this additional metric now let's go
back to the first section where we saw
the overview of the of the dashboards
any user can create a dashboard so I've
not looked at the cloud services and
also create a new Oh new setup demo
dashboard description demo purpose and
then create the dashboard when I create
it the first thing that I've asked me to
do is do that personalization again
which means that now I select the
services that I want to add to this
particular environment so which surfaces
do I want I want game service and the
Advocate services search okay so grab
this one job service and that's good for
now
so all these which metrics can achieve
again console service there any
performance metric yes there is
I want to show that
here not interesting usage for console
the job serves however we're very
interested in the usage data both of
those here there are some usage data as
well there we go
so when I apply it
I have this new dashboard which is only
for me when I store this thing that
close it then I go back to dashboard all
the sudden my new dashboard is added to
the environment that's a good way of
getting multiple views stored views to
your services this concludes our demo
