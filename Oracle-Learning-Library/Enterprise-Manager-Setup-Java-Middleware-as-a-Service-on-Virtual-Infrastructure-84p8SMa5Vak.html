Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you what it
takes for cloud on demonstrators to set
up virtual flow meters of service first
I will show you how a cloud
administrator creates passing friend
zone based on oracle vm zone you can
create multiple paths in friend zones
for different internal departments such
as HR or finance our demonstrate how s
sa administrator can upload and manage
Oracle virtual assembly for source web
project domains to provision for
end-users lastly SS administrator or so
configures video service SS a portal for
end-users by creating service template
based on over assembly and deployment
plan
first let me login as a cloud or
demonstrator you can go to set up cloud
menu item and click pass in France own
menu click create button to start the
wizard enter name administrators have a
flexibility in where WebLogic domain
search should be provisioned and we
support both physical and virtual
provisioning for the purpose of this
demonstration on the virtual flow will
pick a vm zone type for the passing
razon click Next as a second step of the
wizard you will identify the target for
the OBM zone click Add button select and
click Next
and you can add a role who can access
the resources host the on ovm zone click
add and this is a role will be given to
these SS a and the users click next and
submit now let me login as an SSL
demonstrator for a virtual flow we need
to have oracle virtual assembly for a
source profile captured from golden
image / WebLogic domain you can go to
enterprise provisioning and patching and
soft library menu this will be used
later when you create a service template
element now it's time to set up an SS a
portal by going to set up cloud middle
menu full vulture flow we do not need to
configure medial poles first click on
the ricasso settings tab we can accept
it for the values for now you can set
the policy about how quickly the service
request will be fulfilled and how long
end users can keep the provision the
service instances click waters tab
quarter is the aggregate amount of
resources that can be granted to each
surface services user belonging to a
certain role we will look at the
existing Korra as you can see here you
can set the kora in terms of the total
memory or the number of Java servers
click the service templates
click create to launch the create new
service template wizard choose the
virtual flow in the pop-up enter name
and description and click Next the
values is specified here will be used to
provision new weblogic server instances
click Next here you will identify the
passing razon for which this particular
service template will be available click
Add button select the past zone and now
you will need to select the deployment
plan for this photo flow click Next and
you need to add a role for the users who
