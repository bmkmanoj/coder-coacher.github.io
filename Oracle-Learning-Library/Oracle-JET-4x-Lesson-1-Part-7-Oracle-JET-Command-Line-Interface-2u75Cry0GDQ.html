of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet up until this part we have covered a
whole range of fundamental topics
relating to jet
we started with learning about
require.js for modularity knockout jazz
for data binding we looked at setting up
oracle jet components we explored oracle
jet modules and in this part we are
going to look at the oracle jet
command-line interface the article jet
command-line interface is a very useful
tool that is easy to set up and very
powerful to use here we are on the
command line and we have installed the
oracle jet command-line interface the
first point to notice is that you can
type a jet - - help which will provide
documentation on each of the commands
that the command line interface makes
available and build clean grades and so
on but what you can also do here is that
you can get further help on each of
these commands so for example if you
want to find out more information about
your age what we can do here is type a
Jets help followed by the command about
which you would like to have more
information so now a type a jet help
correct and you see a range of examples
so here's how to create an application
with the template nav bar here is a
topic that will be addressed later about
Cordova and hybrid mobile development
here you can see how to set up a new jet
application based on one of the examples
the fix-it fast application here is how
to add a CCA component an Oracle jet web
component that we'll talk about in the
third lesson and here is how to add a
theme in other words whenever you would
like to have more information about a
particular command type Oh jet help
followed by the command about which you
would like to have some more information
and always in each of those cases you'll
be provided with a list of examples
example command lines you can use
together with the command that you have
asked for further help on so we type a
jet help and then for example build
and you see now a list of example
command lines that make use of the build
command at this point you should also be
very aware of the fact that whenever you
use oujet serve oracle jet will watch
your application and whenever you make
changes will automatically reload the
changes that you have made into the
browser so you can see here after a jet
serve is called that a message watching
files is printed out to the terminal
signifying to you that oracle jet is
watching for changes and will
automatically read load them into the
application I can see my dashboard HTML
file I make a change here to for example
hello world instead of dashboard content
area I click Save however I'll do that
by a keyboard shortcut or the save
action and what I can now see in the
terminal is that the Oracle Jet
command-line interface has picked up
that this file is changed and that it
has reloaded it automatically so that in
the browser I automatically see my hello
world message by this point of the
course you should be aware of this
functionality you've been using it
whenever you've saved the file
automatically a reload is done you don't
need to refresh the browser safe you lot
of time and is built-in to the Oracle
jet command-line interface another
feature that the command-line interface
provides is the strip command and the
restore command the strip command strips
all non source files from a jet
application while the restore command
restores those you probably only want to
check in your own source files into your
source code repository such as git or
vile subversion or via material so what
you should do before you check in is to
say a jet and then strip press ENTER and
then the node modules that were included
before are no longer in the nine modules
folder
have been removed that folder is now
empty if we now try to serve up the
application we are told that various
libraries are not available that is
because we have stripped the application
and we have not restored it now when you
run a jet restore within your
applications root folder all the
JavaScript libraries that you have
deleted are going to be riad 'add via
the oracle jet command-line interface
now you can do the ODF serve or the a
jet build again another important
command to be aware of is the add
command when we type a jet help ad we
see a range of different types of
features that you can add to an existing
application such as support for Cordova
in other words you can create a complete
Oracle jet web application and then
later decide that you want to make it a
hybrid Cordova based application as well
and so you can type a jet ad hybrid
which will add a hybrid folder you can
say add platform iOS or Android or
Windows and that particular platform
will be added into the application you
can add plugins for Cordova into the
application and these are all topics you
will look at later and in addition you
can add support for sass a super-awesome
stylesheet language to an existing
application as well so also be aware of
the various features you can add to an
existing application in the context of
the Oracle Jet command-line interface it
is also very useful to know that
NetBeans has built into its support for
a terminal window go to the Tools menu
and then choose open in terminal while
having the project selected that you
want to work with so here we have
selected a particular project you go to
tools open in terminal and then that
folder opens inside of the NetBeans
terminal window at which point you can
call any terminal command directly
inside NetBeans so for example LS to see
the content of the application and also
commands like a jet build in other words
you don't need to use the external
terminal window you can use it directly
integrated into the environment in which
you are working in the case of NetBeans
in this part we have looked at the
Oracle jet command-line interface you
have seen how easy it is to set up and
also you have used it to correct new
oracle jet applications well you've seen
a range of facilities that the
command-line interface provides as well
such as the ability to strip and restore
libraries from your application for your
homework exercise go back to Oracle jet
org go to the get started page which you
can get you from the main navigation bar
or from the front page and use the LG
tool to create the different templates
that Oracle jet makes available so with
the oujet command-line interface set up
don't only create the nav drawer
template as you have been doing
throughout this course but also use the
nav bar template and the basic template
and the blank template compare them to
each other open them in the browser and
see what the differences are look at the
source code and try and understand why
there are four different templates and
what differences they provide and in
which contexts each of them might be
useful as always thank you for taking
part in the oracle jet course and we
look forward to seeing you in the next
part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
