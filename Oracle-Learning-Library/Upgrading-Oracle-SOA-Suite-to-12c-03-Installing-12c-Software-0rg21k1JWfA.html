is the third in a series of eight videos
about upgrading Oracle Scylla suite to
version 12c if you haven't yet seen the
first two videos watch them first
you'll get a good overview of the entire
upgrade process and learn about a number
of critical tasks you need to perform to
ensure a smooth successful upgrade once
you've seen those videos you'll be ready
for this demonstration of installing 12c
software as part of your upgrade to
completely upgrade the topology on this
diagram we need to install Fusion
Middleware infrastructure so a suite an
Oracle HTTP server
because our sample topology includes two
hosts but no shared location we'd need
to install the software on both hosts in
this video we're only going to cover the
installation of Fusion Middleware
infrastructure and the psoas suite and
we're only going to demo the tasks on
one host we'll start by installing the
12c version of Fusion Middleware
infrastructure our current 11g
installation is installed at u01 app fmw
or Fusion Middleware
when upgrading the 12c software it needs
to be installed to a different location
for our demo we've chosen u01 app fmw
12c as our new Oracle home directory
to start the installation program we log
into one of our hosts the installer
requires that a certified JDK already
exists on our system we navigate to the
directory where we downloaded the
installation program in our case that's
u01 stage from there we launch the
installation program by invoking the
Java executable from the Java home bin
directory we've pointed to the JDK and
change to the directory where the
installation program is located with the
appropriate Java command entered we're
ready to start the installation
the Oracle Universal installer briefly
checks system prerequisites before
beginning in earnest
at this point the Installer begins to
load
the welcome screen introduces us to the
product installer
on the installation location screen we
specify our Oracle home directory
remember we need to specify a new Oracle
home for our 12c installation we're
going to use u01 app fmw 12c check the
typing and click Next on the
installation type screen we select the
type of installation and consequently
the products and feature sets we want to
install oracle recommends that you not
install the examples into a production
environment so with that in mind we'll
accept the default Fusion Middleware
infrastructure option here we see the
Installer verifying that our system
meets the minimum necessary requirements
if there are any warning or error
messages we can click the view log
button we don't see any problems so
we'll click Next to continue use the
security update screen to indicate how
you'd like to receive security updates
because we don't have an Oracle support
account for this demo system we're going
to decline this option but it's strongly
recommended that you accept it we clear
the check box and click Next the
confirmation window asks do you wish to
remain uninformed of critical security
issues in your configuration ok for us
bad idea for you the installation
summary screen then lists the
installation options we've selected if
we want we can save these options to a
response file that can be used later in
a silent installation situation to do
that we'd click save response file and
provide the location and name of the
file in this demo we'll skip that
optional step and instead click install
the installation is now underway the
screen displays the progress of the task
and we see progress at 100% if the
screen had reported any failures we can
click the view log button to debug the
problem happily that's not the case for
us so we're going to click Next instead
this final screen looks a lot like the
summary screen that we saw before
running the installation but it reflects
each of our options as completed we can
review the information on this screen
before we click finish to dismiss the
Installer
there are several steps you can take to
verify the installation including
reviewing the installation log files
checking the directory structure or
viewing the contents of Oracle home for
more information check out each of the
recommended documents on your screen
with Fusion Middleware infrastructure
12c installed we're ready to install the
12c version of the psoas suite will
invoke the so installer with the same
syntax we use to start the Fusion
Middleware infrastructure installer with
our command line in place let's start
the installation
the Installer initializes and displays
the welcome screen
it looks familiar we click Next
we're prompted for the location of our
Oracle home directory this Oracle home
should be the new 12c home where we
installed the Fusion Middleware
infrastructure earlier in this video
we can use the drop down and select that
same Oracle home and then click Next on
the installation type screen we specify
products and feature sets to install if
our 11g domain were configured with BPM
we used BPM as our install option our
example doesn't include BPM so we're
gonna proceed with the default option so
a suite
the prerequisite checks are done we
click Next we can use the installation
summary screen to verify the
installation options we've selected as
with the Fusion Middleware
infrastructure installation we can
select to save these options to a
response file for later use in a silent
installation we click install to begin
the installation
we see the progress bar begin to move
the installation is underway and we're
at a hundred percent right now we can
click finish to dismiss the Installer or
next to see a summary we'll click Next
we can review the summary information on
this screen we're content that what we
expected to happen actually happened so
we click finish to dismiss the Installer
we won't demo it a second time but our
next step will be to repeat this
installation on the additional hosts in
our environment if you have multiple
hosts the same would be true for you now
that the twelve to one software is
installed you can run the upgrade
assistant readiness check the readiness
check performs a pre upgrade review of
your existing Oracle Fusion Middleware
schemas and Oracle WebLogic
configurations
it generates a readiness report so you
can address potential issues before you
attempt the actual up grid if no issues
are detected you can begin the upgrade
process to perform a readiness check on
your pre upgrade environment launch the
upgrade assistant in readiness mode the
wizard opens to the welcome screen it
displays a reminder that no upgrade will
be performed by running the report and
that it's not necessary to take a backup
at this time when running the readiness
check you have the option of performing
readiness checks on individually
selected schemas or on a web logic
administration server or domain the
domain option will evaluate all of the
upgrade eligible schemas and/or
component configurations used by the
domain upgrade assistant will detect the
schemas for you in this example we'll
choose the domain based readiness check
when checking the WebLogic server domain
you can select one or more options each
time you run the readiness check first
you can include checks for all schemas
used by this server when this option is
selected the upgrade assistant will
discover and select all components that
have schemas available to upgrade
wherever possible the upgrade assistant
will pre-populate connection information
on schema input screens your second
option is to include checks for WebLogic
component configurations select this
option to upgrade component
configurations for a managed WebLogic
server domain after reconfiguration
you'll be prompted to supply the 12c
connection information the third option
is to perform online and offline
readiness checks after making your
choices a read-only list shows the
components that will be reviewed if more
than one component schema is selected
the upgrade assistant will ask for the
prefix underscore STB credentials first
and then will pre-populate the other
schema credential information when
available this screen provides a
high-level overview of the readiness
checks that will be performed based on
your selections when you click Next the
readiness checks are performed if you're
running the readiness check on your
online production environment oracle
recommends that you perform the check
during off-peak hours to prevent
performance degradation overall progress
and completion details of the readiness
check are displayed readiness success
into
the readiness review was successfully
completed even with a successful
completion of the review you should
still click view readiness report and
view the report before you perform the
actual upgrade when reviewing the
readiness report you can use the find
option to search for a particular word
within the report such as a schema name
or a particular command be sure to
review the report and correct any issues
before you start the actual upgrade the
readiness check can be run any number of
times before the actual upgrade is
performed however don't run the check
after an upgrade is performed because
the report won't provide valid results
we've seen the successful installation
of 12c Fusion Middleware infrastructure
and so a suite in a new Oracle home
directory we've run the upgrade
readiness check to verify our system is
ready for upgrade if you have the need
to install JDeveloper this might be a
logical time to do it we're gonna skip
that step in this demo so we're ready to
enter the upgrade phase of our project
in the next video in this series we'll
demonstrate using the repository
creation utility to create required
database schemas for 12c until then I'm
