introductions we'll start with Kirk hi
i'm kirk and you do who what where when
who are you this is it let's do out what
is your name what do you do and and
what's you what do you what's your
association with java hi i'm kirk i
create trouble in the openjdk mailing
lists yeah and let's see do performance
tuning stuff and I do tooling through
company called J clarity training
through my company called code work your
turn thanks Cort my name is George sob
I'm the vice president for development
for java SE at oracle and i'm also the
chairperson of the openjdk governing
board so my name is Matias Coulson I run
the Swedish Jacques and I am you flip
side I'm a java champion oh right i'm a
java champion so that they can read that
right here they can but yeah not for me
and i also run a big conference in
stockholm koj focus alright so my name
is Henry stole I'm responsible for
strategy for the Java platform which
means i'm having an unenviable task of
trying to keep you guys happy while
trying to get someone else to pay for
java so that we can continue to keep you
guys happy
how's that working out for you I am I
have to ask my other self hi I'm John
URI i'm the founder and president of the
greenville java users group in
greenville south carolina i'm also one
of the community leads for java.net for
java user groups worldwide and the java
enterprise community excellent so we've
got good representation both from the
Oracle side and from the community so
this should be pretty good yeah did you
think yeah I did I in the beginning he's
nervous uh okay so in between these
let's start off on a really good
positive note so it's been it's you know
it's been a couple of years that Oracle
got involved with open source and what
in Java and I know that it's been kind
of a struggle getting involved with the
community from my perspective it looks
like you've done relatively good job and
you know there's definitely some growing
pains what you know what do people think
what what what we'll start with Kirk
over there what what's your thought from
the commuter what does the community
think well it's been an interesting ride
I mean you can see that there's a lot of
people inside Oracle that like community
and they certainly like to involve
community and they've done a very
successful job of trying to engage
community given the restrictions they've
been put under and really the
restrictions have been they've been put
under is by people who don't understand
community don't really know how to
interact with community and really some
are somewhat of afraid of community
because community is it's messy it's a
it's more democratic in in and in when
it comes to Java you're you're dealing
with a group that was used to owning the
product as opposed to community in this
case is really about some what about
ownership and the community feels that
they have
or should have some ownership of Java
the platform and therefore you know some
saying and I think you know from where
they initially started that we've made
some really really good progress we're
now I think the community now feels that
okay there is you know ownership a
feeling of ownership of the platform out
in the community and I think or the
people in Oracle have gotten more
comfortable with the idea that that they
can actually work with the community in
in a less of a command and control type
structure and more in it more of a you
know democratic way i should say it's
good how about from oracle wants to take
that bedside george l I'll take us out
so I think first of all is very
interesting to think about what we mean
when we say the community right we say
the community but there are really lots
of different communities that we have
and engage in constantly right so when
we think about Java there are lots of
different communities around Java each
of the Java user groups that we have or
our communities we have you know we
talked about the java community meaning
kind of everyone who uses Java
everywhere for anything we talked about
you know the OpenJDK community which is
very specific kind of community focused
on a particular kind of task and then
you know we also you know all of us
belong to other kinds of communities so
as an example you know we have a
community of developers within Oracle
working on Java we have communities of
developers within Oracle using Java you
know who are also sort of our our users
in some sense and so you know each of
these communities have kind of their own
needs and their own dynamics and so you
know for me when I think about it and
you know what does it mean to be
successful in the commune
we'll really we have to sort of
understand what all of these are and
find a way to work well together with
people you know for the goal that we're
trying to achieve and what I would say
is you know i can tell you personally
having sort of coming into this I spent
actually many years on the development
team at son back in the early days of
Java and then was sort of a way for a
while and then was reunited with many
old friends and former and then and now
current colleagues when son was acquired
by oracle and so you know i can say that
it was uh it was very interesting you
know kind of going out and saying you
know being put into the situation where
now all of a sudden you know we're sort
of responsible for being stewards of
java and so having people come and say
you're doing this right you're doing
this wrong you know you guys don't know
what you're doing and figuring out in
the context of these different
communities what does it mean and how do
we act how should we act and and how can
we you know how can we get to a point
where people sort of understand that we
care deeply about job we're investing
heavily in Java and there are lots of
reasons for that and you know it's not
always as a parent as it might be but we
do have you know javas best interests at
heart and we try to show that you can so
yeah and what I would say is now in
general and you know I'm very interested
in hearing people's feedback I usually
ask people when I make them and get a
chance to people to speak with
individuals you know how how people
think we're doing and overall what I
would say is like my feeling the vibe
that I get from you guys is like a
couple of years ago everyone was kind of
worried and wondering you know what is
this going to mean and you know is this
going to be like completely horrible and
now this great technology is not
usable or what's going to happen and you
know last year I felt that like you know
we've made some progress in terms of
people kind understanding you know what
our intentions are which is to invest
and make this technology great and it
feels like this year I'm getting even
more of that like that to me it doesn't
seem like a question now in the same way
that it was for people a couple years
ago okay anyway that's that's kind of my
feeling okay great so let's let's kind
of change the subject here a little bit
and let's kind of talk about the big
elephants in the room as of late you
know we've we've really had some issues
lately regarding security what's the
process and why is it taking so long we
have several reports and I'm not going
to specifically ask about any security
but i will say that there were
situations where issues were reported
very long ago and it waited till the
zero-day got out then things started to
happen so to speak what is taking what's
the process why is it taking so long as
there is is there a way to speed that up
a lot of people in the community
especially in open source we're very
used to talking to the two to the
projects behind the scenes privately and
they get a patch out of darn fast as I
can what's what what's been the hold up
for some of these issues what what is
the process that causes that let me
start here George so security is very
difficult topic because he immediately
ready to liability problems we have a
responsibility not only to the early
adopters among the open source community
who could pick up a patch and use it
immediate and fix their stuff but to all
the I don't know hundreds of millions of
users of Java author many are like my
grandmother she has no idea we have
Enterprise Calif Maribeth our entire
business of Java and there are some like
very important elements to have we
handle security there are some like high
level principles like for instance when
we communicate something about security
we have to communicate to everyone at
once we can't have anyone get an unfair
advantage because the risk is that that
guy gets on for advantage is the crook
another thing is we have a public
schedule for how we do security updates
and a large number of constituents plan
their own kind of upgrades based on this
schedule and if we start breaking the
schedule it makes things extremely
difficult for them so taken together the
rules that we have to work with have
being based on years and years of
experience on how you do enterprise
software now one of the things that we
work me through is maybe some of these
need to be adapted to work better for a
big kind of consumer type product so
that's something that we're looking at
but we do have to work within the
confines or gonna be these policies and
rules that we have in order not to run
into liable the problems in order not to
cause more damage with regards of these
we can't discuss specific
vulnerabilities but the process we have
is something gets submitted we immediate
start looking at it and frequently the
issue that gets submitted to us is not
of a quality which is good enough to
actually figure out whether it is a
problem or not so that usually there is
a lot of Port and back between us and
the reporter there's a specific process
this follows once we've identified there
is an issue the reporter gets notified
and we usually negotiate like what's
what time period do we have 50 kind of
the beta patch and agree with them that
they tried to kind of keep things quiet
and not reveal details about it in order
not to expose the community as it work
to this issue then we issue a patch we
publish an advisory and that kind of the
other thing okay now in the meantime if
we start seeing a real issue in the
field we may make an exception and issue
a specifically release for that in order
to kind of protect people but going out
too often too early causes more harm
than good so it's it's very difficult
balance we're trying our best okay John
you got any comments on that from the
users one of the
things that I think is important from
the user side of the equation is that as
users you mentioned your grandmother she
doesn't understand it but she it does
understand when a chrome browser tells
her to disable Java when we as
developers lose out on that because when
they disable it what's the process of
getting it re-enabled because once we
lose them or once they believe that the
java is dysfunctional or that it's going
to damage their computers or that
they're somehow you know there might be
some sort of monetary loss or something
something that scares them it's very
hard to get them to come back so from
the community standpoint or from the
user standpoint and as developers the
lack of communication I know that you
don't specifically want to talk about
vulnerabilities in detail but there has
been a lot reported in the press about
the lack of communication from Oracle
about like zero-day exploit and I think
maybe that's a part of the process that
that needs to be looked at that you know
Oracle says yes we recognize that there
you know there's potentially an issue
here and just acknowledge that yes you
know we're looking at it just the
acknowledgement that you're looking at
it give some sort of sense of security
and I think communication with the
community exactly well with that being
said you kind of bring up a point that
goes into you know we're starting to see
quite a bit of lash back in the industry
in his Oracle really concerned about the
backlash you know we're seeing the
companies in the meeting and the media
is starting to state hey remove job get
rid of it it stinks it's it's a security
problem you need to get rid of it or you
know your bank accounts were being
stolen you know let's let's start off
with the with matias here yeah i think
that one of the issues is really about
you know the communication part of it
marketing for from femara so this is
something that actually is from the IT
magazine
in Sweden you know it's it's a tabloid
we know that all the time everybody that
works in Sweden knows that but still we
have this security experiences dumped
Java she says it a serious security
issue in the platform not only a
specific for for the browser plug-in
which she says it's an issue that are in
the Java platform and you know people
read this and I would like and it
becomes an issue for for for us even if
we work on the server side we have to
deal with Oracle yeah so all right to
start with I'm not gonna take that one
yeah you guys do it so to start with
most of the kind of news article has
said something like this aren't very
specific with what they mean they mean
like stop using Java all together what
they're really saying is maybe you
should stop using the Java plug-in and
as a matter of fact maybe we should stop
using it but for another reason which is
the real initial reason to have the plug
in there was that my web browser didn't
have any functional that would enable
them to be dynamic fine now they have I
can do javascript you can do other
things you don't really need the Java
plug-in anymore all right so I should as
a matter of fact we think it's good idea
to move away from the Java plug-in long
term we can't do it immediately because
a lot of companies still depend on it
but if I were to make you guys a
recommendation don't develop any new
plug-in applications don't like there
are better ways to do this today we have
a question from the audience
yep strong job
what's a plug-in well right so we don't
go out and comment on security issues in
media and this is just a policy issue
one of those that's difficult to change
if you go and read the security advisory
which is like the official position from
us very clearly states what is and what
is not vulnerable and that is how we
communicate I I think what are you
saying is that there's how you
communicate but then there's how this
nice tabloids communicate yeah and then
you know my question was you know what's
a plug-in well okay we know what a
plug-in is but you know does your
grandmother know what a plug-in is well
there is it okay yeah yep so there's too
much jargon looking like promise yeah
well it's about us it's about an easy to
tell the tabloid to stop writing things
like this at it is to try to get them
not to publish pictures of the topless
royalty
the boss majority menthols and planning
the question
yep okay Martin your life that you make
is natural from here the disputed
communication close that so discreet the
damn inflation up with these Twitter you
start media you've got your own freely
bloggers very friendly analysts and
things so you Samara yeah that's
actually is a very good point and I I
know my tias the other day asked me like
Henrik you have to tell me what does it
community what should we do for you I
you know what this is like one of those
places when we issue an advisory we can
just send you guys a link to it because
you guys are smart enough to understand
what it says and you can help correct it
in media as a matter of fact if we try
to do it there's a fair chance that
someone will just use it against us
because that's that's the way the
tabloids work and and this is one of
those things like you're you know I
think you make a good comment about it
would be nice we could go out and say
this only affects this you don't have to
worry about in this kind of situation
but that's also the kind of thing that
you know can be kind of turned around
and it will Oracle is making all kinds
of excuses and they say that this is
fine but for mine it actually isn't and
you know we don't know the specifics of
everyone's situation and that's why we
try to be as very you know as clear and
crisp and precise on exactly what it is
is wrong and what we've done to fix it
is who can be I you know your your
comment on social media is great I know
just looking around the room I see
probably 10 or 15 people that I believe
follow me on twitter I'll go welcome to
G underscore saw public but you know the
point is that most of those people
actually have a significantly much
larger number of followers right and so
that kind of distribution is kind of
thing where I'm happy you know we're
happy to put things out and say this
thing is out there and then you know
like kind of turn the horses loops
a lot of us especially countries near to
one can get a question right those
happened probably more probably needing
more direct communication with the
powers that be rather than just relying
on hey maybe I'll tweet this and see
what happens so so I'm sorry we have two
things not so this is the first thing
that the cumin the community actually
worked out that what I did you this yeah
so what I did of course I was actually
writing up the debate article afterwards
but I was reaching out for you guys to
get some help with that can I didn't get
that so you cancelled so in that sense
it actually works we did something right
me and a couple of friends that are
actually involved in the last movement
but i think that the current policy it
really works when you have business to
business but when you have when oracle
have java that is kind it's really this
is to consumer and i think that you
maybe we don't think that the current
policy work at wall for for the
community yeah nice good i think
actually what what I think we may want
to do is to take a few are you that why
can say wise things about us and
actually bring bring you in front of the
people that set the policy on our side
seriously and have a conversation with
them because again no one no one is
malicious everyone it means while
everyone intends well but the reality is
Oracle as a corporate entity has for a
very long time not being involved in
community and it takes a lot of time
front time for them to understand what
the community means now we're doing our
best and with your support we've gone a
lot come a long way night I I think this
is one place where son made more
effective use of the Java champion
program in the past is that when
different things like this happened they
would come to us in confidentiality and
Earth's in some confidential situation
say look you know this is this is what's
going on and this is how we are
intending to respond you know what what
do you guys think about this and that
general and then it sort of get some
reaction at least from there that would
sort of help them gauge what the the
general reaction in the in the overall
general public
would be and this is one thing that I
just haven't seen happening in the last
couple of years I guess just one thing I
wanted to mention on this in general so
Henrik referred to this but for like
knowing what the Oracle policies are
around this kind of thing if you if you
google Oracle security fixing policy you
will come to the page that describes
exactly what the policy is and also has
a link to how we work with researchers
and I personally found it interesting as
you know I read many of these articles
you know how much speculation there was
about they do this they don't do that
this is what yo and and the crazy thing
is it's like if you look at that page it
says very very explicitly exactly what
the policy is and much of what was
speculated was completely completely
wrong and now you know we can't kind of
do everyone's homework for them and but
in general the idea is that that is out
there and that doesn't that doesn't
change and that particular for
particular situations we don't go and
give a custom message each time it's
like but in the absence of information
well there was speculation yeah and that
was actually win the question came up
that's why I kind of referred to those
on the mailing list for champions ok
we'll take we'll take one more question
and then we're going to move on to the
next one yes
for years then some horrible the tolit
change so I think that our issues as a
community already used certain searching
cedar certain the communication between
the community now it's completely
changed to ybor goals security
procedures and you clearly specified by
there are different from what we're used
to I guess we are okay let's let's save
out we're gonna have a little audience
questions so let's save some of these
questions for a little later so we can
can I ask one question to the audience
all right given that we have this
program we have people whose sole job it
is to work on this would it help you if
we in one of our regular jag leader
champion calls invite someone that can
like talk a little bit about this and on
that phone call do Q&amp;amp;A with you because
I can easily arrange that that's very
easy thank you no I think that's good
that's a resounding yes okay moving on
so let's bring up the issues with javafx
some of the questions out there are you
know we had a couple of round table
discussions when we were in create and
discussed with a number of developers
about javafx this is kind of going to be
a lightning rod because some people
really like javafx but at the end of the
day what's the real big push from Oracle
for this who really uses it we hear
about one or two customers using it out
in the world I personally have never
seen anybody use it why dump money and
resources into detect that majority of
people may not use and then we talk
about that and how
it's going to run on tablets and how we
get past the Big Apple elephant in the
room for adoption on devices I think
he'll will freeze over before Java runs
on an iPad so the question we have is
what's the big push on javafx let's
let's start with Kirk over there what's
the thought from the community on that
the honest thought from the community is
that too long too little we've just
waited too long for this and it still
has every time we thought okay maybe we
can actually try to use this I mean
personally I've been wanting to use this
stuff in some in some shall we say
desktop applications because some of the
visualizations you can chew a chi vinh
NFX I think our can make for some really
interesting user experiences and in
terms of you know how you visualize even
performance data and stuff like that but
we just haven't been able to make the
investment in FX because the technology
has just not been there and i would say
that even two years ago we went in vegas
with steve chin and we tried to do like
a visual vm sorry yeah javafx plugin for
visual vm and it was shall we say you
know it was just an unfortunate
experience I would say you know when we
finally did get something working it was
like fantastic but you know dude we just
ran into bug after bug after bug and
unfortunately you know fortunately
steven was able to get a number them
fixed but eventually our demo just
failed because we just couldn't get past
that last bug in it and I know there's
other people out there that are just
looking at the technology and saying
yeah we really this is something that we
really really want what we really need
it to work and we needed to integrate
well into into some of the existing like
swing frameworks there's things like
that that we already have right because
we can't replace all that stuff and you
known to be quite honest and again those
people have just not been able to
justify the investment from there
and in order to to move forward because
just you know and and i think is stefan
here Stefan Johansson I think he's made
huge efforts to use FX with parlays and
stuff like that and and and today he's
still running in in different
technologies even though it's you know I
I think he's were made a real honest
attempt at trying to get this thing to
work in FX you know um so it's it's
unfortunate because I think you know I
think you know the premise behind the
technology is is is actually very good
and I'd really love to see it working
Oracle did I start should I thought okay
sure so so lucky in this case I'm Oracle
and not son please don't please don't
blame us for what son did with the
technology leading up to everything
before Joe efforts to because I actually
thought that the direction that they
were heading was wrong okay um now you
know about US presidents right yeah I no
matter what Bush has done it's obama's
fault Obama so I adore FX is interesting
because it seems like powerful the
people i talk to love it and half of the
people that I talk to say why the hell
do you even care right and it makes it
really hard to know what the right thing
is to do but my view is the following if
you look across all all applications
that do kind of view I like today the
majority of those applications are done
for tablets and phones okay the reality
is most of those are done either only
for iOS or they are html5 apps it's very
very rare I'm sorry to say this google
people it's very rare that people do
things only for android okay especially
if they try to make money out of it like
you do it through the apple app store
because that's where the majority of the
people with money are we we could
provide your FX with that platform but
it's a very significant investment and
once it's out there it has to be
really good otherwise it doesn't make
sense so it kind of scratching I had a
little bit back and forth on that in the
meantime having it available as a
framework for building rich desktop
applications it's not a huge is tundish
for you I technology but it's still an
important niche building tools building
highly interactive applications for
certain markets so we're seeing
significant doctrines among some of our
customer base of financial logistics a
few of those research are using this
mostly there are they're building from
scratch or they're going from SWT swing
and they're basically expanding what
they already have with JavaFX and over
time their kind of replacing pieces and
the we we are told that the productivity
of working affects compared to working
in a style his swing is significantly
better people say I'm trying to fly like
it myself so we'll continue to have it
focus on it for desktops because it's a
niche where it can be successful if that
niche is small so be it but it's still a
significant number of people that need
to write the type of application and the
second dish where we believe it's useful
is in embedded systems that may not have
connectivity that that may be too small
to run a web browser and where you need
to be able to kind of adapt the user
interface to like a very small screen or
a specialized devices so we started with
desktop remember it's only been out for
a year it's actually very young
technology the next step is doing
embedded which means we're doing like
arm and other embedded ports that was
released Sunday we're open sourcing all
of javafx before the end of the year and
then working with in particular embedded
vendors to get it enabled and all sorts
of weird kind of system of the chips
combinations and from there if if we
decide or if you decide that we want to
take it to tablets or smartphones this
step is very small maybe Google picks it
up and use it for Android I know not
very likely but i think the investment
we haven't it makes sounds okay okay
John
well I've gotta get a different take on
it I think it is a cool technology
without a doubt but how many people know
what f3 is okay so you've been around
long enough to know that Java effects
started off as f3 and it has been around
for a very very long time I think the
first time I heard about this I think
2004 so it's it's been a very very long
path and there was a lot of initial
damage agreed a lot of initial damage
was done by Sun up front you know
releasing a product that doesn't have a
data grid when you're telling people
it's a replacement for you know swing
type technologies if you don't have a
data grid you just lost all your
business users they you know by cluding
together something where you could
actually put a swing data grid on on FX
and then some of the other controls it
was incomplete when it was released so
you know without a doubt there was a lot
of damage done up front and that takes a
lot of time to recover from but one of
the things that keeps happening is it
seems like the the release from start to
finish has been so so long that the
other technologies you know are catching
up html5 you know it is offering a lot
of really cool functionality to so is it
going to still be the big question
becomes is it's still going to be
relevant when everything is complete and
I think that's the the tough question to
answer the the ramp up time has just
been too too long and a daily I like a
day late and a dollar short a day later
we all are shown in I I do think it i
mean it's sexy without a doubt it's just
a really cool and sexy technology but
it's I've been waiting for the javafx
web they talked about it last year it is
now Java one this year and I haven't
heard anything about javafx web I mean
that that's just one of the examples
that just comes to mind okay we'll take
one question from the audience
something struck me every time you saw
taxes heart will never give a clear
message about what went wrong so every
time you say Joe affects some time oh
it's a rich clients promise factor so so
most of the members before so are you
doing the flash so I think you guys need
strong message exactly what kind of the
trench so what you put a desktop is
messed up from and also to provide
cooling down good offers okay all right
so i have a 19 so there's a jogging in
stock oh there is a company that came up
after Stephen was there and they are
actually transforming aura the entire
swing swing application definite I know
wow great okay one more
in here right be singing competitions
right now and as we might real
okay let me ask Larry white one thing
right so one of the concerns about
javafx 60 htmls they are taking over the
world there is too small and is for
javafx diary for oracle is going to give
up on it and therefore i shouldn't be
working on it like let me very clear on
one thing like for desktop app for
embedded systems we are going to
continue to invest in FX for a long time
because we make money or it's very
simple w moved an application brokers in
this is almost every application almost
everybody
okay great let's move on to the next
question and then we'll start taking
questions from the audience jigsaw
question is that that that created
definitely a lot of irate folks out in
the industry I for one them on 342 and
that created quite a quite a bomb on the
mail lists on 342 about the delay of of
jigsaw the big concern is that delay is
going to cause a lot of fragmentation in
the industry for modular capabilities
within our systems people say no it's
not we're going to wait for jigsaw yet
at the vendor show we saw IBM stand up
and say hey we rolled our own look what
we did we created our own modular system
and it's great it works just awesome so
the question is what's the delay with
jigsaw is there a concern of
fragmentation we've got jboss modules
we've got osgi we've got who knows what
that's out there you know what's what
are what are some of the concerns
regarding slowest of modularity coming
to fruition what what's going on should
we start with start with local matters
oh great thanks every this is you know
this is the point in the panel with like
everyone's standing even and like
everyone takes a step back except me and
like okay well what are you guys okay so
um I I think you know the thing to look
look at what you saw is that you know
the change that we're talking about here
is one that is is you know quite a deep
change to the underpinnings of of Java
and how we program pours it right so in
essence it's really really important
that we get this right okay so you know
we want to make sure that we are doing
this in a way that is transparent and
where we can get feedback and above all
where we can try things
and allow people to try those things and
give us feedback based on that and so
what what we have been doing here is
like as we're doing this work you know
it has been going on for a while and you
know we looked at sort of you know where
where are we in the overall scheme of
the things that you know we know now and
the things we know that we have left to
do and our feeling was that basically
based on where things were we felt that
what there was a substantial risk of
having happen was that in the sort of
eagerness to kind of you know get this
get this done you know we didn't we
weren't careful enough for caused issues
and ended up causing more harm than good
in a way that was very you know that
would last for all of us for many many
years into the future sorry now don't
mean to cut you short but we're starting
to run out of time but let's get a
response from I will say I completely
yeah ok I'm going to say that in this
case I think you guys have made
absolutely the right choice my
experience with module system predates
java and i can tell you if you screw
this up it's going to be really really
bad so yes I think yes genera thank you
in July I personally think that a delay
is fine one of them so lightly that's
important though is to be able to go out
and communicate to using the Java user
group leaders using the Java champions
and using the folks and sessions or come
like this is to to make sure that they
understand why so that when people ask
again this is the communication piece
yeah when they ask why you can go back
and say it's a very complex system and
even when things look really good and
looked like there could be right you
could end up like mark up on the stage
for the keynote you know magic system
and having it in having take now not
that it was caused by the modules but
there we go I am I have a request can we
make these two hours long next year next
year we can make it two hours I want to
thank everybody thank our panel
