service to securely connect all your
devices to Oracle Internet of Things
cloud service gather valuable data from
those devices analyze and process the
data received in real time and deliver
the process data to your enterprise
applications or other integrated
services so how do we get started first
we need to make sure the device model we
want to use already exists then we
create an IOT application that will be
used to address a specific business
problem an IOT application requires
association with a device model
definition of an exploration and the
creation of an integration with one or
more external systems we can then
optionally filter the participating
devices now or at a later time after the
IOT application is defined we have to
register and activate the devices that
we want to be part of that IOT
applications scope now let's step
through those tasks the first thing we
need to do is make sure the device model
we need is available a device model
specifies the specific message format
and resources the device provides it
lets Oracle Internet of Things cloud
service know how to interact with that
device devices can support multiple
device models if the model we need isn't
there yet we can add it here we'll use
the temperature sensor device model
let's briefly look at that this urm
serves as the unique ID for this device
model this temperature sensor device
model defines the temperature attribute
a test me action an alert message and a
data message that the device can send
you can define more of these if needed
so now we have a device model now we're
ready to create an IOT application
associate the IOT application to the
temperature sensor device model we
looked at earlier define the
explorations that will allow us to
analyze and process the data sent by the
devices using the temperature device
model
you
next we can integrate the IOT
application with existing enterprise
applications or other supported external
services the integration allows
processed data and alert messages to be
sent to the integrated applications or
services for further analysis or
processing at this point we can
optionally refine the set of devices
that we want our IOT application to use
the default is that all the registered
devices that support the Associated
device models are included in the total
devices account we're done defining the
IOT application now we have to make sure
that the devices are registered with the
coracle Internet of Things cloud service
these devices must support the device
models used in the IOT application to be
included in the application scope we can
register a single device or a batch of
our devices by using a CSV file let's
quickly register a single device device
ID and shared secret values are assigned
after registration we need those values
when we are configuring the registered
device the next steps are to download
install and configure the Oracle
Internet of Things cloud service science
software on the register device when we
start that software it activates the
device to start a secure communication
with our Oracle Internet of Things cloud
service instance the connection is now
established so we can monitor the
activities within the scope of the IOT
application using the applications
dashboard or from the Oracle Internet of
Things cloud service home page thank you
