Seattle because I used to live in
Seattle for about 15 years old and and
and all the like engineers loves the
cloud the drains money so nn-no rain
money for for those all those vendors
who are going to build products that are
enabling enterprises in cloud so today's
topic we are going to discuss about pass
or platform as a service so this is an
agenda some how many of you guys have
started using pass a little bit okay so
and how many of you guys have started
using infrastructure as a service okay
so says you like dick this is just a
primer on the cloud I'm not going to
spend a lot of time so there are three
our tarts you can say up loud and Annan
and then all the if you look at the
cloud platforms they claim about
polyglot or multiple Lang or
multi-language support so I want to be a
little bit funny in this presentation
and I want to show my polyglot like
capability I can speak a little bit of
Hindi although hindi is not my primary
language so you know I ask is like us
like that means i wish like every
developer wish for for infrastructure
service i get a vm somewhere I'll
diploma application I play around and
pass passes in Hindi is very close means
and then the past platforms are not
there yet they are very close they are
going to do a lot of work and fast
sasson hindi is isn't his mother-in-law
everybody look has a high tender little
love relationship with your mother in
law you know so and all the developers
love hates us because they think SAS
platforms is going to take away their
job like one hour instead of doing
Oracle implementation of CRM I'm going
we are buying Salesforce
so anyway so taking me they having to a
little bit serious note now so what are
the differences between like the
traditional enterprise applications and
cloud-based applications this is what
the differences we think as or being at
least hyped as a market in the market
space that traditional applications are
always deployed inside the enterprise
and and the cloud-based applications are
always deployed in the cloud or Internet
and the and the cloud-based traditional
applications are always customer force
face like internal customer facing and
internal applications and the
cloud-based application are always
external customer facing and an done
gone out the old days of like three tier
applications with ejb or the web tier
differently in different tiers and
that's what the people think about the
enterprise applications and and if you
look at most of the guys think the the
actual cloud-based applications use all
the different kind of services like case
of cash services storage persistence
everything in the cloud and then and the
and the enterprise applications are
traditionally jet java ee
technology-based and has heavy
dependency on on the relational database
whereas the newer generation
applications everybody think they have
to use jump into the big data no sequel
paradigm and all this different thing we
think about but you know like when you
start to think about and try to deploy
your applications re-architect europe
enter enterprise applications to
cloud-based application think about ejb
10 so you know everybody jumped into the
ejb one of bandar gun and started build
multi-tier applications the remote ejbs
and then they complained about that this
applications didn't scale because you
did not use the right architecture you
didn't want and so think about that
before jumping into
into the cloud-based application band
organ the reality of the reality or not
all applications are switchable for the
cloud and if you are building a startup
it's great so you do not have to buy a
new hardware do not have to buy weblogic
or any application server or no in
basically initial investment on anything
you just bail your applications and
deploy and a lot of like I need a small
survey of the myself is a unscientific
survey and and then am I am just making
a claim here that my company do not
build any cloud or pass platform so it's
not a vendor is not going to be vendor
which I sway my independent view of
whatever playing around with this cloud
platforms for the past year or so so and
then there is great for development and
testing the cloud platforms are because
life example in our organization also
whenever we are running out of the
resources in the test environment we
just go and go to Amazon ec2 and block
some VMS and do our testing ourselves so
it's great for for enterprises for
development and testing and that's what
most of the organizations are doing and
infrastructure as a service and and the
past platforms so I am so infrastructure
a service is very popular among lot of
enterprises most of the enterprises are
using it and the past are here and still
evolving so as I said with passes close
they are not yet they're close but
they're still evolving and the concept
of private cloud is gaining a lot of
momentum there lot of companies have a
lot of different resources they are not
being used or underutilized so people
are trying to build your own private
cloud inside their enterprises and a lot
of companies are are putting even there
are three tier applications into the
cloud so but that's the reality so white
pass or why do you want as a
organization why you
the invest in a past platform because
there is no initial investment and as a
developer you do not have to worry about
the actual infrastructure like the what
a version of the application server you
are you going to use what is the patch
on the actual operating system you level
is going to be what version of the Java
you're going to use so you just focus on
the applications and not on the actual
infrastructure and the greatest benefit
is the pay and as you guys goes on or
pay as you use a kind of mechanism so in
seat are buying a lot of hardware and
application servers and all the other
not and bolts for putting your
applications you just use something in
the cloud and then based on your load
you can you can use the elasticity or or
mechanism of the cloud provider to grow
to and based on your load you just pay
to your pass provider or the cloud
provider and there is no ongoing
administration costs like like upgrading
the patch patching your application
server patching your operating systems
day-to-day monitoring of all this
platform and basically is a dynamic
scaling so you do not have to worry
about buying this hardware to scale
that's the that's the only thing that
you get as a kind of benefits for for
the past platform and and like in some
of the places mushrooms grows widely so
the past platforms has grown like
mushrooms so you see there are lot of
paths platforms and everybody is trying
to bank on onto this but I have taken
some of the top pass platforms and then
played around card applause some of the
applications and see what other things
make sense so like amazon has ec2 has
been stock for as a java pass platform
then cloudbees is one of the leading
startup they have the wrong one is cloud
and then there is another startup called
J
astic there they were and initially says
Java hosting provider so they are now
they're claiming themselves as a pass
vendor with tomcat and Java EE then
jboss reddit has open shipped Oracle has
announced this Oracle cloud but I have
requested many times to get access to
that I had never got any access to that
so I have no visibility is supposed to
be based on weblogic and it is limited
availability cell sports acquired a
company called Heroku so they were
initially Ruby on Rails and other
platforms what they have expanded their
platforms to Java and vmware acquired
springs force before the spring source
accord a company called cloud foundry so
they are they have the open source cloud
foundry pass platform and there are lot
of other companies are also offering and
services or like they have a private
pass for cloud foundry some of the
companies are providing in in public but
is still the cloud foundry themself
claim itself as a beta platform not a
production platform so one of the the
Fast Pass platform was Google App Engine
so they support both Java and then fight
on but the Java API support is very very
limited in there and they have sub light
JSP and Google web toolkit for for the
web front application development and
they have JDO and JPA as their
persistence here and interestingly they
were not giving any access to relational
databases initially but they have now
launched their cloud sequel which is a
sequel based my sequel platform for for
relational data storage and they have
the opinion data store there is a no
sequel objected a store and they have
cloud storage for storing large objects
if you want to let media files or or
graphic file what are we going to
and they have a for development platform
they have a Eclipse plug-in and they
provide an SDK to build applications and
you can deploy war file not like for
example when I when I started this
exercise so I wanted to test really
whether these are real java pass or
whether you can deploy real applications
so it took two different applications
and try to see whether these
applications will be deploying to this
platform without making any changes one
was the famous j pet store but it is a
modified with the version i took the
modified version of the j pet store that
was modified by spring and I batteries
so the diabetes J pet stores I didn't
have an ejb it can be a one a war file
that can be deployed with the relational
databases and and the other application
that i took is a is a simple application
that i built using ejb3 jpa for my book
and I just try to see how many what are
the things motive are required to be
modified and deployed and then and
Google App chien basically failed
miserably in that test because first
thing is that you cannot deploy directly
then you can a pure j2ee application
like which a sad ejb3 for example and
and the I bet is application so when I
started the enterprise at the my
exercise at that time they had they were
not providing access to this cloud
sequel so I had to make a lot of changes
in the applications to use the the
object store to make it work but so so
but one thing is that Google is a large
company they have very successful in in
the cloud area a lot of applications
they are deployed in there they have
good like kind of put scalability story
there but they have a lot of limitations
like pro patria p I you have to depend
on portability is a big big thing you
cannot just take a war file and deployed
there is a very limited control on jvm
for example I want to monitor something
or or you want to add a new jar file on
undermine JVM
which my applications depend on you
cannot do that and the size of the
application is limited like the other
thing basically I this all the services
whatever i use i did not pay for any
money so there might be some feature i
may not have have available to to me so
i used on the all the free services
those you are offered for two weeks or
three weeks or four weeks or forever
bye-bye these vendors so they have a
limited sorry you like for example jpa
if you want to use or like jdbc a player
like if they do not have all those so
you're liable if your application is
using oracle database for example and
you want to use that they're having
access to your oracle database yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah this is war fire yeah so
this is like a example of like how like
what are the things you need to do for
example for for a database connections
if you have to use the google our dms
and stands name and and guestbook
variable to make changes in your and and
then this is an example of your eclipse
plugin so i have a lot of slides to
cover so i'll go a little bit fast so
imagine binstock so imagine is very
popular for in the cloud environment
like ec2 so they support the binstock
environment supports java PHP n dot net
and java api is basically so it's a web
app it's a embedded apache tomcat 7
container so you can if you have a war
file you will be able to deploy the war
file into the the container it's but
it's a just a web-based application and
and if you have database usage amazon
ec2 has a lot of variety of databases
they have of our relational database
like oracle my sequel sequel server on
the cloud so you can if you if you are
comfortable enough to use your data in
there you can put your data in there
and you can use it and they have a no
sequel database DynamoDB and a lot of
other functionality like for example if
you want to send email they have a
simple email if you want to store large
objects they have all different kind of
and for development they have a Eclipse
plays bass plug-in and sdk and the good
thing was like if you have a standard
war file you can just take it and
deployed it provides some limited access
to the JVM so you can make changes to
the JVM parameters and and they provide
some limited monitoring of the container
the liberal limitations is only web
applications and it's based on tomcat so
if you have an application so it is for
example if you want thinking to move
from weblogic to reduce costs to the
cloud then then you have to make some
changes in there so this is like is very
easy to use the UI is very intuitive so
if you want to create a first
application like if you're able you said
okay you want this 32 me to create a new
application the applause where were you
you're the URL could be it's very easy
to use intuitive environment to deploy
your applications and they provide some
capability to forum will change the hip
size if you have a larger vm and some
can change some of the command line
options and if you want to really rotate
your log file to s it basically s3
imagine s3 then some there's a simple
storage service then you can do that and
like if you are using a monitoring
service like let us say noodley core or
are my company's BMC application
diagnostics or order f dynamics then you
should be able to change you use this
because they allow you to change the JVM
command line parameters because all this
monitoring agent sits as a java agent a
parameter and you will be able to change
that one
then redhead openshift so this is fairly
new this supports again the talk
multiple languages java Ruby node.js
Python PHP polls so they want to get all
kind of different kind of developers
hooked to a platform and the Java API is
primarily based on on jboss so this is a
good thing is that if you have a jboss
application fairly easy to move that
application to the cloud openshift cloud
it's a they have something called
cattery cartridge-based a platform so
out of the box for example if you have
just jboss and you want to add database
service or based on my sequel for ample
you added a cat reach to that and they
provide outer box experimental
application config and their persistence
is based on my sequel and mongodb and
they provide a cliff space to plug in
and sdk the what the deployment and
management is in nightmare form a
problem because it's a fairly new tool
there is no graphical user interface to
do that so it's primarily based on jit
and there is no web-based management at
all and and from from right now whatever
it looks like sis primarily developer
focus not yet therefore for production
ready aplomb and so if you and then and
the way they will they approach their
environment at this moment is like for
example you have like out-of-the-box
config with like spring simple
application or just Java sample
application so it's kind of pain now
it's a playground for developer to play
around it's not there ready for
production deployment so this is a
example of open shipped so you just pick
the URL and then how do you deploy your
application so they tell you okay this
is the way you deploy application or
this is the way so you have to install
the client on your
on your laptop or desktop to to deploy
your applications next one is VA more
cloud foundry it supports again the talk
multiple language Java Ruby on Rails
node.js Scala and it's primarily the
Java is is again spring based java
persistence services or are either a my
sequel or or cloud foundry order them
they call fabric postgres is a modified
version of a postgres and the no sequel
is based on other oh that could be used
MongoDB readies and and they also offer
their mq rabbitmq as a part of that
service and the development is again
based on the clips is fairly standard
for like everybody probably uses Eclipse
these days and and the they have a
different little bit different approach
so they provide a local development
version local version of that so they
called micro cloud floundering so it's a
vm that you can play around like when
you do not have connectivity to the
internet because all this pass platform
whenever you are doing deployment or
anything you need connectivity to the
Internet so they are approaching little
bit different so you have this micro
cloud foundry which is a vm which is a
local version in your laptop so you can
do play around the development in the
cloud foundry environment and then then
you can deploy that into production
environment and right now again they do
not have any good UI primarily its
command line tools and there is it's not
production ready it's the still claim
beta and but there are several other
vendors like active state company called
active state because it's open Cloud
Foundry is the open source project so a
cliff state is a company a start-up they
are offering private pass offering based
on on Cloud Foundry and there is another
company called F frog they claim
they like the cloud foundry options
whatever they provide is is a
production-ready platform again
limitations is primarily developer
focused portability is a big problem I
mean I couldn't run the their own
version of the J pet store the spring
version of the Jetport stored directly
on the cloud foundry without making some
changes and and they have a lot of
limitations for example my the spring
pet store requires some database tables
to be created in the underlying data
store so I try to use the the x sequel
version whatever they provide and then
and it's like it's a kind of touching
your nose like this for creating the
table schema in the database so again
it's a kind of a development right now
it's not a production-ready platform so
this is an example of the VNC the tool
kit that you can use to deploy your
applications into into cloud foundry
cloudbees so cloudbees offers to kind of
services on the gen keynes and then d
and the java pass platform they support
java Grails and Scala and primarily Java
API web-based platform and their
persistence is based on my sequel and
they have MongoDB couchdb as and
services from a separate company
post-race if you are using postgis
database and development is is other
eclipse-based or sdk based and if you
have a war file it's very easy to use
and deploy the application they have a
web-based UI and and then and they have
partnered with new really can def
dynamics for for JVM monitoring but very
limited access to vm jvn and there is an
it's not full they support for java ee
say they are claiming that they have
java web profile support which is the
lighter version of Java EE
but it is not again full Hawaii support
but it's fairly easy if you have a
simple web application with a my sequel
on the back end so it's primarily if you
are building a startup it is a great
place to start with so this is like an
example of a cloud-based UI and they
provide some basic monitoring capability
of the underlying vm like memory CPU
number of transactions of this is a the
good thing or all I liked about of them
cloudbees is that they provide direct
access to the my sequel database so I
can I could create my tables and schema
for my application so they provide me
the the actual URL is based primarily
whenever I tried is based on ec2 so they
give me URL I could connect directly
using my sequel the client tool to and
could create make manipulation of the
database but i was i was telling as a
free version of the database so every
other transactions fail because they
cannot put my because i'm not paying for
like your property like if I'm IBM is
not being used for for ample 15-20
minutes they kind of sleep my vm and my
database service will not respond but
anyway so i was using a free service so
like I can't complain JJ elastic this is
another platform they support primarily
java and and then they're based on
either tom cat or glass fish they
provide the full job IE last fish
service and the DB service is maria DB
so I you know I basically my sequel
forked so it is a fork up my sequel and
they provide also post crest support and
mongodb is for no sequel platform and
again they provide a Eclipse plug-in and
sdk and deployment and management one
good thing was like I liked about was
that they they provide me full access to
the underlying glassfish server so
I could access the Java EE console what
a glass vase offers and do deployment
configuration changes whatever I could
do limited the limitations was stability
was a big issue their life I will deploy
a nap the vm crosses some time and the
ecosystem is a little bit limited there
and databases is primarily a Maria DV
which I don't know how good or bad it is
GJ elastic like as i was telling you so
it provides direct access to my class
face console so it was you could
manipulate whatever you going to do so
there was a the last one in the best is
Heroku so Heroku is is primarily start
at started as Ruby on Rails and other
platform and they they are kind of
because most of the developers for more
than 2 million developers are using Java
so they are embracing Java platform and
their java api is primarily again very
limited servlets JSP and and Google tool
kit sorry GWT that's a cool web toolkit
and they're based on openjdk and and
persistence is is my sequel post grayson
and mongodb and deployment is like you
have everything you have to deploy as a
using their toolkit you cannot just
packaged in a war file and deployed as a
web application and and they have
partnership with new relic which has
which provides visibility to your
application but limitations is not
appropriate profile to api but there
they announced last two week and REM
force dreamforce they are going to have
proper support for java and i am hopeful
of that and then basically you have very
limited control on the underlying vm and
i'm the Dynamo process basically maximum
as 512mb is the JVM side this is an
example of her
and so how you can deploy your
applications and into her co using there
too so this is a comparison of different
platform so you don't have to i do not
have to read this out you can download
this presentation from from the java one
resource I've already made it available
as a PDF file so you can look at
yourself and then do the comparison
which one is good versus which one is
bad and what you are looking for the
main thing is expectation from what you
are looking for so what what the what I
found what are the issues I found with
the pass platform is most of these
platforms are very very developer
centric at this moment so when you
choose a platform you do not just build
the application and put in the cold
storage you build this application then
you build this application for your
customers use for regular use and where
you want to see the return on investment
so you want some capability in deploying
the production monitoring getting
visibility in your applications and
fixing it and so and then then many of
these customers are looking to reduce
their costs so that they can get rid of
this old hardware and they don't want to
buy a new hardware and move to move to a
plus pass platform so that way you do
not cannot just take your existing
applications and move into into the pass
platform because they have a very
limited Jie support and the other thing
is this like there is no standards so
because everybody's still evolving so
you cannot just deploy your app more
than one platform so whenever you have
like choose choose an for example let's
say cloudbees or cloud foundry and then
and you want to change in future you
have to make a lot of changes and the
other thing is that there is very
limited access to the underlying
infrastructure like many of these
applications at least I have one they
send emails any deploy your applications
in the cloud
is a customer-focused application and
most of this platform do not have even
ability to send outgoing emails you have
to leverage an external services to send
emails so there is the biggest
limitation because if you are using this
kind of platform it is a built and
deployed in cloud you the basic thing
you need is able to send emails and most
of these platforms they do not have
without leveraging and external services
and and in many applications basically
depend on config files like the guidance
system as a resource file and then and
based on whatever the configuration
changes and and there is no most of the
platform do not allow you to use any can
now provide access to the underlying
platform to make any kind of config file
changes and then testability is life
example you have to always depend on the
internet whenever you are using the pass
platform unless you are using the next
generation probably they are going to
have the fly private plus offering from
from many vendors where you can test it
locally the other thing is the security
so security is a big concern for
enterprise are you ready to put your
data in the cloud that's first thing so
if you are ready to put your data in the
cloud then then probably you are good to
go there and most of these are have very
early production deployment and most of
our have like DB services which is
dependent on my sequel not and my sickle
is a very good database but many of the
center prizes like if you use Oracle or
db2 which are and not offered by most of
this enterprises the enterprise or pass
vendors yet so like variable this is an
example just having this little bit
misplaced you this is here so I like how
the resource references in a pass
platform works so you have to depend on
the actual store equitable debut store
is my database in my sick
they're so so the best practices is that
don't jump into the bandwagon yet it's
like in my view it's like the stage or a
2000 like what 10 years back everybody
was trying to jump into this ejb 10 band
Rogan so it's the same stage now after
12 years is like if all these past
platforms are there in a 10 version and
so with for the free version at least so
look at your application do not like
just become so when you build your
application is you build for a year
enterprise for your business do not
build for yourself just to riorca tech
to yourself just to learn pass platform
and then build and settle for a platform
where the whole premise of Java once is
there like four right once and run
everywhere so we and that's the biggest
premise for promise for Java so and then
look for your security requirement
whether your applications really has
secured do not you do not care of the
security then and look for the private
parts like many of the organizations
they are using private cloud in there in
them like for example instead of having
lot of law of different big hardware and
in across your organization they are
consolidating and building their private
plus private cloud so maybe private past
environment makes sense for for you and
and look for those who are emerging and
this is a very unscientific survey i did
so i blogged it tweeted it and also in
indy Joanna posted a survey and like
about the past adoption in the
enterprise how many people have really
adopted pass and evaluating and also out
of I think so far 120 people who have
responded to the survey seventy-three
percent said they are not
evaluating for the next year or two and
five percent they said they are using so
maybe some of my people like me or some
of the vendors who are offering pass so
I don't know who those are but ten
percent days are they are evaluating and
12 person they said they have they have
planned but not not evaluating yet okay
so that's my the conclusion for today is
Java pass are available for many vendors
like if you remember 2000 there were
some 25 application servers vendors now
we have if you count on fingers and
there's one like one hand would fall
have number of applications of servers
available in the market so wait for for
those and Java pasar in a very early
stage and have a lot of portability
issues and like choosing your platform
like you remember there was a great
application server core blue stone if
your name if any if anybody has remember
but they faded away because they were
required by HP and I speed so so think
about this like all those great
application server though they existed
in two thousand and they are no here so
wait for the dust to settle a little bit
before we jump into the bandwagon and
cons for the timing if you look at
deploying a building Europe here if
you're just building your application
how much time does it take to configure
Tomcat or jboss or jetty in your laptop
and a MySQL database or in Oracle
Exadata base less than an hour and if
you can do that in your laptop if you
have a service then wait why do you care
what for the basses is as a kind of a
development platform but if you are are
really looking as a production platform
ready you have to wait in their
enterprise so that's what it is so if
you are any any of the past vendor
sitting here who wants to claim me
the cost is definitely lower law for
smaller application ESO out of this all
these things to be fair I like the cloud
be is offering the best and and J
elastic is promised and then and I was
talking to them yesterday they have
supposedly fixed the asked scalability
and instability issues in the past one
to two months time frame yes o opens
like if there is if you look at the past
platform so there is no standard it's XO
itself yeah OpenStack is primarily for I
en ass away that's from infrastructure
is in service primarily yeah they are
standardizing some of the concept but
not the platform itself like for example
there is a requirement in the gel in the
application for example if you are
offering GI messaging service so there
is no concept of multi-tenancy there in
the GMS so and think about if you are
using toppling core jpa and you are used
storing all these database applications
in 11 table and you want to afore really
off for multi-tenancy for the table so
there is no concept of multi-tenancy in
toppling or hibernate or JP itself so
those are the things they are
standardizing I don't think anybody is
standardizing the past platform yet
so is definitely so that's what i was
saying basically this so the grand
promise of the pass platform is
providing scalability and all all the
administration costs basically no
administration costs or this startup
costs for you so if you are just trying
to deploy your applications in a
production environment highly scalable
environment and and these guys really
provide a great service in elasticity
and an stability and you do not have to
have put your cost in your in your in
your organization you can just leverage
these services so for a startup company
for example if you do not have all this
in your in-house then you can use the
pass platform but the past platform are
not ready yet so you can use is the
programmable infrastructure and service
from like how much time does it take to
configure tom cat in a vm just download
and unzip it and then do you really care
to use a pass platform to use a tomcat
container and in term for amazon will
provide you elasticity for for the
underlying vm if you want
but a so none of the past vendors are
going to look at your applications they
do they will make sure that the actual
container or up or not so you are still
have to have the application monitoring
by yourself and that is the reason for
example the all these pass vendors are
kind of partnering with the monitoring
SAS vendor like New Relic and f dynamics
and they are offering the so that as a
your application support personnel you
have to do the monitoring of yourself
the pass vendors are going to make sure
that your vm dragon crass or the
databases and crafts they're going to
make it available or if you have the
react elasticity configured properly
then if there is a lot of load then it
can they can fork a new vm for you
that's what they are going to do it but
not the actual application monitoring or
Diagnostics if you want to do that you
have to use a SAS you do not have to
worry about
yeah sure
yeah sure
yay honey sorry yeah so imagine is like
variable if you are looking just for
tomcat and then the namma zone is
binstock is very good here they have the
UI another thing ma Sonia so the DUI
basically the DUI yep now what cloud
beasts provide and the partnership they
have for monitoring and also they have
like for example easy partner variable
if you want to you do a lock correlation
of your your applications so this guy is
like cloud-based provide that has
partnership with a company called paper
trail so you can do like switch all the
log files and undo the clock correlation
by them so they have they have built a
very good Co ecosystem around around
them and also their development platform
the Jenkins wherever you are really
versioning and build systems is also
integrated in there yeah yeah so yeah
yes so there so I I didn't buy kind of a
subscribe service but supposedly they
have they they take care of themselves
so so you do not have the I do not have
an like whenever I signed up I de nition
options to take an option for example
there is a patch to you do not want a
patch to be rolled out so whenever they
find a for example a security bug in
underlying Java so they will upgrade
that for you without you being dependent
on them or you cannot decline as far as
I understand you cannot just decline
pushing out a patch on the underlying
platform
I wanted to live to get out in an
enterprise right trying to use
protection amplified world they're
always be some kind of systems are lying
down
there they provide a kind of VP yeah
yeah did they provide some the VPN kind
of capability for them imagine is it
imagine provides say kind of a so it's
kind of provide you think about those
those as as you're basically as a part
of your local network so they provide a
VPN kind of capability yeah yeah yeah
yeahs connect to you yeah and that kind
of they operate as a part of your
network you can say
so yeah so the it's basically so when I
started like I am a product manager for
application performance management so as
there is a like is a product manager I
think always two years what are you
going to do or three years so as a part
of this because this all the past
platforms are gaining momentum or
getting at least a lot of prayers so I
thought okay we should invest now look
at this so that we can make our product
ready for the platform monitoring so as
a part of that I did this research I I
work for the application performance
management product so we have product
called BMC application Diagnostics ok so
I think if you no more questions then
thank you very much for coming and have
very good nice sunny day in San
Francisco</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
