CEO of Tesla of technologies and I
really comes my own project i'm joined
here with by greg static greg is a
product manager of work of developer
tools and steve spyker who's the lead
architect of OSLC at IBM and will
explain that bactrim stands for shortly
Marv Steve Oh laughter so we're going to
talk today about how to link your
application lifecycle so there's been a
lot of change in our life cycles Hudson
and continuous integration have become a
really key part of it but to really make
that work and really make it effective
you need to hook it up to the rest of
your tool chain so you need to hook up
to your other developer tools other
tools are involved in your basic your
ALM stack your application lifecycle
management stack and i'll just start
with a quick story of what happens when
when companies failed to do that so this
is the 787 it was the often delayed
plane that's that's now flying in uh
just 2011 it saw another delay and the
article in this Seattle Times newspaper
was that the GM of the project manager
saying it's not that the brakes didn't
work it's that they had a problem the
traceability of the software that's the
actual quote and then it didn't go into
it any more than that I've actually a
chance to chat about this was boring
folks since then and looked into it what
happened is that they were outsourcing
their break software I think it was
going to General Electric through some
French subcontractor who did the
software the brakes after was all done
to spec everything worked everything
passed the test and then bowing realized
that they didn't have any traceability
between the requirements for the brakes
and the source code they got so they had
none of those links between those two
they have to maintain the software
there's a fair amount of soft on that
plane they have to maintain that
software and that brake system and the
rest of the plane for 35 years that the
plane is an active production and
another 35 years of maintenance so
around the 70 year maintenance window
they did they deal with and the sort of
maturity that they have around
understanding software delivery as a
result of that as a result of your the
very large cost that they assume
maintenance they realize the right thing
to do was to throw out that breaks
Alfred's rewrite from scratch because
adding traceability after the fact is
you know it's very difficult so that's
exactly what they did and there's
another few month delay which I imagine
would be fairly expensive as well so
what's been happening is that we've our
tool stacks have gotten more and more
complex we've been pulling out over the
last decade that actually Steve used
used to work on unclear quest right has
been pulling out Steve's previous tools
tool chain from you know their
large-scale software delivery and adding
more modern tools whether it's the more
modern IBM tools like rational team
concert some of the you know lightweight
things subversions gone into a lot of
our organizations lot of our firewalls
gets popular now as we've been pulling
out the and changing and evolving the
tools that we use we've actually lost
some that traceability I mean the
amazing thing about clearquest and the
rational unified process was that
everything was connected everything was
linked it was not done in a way where
developers were happy good because there
were some very onerous tools a lot of
field to complete and the lightweight
stuff like the GRS bugzilla strax and
disrupted that and the lightweight SCM
tools disrupted that but in the end to
have software that's easy to maintain we
need that stuff back that stuff that
that the clearquest clearcase stack had
the stuff that the rational unified
process have but in this new modern
stack and we're going to talk today i'm
going to show you some demos of how
we've done that as you know it's one
example on the eclipse milan project
that we work on every single line of
code is linked back to a bugzilla bug
and we'll show you how we added some of
that tooling to make that possible we do
not take patches from anybody in the
ecosystem if they're not linked if they
don't have the context and that
traceable information because we know
then that we're just adding technical
debt to our software for us it's not the
seven year lifespan it's the fact that
we have a small set of committers
maintain that code base and we know we
can't assume that kind of that by losing
that traceability so one other
interesting aspect of this is that the
things have gone complex enough in the
way that we're doing software delivery
that this traceability will show you
some examples of how you can hook up
around Hudson around the Oracle
developer cloud service that you may
have seen
part of the conference on Tom's Koreans
keynote this traceability has to both
work within the projects that you're
working on with an organization but also
across it across different organizations
so the problem gets more complex and
we'll show you some of the web standards
that Steven his teams and we've been
working on to make it as possible
because that Boeing example was actually
involved multiple organizations so
Boeing was doing the requirements who
knows what SCM system in issue tracker
oh that outsourced organization was
using if parts of your software stack
are being done by other teams and
organizations possibly because let's say
you know you're depending on the open
source component that's hosted at Apache
if your life cycle is not connected to
basically what's your software supply
chain to the fact that a chunk of
yourself is being made on Apache by
commuters on Apache if that information
is not linked you don't know when
there's been four new security effects
raised and you might be exposing credit
card information so this linking as as
our stacks get more heterogeneous as and
as the software lifecycle evolve so
we're consuming you know both jars from
other organizations also web services we
actually need to keep this kind of
linking trace building mind both within
organization and across it so you know
we've got these within the company we've
got these different scenarios we've got
different roles working on different
parts of the software they're using the
key thing is that they're using
different systems those requirements are
living in a different system from the
issues that's living in a different
system from probably from different
supplier then where you got the source
code from and we've got to in the end
we've got to link these things we've got
to get to the point yep question no it's
small enough group go ahead I think
there must be another session on that I
don't know so the things that you hear
here will apply to Jenkins as well those
tools are they are very similar they've
fork they've got different sets of
plugins but yeah we're focusing on
Hudson here and we've in the demos
you'll see Hudson integrated into this
tool chain
why they can be so it's just an open
source community split you know long ago
XC Max and emacs that's what happened so
it's they're sent to be like
misalignment on community direction and
so on and that happened with Hutten and
jenkins if you google for it you can
spend the rest of the dog reading about
it so alright so we want to get to the
point where everything is connected you
know whether you especially and there's
a nice opportunity now happening with
your applications getting host it so I
mean on the past so say on the Oracle
cloud so we're just going to show you
how when everything is hosted we can
link everything up in this very
transparent way around the central build
engine and in this case that's Hudson
before we do that Steve is going to take
you through some of the issues with you
know what's happened with things not
being linked and some of the technology
foundations and the and the standards
now being worked on you make it possible
to wire up these disconnected tools then
we'll go into a demo of what that can
look like thanks Mick i might add on one
interesting story of the 787 on if
you've heard this one before so the
picture maybe I should move back to it I
think of 40 clicks and then I won't do
that so imagine there is a taking off
and there's the exit or there in order
to save money they were used to design
from a previous aircraft so they could
just plug it in but they were going to
move the ashtray from the armrest but
turns out the cost to do that I'll
forget the millions at cost because they
have to recertify that part now to fly
so now even though there's no chance you
can smoke it now has an ashtray in the
door Wow any was just showing the cost
to change anything so I'm going to talk
to you a bit about what's going on
around so I work in IBM and the rational
division and worked over the years on
not just product development but
integration so we look past and I just
picked some some dates here of the way
the history of tools have gotten you you
can look at maybe 1995 whatever the date
might be the focus was around
specialized tools for example modeling
tool
to really generate some some kickass
code from a requirements tool that can
do you know some interesting
traceability with it its own world but
they often focused within their own
world of how they operated and so the
the motivation behind tools getting
better was noticed those individual
tools meeting their needs there was
limited need to work together so fast
forward five years or so then we say boy
we really need to start sharing
information between these tools but
these tools have always been built with
the mindset of you know I I'm getting
this line item done I shipped great oh
now let's worry about integration and
when we worry about integration there
it's like Oh what what api's do have
available sometimes our public sometimes
they're not often the third party has to
come together in tees into those those
endpoints and pull the data together and
it's a bit clumsy fragile and then if
you connect to tools that way you're
often locked in too because you're these
api's are are based on often the
technology certain java api level maybe
it's a pearl base command line all these
various things but now if you want to
upgrade one of these tools you have to
almost upgrade the integration as well
and the tool on the other end and then
if you take that pattern and repeat it
over here for another set of tools Oh
sudden you you almost can't upgrade
anything without upgrading everything so
so we're looking at a better way to do
this so we've not only looked at
technology ways of do this but the
approach of how we do it you know we
could have gotten together within IBM
and our redundant tools if you will
they're not but you know we've we have a
history who big company legacy tools
next generation tools acquired tools so
we have often things that overlap a
little bit and their purpose built and
what we want these things did a great
better together even within but the
reality was well how do we get our
partners involved I would get our
customers involved and why not even get
our competitors involved in
all this process so then we we looked at
the better way and as an approach to
link these things together using the
internets style of linking so instead of
focusing on language specific api's
product specific api's will look towards
open protocols and we'll will describe
how we're going to work together how
these tools are going to work together
based on some some minimal scenarios so
we'll look at what we're trying to
achieve well won't we're not trying to
reinvent Saul the world's problem that
we're trying to make valuable steps
where we can get value from it so we
iterate over some common scenarios
provide just enough specification and
then work towards implementation to do
this so we've worked together out in
this community with a number of folks
like making task top folks from Oracle
as well and have tested and and use this
approach this approach the linking data
isn't something that is is necessarily
new or different or specific to to ALM
he could look at other domains as well
if you look at healthcare and life
sciences one of the one of the problems
you often see is around handling so you
have a couple different parties involved
so of course the patient who's taking
some type of drug whether it's part of a
some type of trial or whether it's
really far their medication they have
the problem of I now need to as a med as
my doctor and I go to report my issue
that I okay you're taking this
medication let's see what the problems
are so looking around you know common
problems I see with somebody taking this
but also they have to report some of
these issues back as part of the drug
trial to the original into the drug
manufacturer and then also regulatory
requirements to push it back to
you know FDA or whoever it might might
be and the problem we that's changed
over time a bit but the problem is often
that when you we don't say I'm a medical
unit that or doctor's office I want to
participate in a drug trial with some
patients I'm often handed a computer or
something to report that so not only do
I have a system to manage the patient I
have the system to to report information
to whatever drug manufacturer for how
many I'm involved with and then also
various regulatory agency so it's a mess
so if we could Oh gig improve improve on
that you know to find a call defying a
common way to communicate share this
information then there can be one way
that you ship this information out and
so it lowers the cost 12 to develop
these drugs and report information on it
reports the overall regulatory expenses
around having to maintain custom data
for each type of report that comes in it
also improves the overall patient care
because the patient now you know when
they would report in and want to get
some type of diagnosis and say oh you're
on this drug and the doctor physician
now can have up to the minute
information because that's being
reported through this common protocol I
through these open api's they can also
get the information quicker into their
system without having to the time loss
and and transforming the data across
different formats we see this across
many different domains but just showing
a couple examples there someone spend a
little bit more time now drilling into
some details so make showed some nice
pictures of a high level view of
integration of tools and so when we we
talk about this integration it's
actually motivated by folks don't know
Tim berners-lee who is created as given
credit for inventing the web so
essentially the ability to link between
web sites and content
and so he's a very much afford thinking
on the way the web works and he came up
with this proposal on a concept of
linked data and what we're talking about
how we're using to integrate tools so
real simple concepts so if you're going
to give something an ID there's there's
a naming convention universal resource
identification system so use a URI to
identify it and then we have one of
those provide some useful data by an
HTTP access of it and the third thing is
if you're going to provide data back and
instead of maybe just being an HTML page
which is valuable for a human reading it
but for a computer it'd be good to have
a more descriptive a format so some type
of RDF format and then when you get that
information back provide links to other
useful pieces of information so Tim
concludes by saying you know simple so
let's break it down what it really looks
like at a fine-grained view of things so
an example the way you could say the web
works today targeted towards human
consumption you can read this piece of
information saying you could say I'm a
tester I'm responsible for tracking
whatever the the test cases against this
product and I might just build an HTML
page to log the information I might have
a spreadsheet I might write it down a
piece of paper however it might track it
and then I write down this information
about it there's relationship so us as
humans we can read this we can
understand it and there's other things
say I'm a I'm a tester like a example I
was at the water cooler I ran into my
friend Joe and just happen to talk about
open source and things up cool he's a
bitter on Apache or right on a website
but these are interesting statements I
learned out there so it's typical web 10
if you will ways of learning things but
following Tim berners-lee rule number
one well to help the computer understand
that computer understand this we're
going to give a URI to each one of these
things so the test case as a URI it
might be
HTTP URI to my internal tracking system
either I am I I build it myself a buddy
of mine at where I worked i leveraged
piece of Cody had we bought a commercial
great tool whatever it might be it
stores information about the
relationship to where you know the
status of it and the fact that you know
it's it's blocked by some other issue or
thing out there and then of course with
Joe is a committer we see that they're
so then following on rule 2 and also
three so we obviously we see these are
HTTP your eyes and we can do gets on
them so let's let's look up issue 973
and see what interesting thing we find
there so we learn something I was like
well that's actually maybe it's going to
be a while before this is fixed because
it's actually dependent on a bug in
another system and these are you know
made up interaction so that so as a
tester I'm like okay this is good i now
need know that i might be some time
before this gets fixed i might have to
go chase someone down at the other other
end to go see what's going on I also see
something interesting that's like oh I
see it's owned by my friend Joe which
which was good but you know if I didn't
run into Java the watercooler I wouldn't
have known he was a patchy better
without being able to look it up and I
could even turn around look up Joe and
then learned from you know looking him
up that he's a committer on the Apache
project so a simple example on using
linked data to integrate the life cycle
of of tools you could take this a step
further and you can look at it in a in
just a simple picture what I just
described in the this the Gorp on the
previous slide as a graph of showing the
relationships and then you can also
expand onto that some of the examples
that make touch going where you see as
these things are you know blocked by
assert an issue you see a relationship
to another bug but as he tie in this
into the build system that will
we'll notify when it's ready to be
tested available raised to test then the
tester then can have access to that
information to then know they can can
they're unblocked and can continue to do
what they need to do so this is a big
picture of linked data so if you we sort
of looked at a very finite example
within ALM but if we look at what's
going on in the world if you will blink
data and there's a there's the ability
to publish data on the web like linked
open data there's this the linked open
data cloud net that takes in data from
many different sources dbpedia IMDb
whatever and catalogues it the size of
the circle means how many how much data
from that data set comes in the coloring
means from what area what sector so I
can see here like green is from the
publication field and so you know like a
really small dot of a dot is probably
the example i just showed so then that's
a view of just linked data from a point
of view of you know what Tim berners-lee
to find some wood in order to make some
of this real we need to do a couple
things to help and so at OSL see or open
services for lifecycle collaboration you
know we're we're good at coming up with
long complicated names so but you can
learn more about open data services net
so it's about linking the tools together
and it's not necessarily even about
linking the tools together it's about
linking the data together and the tools
operate on that data so in order to do
that we need to get together and agree
on what some of these things are what
resources are what properties they have
how they interact together so what we do
is get together and describe what
certain things are so so common resource
definitions around what a bug might be
our change requests the fact that it
might have a relationship to some other
type of records such as a
resources is a requirement some title
some simple information so this is a
simple example what's out there only
that then what do you need to do when
you try to embed this information into a
say a web application oftentimes you
have to build some type of presentation
around these things well you just want a
quick peek so instead of loading the
full HTML page for this resource so we
define this thing called a link preview
so giving standard HTTP content
negotiation which means the way the web
works right so a browser says I want
HTML and you get HTML this says tells
the the server that's hosting up say
this requirement data give me a preview
and it gives a snippet of HTML intended
to be included into your page so you can
think of this as your in your say
bugzilla database and you see a link
pointing out to something you could
mouse over it and see this this pop-up
hover give me some more information then
you could click into it and then get the
full user experience in the browser I
know that when we're talking about
integrating tools when the problems is
how to find things in the other
repository how to create them some tools
and confess IBM's overachieved and
making it complicated to to create
things programmatically sometimes in our
in our defect tracking tools so we
looked at it and said well we have these
dialogues that exist and all our web
applications we really would like to
place them in this other tool so we
define a model out there that says
here's how you can take this dialog for
finding things and creating things and
move it into this other application so
it's in order to integrate this way is
real simple you just basically need to
create an iframe load it and put a
listener and waiting for an event to
come back so that's my quick run-through
on linked data and OSLC I should say
that some of the things we've learned
from working on this in the open we've
gotten together at the w3c to take Tim's
for
rules and tried actually standardized it
and a working group called the link data
platform and so I starting on a workshop
last year got together with a number of
folks including representation from from
Oracle from the EMC nokia I'm going to
forget a number of people and then also
we went from there and created a member
submission to w3c work Oh submitted with
with emc Oracle task top and then now we
have an up and running working group so
we're we're currently iterating over a
draft of a specification so really
trying to find a minimal set of you
could almost call it you know to meet
the buzzword requirement in a rest way
of operating on on open data so a lot of
interesting things going on there and
evolving at w3c around standardization
at and OSLC at open data sources net
I'll turn over to Greg thank you so
we're going to get into one of our demos
which will be showing an example of
linked data in a closed system but
before we get there maybe we talk a
little bit more about Hudson so Hudson
how many folks here are using Hudson
today or Jenkins okay so pretty much
everyone so this is a lot of this will
be kind of review for you so Hudson is
open source continuous integration
server and so it basically is over the
last year and a half or so we've been
transitioning it into the Eclipse
Foundation to make it a proper Eclipse
project we're very close to being having
our first Eclipse release probably by
the end of the month or so one of the
values of Hudson is that it's very easy
to install it's just a war you run on
any application server and you basically
have your build system ready to go one
of the it has a very simple web-based
interface and I think what draws most
people to both Hudson and Jenkins is the
plugin community
so even within Hudson there's about 450
plugins available and they range from
things like a git repository plug-in
that will pull sources out of git pull
them into your build and integrate the
change list to things like you know
Chuck Norris that will go and show you
that Chuck Norris is mad that you broke
the build I mean it's it really ranges
the from the gamut for the plugins and
so Hudson see I it's it's an eye it runs
automatically you can have it can
integrate into any of your existing SCM
systems and it provides immediate
feedback you can continue configure it
via multiple channels including things
like email RSS news groups and then it
has a whole host of plugins that enable
you to do things like reporting so
examples of those would be like sonar
which is a big dashboard that integrates
into Hudson and gives you a full set of
test suite results and links through
that so to see an example of this in
action I'm going to use the Oracle
developer cloud service so developer
cloud service is a new feature that's
part of Oracle cloud and the idea behind
it is it's giving you a turnkey based
solution in order to have a dedicated
build system in the cloud so you know
typically when you're starting a new
software project you may have to work
you challenged with having to pull in
your ife IT infrastructure to do things
like at a source control system up and
running which build system are you know
which build system do you want to use
maybe I need a bug database and I have
to integrate that in some way but and
typically when you're doing this
in-house you have to have a team that's
going to work with that it's often a
heterogeneous environment it
disconnected tools that you have to try
and integrate so what we're trying to do
with the developer cloud services
provide you a standard box with core set
of features which include source control
management an issue tracking system
Hudson and wiki so let's see a quick
demonstration event
so I am in the developer cloud service
main UI so we're going to walk through
an example of a different features so
right now I've logged in as one of the
users I'm going to just maybe log in as
a different user quick if you log in as
myself and so when I log into the system
what i end up what i see is my main
project dashboard and so as i'm
configuring my team or creating my team
i can decide that the projects that are
developing can be a different scopes so
i can have private projects that only
members of the team can view or i can
create organizational projects so if my
entire organization is configured within
the cloud then it is basically an
organizational public project enabling
my entire group to participate in the
two in the project commit resources
update their tasks things like that so
this is an example of a self-contained
system that integrates Hudson and an
issue tracking system and bug source
control system and I'm going to show how
we used do linked data to connect these
different systems yeah
so I'll go into the project and it will
show me basically my project activities
so I see here where my sources are I
have a git repository that I've created
having maven repository I've created I
can see that there are some activities
going on within my within this project
and I can click to any of these
activities and then drill down into them
so this is giving me from a home page a
way to link to a specific module SCM
check in a bug that's being updated a
bill that's just completed but before we
get to some of those just we can also
view our project more in a dashboard
format which gives us basically an
overview of the health of the project
who's doing commits and in what kind of
mean what percentage you know who's
having a bigger role in this project
what's my open and closed bug right
what's my build status and then I can
also get into my check-ins so I see here
that on october third Lucas did a commit
and so I'll click to this commit and it
brings me into my source module and I
see he added a whole spring MVC example
and so I'll go go up here a little bit
and I can see the diff
see image
hold on one second was it the other
stuff
alright let's do a quick refresh what's
the browser looks a little frozen beam
Safari
alright so let's go back to this source
so I can see in my source that I have
things that have molesta commits and so
one of the commits that we added is that
the user can create a task so I'll click
this commit and then I see here that as
part of my commit message because I
followed a convention where I'm
referencing my task in my commit then
we're providing linking here so
basically the system understands that
there is a bug that this commit is
related to this bug and I can very
easily drill down into that bug and I
can see that it's linked here as well so
as I'm going and looking at the health
of my project I'm creating tasks I can
associate commits with my tasks and then
try and understand as I'm closing above
what were the what were the changes that
went into the into fixing this bug so
maybe we'll create a new task and look
at another example of linking within
within this system so maybe i'll create
one for myself that is create a new wiki
and I'll just assign it to myself here
so I've got a new task so too maybe
resolve that task i'll go and create
this wiki page so i'll go in on wiki
module create a new page
so we create the project but I haven't
made an association so I've created this
project head and go back to my task but
I don't have this traceability so maybe
I want to go and make a link between
these two so i'll go in back into my
home pit into my page and maybe add a
reference to that task and so I just
referenced the task and then we see that
we have this linking between the two so
I see that between I assigned a task to
myself i created this tat created the
wiki to it fulfill the task we have
linking between the two and then I'll go
back and fix it
so we've looked at ways what we can do
linking between source code commits
between tasks between our wiki and our
tasks but as we're doing our builds then
we also are able to use linking
capabilities inherent in Hudson plugins
to also linked to the rest of the
application that's the state of my
project so i'll go into one of my builds
and i see here that we have a successful
build go into my recent change list okay
there were no changes for this specific
one but as I'm going through my Hudson
builds I can review my commits look to
see if they are linked to a specific
task and then link and then understand
how that build relates to the different
bugs that I've closed it's really useful
if as I'm developing this project if
I've done a commitment actually broke
the bill then I can see how the change
list impact the build and how what bugs
work related to them thanks Rick so what
you're seeing here is you know what you
saw right now is that using a simple
linking format we're just able to
connect all these parts of the life
cycles so any you know any issue that's
been worked on and you requirements say
is now linked and all of that is visible
through your builds I'll show you just
another instance of that this time from
the developer's point of view inside the
IDE if we look at just close some of
this if we look at this is inside
eclipse the Eclipse Milan project relies
on exactly this simple linking format to
automatically hook up you're definitely
cycle are the facts so whether it's
connections on the task list between a
defect and something it depends on an
external system using that exact same
linking format for this and you'll see
how this actually shows up in your
Hudson builds so here I've got my
connected in this case to the Eclipse
tools so this is connecting an open
source tag we've got all of this now
that's announced this week also working
for the Oracle developer cloud service
you can connect as soon as you create
your project in the Oracle developer
cloud service you can connect your ID to
it and you'll be connected to the Hudson
instance the gate instances and getting
both your source code you build and also
your issues all of that will be
provision into your IDE once you've got
that what I'm seeing here is my Hudson
bills I see which ones are working which
ones are failing and if I open one of
these up note that all of the related
artifacts of this build our length and
navigable and here so I know I see every
single defect that was addressed and I
see under that defect so I can open up
these defects oh I'm not online but I
could open up these defects in the task
list let me see if any of these are
cached or not and I see all the changes
under those defects I can pull down the
build failures and put them for example
into my j unit view so all of this
information is linked to the Hudson
builds and what's been happening here is
that we're adding more and more of this
linking to our build plants or build
systems the Hudson server is becoming
this centralized hub for you know not
only building but linking all of the
relevant artifacts for any build for any
release for any chunk of your software
and the really neat thing is that tools
like the Oracle cloud developer service
in the browser can expose all of this
and in this case an IDE for this
particular build I know everything
that's changed in it this is actually
pretty long changeless because this was
a pretty comprehensive real it lists the
IDS use this blinking formats will no
matter what SCM system I used I actually
see the source code changes to that as
well and again although any artifacts
that were there on the console output
and the really neat thing is you know
say any failed tests so I can instant
just run the failed tests from this
build in my IDE without ever having to
make a new j unit test suite having to
do anything manually we're just using
this linking and the IDS just become
this rich client follows those links and
will download all of the J unit traces
and then instantiate the test cases
inside your IDE so all of this is now
hooked up automated this is where we are
today this is what you've got working in
the Oracle developer cloud service and I
think the big thing looking forward now
it's actually start connected to those
external tools as well because you might
have some additional gr instances you
might have you and your Quality Center
as the place where you host your defects
and the way we're going to do all of
that is with exactly this format this
linked this length data format where we
can link to things refer to them get
enough information and then decide
whether you know you just expose those
links inside the rich environment like
this
whether in the cases of some of our
commercial products liked a stop stink
we actually move some of the data
between those different destinations so
that's a summary there's some really
interesting layering that you can do on
top of this kind of linking the
contribution work for if you look for
the get Garrett Hudson talk that's
another thing that we're looking at
adding to this tool chain I was letting
a garrett automation so what you can
basically I'm gonna actually skip over
that there's things there's a good video
online of that and one thing I do want
to emphasize is how the changes in the
toolchain are enabling some of this
additional linking to basically connect
our source history to our task history
so just as an example of the way that
this works in the Oracle cloud developer
service and you know the code to cloud
tooling underneath it some the open
source components like Hudson well in
this case let's just focus actually on
building on the issue tracker in it and
on the on the version control system so
and get underneath it and it's one of
but you know why it is actually a very
important part of this tool what you've
got when you're creating your products
whether it's that brake system and
that's the product it breaks down to
these requirements if you're being more
agile its use your stories those I'll
show up in your issue tracking project
management system whatever you use for
that and at some point they break down
into work that you do when you're coding
and a key thing about these new ALM
stacks that are forming is that this
structure actually gets reflected
exactly in the version control system
this is something that was never quite
possible with the older version control
systems like like subversion that we now
have and get and that we now have in
these tools that you see today so that
commit corresponds to a task the IDE
tools do some automation for you that's
one of the things that the Milan
extensions for the Oracle developer
cloud servers do is they automatically
set task IDs that are hosted in the task
service for those commits so that
linking is automatic the whole idea is
that you never ever have to paste in
that issue ID into a commit message
because we're able to reflect that
that's been automatically because the
tool knows which task you're working on
because again it's a rich client to
everything for that we can on that the
trade topic branches that correspond to
say that user story and that
that's something that's not completed
yet it's something that we're working on
now is basically automation to make sure
that you're not deciding when to take
tree branches the tool already knows
because it knows which user story that
you're working on and then that goes
into the master branch will say for that
product so this is basically you know
the way that we see the modern alm
stacks evolving to make sure that you
know when you're building your systems
the same way that we expect developers
or contributors to our projects or open
source project on Eclipse to do this
this is getting done for you
automatically inside the development
tools and you're getting the benefit of
this fully connected and this full
traceability across what you're using
and again Hudson as the centralized
engine we can get everything from that's
why tools like sonar are so important
because they can stick and see your
entire source base from Hudson that's
why these open formats like OSLC are
important because they're too like sonar
in addition or extensions of sonar can
look at both the requirements and that
can actually can report on the
requirements and sees let's say which
lines of code were not linked to any
requirement as an example so with that I
think we can wrap up arm and take some
questions thank you thanks to you thanks
rig yep
that's why I showed
I that's the most straightforward way
that all of us look privately is if if
but with the Oracles made some mentions
of a private cloud offering ray maybe
you want to speak to that yeah so that's
something that's on the the cloud
roadmap is a it's basically a private
past solution so you basically the
technology that goes into Oracle cloud
you could install it in your IT
infrastructure you can mmm for revenue
recognition reasons I can only say
within the next year you can tell the
lawyers to beat that one into me right
yeah next person here what you saw
working today was so there's all the
automation that mean that makes a
turnkey that's the Oracle developer
cloud service that's the whole packaging
it uses multiple open source components
so users you saw get you saw a bunch of
Hudson you saw the mild extensions you
so you'd met code to maven maven code
out loud yeah and then in the IDE you're
just seeing this is actually just
vanilla Milan in the IDE which can
connect it has extensions specific so
it's mylan with connectors for the
Oracle developer cloud service any other
questions yep
yep with relation to linking yeah yeah
so Hudson is are very rich set up plug
in our Couture plugging communities so
examples of plugins that will give you
like data linking every SCM plugin so
get subversion CVS all of them have
their own standard of how they will link
the build to change lists almost every
bug tracking system has a plug-in like
JIRA like bugzilla that are also allowed
linking to the build and a specific bug
what we do in the developer cloud
services then we make that extra hop
right we go from the check in to the
from the bill to the check in to the to
the bug and all those plugins and is and
tools actually use different formats
we're linking and different syntaxes and
someone looks like think why some of
what Steve is saying is so key that we
end up with standards so we're not you
know creating any time that you want to
create a Hudson reporting tool you not
have to write to those custom formats
that those still has been using and some
of them you know will evolve over time
as well so having a common format for
this will enable us to do a lot more in
the CI server in terms of reasoning
about their code bases and our and our
issue trackers and requirements and
agile plans on the rest any other
questions ok one more last one
so Hudson 227 I think is the most recent
release there's you have just as many of
the 450 plugins available but we are in
the process of finalizing 30 one of the
differences you'll see between to 27 and
30 is that we've gone through and taken
the top 50 plugins based on usage
tracking that we have within pluck
within Hudson and done a quite a bit of
QA and analysis on them to make sure
that they work perfectly so so 30 will
be a little bit more stable when it's
final thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
