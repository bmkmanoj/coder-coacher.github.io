Manager cloud control 12c demonstration
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum in
this demo I'll show you three very basic
tasks first how to configure basic
recovery settings which include the
archive load setting a fraud ISM
described as a backup destination and
enlarging the size of that destination
then we will restart database view the
modified initialization parameters and
configure sample backup policies here we
are on the Enterprise Manager homepage
which is our starting page for the
navigation in this demo and we select
availability backup and recovery
recovery settings on the recovery
settings page we select archive log mode
so that we can take backups from an open
database then we scroll down to view the
fast recovery area and here we want to
change the parameter for the fast
recovery area to + FRA which is an ism
disk group and we want to change the
size of this fast recovery area to 10
gigabytes if you are interested in the
sequel plus of this operation at the
bottom of the screen click show sequel
and you see the two commands that alter
the system you do not see the archive
log mode because that is a command that
is executed as part of the database
restart when the database is in no mount
we click apply and you get the
information that the changes have been
applied and that we have to restart the
database
for the archive log mode choose yes to
do it now we have our predefined mem
potentials Oracle for the Oracle uses
host credential and we also have in CSS
TB monster this is user I click OK and
once again you have the opportunity to
look at the sequel so here you see that
after the startup amount the database is
being put into archive log mode and then
opened so now we click return and
execute the commands when the restart is
complete you will receive a success
message and you can look at details a
log file of the restart of the database
if you wish to view your modified
initialization parameters you can
navigate to administration
initialization parameters and instead of
viewing all of them choose the category
backup and recovery click go and here
you see the modified parameters next I'd
like to show you where you can configure
backup policy settings so availability
backup and recovery and then choose
backup settings click the policy tab
page and it is highly recommended to
always automatically backup the control
file and ESP file so that you always
haven't a correct one for any recovery
that you might need here are possible
optimization parameters we scroll down
and confirm that the retention policy is
set to retain one backup I'd like to
change the archived redo lock deletion
policy and delete the redo log files
after they have been backed up one time
I also specify named credentials but if
you want to test a username password you
can do so by
taking the test icon and you see that
the test was successful so now we click
OK to save the settings we've come to
the end of this demonstration where you
saw some very basic backup and recovery
settings thanks for watching this
