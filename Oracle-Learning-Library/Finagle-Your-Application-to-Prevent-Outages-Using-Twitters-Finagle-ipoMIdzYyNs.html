probably ready deed dinner or even
episodes eight o'clock and got a party
at six-thirty so we'll try to move this
on and not waste too much time does
anybody here use finagle already know
okay well finagle is a fault-tolerant
RPC server and shoes by twitter right
now and basically it's protocol gnostic
so you can talk to various services it
can be different protocols what will go
through that in a minute and the reason
we decided to look into finagle we work
for behr paint company i don't know if
you've ever been to a home depot they
sell paint at home depot we also sell
other brands of paint kills casual
colors kills primers him or a res cap
different brands in the US Canada China
Mexico Chile I think we're moving into
Brazil pretty soon and I basically we
work on the websites the marketing
websites beer calm master Cameron kels
calm and the international sites and on
the there's a bear a professional site
right now we also have kiosk at the home
depot for matching paint colors and wood
wood stains and also a lot of iphone
apps and android apps where you can
download them from the iphone store for
free and you can scan your wall and
match your paint colors from home and
order paint samples do things like that
all of these various devices whether it
be the kiosk the phone apps the web
servers they all talk to various
back-end services and this is really
getting more complicated these days
because nowadays whenever somebody
submits a request they want to generate
a rich email i'll show you an example of
that they want to update salesforce they
want to possibly op the user into our
email list they want to either submit
the order to our ERP system or save a
project on our very own website you know
there's lots of things going on and we
don't want the user to have to wait for
all these events to happen
and if an event fails we don't want that
you know that's not the users problem
what's he going to do about it anyway
right he just wants to know that you
know his orders been placed or his
projects been saved or whatever as
mentioned the emails here's an example
right here of a an email we sent from
the kiosk and are marking doesn't want
basic emails we use a job advanced
imaging to paint this image here with
the colors that the user selected at the
at the store and that you know that
takes time if you go down here we have
to get the store information here we
have to call the color service to render
this this has one color but they can
have multiple colors painted on this
image we have to go get the current
promotion there's advertisements and
stuff and this email we have to get all
this information just to send the email
out also they can request off the person
into the email list we have to save the
data to the database and you know that
can take some time and they want any
kind of instant response they don't want
to sit there and wait for this to happen
the same way when people go into the
e-commerce sites and place orders we we
have to update Salesforce and the order
and have SI PE RP systems and you know
update our databases update various
systems so we decided to look at
Twitter's finagle maybe to handle these
events asynchronously handle fail overs
and load balancing and things like that
for us
so we're going to do a brief overview
and then we'll go through an example of
some real code it doesn't do much but it
generates all the principles of finagle
as I said we were for bear pain i'm mike
palace and this is brain coal I'm talked
a little bit about bear pain ok there's
a bit of history going back to about the
90s I guess when people start doing
websites and first they tried korba to
talk to various remote distributed
servers an ejb was really popular I know
early ejb was kind of slow but there's a
lighter versions of that around now then
people started using various web
services for example soap and then
people use like JMS messaging to talk to
you know just straight JMS java or mq
series or mq whatever eventually they
develop breast services that are
basically easier to setup people used
enterprise service buses now there's a
lot of RPC servers there's probably
about a dozen out there I don't know if
anybody uses akka or any of the other
servers out there now finagle is written
in scale abut you can talk to it with
any language that you can use on the JVM
you can you can code in Java you can
code in scale JRuby grube any of those
kind of languages the other ones like a
kiss of them are written in Java
basically fagel finagle provides service
instances via clients will show you how
to create a client they expose the
service instance via servers it adds
behavior so you can add behavior at when
you you know compiled a code you can
configure it that way or you can
programmatically runtime add behavior to
that we'll talk about it some of the
right of the way you do it in the code
it'll you know have retrain connection
pooling load balancing rate limiting so
you can specify how many times you want
to retry this particular server and
maybe give it a time limit before you
mount a marked edge server to being dead
and stop using that server that is
completely configurable the connection
pooling is configurable to like I said
load balancing they try to divide the
request up so the server that's got the
least number of actively quests that
haven't returned a response that would
be the server that finagle would use for
the next request that it's called a
future
it provides monitoring and stats so
basically if you've got distributed
systems running on like eight different
servers you can collect all the stats
and logging and monitoring all in one
place so if you want to go generate some
nice reports to see the various usages
of the various servers you can generate
nice reports in one place you can log
all the servers and clients all into one
place to keep the statistics so you
don't have to go when you're trying to
trace a problem you don't have to go log
on to five different servers to figure
out where the issue is finagle provides
a number of codices to implement a wire
protocols they provide a number of them
we'll talk about some of those and you
can actually you know create some of
your own if you want to we'll go to an
example of that it also manages
resources for you okay most of finagle
is protocol agnostic okay so you can use
codecs for thrift which is an Apache
project that basically it's an RPC
project they can basically talk to any
kind of program whether it be C or Java
or.net or you know whatever kind of a
program it is it basically uses a simple
interface to talk to another server will
show some examples of thrift can you
just regular HTTP now both thrift and
HTTP or basically you know single or PC
you get one request generation one
response okay it's a one to one thing
and also supports kestrel reduce and
streaming HTTP and generic multiplexing
so you can have requests that one HTTP
call would generate multiple responses
and it'll you can set that up we'll talk
about that a little bit later so
basically the Styles you got request
response streaming or multiplexing
writing a new codec is easy you can
write your own if you don't like what
they provide it's built on top of Nettie
for the event loop I'm Nettie is
basically handling connections that's
built on top of niño job nao provides
scale in Java parodies
as I mentioned you can write in Java you
can write in scaling right in JRuby
grube whatever it skillet is a little
bit better because there's less lines of
code and you have basically lightweight
closures you can use but Java works fine
a lot of people even a Twitter they code
in Java too it provides a robust
implementation of connection pools with
throttling to avoid TCP connection turn
it's got failure detectors to divide
slower crashed host so there's a sailor
strategy so if a host isn't responding
it'll kind of ignore that host and send
the traffic to the healthy host because
as I mentioned there's load balancing so
the server that has the least requested
it hasn't responded to that's going to
be the next one is going to hit its back
pressure techniques so you got a denial
of service attack or someone's trying to
bring down your server it'll it can to
kind of detect that and defend the
servers and it makes it easy to deploy
services where you said published
standard statistics logs and exception
reports so you can generate all that in
one place you can have nice reports
there's a really nice reporting tool
built into it you can do distributed
tracing using dapper across the
different different protocols so you can
trace you know all the different calls
across the different servers if you want
to use zookeeper for cluster management
you can configure your all your servers
and all your services in zookeeper so
you can all be done you know dynamically
using a console and it supports coming
charting strategies so if you have a lot
of distributed databases things like
that you can you can set that up as I
said it's protocol agnostic the main
protocols it supports out of the box or
HTTP streaming HTTP using comet where
you have a long live connection where
you're waiting for multiple responses
thrift patchy threat will show examples
of that memcache kestrel that kestrel is
something that Twitter developed on
their own mysql of course and then
there's many more to come they probably
already provided some already been
he use it provides builders so you have
a client builder that builds a service
implementation of a client so you can
see in this example no this is scalar
but we'll go through some job examples
if you don't know scalar basically this
one returns a client they're basically
giving it a name of you know HTTP load
says giving it the Kodak you can specify
the host this is just using a string but
in reality you'd probably go out and try
to locate the host yourself because
you're you know running and we got prod
servers and Dev servers and QA servers
and then you probably heard code it and
then you just basically builds it
returns the client to you the service
builder to build the service is just
just as easy it basically pass all the
same information but in this case you
have a socket address that what it's
going to send like this in this case it
in Scylla 8080 is going to default to
the localhost and it basically is you
know using HTTP and building it at the
end of course you want to close your
server when you're done with it okay
here's an example of a simple HTTP
server the first example is in scale and
you can see the codes not that different
in Chavez so basically you create a
server you created a socket address or
whatever kind of address you want to
create and then basically you assign
that service and that address to the
server you know give it a name do it
build on it to Chavez very similar
basically it's using a local host about
10,000 an example the client comes
pretty easy also you just basically
create the client you create the you
know HTTP requests in this case it's
just doing an HTTP GET and then it
generates a future response now a future
is one of the basic building blocks of
Twitter and this is a Twitter future not
a Java future and basically a twitter is
a promise to return a response in the
future but it may or may not happen so
you're asking for some kind of a
response
now you know it could time out it could
fail but it's it's it's kind of like a
list where you're asking for things you
can have a single response or you can
add a sequence of responses and we'll go
into those various combinations later on
there's the Java implementation of the
same thing you can set a connection
limit on the client so basically this in
this case would be 5 connections
concurrently as I mentioned it extends
Nettie model so basically that's an
asynchronous RPC server and then it uses
niño but this provides a lot of
services that you wouldn't get at it you
know just had an Eddie itself there's a
lot of handling of events for you
basically these finagle objects or the
building blocks you use for finagle
these are the most common you're going
to see I said everything is basically a
future a future object is a promise of a
future event it's an asynchronous
operation unless you put it in a
sequential Combinator we'll talk about
those the service object performance of
work so that's basically the call that
what do you want to do what kind of a
call do you want to do the filter object
that's where you spend most of your time
in finagle it basically lets you
transform the response or the request
and also it can provide handlers for
different exceptions or events within
the call the filter can be added on the
client or on the server you can edit any
place you want to add it will have some
examples of how to create those and of
course the code act as i mentioned
that's the protocol they provide a
number of them but you can create your
own in this basically it's encoding the
way the message is handling handled by
this server ok as I mentioned future
objects or there is basically an
asynchronous computation that is you set
it up and basically the two basic kinds
you have a blocking wait a block and
weight is let's say you're reading from
the disk or you're doing a long
computation or your maybe reading a
remote system that might be takes a
while to be
bond so you you know that this thing
isn't going to be every turn right away
so you want to give it some time and let
other processes and run mall this thing
is running the other way is just to
register the call backward whenever it
succeeds or fail it returns the result
to the client rather than passing the
call back to a dispatch routine the
dispatch routine returns a future which
is a promise so basically you add the
call back into the future before you
pass it to the server it's that it's the
kind of backwards from the way you
traditionally do things so here's an
example of some simple futures I know
this code isn't scalable web Java
examples to the first one just creates a
simple future it takes a string the
second one you can do it yet but in this
example you'll probably never do this
because it's going to wait indefinitely
the third example is basically you're
going to wait one second it's going to
return now you don't know after one
second you don't know if the thing is
actually timed out if it's got a error
or what's going on it's just going to
return whatever happened after one
second so you actually need some more
code to make this really functional and
that next week quest we basically create
a block so that's a blocked event like
we said you do a HTTP GET request and
then basically do the requests on the
client and basically that I don't block
until the result is returned I guess
again there's no error handling in this
example the next one basically is what
you scheduled a job and in this case you
what the future is not available until
the scheduled job completes okay so it
it's another way to do it there is
something called a promise a promise is
basically it extends the future but a
promise actually lets you write and not
just not just read so regular future you
can just just read a promise you can
read and write in general you you create
a promise you cast it to a future and
then then you send it to the consumer of
that
event so basically you basically the
server doesn't really see that the
problem is he just sees that he's got a
future an axon and then when it comes
back the client if he has to write
something to it or change it he can
change it you can do futures with
timeouts so basically here I'm creating
an HTTP request and then telling the
client to go ahead and get the request
and then I'm saying okay in one second
whatever happened I want to get that
back so it's going to print out the
result in one second now it may have
finished it may still be waiting and you
know timed out or it may have failed
okay your question this is Twitter
finagle yeah promises extends the actual
future a future every request is a
future but a promise is a special type
of future but it's it's not a Java
future it's a twitter twitter okay it's
it's different yes a promise is just
like a future the server featured the
same hey this is going to return an
event so if you if you fire off a
thousand promises and don't don't put
them in a Combinator they would just
maybe asynchronous each one would
execute and then whenever they're done
or fail or whatever you get to
reasonable okay we'll go through some
combinations of how you can combine
these it to make it really powerful
here's an example of a timeout filter as
I mentioned it at a filter can transform
the request or the response but it can
also handle events in this case they
have something called a timeout filter I
can it you notice there's no protocol in
there so I can add this filter to any I
can edit you know to any future request
i can add this time out so basically i
set the time limit and then basically
you know pass it the future and the time
limit whatever and I I can reuse this
right so because it doesn't matter what
protocol I can use this for you know all
different types of you know futures I
can give it different timeout limits
whatever so it's pretty pretty nice
thing to use it because the filter can
be put on the client or on the server so
whichever
one decides that you know he needs to
have a timeout because it you know
servers can have different time out time
some of them you expect a response in a
second or two some two minutes is you
know not bad so so
can you do what
legacy x 3 and
well it well wishers show that you'd
probably want to look at just some
examples but you probably want to do
like on success or unfailing or wait for
those events to happen before you start
accessing it I'm you can try to read it
but you won't know if you just read it
without checking to see if it's done yet
you know I mean but yeah you can't
access at once you get it back see but
you probably want to put some more code
than that just try to you know you will
go through some examples yeah I'm saying
you probably want to add some more code
because if you if you see just create
the future and then you know pass it to
the service and then just try to read it
it might not be done yet okay but anyway
so there's an example of using error
handling so in this case I create a
promise and then I I call what and I you
know I trapped the error I travel if it
was canceled and then execute the
promise so you can you can throw
exceptions the same way you would do on
any kind of a call and then the
exception can be handled in you know the
proper place on the proper server as I
mentioned a codec encodes and decodes
wire protocol such as HTTP basically
these are the ones they provide thrift
HTTP men calf Kestrel hdb chunk
streaming using Twitter whatever but you
can write your own there's an example of
creating your own codex so here's
creating a codec called string codec
basically it handles like end of lines
and stuff like that it was the rest of
it basically you create that and once
you create that codec you can you can
create a client using that codec and you
create a server using that codec and
then they can talk to each other okay it
is we were talking before it is you ask
you a question is here's some example of
some simple callbacks so I create this
future and I say well on success i want
i want that condition trapped and i'm
going to return it on success or me too
if it's on a failure whether it's based
on a timeout or there's based on an
exception i can print the stack trace or
see what went on basically you want to
try to handle it using callbacks the
callback is passed in with the future
so that okay there's as I mentioned
there's filter objects we went to an
example of a timeout filter but
basically you can use these to handle
exceptions as we show with the time out
of authorization problems you can
transform either the requester the
response to something different it
basically wraps the service and converts
the input and output types or does error
handling or whatever you wanted to do
and that's what's most of your codes
going to be is writing these filters
there's a simple example of creating a
filter so this is an authorization
filter so when the person tries to
authorize their account they enter the
secret question if they get the answer
right it fine but if they don't get if
they don't get the answer right throws
an exception there's an example of using
the filter to transform the requests and
responses so this is basically as
returning results if the if is correct
it returns in okay otherwise if he turns
errors if the identification fails you
can see that basically it tries to look
at the session and the authorization
basically a single sign-on type thing
okay now they said you can just fire off
a bunch of futures and they'll all
execute asynchronously but if you want
to make this really powerful there's
different Combinator's and you can do a
sequential composition or you can do
asynchronous compensation so for
sequential composition the most
important common here is a flat map and
when you have a flat map that means
you're going to execute futures one at a
time and it'll wait till it gets the
result you know the response from one
request before it executes the next
request and so on so for example if you
go to Twitter and you try to log in
it'll try to authorize your account if
that fails it doesn't go and try to get
the user and try to get all your tweets
right but if that succeeds
in execute some that it goes and gets a
user and then it it uses another kind of
common a today to go get all your tweets
from all the different servers and then
combine them into one future and then we
turn all those tweets but so now the
flat map if one if one event fails like
I said the one future fails they all
fail so you don't have to worry about
where to handle that the the it's either
All or Nothing there are some sequential
ones that Twitter provides that will
handle failures and maybe do something
different on a failure but that's we're
not going to show that today okay but
there's also concurrent composition so
basically the three most common ones are
collect join and select and this is
basically where you want to execute a
group of futures all at the same time so
let's say you're doing a search you want
to search like different servers
different databases whatever and combine
all the results together when you get
done so you can take all of these
futures combine them into one of these
these Combinator's and then it'll go
ahead and return the results it kind of
turns a sequence of future into what
they call a future of sequences so you
think of a future as a list okay it can
be one thing or can be a list of things
right so here's it okay so a collect is
the most straightforward one okay and it
collect basically if you have futures
are all the same type okay you can
basically assign these things to a
collect execute them and then when
they've all completed or when one of
them is failed whatever it'll go ahead
and collect them all in one future and
return that future which is basically a
future of sequences it has all of them
so
unless unless you handle it is going to
stop when the first one failed but you
can handle certain events if you want to
handle it okay all them are completed or
you have a failure either one like I
said you can if you want to handle a
failure and you know do something with
it you can handle it so okay joint is
basically the same thing but when you're
doing to join they can be mixed types
they don't have to be the same type of
future you can have futures that are you
know different signatures different
return types whatever so you know if
it's basically the same thing and then a
select a select returns of future when
the first of the given futures completes
okay together with the remaining
uncompleted futures so basically this is
like when the first one completes like I
want to try five different things and
whatever the first one's done that
that's what I'm going to return to the
user so I'm you know maybe you can try
different methods you don't know you
know what kind of user this is or
whatever you can try different databases
whatever until you find the person and
then return that but what really makes
is powerful is you can combine these
things so you can take a flat map and
you can execute say your authorization
and that's what they do in Twitter and
then you can go ahead and get the user
and then you can do a one of the
concurrent events to go out and get all
the tweets from different servers
different MySQL servers whatever you can
combine those also that would be like
the third step but the authorization
failed you never get to that so you
combine these various concurrent
Combinator's into a flat map and then
like I said you can stop at wherever
wherever you want to but it basically
it's very powerful date there's an
example on the web provide the address
later but it's called search bird where
they created a search engine with 200
lines of code and I know you would want
more code in a real server but basically
uses fan-out indexes where they go ahead
and create all these indexes and phantom
out do all these surgeries and then
combine the results and phantom back in
again
and this basically has all of the
different you know structures you would
use in a real search engine to really
you know go and combine all those
results and there's as I mentioned
there's failover detection and clusters
so there's an abstraction called
clusters where you can register the
clients and servers so you probably want
to you know maybe dynamically unless
you're using a zookeeper something to
configure this you probably want to
dynamically have your servers register
themselves or register various services
and then because the failure detection
will mark the host is dead so if you can
set the time limit if you want and the
number of retries you want to try on
that server so you can say if this thing
doesn't respond in two minutes more than
three times or something like that you
can say I want to go ahead and just mark
that as dead and there's also a
directory where you can take dynamic
registration on the server site and
dynamic discovery and the clients say so
that's why I'm saying you're registering
these various servers and services so
you don't have to hard coded which you
probably don't want to do and then
basically you can you can call this an
age Act basically this is like a jQuery
example you need more basically you get
a web page maybe you're going to go out
there and look for some user information
if it didn't return you know you don't
really care but basically you're going
to call a Twitter hey here's some URLs
basically you can download all this code
from github or you know basically
there's you can download the project
their sample projects you can download
light all the scale of docs there's a
funicular group and on google groups as
i mentioned this search bird here you
can just do a search for search bird
finagle and get that it's basically a
search engine with 200 lines of code you
wouldn't really run this but i guess
that it provides all of the different
you know fan-out indexes and the various
indexes you would use to basically you
know execute a thousand requests at once
for every search word and then combine
all the results together when you get
done
I'm going to show up here we sent them
an example here they sent an example in
netbeans have just some basic simple
code here now this doesn't use any of
the Combinator's we've talked about but
it's just firing these things off
asynchronously okay so right here first
thing I do is I basically create the
client using the client builder so this
is setting a socket address of a DAT
this is using the thrift client we
talked about the Apache thrift which
basically is a language-independent or
PC server and basically it sets a
connection limit of 80 so there can be
any connections open at once and then
assigns that Club client to a service
interface that's a the service interface
for the thrift okay so I have a method
here called hi and this method will be
called once and basically it just
returns the name or throws a failure
back so if it's on unfair of course it
loves the cause if it's successful it
logs to the value returned the next
example I'm just adding two numbers
together so these first two examples
their non blocking calls are just you
know fast calls they go and you know get
it get the guy's name or add two numbers
together and they come back so this one
either returns to be sold at the
calculation where every turns ear okay
this next example is going to execute a
thousand calls but basically it's going
to call this thing a thousand times to
do the addition of these random numbers
so this is a blocking call since this is
on the same machine it would really
execute quickly but we put a delayed
loop in here to kind of slow it down to
make it seem like it and the delay is
random so it can be anywhere from one to
10 second delay so as we fire these
things off they're going to come back in
different orders depending on the delay
okay so it's just basically simulating
something you might do in
real life where you got a slow response
from your server you're doing a read of
the disc or a complicated calculation or
something like that or database query
that takes a while and then it basically
it calls them a thousand times and then
it goes through in checks to see if if
they're all done right here in the loop
so right here it calls the thing in
checks to see if they're all done if
that if the count is equal if that if
they're not done it just goes to sleep
for a second and goes out and looks
again see if they're done then releases
the client obviously and then it logs
you know the results so so here's just a
simple server example the server example
basically you know you create a new
server you have you know you build the
server you know set the socket address
this is a thrift again give it the name
of the server and then this is the
service interface it creates the pool
service pool it's got a random routine
here you see show where that's used and
then basically the first method as I
said it's just a simple method it's not
block it just adds to your numbers
together and then the second method down
here this is the actual blocking home
method so basically it calculates the
random delay so basically you know the
first one might be delayed for three
seconds my next one might be 10 that's
one would be five so they're all going
to finish at different times and then
it's at similes to delay this is the one
Marcus said there's a local timing Luke
just to burn some cpu then it implies
that the blocking and then this last
method that's the high method we're just
returns the name okay so
if we
okay Sophie renders and the client
okay you see they're all failing now
because I didn't start the server right
so just to show you it will handle the
failure is fine so so I need to seem to
stop them
I'll stop that start it up the right way
now
okay this time I'm just I'm going to
start the server okay the server's
started thrift server start the client
ok now this console it's you got one
console for the client and one for the
server so it's kind of hard to see how
the results are going in i'll show you
how they're all logged together though
so
okay so here's the results okay so
basically the fifth server is running
basically it now as we see me in
requests the first request was the high
secondly quest was the ad and you only
see one response for the high-end one
for the ad now for these other requests
basically it's it's adding the numbers
and you can see the first one blocks 49
seconds and some of them block for one
second or two seconds or whatever so
they're coming back on all different
orders and if you go all the way down
it'll it's going to call this thing of a
thousand times and then eventually when
the counts a thousand it's going to stop
that's really really pretty quick and it
does a lot for you so
make any questions your pardon
hopefully
what
confront this
play play
web pages driving to finance my answer
actually they finagle could be on any
server but every I don't think they're
basically on the same box you know but
they're voting across
in
you can take a hard color to use
discovery but if you use discovery you
can register those you can either use
zookeeper oh I'm sorry you can either
use zookeeper or you can dynamically
each of the servers can register the
services that you know when they boot up
or whatever they can register the
service and their what server they are
and then it can go out and find which
servers will you know handle this type
of service request right because like it
said in production and have you know
you'd have different names of the
servers and all that so you're probably
I kinda want a hard coat like in the
examples but you can use I guess I'd
either zookeeper to configure them or
you can dynamically register the servers
in the directory and then the services
in the directory so because you could
have multiple finagle servers going on
for different things so
oh yeah I can just talk to an HTTP
server right https uh yeah your sling
yep i'll be through finagle we really
just you know didn't really use anything
you know i mean it you just call
different services and wait you know
what i mean and you'd have things that
slower and slower you know yeah so now
we didn't use anything else before that
nothing like this we you know use some
so close and we use some rest calls and
we use some you know whatever I mean
near questions
awesome
they just keep adding more requirements
every time they make a call either for
e-commerce or to save projects and stuff
there's just more and more stuff they
want us to do every time you know they
it's like oh well we want to have you
know send emails this guy oh we went
this guy in our you know Salesforce we
want this guy in erp way you know they
want to constantly get list of customers
and be able to contact the customers and
do their you know really into the
marketing you know end of it and so as a
lot of updates going on but we didn't
want the people on the website to have
to wait for all these events to happen I
mean it's really ok what if you're
waiting for a call or what if it fails
what you know what's the user going to
do about you know I mean that she kind
of hate to go to a website and have to
wait for two minutes or have it throw an
error at you that really nothing you can
do about right some know the kind of
blood back to see the question so so you
buy me a beer so Craig's find everybody
be raised in the back row so there's a
what's that if you go online and print
this out there but introduces JCB party
in about 10 minutes it's over ellis
street yeah so this is please JCB
community party pretty good again prices
out too
thank you bring
so begins had bigger than that position
when you're telling different kind of
weight bench right have you had it
planned
we want to do this we want to do that
regularly every call they want more and
more and more heading whatever you may
say to your ERP add some way to talk to
them and good luck yeah I mean when you
realize like you say I've had the kiosk
and I just want to send an email on a
guy I don't want to wait for all this
stuff to happen i just want okay find
your email sent and then the stuff here
is that it's nothing away it said his
yeah this is what he's won more and more
stuff when you know when this my logs on
you want to wait like for two minutes to
log on just because it's going out there
and updating all these tables and doing
all this stuff and getting all your
project information and all that you
know they'd be so now we just found us
on the web you know so tried it out
that's yeah but you know marketing keeps
adding more and more stuff and they're
always they said they want to use all
these remote software service things
like Salesforce and see CRM customer
relationship management systems and Sapa
have two or three and one at one time
you don't i meet all these services they
want update to keep all this customer
information there's a lot of them at you
know if you want to check out there's a
lot of AKA is pretty similar there's a
lot of other ones there's about 10 of
nothing yeah i think you can find all
this on the web yeah there's a lot of
them out there they're getting more
popular well I mean look I mean look at
twitter is a pretty high volume website
i mean you know if they're using those
got it you know they do a lot more
volume than we do i can tell you that
you don't I mean but there's other ones
out there you might try a kk which is
more of a Java you know so logically
house watching
it just it just provides like I said a
lot more you know event handling and I
haven't used that you know I'm just
regular JMS it's just like a single
request right i mean participants in
different ways or do error handling or
do you know like statistics and stuff
either do a lot more that kind of stuff
with other entities that to JMS and
basically you need some kind of
enterprises for sentencing yeah yeah
this has a lot of that load balancing
all that kind of stuff for you you know
i mean there's a lot of styles one in
larger well yeah it's just if you're
just doing single calls they're not
doing a lot of different type of calls
you know like mixed calls that would
probably be fine then i thought it thank
you it was in the think they were ready
yeah
so
a service similar for a sequence right
it just takes incandescent Vance fires
them all at the same time you said that
client like I said maybe they don't ever
finish I mean whatever but the claim
doesn't care if you want to you know
fire off so what
well this way you can group them in
different ways you can do reporting like
you can do reporting you can nominate
you can do load balancing it just
provides a lot of stuff on top of that I
know what you're saying but yeah it
provides a lot of different services you
can negotiate do reporting you can log
all into one place from all these
different services you can know it's
just kind of a framework that gives you
a lot of services you wouldn't have
otherwise and no different kinds i hated
those things on top of genius but this
is yeah sure you could have that you
know somebody to provide different
protocols to we're JMS you get us your
GMS you know you okay one box might get
one you might be running mq on this box
and in few series on innocence i mean
use different implementations or dms for
that matter right now I'm saying what if
you're just doing like HTTP calls or
triples or whatever you don't have to
have all that set up on every machine
you know me thank you but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
