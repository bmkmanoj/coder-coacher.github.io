library overview in this session we will
review the components of the retail
reference library and a sample business
case on how it can be used in an
implementation environment the Oracle
retail reference library or RRL is a
collection of detailed implementation
information for our partners and
customers it is available via my Oracle
support and includes business process
models architectural diagrams and a
retail glossary the Oracle retail
reference library contains deep retail
intellectual property that we are
sharing in order to help our customers
accelerate their implementations and
derive maximum value from our software
and it is free to licensed customers and
partners let's take a deeper look at the
three components that make up the retail
reference library the Oracle retail
reference model is a comprehensive
collection of established
industry-leading business processes
which guide retailers and implementers
on the use of Oracle retail applications
the Oracle retail reference model is
based on the input and experience that
Oracle retail and their partners have
gained in working with a broad range of
retail customers the processes aligned
with Oracle Applications leverage
industry standards and help business
units communicate with IT process flows
are now created in Visio to allow for
customer specific business processes to
be managed and maintained the Oracle
retail reference architecture describes
different views of Oracle Retail
Solutions offerings including contextual
models integration models and deployment
models those implementing Oracle retails
products will find the Oracle retail
reference architecture a useful
blueprint in understanding how
enterprise systems fit together it is
meant to convey information to a broad
audience from IT executives to
development staff the ability to have
context around a particular component in
a system and where the system plays a
part are essential in understanding the
impacts a customization may make and
what is required for successful
deployment the Oracle retail semantics
glossary is a searchable collection of
definitions and calculations for retail
terminology and
key performance indicators or KPIs with
the goal of aligning terminology and
KPIs across solution areas for a better
overall user experience each component
of the retail reference library can be
installed as part of the comprehensive
library or can be installed
independently again it is free to
licensed customers and partners not only
do our customers get software from us
but also a wealth of information to help
with software implementations enterprise
level context models and end to end
business processes answer the
big-picture questions of how systems and
businesses fit together to provide
business solutions for various levels of
an organization meet brian brian is a
business analyst and has been assigned
the task of designing the requirements
for an empowered commerce journey
process in which an order is placed
online the product is sourced from the
supplier and picked up in the store in
preparation for a requirements meeting
with the business the technical
architect and a key supplier he needs to
understand both the business process and
the technical and integration
requirements for the supplier brian
begins with the retail reference model
brian reviews the list of conceptual
flows for the direct-to-consumer
business process flows and finds the
process in which the order is sourced
from the supplier inventory all process
flows have a unique naming convention
such as zero one zero two zero six zero
three execute example process the first
two numbers in the sequence indicate the
domain group the second set of numbers
indicate the level of model
differentiating between the level ones
and level two is within the conceptual
navigation folder the third set of
numbers is the unique folder number
within the conceptual or activity
navigation folder which makes the
complete model number unique within the
collection the last two sets of numbers
indicates the order of the model within
the topic group
tidal numbering for the process Maps is
for categorizing and sorting purposes
only and is not to be interpreted as a
sequential order of implementation Brian
selects process flow 14.0 2.0 0.1 to
fulfill sorts order from supplier
inventory he can view the process flow
in an HTML version or with the use of
Microsoft Visio
he can view and/or edit the process flow
if necessary after reviewing the level
two and gaining a high-level
understanding of the process and the
affected groups Brian drills into the
more detailed level three process flow
called fulfill source order from
supplier inventory here at the level
three
Brian reviews the business process and
the interaction with the supplier and
notices that there are defined
integrations he drills into the
integration that details the interface
with the supplier to review the
integration specification and
architecture brian begins to navigate
into the reference architecture he
reviews the functional interface
specification and drills into the
integration context model in reviewing
the integration context model brian
notices the ASN message between the
supplier and the merchandising system
and drills into the interface brian ends
up at the interface specification which
provides details on the nature of the
ASN interface if desired he can drove
further into either the fulfill its
store or fulfill at warehouse for
additional integration information
during the requirements meeting business
case number one a separate discussion
arose regarding the difference between
base cost and unit cost which are both
fields in the ASN message Brian
accesses the retail semantics glossary
to further understand the definition and
location of these terms the Oracle
retail semantics glossary is a tool that
facilitates a single source for defining
terms metrics and measures used by
retailers users can search for terms in
order to understand their definition
calculation synonyms and context thus
helping to align departments and provide
consistency brian searches for cost in
the retail semantics glossary and
filters his view to find unit cost and
base cost the RRL is available on my
Oracle support simply search a knowledge
base number two zero five eight eight
four three two to access the RRL
Information Center where you will find a
brief overview and select the available
versions tab for direct access to the
library version of your choice a link to
the latest release is available from the
main page do you have questions on the
RRL or are you having problems accessing
