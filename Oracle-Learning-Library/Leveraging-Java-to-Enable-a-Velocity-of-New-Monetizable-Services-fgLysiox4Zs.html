development and marketing for Proteus
systems I'll talk here a bit about Brody
as we start out and then get into really
how we took advantage of Java and our
product and to really deliver on our
value proposition to our customers talk
about who those are and really what's
the decision process that led to where
we are today entitled at leveraging Java
to enable velocity and new monetizable
services and ends because that's really
what the court or business model is so
with that I'll get started small
audience so you know if there's any
questions at any point to you know feel
free to chime in I'll try I'm sure we'll
have time at the end as well so first
proteus systems what are we about our
value proposition to our customers and
to a consumer is really to improve
people the way people interact with
technology you'll see that the way we do
this is focusing on enabling service
providers I'll talk talk about who they
are but in general they're traditionally
telcos cable co satellite companies so
on and so forth to to deliver a suite of
value-added services to their customers
more specifically the solution that we
have are offering is a an end-to-end
managed service delivery platform I'll
talk about the architecture as we go
through it but think of it as a cloud
service that we distribute in a managed
fashion two operators wear white label
so if you went to our website you
probably didn't didn't walk away with
much because mostly our services are
powered by the brands of major major
operators both well initially outside
the US and now emerging inside the US
the platform itself is consider our
value proposition being to an operator
that most operators in the world these
days are delivering what in this space
we call the triple play or quad play
voice video broadband and wireless and
they're all thinking about how do they
deliver the next suite of services as
the connected home evolves as people
start doing more and more from their TVs
from their pcs from their mobiles as
they start to look towards other
services inside the connected home
different devices in the home and
self become connected the operators
don't tend to have platforms that can
actually scale and deliver the services
to those different devices that's
exactly what we sought to build so with
one platform which is a software based
platform they can deliver take their
voice video and broadband and then start
adding to it healthcare related services
so i can do remote management of people
with chronic diseases home automation
home security home remote IT support and
backup services all through the same
interfaces that people are used to using
today so just imagine and for the few in
the room who have seen our product
before you're sitting there at your TV
set and you're doing everything from
being reminded that it's time to check
your blood sugar to being told
somebody's at the front door to you know
controlling the blinds because you're
about to start a movie the those are to
certain extent dreams that are pipe
dreams that the many home automation and
home control focus companies have been
working on in the past we've realized
that in a platform that's really
delivered to the mass market I'll talk
about how we do it but that's that's
really how when we started this company
the the vision we had to bring to our
customers so how do we get here you
really to look at how we address the
space you have to look at how the all of
these services from all these different
operators in particular your your homes
as well have evolved through the years
most operators in the past have focused
on just a limited number of services and
devices first it was for telephone
companies it was voice and broadband
cable companies it was video then got
into voice and broadband but originally
and you know if you if you look back to
say the the 90s you had basically three
devices in the home that they did
anything with you had a triple play a
best case a package of voice video and
broadband that you can put on top of it
and you had no convergence between the
two in other words that you couldn't
take your content service from your TV
and watch it on a mobile or a tablet or
or a web page and of course from a
consumer perspective there's limited
choice the other thing that's that
happened at that time is that at the end
of the day there was very little
convergence of how the operators
themselves dealt with this they had
separate billing mechanisms for how to
Bill you for your telephone service from
your broadband service from your video
service separate support people separate
support infrastructures the hole where I
refer to as the lifecycle management of
those products was completely disjoint
as things evolved of course the
connected home evolved and more and more
devices inside that home in that home
had to happen to have either an Ethernet
connection on them or or a wireless
connection on them so you've got more
and more connected devices showing up in
different rooms and in that consumers
life you have to a certain extent a few
years back you start to see common
software platforms start to ride on
these things initially the samsungs of
the world would approach things just
with a samsung software environment and
sampling architecture and then the
course the apples do their thing and the
the panasonics did their thing so on and
so forth but you didn't see a lot of
commonality reuse of platforms we're
starting to see that somewhat like
Android as an example but you know if
you go back a few years it still wasn't
you weren't seeing major software
platforms riding across these different
devices you know the service providers
are still typically a few years behind
everybody else and they're still trying
to focus on maybe the triple play
becomes the quad play where they throw
wireless in there but that's that's
about all they were doing and from a
consumer side you really your choice is
haven't changed specifically as it
relates to services you can go out there
and buy a few more gadgets but then they
onus is upon yourself to hook up those
gadgets support those gadgets and figure
out how to how to make use of them the
problem of billing infrastructures and
from and support infrastructures and so
on only got worse with every one of
those new devices that came in if
there's a service attached to it I go
out there and I buy a roku box and I get
netflix on it if I have a hard time
figuring out how to make that work who
do I call it when it comes to paying my
bill I have a bill for Netflix but i
also have a bill for for the other guys
we're delivering the rest of my services
advance to where we are now a lot more
devices are now connected instead of
just display devices you
have a lot more of non-display oriented
devices locks at front doors you've got
medical devices that have network
connections on them some of these
connections don't always make a lot of
sense you might have a refrigerator with
a connect with a connection on it but
the point is that more and more of our
life is connected via IP and of course
at the same time you then bring with it
the complexity of well I have now a new
sea of choices that I can pick from as a
consumer this problem as you can see
before from a billing and a lifecycle
perspective is only still gotten worse
then you layer on top of that the
over-the-top trend those in the service
provider space and well pretty much
anywhere in in the Western world here
know that there's a trend towards
over-the-top services where I may decide
to cut the cut the cord from my TV
provider because I'm going to get
everything over IP I can subscribe to
anybody can deliver anything over a
broadband connection well that takes
this space and just fragments fragmented
to the nth degree so now I've got a
variety of different players some of
them are my telephone company and cable
company some of them are pure over the
top players that are coming into the
connected home environment and maybe
delivering this service on this on this
one connected TV but not on this other
maybe on this game console but not on
this other and so the the amount of
consumer frustration that that results
from that is huge the amount of issues
whether it relates to common
infrastructure to be able to deliver a
simple experience to a consumer to
support it so on and so forth is is
really much is really a non-starter
service providers themselves tend to be
have a deer in headlights look as to how
they're going to deal with this this
space so this is the problem set that we
were focusing on and we start
architecting the platform we didn't
really to be honest with you didn't
really envision things becoming as
fragmented and as connected as they
ended up becoming but it's only
basically proven out the value prop that
we have when we bring it platform in so
the problem statement that we thought we
put upon ourselves was solve this
digital dilemma the dilemma I've got too
many devices that have just disparate
services I've got too many I want to be
able to access these different services
from all those devices but I can't
I have different service providers in my
life that can that I can get services
from I can get this from this app store
or this from this service provider but I
can't get everything from from any
single in any single party and then of
course again if something goes wrong you
know lord knows who I call it typically
nowadays people tend to call you know
the youngest the youngest kid living in
the house or the the 14 year old living
down the street or whatever because they
seem to know these gadgets better than
anybody else especially when you talk in
in a mass-market sense so what protea
did was translate this to well what do
we need to build so our needs were a we
have to go into a connected home
environment where we know that whatever
number of devices we support today
end-user devices these can be display
devices like TVs it could be a telemetry
device like a sensor it could be a
health care device like a scale or a
glucometer any number of devices that I
support today I know whatever that
number is it's only going to be you know
greater double triple whatever tomorrow
I can also count on the fact that
whatever the protocols are that those
things speak I'm I'm not going to drive
any standardization amongst them even
when a group of consumer electronics
companies get together and say hey we're
going to standardize how we deliver
media throughout the home they still
can't come to an agreement because they
all have different agendas to solve so
we said our platform is going to need to
support a lot of devices and the
protocols that are associated with them
layered upon that of course we're going
to need to support a variety of
different services some of these are
going to be you know kind of different
applets like what I can do on a
connected TV other these other these are
going to be more complex end-to-end
services like remote health care and and
and security management and then lastly
is the value proposition that any of our
customers seek to bring into the home
and the way in which they probably have
any chance of staying relevant in this
world relative to what's a google and
apple are doing is to enable a
convergence of these services that
nobody else does so in other words if if
an 80 as a one-off example tries to take
on a Google in terms of any one
individual application they probably
will lose
hopefully there's nobody from AT&amp;amp;T in
here but I don't think so where they do
have a competitive advantage or a
distinct advantage against those those
types of what new entrants into this
market is when you look at the fact that
an ATT could provide a converged
experience that as I go from my TV my pc
my mobile as I do go from one platform
an iOS platform to another that happens
to be an Android to another that happens
to be you know Samsung's connected TV I
have a chance of providing a service
that carries with them and this is the
only this is the way the service
providers see that they can at least
stay relevant in this space so to build
a platform that does that we need to not
only bring in all of these different
services some of them over the top some
of them are homegrown but we also need
to do it in such a way to enable the
seamless interaction between these
different devices and so we really were
left with two choices one is build a
single platform where we try to reinvent
the wheel inside our connected life what
does that mean so I sit there at the TV
and could protea go out there and build
a another netflix another set of
internet apps like you know connected TV
apps like youtube or different types of
internet video in ur internet music
pulling the best of breed security
service the best to breed health care
service so on and so forth which even
for a big company is not necessarily a
realistic realistic objective or
basically take on a massive system
integration activity build out a
platform that is really designed to
integrate to these these different types
of over-the-top and embedded services
and then we can make the decision as to
what we want to pull in and what we want
to reuse what we want to invent
ourselves so obviously we chose that
second path where effectively we're
going to a service provider saying we've
got this platform for you and within
this platform you can pick and choose
whether if you yourself think you're
going to take on netflix then here we
can plug into that or we can enable your
netflix equivalent if you you think so
think you're going to partner with you
know the Mayo Clinic on a congestive
heart failure related program for all
people that suffer from heart disease
then you have
the ability to do that versus reinvent
the Mayo Clinic which obviously they're
not going to do and so that was the path
we took and basically the the
fundamental requirement of the of the
platform that we built so what do we
build the platform we built we call Ross
residential operating system that's a
white label again bright a term because
are the consumers for the most part
don't ever see that that name but what
it is is really an end-to-end platform
parts of it resides in the home which is
the part that I'm going to talk about
more here fundamentally part resides in
the cloud which plugs into major service
providers back office equipment and
infrastructure and then basically it
delivers these services to different
devices and what we've done in our
architecture is really done it in such a
way that we can make that decision point
by point or vertical by vertical as to
whether we're building versus buying or
partnering versus reinventing ourselves
so here's what our architecture looks
like at the end of the day if I put it
into a consumer term not necessarily
what the consumer sees but if I put it
into the terms as to how something like
this would come into one of your homes
we're effectively a software client
that's riding on one a box that a
service provider brings into your home
so you get this new set-top box from a
company or a new modem from from from a
telco it just so happens to be charged
up with a series of capabilities that
they're going to then go position to you
on a on a regular basis and so from this
we actually have this three-tiered
architecture the cloud which I'm not
going to talk as much about although it
does make use of Java technologies to
deliver both the management and I'm
talking on the bottom here but both the
management value proposition as well as
the how it plugs in to different
operators networks the home which inside
the home here which is really divided
into these two categories what we've
done is we've separated out we've driven
a almost a client-server architecture
inside the home whereby we recognize
that the different devices that
consumers are going to use to access
content and services is not necessarily
the same device that's actually serve
up that content or that service and so
we've created this concept which we call
a home center think of it as a software
based server that's riding on different
types of platforms inside the home and
that's in that middle section there and
then delivering experiences to through
web services to a variety of different
types of clients that client could be a
connected TV it could be my android
phone it could be an iOS app it could be
we really don't care what it is because
at the end of the day we know that that
set of clients is going to keep evolving
so within this server element here which
is this the center section here a we had
to have a an architecture that says that
we have to be able to run on different
types of platforms like I said it could
be a set-top box in one case it could be
a gateway in another case it could be a
piece of hardware built by protea it
could be a piece of hardware built by a
different company entirely and within
that we had basically decided to build a
number of fundamental functions
ourselves which I which are these really
platform and management services here
and then basically build within that a
JVM whereby different apps and services
when we go into say health care and I'll
talk about the example here where
different apps and services are built as
as a bundles inside of osgi inside of
Java and as we go through the next parts
I'll talk about well you know why that
was good for us and how some of the
benefits though of the architecture were
a we got a scalability both in terms of
supporting the large number of any large
number of subscribers that an operator
would need to because we have a piece of
an intelligent server sitting inside the
home we didn't have to scale up the
cloud as much we also got scalability
with how we evolved in the connected
environment if I was at a trade show the
other day where somebody was talking
about what's next inside the connected
home as it relates to video in terms of
how people you know consume video video
experiences it was a bunch of
broadcasters and the like in the room
and you know the last panelist to talk
basically said that anybody who can
predict how people are going to really
consume video next year or the year
after I'd like to know whether they
predicted how the
tablet would really change the way
people operate today in many homes
myself included TV doesn't even get used
as much anymore because my kids can sit
there on the on the iPad and get all the
content that they want so the truth of
the matter is in all of our homes the
one thing we can count on is that the
way the different ways which we consume
media will change will change a lot so
for this reason we separate it out that
top layer with the different user
experiences from the server function
inside the home and so of course now the
core the the most fundamental core to
everything protea does is that server
it's how we get the server into the home
it's then how we then go integrate that
server to different types of other
platforms but without that server
element which we call the home center we
would not be able to deliver the value
prop we did so to that end then you know
why do we pick what we picked and in
terms of java and OST i obviously as i
said before picking in a software
environment that allows us to port to
it's different not just different
hardware platforms but different flavors
of hardware platforms is very
fundamental our first deployment was
with a telephone operator in the Middle
East in Dubai where they're effectively
a traditional 18 not even an AT&amp;amp;T like
operator but a small version of an AT&amp;amp;T
let's consider than that they built up a
bunch of services then the next thing
they said is oh well we want to go take
this over the top in conjunction with
satellite so now all of a sudden they're
saying I want to take all the same
services that you just built onto this
platform but I have to put it onto a
set-top box effectively that does
satellite plus all of these other things
well the last thing we want to have to
do is then go reinvent the wheel because
we're going from a kind of a pure telco
type world to a satellite-based world
our second customer was a up was a
operator who wanted to focus on
connected communities and they wanted to
you know get these this platform into
environments where they're integrating
to security systems and building
management systems and and the local
concierge services all within a very
confined community but of course once
that successful the next step is oh I
also want to push this out to the rest
of the the subscriber base over on an
entirely different platform so the
ability for us to build our applications
and
from a end consumer device perspective
port those applications as quickly as
possible to to other platforms was was
fundamental to our to our need another
reason why we chose Java is is the
ability to sandbox these applications so
that way if one developer is developing
a new service related to entertainment I
have to be able to confine that
application should something go wrong
because that same platforms running a
mission-critical health care application
so if the this one clinic is running a
program to manage people with congestive
heart failure when certain events occur
inside that consumers home it must react
a certain way and there's very stringent
requirements that it's working and it's
always on I'm sure that application
works and was tested to to perform at
the at the five nines of reliability
that it needs to but the problem was
what if somebody else wrote an
application that then go takes the takes
the platform down or Rob's it of system
resources or what have you
yes absolutely and so what we ended up
doing and I'll even show you a picture
here and another reason why we chose
osgi or actually a Java with OC on top
of it was we had to treat each of the
different devices that we're going to
have to talk to as a proprietary
implementation ie have an architecture
where we can slot driver after driver
after driver if one of those drivers is
a standardized interface great we're
happy and to a certain extent some of
those exists but I'll even show you when
I walk through some of these examples
here when we went into the healthcare
space is a good example you know there's
one company that makes a good num
probably sixty percent of all the
glucometers out there for checking blood
sugar it's a completely proprietary
interface okay so we had to put the
drivers in there for that the next
healthcare institution we talked to are
we going to get them to it to implement
the draw it the same protocol that the
first one not at all as a matter of fact
we didn't even try to fight the battle
of having device manufacturers change at
all their device that they put in the
home because we know that a those
battles are going on amongst all the
different consumer electronics device
companies they're all driven by their
own agendas so the only way we're going
to do it is to take all the proprietary
protocols that we're going to have to
interface to and making sure from an
architectural perspective we can slot
those in and so wherever standardization
exists it makes our life a little easier
but we don't at all count on it and
that's poor very much core to our
message to our customers because
unfortunately in the service provider
community especially telcos and cable
codes they don't even that their egos
are often a little bit too big to
understand that you're not going to move
the entire consumer electronics industry
consumer electronics will do what they
want to do so we just show them listen
if the next hot device that you want to
integrate to is this protocol let's not
get religious about it let's just make
sure we can build that build a driver
and push it into the bottle quickly so I
was on you know sandbox was of course
one thing you know moving down the list
here on this middle section here a big
piece of it is
as we go certain of these services that
we implemented when we first started on
health care we started doing it
ourselves because we saw it is a very
core strategic initiative for our
company I'm so we brought on advisors
and architects and what have you to say
what doesn't end to end health care
management system need but you know we
we as a company certainly don't want to
do that to the end of time and we can't
scale our business if we had to do that
and so we needed the ability to then go
engage other local partners to say hey
listen you know we've got this basic
platform capabilities here but if you
want to go take this same platform and
put your own custom security application
on it or your own custom energy
management application on it in
conjunction with the local power company
here's the toolkit have at it and so
protea ourselves of course built our own
development kit that we can give to
partners but fundamental upon that was
to give them an environment that they
could go go do that code development
themselves and obviously one thing that
protea looks to do is we scale up our
deployments is to bring a larger
developer community to the mix and so we
don't want to be in a position where
we're the only ones that can develop on
this platform so starting with Java was
was a was fundamental to enabling that
and then of course you know related to
that is just give us give us velocity as
we go go to market so we did we made
that decision so now you've got our
platform in the home it's got its
linux-based at its core java on top of
that or our platform services in java
but then we just add is that enough we
we did make the decision that we need to
layer osgi on it osgi was added for a
number of reasons first and foremost was
this kind of component oriented
framework and by that i mean that when
you think about what you want in your
connected home it's not just about the
fact that i want to turn out the lights
you know remotely or you know check to
see whether my security system happens
to be plugged in or on or turned on or
whatever it's really about the fact that
what you want in your home but i want to
my home is probably some combination of
that but i'm going to have my own
routine my own schedule the only things
that i want to do in my home and you're
going to have your own and it's the
ability to
what we in our company called create
connected home mashups so as soon as I
interface with a new device it could be
that camera at the TV it could be the
camera at the front door it could be the
ability to control the the thermostat
where the real power comes in is the
ability to start to customize that
towards my needs i come home at a
certain time and i want certain things
to happen in my house I've got what are
you know I've got a theater mode in my
house where I want to turn out the
lights and do this this and the other
thing my father's diabetic well he's got
different routines he wants to do
specific to his remote management of
diabetes and so to do that it meant that
we cannot to deliver our value
proposition we cannot implement services
in ice in silos isolated from each other
so you've got this job environment but
we want to make sure that every bundle
that we ever put in there every piece of
code that we write in there can be made
can other developers can then make use
of to create other matchups inside that
connected home environment so the one
guy who figures out how to talk to this
garage door opener or whatever it is
somebody else can then go write an
application that goes and takes
advantage of that and so starting with
Java but layering osgi on on top of that
and allowing our developers to then go
create these bundles but then publish
those bundles to other people that are
developing on the platform as well is a
pull through for the platform and adds a
lot of power to it the ability that the
management of it is another core part of
our of our proposition to our customers
so any piece of software I put on there
any application I put on there I have to
be able to control the whole lifecycle
of that that's something that you know
osei adds a lot to the mix from that
perspective and you know at the end of
the day it's it's it's also recognizing
that the day we put this into the home
is not the last day we're putting
software on that every day day in day
out you're pushing new services pushing
new applications and so that tight
management of all of the applications
and services is fun is fundamental so
the architecture we had basically starts
with Java puts osgi on it I guess the
last one we would say is that in many of
the circles we were running in we are
running in osgi is thought of as a
standard way to approach this IE telcos
and stuff like that
and so so from that basically we could
we can deliver our the proposition we we
sought to deliver so without what I'll
do is I'll walk through two examples now
the interesting thing about these two
examples is that when we first
architected our platform we had done
nothing in health care and nothing in
home control or energy management we
were focusing initially because we
founded the company in 2006 focusing
initially what our customers are
focusing on was mostly entertainment a
little bit on security personal media
the ability to share move content around
the home very much a Content focus and
of course including things like voice
and home networking and stuff like that
in the mix but health care was never a
single requirement on our on our you
know in our engineering requirements
list that our developers were we're
developing too but then at some point in
time we brought our platform in front of
some health care experts and we said
this is what our platform can do what do
you think and they said well if you
could do if you could develop a platform
that does the following these things
that we have on here and I'll walk
through them you could really move the
needle as far as what's going on in the
in the health care industry and I'll
talk about why in a second it starts on
the bottom right there with connected
home devices the first thing they said
is instead of talking to a TV or a
camera or a phone you know maybe you can
talk to medical devices well that's
that's pretty much a no-brainer other
than your comment before of having to
speak the protocols to them but that
that takes a couple weeks on that go
moving down clockwise through it the
next is that instead of interfacing with
back-end partners that have content
related services or entertainment
related services we have to interface
with health care institutions that
provide repositories to store medical
data like electronic medical records and
personal health records hospitals that
actually have doctors portals and and
different IT infrastructures so that
they can enable you know healthcare
providers to remotely manage we have to
connect to the doctors and caregivers
themselves we also have to connect to
other members of the community my
father's a diabetic as I said I'm I'm an
influential member in his community
because I can then go use the system to
help coach him in
remotely manage him and make sure that
you know he's he's he's following the
daily regimen that I asked him to even
though I happen to live in Texas and he
happens to live in New York on a Content
side we also had to interface with
different forms of educational content
video incentive mechanisms whereby I
cannon sent dad to actually go check his
blood sugar and and you know really
provide an ecosystem that includes not
just me collecting data but me also
remotely engaging him none of these
things do we build into the platform day
one what we did decipher from that is we
have to have devices we have to
integrate with third-party repositories
and data we have to integrate with
content services we have to integrate
with logic engines for health care this
is where the system receives these three
readings from my father's house and
decides I need to trigger an event like
call in them early call in the
professionals or push some reminders to
him because we've no we're noticing that
a given value of on his blood sugar is
on the rise these are not systems that
protea was going to build because we
didn't want to get into the middle that
these are systems that third parties
would provide and then lastly as you can
imagine the security and the privacy
requirements are pretty stringent when
it comes to this and ultimately what I'm
talking about here we did get FDA and
hipper approval for so we knew that you
know one way or another it's going to be
we're going to have to follow some
specific rules for so that's what
healthcare brought us and now I'll walk
through what energy management and helm
control brought us and then I'll talk
about what the resulting architecture
look like so on the home control energy
management side I'm sure you know many
of you just in in passing here of you
know the ability to like I said open
doors oh you know check if windows are
open turn lights on and off what have
you those are the standard requirements
yes you know that you layer on energy
management in there where the device
list is not just about controlling
things the device list is also about
sensing things how much power is that
this one device using where is my
where's the money on my energy bills
going you know can I set up a schedule
for my
water heater whereby it's not running at
all the toll 24 hours a day so on and so
forth but where we wear our customers
took us was again not just that it can't
just end there because that's not enough
to really make it to really help it take
off it's the ability to create as I was
saying before these custom scenes where
I as a user can say here's what I want
to do here's how I want to very easily
program my home environment when I come
home I do this I want this to happen
that to happen or my kid walks home from
school on their own as soon as they walk
in the front door I get an alert I can
see their image was on the front door I
can then go you know initiate or remote
teleconference or whatever I want this
is cus this is very specific to me my
home my life and the next person is
going to going to be specific to them
and so this is where the worlds of
security and energy management home
control are all coming together so
whatever we developed here can't just be
in that in that one silo so what were
the the requirements coming out of this
whole suite of new devices some of these
standardized fortunately many not so
instead of health care devices it's
things like I said like thermostats and
light sensor outlet sensors and outlet
controllers and so on and so forth it is
new protocols with each one of those it
is these user-defined scenes so that I
can customize it to my needs without
having to call in a programmer to do
that because once you get into that
you're really into an industry that's
only caters to the the top 1% of the
population and it is this interaction
between the these different types of
services where I can blend the scenario
i said before of my daughter is a
combination really of security and and
an home control and then lastly is again
i don't want to be in a position where
protea has to do all that development so
we have to then go put these these
capabilities into third-party hands so
when you take those two together which
again like i said we didn't really
architect with these services
particularly in mind this is what the
resulting architecture looks like
starting out at the bottom we have a
series of platform services that is
the core to what Ross which is our core
platform brings to the table this is the
management of the whole in a home
environment this is hooks into telcos
and service providers Oh OSS BSS their
billing systems their their consumer
portal so on that then exposes a series
of platform services to everything that
we put at this Java layer we did of
course like I said bundle osgi inside
there and so each one of these things
you see here is effectively another
bundle written in the same jvm and
inside osgi so you know whereas starting
at the bottom I have a proxy to talk to
my platform fine but basically we first
created user-defined scenes with a home
control context in mind but then we
allowed energy management to make use of
those same user defined scenes I had a
suite of protocols that I had to support
z-wave zigbee are somewhat home control
and energy management centric bluetooth
is both ANT+ is usually used in the
medical community so but once i
implemented any one of those protocols
any app or service can then go make use
of it again because it's just another
bundle sitting inside that same same
framework and then we created these
vertical services now the truth is the
one thing even this chart doesn't
reflect is that I can have many many
instances of a health care service we're
doing health care is one of the more
emerging areas so we're doing pilots in
the US and outside the US and even in
the u.s. we've got medical institutions
that have their own flavor of what they
want to do with remote health care
management so there's many instances of
that health care service which protea
wrote those in this case but protea
doesn't even need to be the developer of
those but the next version our next
instance of that health care service can
make use of course of all of those other
capabilities within the platform there
and so now I know other develop has to
worry about how to talk to an ant plus
glucometer how to create user defined
scenes what's an also not on here is we
built bundles for talking to medical
repositories so the first version of it
puts all of the medical information from
that user into microsoft healthful which
is there
they're EMR but then we had a was
actually with Oracle at the hems show
the medical show we were demonstrating
how we can take all of the same data and
plug it into a oracle based personal
health record repository that work took
like one of our developers just a couple
weeks because all he had to do is take
it stays here take that bundle that we
that says take all this data we getting
out of the home and plug it into this
this repository just create another
instance of that and now it leveraged
everything else that was in that in that
same platform so it was I think a very
good poster child or ratification that
the approach certainly paid off because
at the end of the day all of our
energies to make this possible was years
of work kind of at the platform level
and building the framework but the first
pilot instances of both health care as
well as home control was literally two
weeks worth of work for for one of our
engineers and then it inherited all of
the rest of the benefits of the platform
and in that regard some of our learnings
some of the obvious ones this first
section is ones that we expected to find
you know obviously rapid porting and
development as we went into these
different environments what depending
upon what hardware we were needing to
run on in a consumers environment the
communities of users that we could then
go tap into we go into one of our
partners and say listen if you if you've
got people that could just develop these
services in Java then there you know we
can very easily you know use them on
this on this program the security is
paramount and fundamental and by
security it's mostly around the ability
to contain applications to make sure
that applications are written in this in
this sandbox and only have the rights to
do what they are supposed to do and then
integrating to third party not
third-party developers but third-party
systems like that the medical repository
example I just gave before because
everywhere we take this platform we have
to do that one of the opportunities was
that we saw for JVMs in general was the
whole bundle management theme
a concept that I talked about which osgi
brings which I do believe Oracle has
since added but it was something that
initially was not was not there and
something that was very important for us
and I think it's for anybody who's doing
a similar type of application will run
into this need so that way we can you
know more easily manage putting all
these apps into the same environment
because we need them to to deliver on
our promise but at the same time have
the the full level of management over
each of these individual bundles as we
as we push them to the to the consumer
and then of course you know what we
ended up with was this platform so most
of our customers actually launch with
you know entertainment because because
our customers aren't always if their
service providers they're not always the
most the best marketers of the world
they they don't necessarily launch with
the most innovative thing but they go
out there with a very strong a very
powerful Trojan horse whereby they
launch with a video on demand Plus maybe
a remote and an elder and elder
management or elder monitoring type of
nanny cam type service but now they've
got the ability to continue to leverage
that on a day-in day-out basis so you're
sitting there you're TV one day and you
just get this pop-up that says did you
know you can now subscribe to this new
service that does X Y or Z and they can
do that because we sat there in the
background and just push that new app
and push that new bundle and allowed
them to deliver that new complex service
but it hasn't changed how they how they
run their business they haven't to
invest haven't had to invest a lot of
money into building that and really
hasn't you know is really just additive
to everything that they're doing so I
think that's that's our story questions
both both so what we had to do is we had
to actually like any a small company we
had to cede the market ourselves because
the first thing we did is we went to the
the the guys who are making devices in
homes but for service providers these
are the motorolas and Cisco's and paces
and whatever the world and the first
thing we said to them is hey you know if
you did this if you put our app on your
platform look what we could do together
of course they scratched their head and
say yeah we should do and that we should
do a platform like that thanks for the
idea so they were always resistant the
other thing is that they're always also
not the most innovative people so when
if they go to a customer Motorola goes
to one of their customers says well the
good news is I got a set-top box that
can run all these other things the bad
news is to dollar more Comcast the real
thing I'll save the dollar and so that's
changed a lot thanks to you know all of
the innovation largely coming out of the
bay area that's got the comcast of the
world more scared and they know need
they need to do new things so what we
did is we launched with our own line of
hardware but all on industry standard
reference designs and chipsets and now
we're at that stage where the first few
third-party manufacturers are building
these boxes according to spec from from
the chipset guys we're even going into
the chipset guys saying hey guys let's
make this a core part of your software
suite and you know make that something
that you avail to your customers as you
develop a new line of chips that's where
we see this going so the day will come
in the not too distant future where we
don't make any boxes and we slowly run
on servers
we do we actually got two flavors we've
got a version that's kind of totally
server-based which is like a linksys
gateway on steroids so actually the
first box we built was exactly that yeah
because we didn't want to we didn't want
to get in the set-top box community as
its own its own little world too so the
first thing we did was really the
equivalent to what you'd buy from
linksys but just a bit on steroids then
we got into the set-top box base where
even on the set top box I'd we allow
them to bring in the traditional
providers of middlewares and stuff like
that on set-top boxes we just complement
that and then I'd say the last box that
protea will take to market is actually a
little dongle but might as well be a
wall wart you know that you just
basically plug into the wall and plug
into your home network it has no video
in and out it just has a network
interface or it's or wireless and it's
just a server and so in that case we're
not even the linksys of the world
because why we're finding is that unlike
2006 people are replacing those linksys
boxes less frequently now than they used
to be because you know you went from BG
2 n 2 double n or what have you but
nowadays how much how many of our home
networks have changed yeah other than
other than that so that's that's
primarily it other questions
I didn't go over the business ball but
I'll be happy to discuss it with you so
basically what what we do / and sexually
good piggy back on the last comment was
what we do is we go to our customers
with an end end software platform that
we deliver as a managed service so now
we go to them and say we have these
pieces of hardware if you want them you
buy them from us if not we're fine to
run on something else and then it's it's
really a light a revenue share based
model that says you let us in the door
with your plot with this platform we
don't charge you a lot for hardware we
don't charge you we don't they don't
even have to do the backend hosting we
can do that for them and then because
we're in the door there with you we will
jointly benefit in that the health care
stuff which you did here that's a good
example where we go to a customer first
around you know we weren't even talking
health care around you know
entertainment type proposition we
deliver them a bunch of services we go
back and build out this end and health
care program where our customers don't
pay a penny for it we come back to them
and say okay we're already in the home
we're already running there we've built
out this health care solution we've even
talked to some of the local partners
here and did you realize that you know
this insurance company or this ministry
of health would be willing to pay you
ten dollars a month just to get this
inside the home so and if they say if
they agree then we just split the split
the the revenue on up so basically we're
trying to take the innovative you not
depend on the operator for the
innovation because they don't always
happen and and also basically align our
interests and it is i mean not to make
it a softball but it was pretty
fundamental to to also using java
because we're only is good i can tell
you you know when we get that first
contract with a given operator that's
not really what what excites us what
excites us is we get out there we get
into the homes and now we can start
developing new apps and new services and
so at the end of the day if we didn't
see a platform that was future proof to
be able to deliver to create these new
verticals like health care then you know
our business model as a whole wouldn't
really stand
do
so you take orders
Prime Aaron Ischl well initially our
customers were exclusively service
providers telcos cable companies
satellite companies people who are
delivering services some semblance of
voice video broadband or whatever or
wireless to you today we're seeing that
change a bit where there's a lot of
other players in the market you know if
you look at the role that companies like
Apple play in a consumers life they are
a provider of service and content and
what have you so we're seeing that
change a bit where you're getting less
traditional service providers come to
the table and say you know what I still
need to deliver I still need to have the
ability to have a quality run scalable
managed service but i'm not a telco and
what's really changed this is this whole
over the top trend right where i don't
necessarily need to own that copper or
that coax in your house in order to
deliver service to you and so i would
say over time we're seeing more more and
more development of those other types of
alternative service providers but to
date they've all been the traditional
ones and then to to your other question
or we wasn't any question but just to
highlight we took the same approach with
apps as we did with hardware which is we
didn't just give them a toolkit and say
okay now theoretically if somebody were
to build an app on this you'd have a
cool app we actually built the first few
apps ourselves and like health care we
go out there and and then you know we
invest time energy money into thinking
about how to piece together a health
care solution so we ourselves also bring
apps to them but we don't say that this
is a Protea run walled garden we say as
anybody that wants to develop apps and
services on the subject to you know our
customers agreement then they can do
that
it's it always is a combination of the
two right I mean we would love if our
service providers customers were would
prescribe here's our five-year vision
and every app and service we need to do
but again they don't always they don't
know that themselves always we often
have to go to them and say you know what
there's an opportunity here in health
care there's an opportunity here in
security or whatever and so and then and
then from that we distill out now new
requirements like okay well if we are
going to get into health care we got to
add these protocols that we have to have
these types of platform services so we
let the apps and services pull through
the platform don't just hypothetically
create platform capabilities thinking
well maybe one day we'll use these
because at the end of the day the app
and service is what they're going to
sell and the app and service is what's
going to give us our rev share as well
yeah well what I'm seeing definitely is
a lot of devices certainly there's some
from a protocol perspective i'm seeing a
bit more gravitation towards bluetooth
LE i guess it is you know a low-energy
version of bluetooth so that's good
because I you know ant+ is probably the
most common device protocol today I am
definitely seeing this it's almost a
Qualcomm initiated trend of I want to
build a cloud service that's tied to
everything that comes inside the home
I'm not really a cloud service provider
company but i figure i'll figure out how
to monetize that or use that later I
definitely many are doing it the first
wireless scale that you can get on and
pull the readings off company by the
most successful ones coming by the name
of withing 'he's they did just that you
have to go through the wedding's portal
to go see the the results and so just
like probably many other industries
there's a bit of a land-grab there where
everybody's trying to talk you know
rollout devices that are tied to their
back-end service none of which have
really figured out what they're going to
do with that back-end service once
they've got people on it I we try not to
get in the middle of that battle you
know we've got two ways to get the data
we can either talk directly to the
device so we can talk through the cloud
service so the consumer they don't
really have to know the difference but
certainly I'm seeing that the trend
towards that not that point no because
that's where business needs or you know
supersede standards needs you know
standards I'd say we're the biggest
activity I'd say on the standard side is
probably when you do look towards
integrating that data in something like
a personal health record repository I
see more activity there but that doesn't
preclude the Withings of the world from
still pulling it first into their cloud
first right so I think there is some
good work being done there because
because of you know government initiated
mandates that this stuff does need to be
digitized so it is coming together a bit
completely in the cloud I don't think
it's really sorting out the home
environment at all for anybody but it in
it indirectly helps us I guess because
we can at least I can get access to the
data and still
liver or service any other questions
okay well thank you for your time and
your attention and you know so good good
experience here to be able to use to use
these technologies to deliver on what
we're doing hopefully one day you've all
got it in your homes and you'll give me
your direct feedback so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
