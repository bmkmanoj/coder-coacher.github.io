manager for the Oracle development tools
and this session is specifically about
JDeveloper and ADF so just so i'll know
who the audience is how many people here
are actually using JDeveloper and ADF
right now all right some of you I'm
assuming 11g oh yeah okay so for you
some of it might not be that new okay
basically what what we kind of time to
do with this session is educate people
who don't use JDeveloper about what's
new in JDeveloper and time travel some
of the new stuff that is there is
relatively new or upcoming in JDeveloper
a little bit later on well I'll try and
do today is I can explain first of all
why do we actually have j develop an ADF
then I'll talk about ADF essentials
which is one of the new things that we
are offering which is basically a free
version of Oracle ADF Co functionality
and spend about somewhere between 20
minutes about around doing a demo just
to give you an example of how you
actually build application with ADF and
then I'm going to talk about what's up
coming in JDeveloper what were the
things we introduced lately okay first
of all why we actually need JDeveloper
so JDeveloper is a Java development
environment but for us it's much more
than that
it's not just a Java development
environments it's a development
environment for anything that has to do
with the Oracle platform so whether it's
the database so you have database
modeling and a peer sequel debugging and
all of those aspects
it's everything that has to do with all
the Java stack from just the sdk to a
java ee to web services to HTML to xml
manipulation it's also the platform for
our middleware development whether it's
the SOA processes VPN post says web
Center and total capabilities or MBI all
the business intelligence and stuff like
that all of those are developed in a
single ID and the approach here is that
we believe that the modern day
application it's not
just the Java part the modern-day
application has much more than just Java
it involves all of those layers of those
capabilities and we wanted to give a
single development environment where you
can do all of those in a single project
with the same gestures which make you as
a developer more productive focusing on
doing those type of applications we also
use JDeveloper is the development tool
for our fusion applications okay so this
is one aspect that is really unique to
our care in that sense we like half of
the company is responsible for
manufacturing products and technology so
things like a development tool or a
database or middleware but there's
another half of the company that
actually uses those products to build
applications enterprise type of
application all the HL CRM project
management financials and those guys are
using this tool and this framework to
build their applications
okay so JDeveloper is the development
tool and then we have also IDF and what
IDF gives us is a development framework
okay it's a Java EE based development
framework so we basically started from
Java and we built on top of it adding
more functionality so we added a bunch
of innovative aspects to what Java
currently provides yeah it also
integrates all the layers so it's not
just a framework for doing object
relational mapping open system it's not
that a framework for UI it's not just a
framework for a controller layer it's
actually a framework that integrates all
of those along with things like security
that goes throughout all the layers so
you can define a security on your
business service that then will
automatically reflect in your user
interface the main goal of Oracle ADF is
to simplify application development for
our developers okay so we have about
3,000 developers building Fusion
application and we wanted them to be as
productive as possible and yet they
could have written
low-level Java code for everything but
frankly that wouldn't give us the
productivity that we
needed and you wouldn't be able to see
fusion application production in the
last year also okay it'll probably take
us a little bit longer and what IDF
allows us to do is focus on a
development approach that is much more
visual and declarative okay so rather
than writing a lot of low-level Java
code manually you do things visually the
result is actually Java code okay so
what you do get it the end of the day is
so that you can go to and directly
manipulate the source and version
control it like anything else okay and
debug through it and things like that
but we do the development in a in a
different approach in something that is
much more parallel to what people are
used to form let's say a dotnet
environment and one other aspect that
EDF gives us is abstraction from
specific technologies in many layers so
we don't need our developers to learn
low-level HTML Javascript and XML HTTP
Oh Jason in order to do ajax they walk
with concepts where they work with
components that shield them from those
technologies and then when technology
changes the framework adapts okay and we
can talk about it later on some examples
of that the other aspect which might not
be relevant to everyone but is
definitely relevant for us is that ADF
allows us to create an applications that
are customizable which means that we can
provide a base application to one
customer into another customer the same
application they can go and do
customization on those application
change behavior change position of
things in the application change
validation rules and those
customizations are kept in a layer above
the application we can then upgrade them
to the next version of our application
and the customization they did would
automatically be applied so we basically
use Oracle ADF to build everything at
Oracle right now so Fusion application
is one example and those are just some
screenshots from I think the the this
side is actually the HR system
I think the other one is CLM okay and we
also use ADF to build some of our
product so on the right side you see I
am a management tool Cole Enterprise
Manager it's built with ADF on the left
side you're seeing so it's on the other
side yeah this side is actually the
bright side you're saying about BPM
which is part of our SOS wait this is
the BPM workspace area where you can
basically monitor processes and see how
they are performing we used OAD F to
build our support site so if you go to
the oracle support site today
you know actually running an IDF
application and beyond us doing it we
also of course a lot of customers are
using IDF to build their own
applications and while the previous
applications might have all looked the
same to some degree because this is the
standard okay look and feel as you can
see customers can actually use ADF to
build whatever look and feel for their
application that they want to so just so
you know those are all public web sites
that are running based on IDF there's
also ADF is used for public website but
a lot of the usage of ADF is actually
for backing the enterprise application
data running inside the organization not
necessarily exposed over the Internet
all right so this is kind of another
view of what is JDeveloper an ADF and
why we have them okay basically we have
them because we needed tools to make our
development effort easier and protect us
again technology changes in the future
one thing we announced last week is
something called oracle ADF essentials
which is basically taking the call
capabilities for molecule idea and
allowing everyone to use them to develop
and deploy application for free okay so
it's not everything that is in ideas but
it's all the pieces that you need in
order to build a web-based application
okay it got the JSF component okay
it got the controller which expenditures
of capabilities
does the binding layer and there's a DF
business components to access the
database now the nice thing about ADF in
general an ADF essential as well is that
you don't
we have to use all of those you can pick
and choose you can choose to use just
parts of the framework okay we believe
that the power comes when you use
everything together but I'll show you in
the demo I'm actually going to use just
three of those technologies not all of
them not only is it free you can also
deploy it on GlassFish which is also a
free server you can also deploy it on a
web logic and WebSphere and those are
the ones that we actually test that you
can probably deploy it on other servers
as well we just didn't have time to test
this in terms of development with ADF
essentials you can get JDeveloper which
is our free development environment and
we also there's also ADF development
capabilities in eclipse they are still
not using the essential versions but
they will uptake the essential version
in the next version of the eclipse
student that's one thing that you need
to know about ADF we're expanding the
tools that you can use so if you're
currently using eclipse
you can still use ADF and you can still
you do the idea faces and the controller
visually and you can do binding even so
that's the kind of the architecture of
what is inside the idea of essentials on
the top we basically use JSF and we
extend the UI that you can build with
JSF by giving you a set of components
called ADF faces components this is a
set of over 150 JSF - all components
that you can use to build your pages
okay so even if you're not planning to
use ADF at all right you're just
building a java application using JSF
and you're looking for a rich set of
components with a lot of functionality
you can just pick up a their faces you
don't need the rest of video work just
like any other set of components below
that we have the ADF controller and
again this is an option you can choose
to use just the JSF controller the idea
of controller gives us extra
capabilities on top of what JSF gives us
okay and we'll talk about it in more
detail later on on the bottom you have
business services and those are
basically the services that access your
data do validation logic whatever you
want and here we actually our pluggable
so you can use any java class okay MJ
piha bees if you want to
you can use rest services or you can use
one of the parts of ADF that we provide
which is called ADF business components
which is specifically targeted at
working with relational databases and
then there's the IDF binding layer which
offers a very easy way to take and build
and connect the user interface and the
controller layer to the business
services that you have developed so if
we break down what each one of them in
ADF faces as I said a set of a hundred
and fifty JSF components it's probably
the richest set of components of JSF
components out there today it includes
everything from your check box to a
button to a table to a tray to graphs to
cow cells calendars Maps whatever you
again we used all of those to build our
one application so whatever those guys
needed we provided them those type of
comparison beyond visual components
there's a lot of other framework type of
tre components things that allow you
very easily to do drag and drop to do
pop up window Inc we support things like
push to the client okay so you can
actually file events to the client and
the other aspect here is that we also
took those components and made sure that
they are not just walking in a regular
browser they are also working on the
browsers that run on your tablet so if
you take an iPad and you take your ad of
application and access it from the iPad
everything would still work okay we
adapt to the UI to the show it to the
platform and we actually adjust the UI
to match it so for example graphs in in
our regular browser would display using
flesh we automatically convert them to
display an html5 on an iPad and this is
actually a good example of one key
capability that the ADA faces component
give us and that's protection from
technology changes on the UI layout okay
because when we first created a graph
component it was generating SVG images
but then they stopped developing SVG and
so we just switched the graph component
to generate PNG
static images and then our users came
and told us but we want that way the
guff to actually have animation because
the managers like to have nice things
moving around so what they did is so
what we did actually is we switch the
graph to generate flesh edit animation
capabilities and then people started
showing up at work with iPad and told us
they the graph doesn't work here so we
just switch the graph to generate html5
and throughout one of those changes the
actual developers didn't have to learn
any new thing they were still working
with the same component the component
took care of adapting to the new
technology and that's what basically
idea things to do it seems to protect us
from technology changes basically we
spent the last five years building a
huge application like thousands of forms
tens of thousands of business services
we don't feel like redoing this anytime
in the next 10 years or more so the
framework is built in a way that allows
us to adopt to technology changes
another good example is when we build
business services ok they deposit access
the database initially we were able to
allow remote access to them through EJB
ok and then we switch it so now you can
also do a soap web service and now we
are switching it again to allow you to
do s service and again the business
service is the same business service you
just go through a different wizard to
allow you to expose different interfaces
the idea of controller is basically the
controller part of your MVC architecture
if you talk to people who are using IDF
11g that's probably one of the parts
that I must impress them and the reason
is because what we did is we took the
controller layer and instead of just
having a page flow diagram we actually
converted it to be a complete process
flow diagram so things that in other
products and other frameworks require
you to get a full BPM engine or Whipple
engine to and things like that we can
run it as part of your regular Java
application then the other aspect that
we did is not
can you run those as processes you can
actually take them and embed them into
other flows so you can actually take one
flow and invoke it from another flow and
you can also take one flow and invoke it
inside another page so you can have a
full like a regular JSF page that on a
region on the page lands a complete flow
of several other pages okay which is a
concept that sometimes is how to explain
with slides so I'm actually going to do
it in the demo later on and show you
what we're meaning to but the ideal is
that you can now modulate the way that
you build your JSF application build
contained processes and then reuse them
across multiple applications across your
application in multiple places and if
you're using the full overkill stack you
can actually use this and have end-user
edit those into your page dynamically so
create the page and bring those into the
page whenever they want so again the
controller is also part of ADF
essentials and then there's the layer
called area of business components and
this layer is responsible for building
business services that access relational
databases and the goal here is to give
you the most of total box functionality
that you need in a declarative way so
you can actually go ahead and create
master data synchronization and lists of
value and calculated fields and
validations and all of those without
actually writing low-level java code you
just point and set some properties and
you're done you have a business service
that you can actually communicate with
the database in addict like and you all
needed declarative definition you can go
in and write Java code but the idea is
that you'll only write Java code by
exception so if you have a scenario
where the framework doesn't do what you
want you can override and add your own
logic so for example if you want to
override the way that we do locking in
the database you can bring in your own
locking mechanism and write it in there
again all of those business services are
usable across application you can pick a
them use them in multiple application
and you can also expose them with web
service interfaces to be activated
remotely okay so those are some of the
things that it makes like ADF missy
makes simpler everything from query by
example so you can actually query by any
of the fields to lists of value to
calculated fields to a lot of the
infrastructure of how you actually work
with the database so range fetching so
not like fetching all the table into the
middle kill in one go and transaction
control and looking and state management
and all of those are done declaratively
delay oh that is the hardest to explain
how it feels to be the hardest to
explain to Java developers is the
binding layer okay what the binding
layer is as possible to do is allow you
to very easily take and build the user
interface that connects to your business
service and in the world of Java until
Java six there was no equal equivalent
to something like that in Java EE 6 they
did something they moved one step
forward which is CDI which allows you to
declaratively sort of define which
business service is used in which page
we're not talking just about how you
define this but we're also talking about
the development experience and you'll
see that with the ADF Modelo data
binding layer I can basically take a
Java class or an EJB or a web service
drag and drop it and create a page I
don't need to write all the managed bean
I don't need to write all the expression
language and we can do it again for any
Java class that you'll give us JPA EJ
Bibbs web services rest services and a
bunch of other things so all of those
open and this is basically a list of
some of those all of those things are
basically included in ADF essentials
which you can get for free and start
developing today again either in
JDeveloper or eclipse and as you can see
both of them support visual aspects of
development so instead of showing you
that part insights have actually go in
build an application so this is
JDeveloper 11g the current production
version and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to build a new application I'm
going to use what we call the fusion web
application template
I'm gonna give it a package name and
click finish and JDeveloper would go off
and create two projects for me so for
the people in the chip sits at the back
you can see there's a model project
which is where I build my business
services there's a view controller which
is where I build my user interface so
this separation out of the box is named
again at your building mobile useable
applications so the model layer you can
go ahead and build your business still
Business Services okay and again you can
use ADF business components which is
part of ADF because this is Java one I
thought what would be a little bit more
interesting is to actually use Java
standard so let's create a JPI entity
based on some tables in the database ok
so this is the regular JPA without the
inside JDeveloper and you create a
connection to a database and by the way
it doesn't have to be an Oracle database
it can be other databases as well and I
think that you have a JDBC connection -
you can use it it should be an auto
database because I'm from Oracle but
that's anyway you create the connection
to the database you query your data
dictionary you pick up the tables that
you're interested in working with and
you click Next a few times and in all of
those steps you can basically set things
about how the JPA is are being generated
like what fields methods what a notation
what relationships things like that but
this is kind of blowing kiss this is
something that all the ideas are doing
right now right so I'm not going to
delay on this and what you get is you
get your basic JPA entity there's
nothing here that is Oracle specific if
you look at the impulse spill Java right
and what we do nice what one nice thing
that we do is we actually allow you to
now go and generate an EJB session
facade that access those and create
basically access the facade to those JPA
entities and this facade will be created
with a bunch of methods that allow you
to work with the data so do things like
queries and updates and inserts and
things like that so this is again
something we do nicely for you again if
you look at the code
nothing Oracle specific in
and by the way I'll click Save now and
what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to do the first PDF thing that I'm doing
so far so so far I just did regular Java
II what I can do in ADF is I can take my
session egb and I can say create data
control okay and this can be running in
the same game or in a different way I'm
going to run everything in a single VM
and what was created right now is this
file okay and this is the visual way of
looking at the file okay it shows you
which methods and available he'll you
can also look at the source source
doesn't say much beyond the fact that
this is accessing the session it should
be that you build what we basically tell
ADF now is that this is a business
service that you should be able to use
in your ADF application and again the
code in the in the AEG behind each ABO
in the JPA hasn't changed I didn't need
to go in here and annotate the EJB or
the JPEG tell it you're going to be used
in a jet-set face in a JSF page okay
which is different from CDI and CDI
actually need to go to each business
service and define where it's going to
be used okay here I don't do this okay
I'm completely obstructed from where
this business service is going to be
used and by doing this all I got
basically is this little area here where
I can see what is inside my session EJB
okay now let's go to the more
interesting part which is building a
user interface so here I'm going to
build a new JSF page so it's on the web
tail page and this is a normal chess F
to the top page users facelets and you
can use templates if you have templates
so you can use one of our quick stout
layout and we have all sorts of layout
and sub layouts and I'm going to again
start from scratch so actually let's do
a blank page nothing on it and what
JDeveloper is doing now is taking me
into the visual JSF edit oh okay
so unlike most of the ideas right now in
the Java Market we actually have a
visual editor for JSF let's see and now
over here on the right you can actually
you can work with the regular JSF
components right which is what about
2530 components or you can choose to
work with the idea phases components
which is about as I said over 150 and
I'm going to take a decorative box put
it on the page and change the color
scheme to be medium Helders medium color
medium looks okay
and and all this this component
basically just gives me rounded corners
so it's like child proofing your ad F
application and actually it's it's a
cool looking a result that is that it's
a cool looking thing for your
application then I want my page to
actually be split into two areas the top
and the bottom so I'm going to take a
splitter put it in here but not one next
to the other but rather I want the
orientation to be vertical so one on top
of the other and because we have a high
resolution we can public turn this into
three Hobart where the separation is it
did alright at the bottom I'm going to
use a dashboard component where is my
dashboard component panel dashboard I'm
going to put it here and a dashboard
allow me to take and put boxes in the
dashboard okay and the dashboard kind of
control the boxes in it so if I tell the
dashboard you're going to have two boxes
in a row it's going to arrange them like
this and I can tell each box is going to
be like 350 pixels okay something like
that natural 300 bucks yeah okay so I
actually want all the three of them to
be in the same well so this is the
dashboard I'll show you what the
dashboard can do mob in a couple of
minutes then on the top I actually want
to show actually let's split the top
again to - where's my splitter on it
okay I'm going on this let's say in the
400 and then on the right side I can
tell on the left side I can take and
build an accordion component okay so
when I called you on let's call this
depth and you can right-click and say I
need another accordion component so
again what I'm showing you is kind of
bowing I'm showing you how to build a
layout for a page but what I wanted to
get an impression of is how you build an
application okay this is not what you
usually see in Java
one sessions writing in usual Java one
sessions what you will actually be
seeing is more along the line of this
tub okay which is called the soul step
okay and then you go like I can't see
anything and and the nice thing here is
that my code is actually available for
me so if I want to change something I
can go and directly change it in my code
for example and let's find our shell
detail it let's do it from here let's
find one of our boxes and have the text
folder box say move okay then if I go
into the design view one of the boxes
would now say move okay the same thing I
can do form a puppet I can go over to
the second box and call this one foo and
basically it's just an easier way to
visualize what you're building in terms
of user interface right now comes the
part is usually tricky for JSF
developers or Java EE developers is I
got my layout for the page now I need
that data in here so what you were doing
normal Java is you'll go into each one
of the agb's you start to annotate it
okay
then you'll bring components and you'll
start to write expression language
connecting those to your managed beans
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
over to my EJB that I created he'll see
that there's a method that returns
department and drag and drop it into the
page to say create a read-only page for
me okay I don't actually need all the
fields I just interested in those fields
and I'm adding a bunch of buttons that
would allow me to scroll between my
records of departments and that's this
page so this this section of the page
yeah
what JDeveloper does now it goes over
analyzes the structure of the EJB and
the collection that is returned and puts
it on the page and creates the fields
for me then each department has
employees again for the people in the
back you can actually see each
department has employee list below it so
I can take this employee list and bring
it over here and put it for example as a
read-only table turn on some behavior
again maybe remove one of the columns
maybe remove some of the other columns
maybe rearrange columns actually the
arranging now doesn't actually is it's
not very important because I can
rearrange it later on where Trenton okay
and then I get a table with my data
again no need to go in each column
manually write the expression language
that needs to access the breaking beam
so this is how you get data in there
maybe we also wants to use the employees
of the hill to have a page where I can
actually update some of the data so we
can again remove some of the fields some
of those and include a submit button and
then I have a little area where I can
update the data then the salary field
right now it's it's showing as a regular
input text maybe I want something that
is more advanced so I can click on it
and say convert this component into a
spin box component right so spin box
basically allows me to say okay the
maximum salary is seventy thousand the
minimum salary is one and when I click
on the arrow just increase the salary by
one thousand okay that's the way I would
do it and what else can I do I can also
take the employees by the way and bring
them over here to create geographical
maps of where the employees well or a
hierarchy view a local sales let's do a
graph so there's like 50 types of graphs
in Hale that you can choose from most of
them I actually don't know what they
actually represent but well graph I can
still manage that so we'll do a broad
graph and again what you do is very
basic I say I want salaries on the Bob
and I want the last name over here and I
can swap the two if I want when I click
OK and this is how I create a graph so
again the concept is I work with
component that's the nice thing about
JSF I don't need to write low logic code
to end their visual graphs ok and maybe
some before I already ran it but I'll do
a couple of other things what if I want
to do drag and drop of the boxes that I
want to be able to move them around all
I need to do like we do is actually take
the component called component drag and
drop it on each one of the tables so I
put one here put another one here and
put a third one over here okay so now I
can drag those what if I want my graph
to actually not just be flat like like
let think I want it to actually be with
a three-dimensional aspect so I can go
into appearance and set it to be 3d and
maybe even do some animation and
something like that and maybe even do
see the soul of a bit like this
okay so again a bunch of properties that
allow you to fully control what's going
on in here then you can go with less
your page and there it goes with
animation right and you're looking at
the apartment 10 and you can look at
Department 20 and what I want you to
notice is that when I scroll through the
depower
outside of the variable range okay we
revert this back to oh yeah it's the
other way around the maximum is 70,000
and the minimum is 1 sorry I need to it
more carefully save compile reload all
right this should be better so what I
want you to notice is that when I browse
between departments I'm looking at the
employees of each one but look at the
page it doesn't do a full page refresh
what is being refreshed is only the
content in each one of the areas
this is Ajax behavior how much code did
I need to write for this nothing okay
this is out-of-the-box functionality
look at the table right now there's a
lot of Fey
Rose inhale and by the way the table is
very each I can take for example
first-name movie to be over the hill
then say for is that column and I can
scroll those like that okay and I can
unfreeze it or I can hide columns so
maybe I'm not interested in the email
column so I can just remove that one
it's all world ok what I want you to
notice on the table is I can scroll down
and if you look very carefully when I
scroll down in this area you'll see a
message popping up so score score score
message fetching data okay so what
happened here is I actually as I scroll
my page my set of records I'm bringing
more data to the browser as needed so
while in other frameworks and other
components if you have a table that
allows you to scroll it basically means
that I fetched all the million of
employees to the middle well and then to
the client with ADF we're doing it very
smartly we're doing range fetching okay
we're fetching only what is needed you
can actually control the size of the
range the default is 25 and as you
scroll down we bring more information to
the client okay the table also allows
you to do things like filter the table
so just give me employees with last name
starting it in M and you can see
everything is synchronized you get the
highlights on the graph okay you get
this opportunity here to increase the
salary as you want to does a date field
here so if you put in an invalid value
and you try to leave you get the
immediately validation with a red
highlight so this is actually
implemented using Java Script validation
on the client but again I didn't need to
write it all I needed to do was define
the format mask for the field which I
actually derived directly from my
preferences yeah so this is about what
five ten minutes of development and get
a full application and I forgot to show
you that you can actually switch the
order of the boxes around right and you
can get this for free let me show you
one more thing okay so you know the jsf
controller so the controller basically
allows you to define avocation between
pages what I'm going to show you is what
we do with a controller okay we switched
it from being called a page flow to
being called task flow and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
task flow I didn't give it a good name
but task flow definition that's a good
name and which is going to have two
pages on it okay so this is our visual
page flow diagram so you can take one
page another page put them on the
diagram and then connect them with a
line called this go maybe we need a
navigation breaks
we'll do a navigation back and call this
one back okay this is regular page flow
but if you look on the side you can see
that in our flows you can also have a
router which basically evaluate some
value and decide where to go based on
the result and maybe the result it means
that I need to invoke a method before I
go to a page so suddenly from just being
a page flow you're looking at the full
process flow okay
actually I'm not going to use a function
right now and outer I'm going to keep it
a simple flow so we're just going to
have two pages let's actually create the
pages now if you really like if you can
look very carefully this is actually the
extension is JSF F so it's not just a
regular JSF this is what we call a page
fragment so this is a page that can be
included in other pages and I'm going to
still use the department EJB that I
created I'm going to show you another
thing that ADF gives you out of the box
and this is queryable attribute so a
query component for an EJB so I'm
looking at departments and I'm just
going to create basically an area where
which will allow me to query the
department based on any of the fields
then in this okay I would want to
actually click on one of the departments
in the result go to the next page and
edit it so instead of having this as a
text field let's convert this one
convert to a link so this is another
like the navigation component basically
still wanted to show the value and in
terms of what it would do it will do the
go navigation so this is the navigation
for my page flow so once I click here it
would basically go to this page so on
this page what I want to do is I want to
show the departments and and allow
people to basically edit them in a phone
so I'll do a form and again don't need
all of those fields add a submit button
and maybe the submit button that I just
created now this one will go back so the
action would be back ok so this is a
very simple page flow
okay now what I want to do is I want to
actually include this flow in this page
right so you notice that I have three
boxes and the reason is because in the
third box what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the flow and drag and drop
it into hill and when I drop it you can
see that I can drop it either there's a
region of a dynamic region okay so right
now again because I'm doing just a basic
thing I'm just going to drop it as the
region okay and I'll explain what is a
dynamic region in a second but the idea
here is that I'm going to run this whole
flow of two pages in an area in my page
now because this is a complete flow
maybe I want to tell it you're kind of
independent from the containing flow so
you're not using the same set of data so
there's a property here called behavior
in terms of transaction and I'm going to
tell it you're not sharing the data
control with your parent okay so this is
an independent task flow running inside
this page and now I can do one okay say
I didn't need to do and I can just save
and compile anyway mmm
so I dot it as a region and this means
that in my page in that box there will
always be this area running this flow
okay I could have also dropped it as a
dynamic region which means that at
runtime
I can decide what is going to be
displayed in the third box and I can
change it at runtime based on anything
that I want to so this actually allows
you to create a much more effective
single page interface application where
you go into one page and the content of
what you're showing on the page and the
functionality changed based on what the
user does okay so as you can see I am
still like the application still works
as before but now in this area here I
have a quail component which allow me to
look up all the department that starts
with the letter M find one click on it
and go to edit mode where I can edit it
or go back it's not just a basic mode I
can also go into an advanced mode of a
query and say I need Department not that
start with them but
that the location is greater then I
don't know six 1600 can I get those
click on those get a new data and
everything runs inside an area in my
page and I can tell you that I can now
take the same thing and use it in
another application it packages up the
flow as a jar file which I can go and
use in other places all of this
everything that I showed you so far is
included in ADF essentials and available
for free going hold hands on GlassFish
works perfectly fine as I mentioned the
IDF has a bunch of other stuff beyond
that so the green stuff out what is way
if you want other stuff like mobile
development or development for office
and Microsoft Office they have one tenth
if you want access to our SOA suite then
you need those pods okay all right so we
about we have about 20 more minutes so
let's talk about what's new in say
developers so the current version of
JDeveloper is eleven one two three which
was released last week right when it's
our third eleven one two version that we
released this basically since June 2011
a few of the few of the new things
though I don't know if you're familiar
can now own Sun and Sam had an idea
called NetBeans and the NetBeans team is
actually reporting to the same guy that
will be proto and one thing you can now
sees as cooperating on staff so for
example one thing we introduced in
JDeveloper is we took the OSGi
infrastructure that they built enhanced
it a little bit and this is now part of
JDeveloper we did the same thing by the
way for the profilers we took up the
profiles for NetBeans and they are now
available inside JDeveloper ok this
release is actually focused on a lot of
performance improvement there's a new
look and feel a lot of wave a lot of
focus on usability as well and
enhancement across all the place a few
of the new three new features I
mentioned profilers ok so we have a new
memory profiler and a CPU profiler
we have integration we
GlassFish so directly from in JDeveloper
you can right-click on a project and
create an eel file the deploys into
glass fish okay you can do remote
debugging into glass fish if you want to
we now have support for maven as well so
that's another thing that we introduced
a couple of versions ago and a lot of
enhancement in the ADF space as well
some examples we spot Jess F to the Tona
with our components previously it was
Jess f12 - we have a visual skin edit
also I forgot to mention by the
application you built before can have a
completely different look and feel by
you're changing a CSS file so you can
actually skin all of our components and
we have a visual skin editor that allows
you to skin them in a night in an easy
way
I mentioned the touch gesture support
which is also new in the latest releases
and we introduced new components are
constantly adding more components so for
example we now have Matic map which
allows you to show a map
divided into regions and then color code
them or highlight them based on values
of something and it can be a world map
or with county map or various levels
over there okay we also do drag and drop
between flash and HTML for example
between the map and a table we can do
those type of things one other you think
that is actually still not production
but we're actually demoing it throughout
this week we actually have a hands-on
lab running at open-world about it
throughout the week there's one running
right now actually and there's another
one tomorrow is something called ADF
mobile so as you probably know there's a
lot of people now with smartphones and
tablets and they want to access their
enterprise application what we wanted to
do is we wanted to allow our developers
to build application to turn on mobile
devices but we didn't want to bother
teaching them how to write at the Xcode
level for iOS or at the whatever level
the Java level for Android okay we
wanted them to still work with the same
concept they have and not need to learn
specifics of the device
okay and so what we built is something
called a lady of mobile work lady of
mobile basically takes the same concepts
you should you've seen now and extends
them to a mobile device development to
create an application that actually
installs them lands on the device okay
so you build the application once and
you can run it either on Android or on
iOS you don't need to develop twice okay
the application if you need to write
logic in it you use Java same language
as the rest of idiot the way that you
build visually the application is using
components just like you build a just
application the way that you don't
avocation between pages a controller
just like you do tasks flows just like
you do in ADF so the idea is that anyone
who's an ADF develop Ellen was
developing with idea for the web now can
do it for mobile devices okay yeah let
me show you that so you can go and from
the same place that you created a new
fusion application you can also create a
new mobile application okay
same process call it a maybe before that
they call it something else you get two
projects like before okay and then in
the view controller project you can say
I need the new and then you go project
technologies mobile ADF mobile page okay
you can decide what you want to have on
your page something like that and you
get their code okay and again I don't
like code too much so I prefer to work
with the preview
so here's my little page sofa so in my
page you can see again from the
structure pain I have for example this
header level here I can go into the
properties and say this is my employee
employee application yeah there's a
button here that does something so I can
call this find ok and you can see that
there's an action here so if I have a
page flow okay I can create like a
navigation between few things so angle
here I can also create a task flow and I
can say my first page so I take my first
page put it here it calls another page
it looks familiar
yeah you saw the same thing like two
minutes ago right but now you're doing
it for a mobile device so that's the
idea and again maybe you need some logic
so maybe you have a new Java class and
I'll show you basically what the data
binding means I can take any Java class
let's create class one and create a
method here public string say a string
name right return hello hello plus name
so this class can do any logic that you
want as far as I'm concerned it can go
to an essay PC stem fetch data and get
me the result of an employee form as a
pillow
whatever once you do this you do the
same thing you did on an EJB okay you go
to your java class here's my java class
it is you right-click and you say create
data control just like you did for the
EJB okay you get the file created here
not interesting okay you go back to your
page okay
and now in the data control palette you
can actually see this class then you can
take the method called say hi and drag
and drop it into your page right like
that to create a parameter foam which
will allow you to pass the name and then
maybe you want to show the result on the
page
as an output text okay same thing as
developing web the one difference is
that over here beyond just your class
you also have device features so if you
need for example to find the contact or
get a picture we'll walk with the GPS on
your device will send an SMS you can do
this so you can take the SMS message and
basically drag and drop it into your
page to have a button that sends an SMS
to the person so you probably need to
then the body of the text right things
like that and then you can adjust it
instead of looking at Android maybe
you're targeting an iPad so you get
suddenly most basement so you can adjust
it so this is the basics of ADF mobile
and at the end of the day you go over
here and you say deploy the application
your deployment profile and you can
choose whether you're deploying to
Android or iOS same application runs on
both all right
yeah and beyond developing own device
content you can also bring in content
from remote services so you can actually
take the idea faces page that you built
before and incorporate it into this page
into the page that I just created and
combine them all into a hybrid
application and that's what ADF mobile
is it's a hybrid content application
okay so you can have local files
learning you can have remote content
coming in and you can have device
service integration okay visual
development we just show you that so
this side is kind of redundant
that's the overall architecture I'm not
sure if it's really interesting but what
happens is at the end of the day you get
our application lines inside the
container on the device so this is the
big box that you see here okay you use a
components to design your page you have
a controller everything is running on
inhale and it creates user interface
using html5 okay this is the interface
that you see on the device and you can
skim the
face using CSS again css3 if you need to
communicate we device services we use
PhoneGap and as you saw you don't
actually need to code PhoneGap we give
you it in drag-and-drop format mask a
format way right you can also have local
java code running on the device may be
accessing the local database if you want
to and it can also bring in content HTML
type of content from other location to
display work with resto a soap services
to get data into your application that's
the overall architecture and that's
basically all I had to show today and
actually demo went faster than expected
so the basic things to remember okay
J developers our development tool does
regular Java if you want to but it does
much more than that
ATF essential basically we took all the
capabilities all the core capabilities
that were built into ATF and it's now
available for you for free ok so even if
you're just interested in graphs that
can do animation take those components
for this if you really want to do more
productive development take the whole
JDeveloper n IDF together and you see
that the development experience is a
little different than what you probably
saw in other Java one sessions will do
it and that's about it if you want to
learn more we have a Twitter feed we
have a Facebook feed and we have a very
large community which right now actually
has an event at open hold so we can all
under and maybe catch the 5 last minutes
of having bills but if you look at our
Twitter and Facebook feeds not during
open world you will see that every day
there are more blogs and updates of
people sharing the experience using ADF
if you want to download this thing
follow tutorials just google JDeveloper
or google ADF or google ADF essentials
you'll get to a page where you can
download everything there's tutorial
step by step instructions you can try it
at home and this is the URL that you can
remember or tell that compression Jaidev
that's all I had to say any questions
yes
yeah yeah so you can actually in the in
the JDeveloper that is currently
production production you can do so need
to cancel here you can do file new and
is this the Maven yeah so you can create
a maven based application of a maven
based project and it creates all the
poem and stuff like that for you right
so let's get a maven application that's
for example and the structure is
basically the same it has the poem
created for you it synchronizes
libraries across the project and the
poem so yeah that's that's another new
thing that we added in the current
JDeveloper so it's production right yeah
any other questions yes
yes so that's another aspect of our
components and again what you need to
remember is that those components are
used for our enterprise application we
wouldn't be able to sell our
applications to the market if they
weren't a fully accessible so you can
actually use a screen reader on this
application the UI adjust to it em it
was support internalization so maybe you
have customers that need to walk in
Arabic we can automatically switch
everything to walk right to left
those are all built-in functions in idea
faces yes with what M not well actually
yes
so to JDeveloper there's an extension to
JDeveloper that we developed called TPC
in productivity Center when you bring it
in you have inside JDeveloper menus that
allow you to interact with JIRA Orbitz
Gizella
to track things and it also has
integration with Hudson so you can
actually track have some bills form
inside the ID so from the idea you can
actually see if your build was
successful or not and go over there we
have integration with j-unit as well we
tend if you want to yeah so that's
basically it all right thank you very
much if you liked what you saw just
share it with the other guys in the
other one right Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
