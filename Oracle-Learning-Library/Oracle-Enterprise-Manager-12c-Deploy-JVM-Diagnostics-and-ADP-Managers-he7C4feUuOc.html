welcome to the Oracle Enterprise Manager
Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
deploy the JVM diagnostics manager and
the ADP manager in enterprise manager
Cloud Control 12c application dependency
and performance or a DP and JVM
Diagnostics provide additional depth for
diagnosing problems and tuning
performance in Java and Oracle Fusion
Middleware applications both the adp and
JVM Diagnostics managers collect
additional deep-dive data using their
own agents from within the JVM of the
monitored application servers the data
is then made available for you to see an
enterprise manager from any page and
Enterprise Manager go to set up
middleware diagnostics from this page
you can deploy both ADP managers as well
as JVM diagnostics managers let's deploy
a JVM diagnostics manager by clicking
this link on this deployment page we
have two options we can create a managed
server and deploy the JVM diagnostics
manager to the new server or we can
deploy onto an existing managed server
if we choose to deploy onto an existing
managed server that server must exist
within the enterprise manager domain
let's create a new managed server the
host drop-down list shows hosts that
have OMS installed this is because you
can only deploy a JVM diagnostics
manager to a host where OMS exists in
this case there is only one host so
we'll accept that the managed server
name defaults to what you see here if a
managed server already exists with this
name the final number increments
automatically until it finds an unused
this is the first managed server will
accept the default likewise the default
managed server listen port will
increment automatically for that
particular host underneath the covers is
doing tests to see which ports are
available will accept the default for
that and also for the managed server SSL
listen port now let's complete the
credentials section we need two
credentials for deployment we need the
credentials for the host where the OMS
server is located this is so we can have
the e/m agent run the deployment job for
us and we also need the credentials for
the WebLogic domain itself to make the
underline w LST calls to create the
managed server or modify the existing
managed server let's expand this OMS
host credential section and will create
new credentials will enter the username
and the password now let's set the
WebLogic domain credentials and will
create new credentials well in to the
administrator username and the
administrator password now that we've
entered all the information we'll go
back to the top of the page and we'll
click this deploy button the job is
submitted and now we see this deployment
status page if we click this link here
we can see the status of the job on this
page you can see the prerequisite checks
are made to ensure that the ports are
open and available from the OEMs then it
creates the stage directory then it
coffees the JVM diagnostics manager and
starts the managed server let's refresh
the page and we can see the job
succeeded
now back on the middle way of
diagnostics page we can confirm that the
jvm Diagnostics manager was deployed we
can see that its status is up so we know
the OMS can talk to the manager so
that's it for deploying a jvm
diagnostics manager now we'll look at
deploying an adp manager from the middle
with Diagnostics page will select deploy
a VP manager on this deployment page you
have the two options to either create a
managed server or deploy onto an
existing managed server like with
deploying the jvm diagnostics manager
you can only create a managed server on
a host where OMS exists and if you're
going to deploy on an existing managed
server it must be a managed server
within the enterprise manager domain in
12 G the ADP manager runs inside the
weblogic managed servant let's create a
new managed server the host drop-down
list shows the hose that have OMS
installed in this case there is only one
host so we'll accept that the managed
server name defaults to what you see
here like with JVM Diagnostics manager
deployment the final number increments
automatically until it finds an unused
name as this is the first managed server
will accept the default and will accept
the default listen port and the default
SSL less important and for adp there's
also the adp manager registry port the
adp manager Java provider port and the
ADP manager controller port these
reports are also incremented according
to Oracle best practices the deployment
was it automatically checks that these
ports are open and available from the
OMS now let's complete the credentials
section here we need the same
credentials as the jvm diagnostics
manager we need the host credentials for
the weblogic administration server and
the credentials for their WebLogic
domain in order to log in so let's
create new credentials for the
administration server will enter the
username and the password now let's set
the WebLogic domain credentials or
select new and enter the administrator
username and the password now that we've
entered all the information we'll go
back to the top of the page and click
deploy the job is submitted and we now
see this deployment status page if we
click this link we can see the status of
the job here you see the job performs a
different operations necessary in order
to deploy and register the ADP manager
let's refresh the page in 11g
registration was a separate step but
here it is automated along with
deployment and you can see that the
status is succeeded so the ADP manager
has been deployed and registered back on
the middle weird diagnostics page we can
confirm that the ADP manager was
deployed we can see that the status is
up so we know that the OMS can talk to
the ADP manager so that's it for
deploying an ADP manager
after deploying the adp and JVM
diagnostics managers you need to refresh
the WebLogic domain where the managers
were deployed to do so from the domain
homepage go to the WebLogic domain menu
and select refresh WebLogic domain
