engagement and monitoring presents using
the dashboard summary to gain insight
here I'll show you how easy it is to
gain real-time insight into social media
conversations taking place among
consumers by using social engagement and
monitoring to get started go to the
listened and analyze tab and choose the
dashboard I'll expand our group and
select the topics that we are interested
in evaluating which in this case is Java
cloud and database cloud here is a
summary dashboard at the top is the
daily activity chart that shows the
total number of conversations about each
topic for the past 30 days and if you
want to look at say just the past week
you can easily change the date range by
typing the dates here or using this
slider this graph compares topics at any
point in time you can click on points in
the graph to see what is happening on a
particular day so let's take a look at
this downward spike in the conversations
in the themes detail pop-up you can
review individual messages to discover
what people are talking about however
with this much volume it's quicker and
easier to use themes to discover what
consumers are talking about so I'm going
to click on the themes tab to see the
top themes for the Day themes group
conversations by contextual meaning this
provides a quick and easy way to
understand what consumers are talking
about clicking on a theme shows you the
key terms used from the conversations
once I'm finished looking at the themes
I can close this out by clicking the X
on the shara voice chart you can see the
percentage of conversations each topic
received over the date range and you can
just click on the chart to see
conversations and themes for the
specific topics share a voice the
sentiment chart shows a negative neutral
and positive sentiment breakdown by
topic this is determined by the number
of positive or negative words a
conversation contains so for example if
a conversation contains the word love
then it adjusts for intensifiers such as
vary and negations such as not here we
can see that both topics have some
negative sentiment to understand why the
conversations were negative you can
click on the negative portion of the
chart to open the themes pop up to see
what was being talked about next let's
take a look at the content types the
content type chart breaks down each
topic by type so here you can see that
most conversations about both topics are
in blogs and micro blogs such as Twitter
and then message boards and again as
with any of these graphs you can click
on a portion of the graph to view the
actual conversations and view themes to
discover what consumers are talking
about on different social content types
finally if you want to save data from
any of the charts click the arrow next
to each chart and choose to save the
chart in various formats so that's how
easy it is to use social engagement and
monitoring to evaluate topics so you can
understand the social media
conversations that are taking place
among consumers please visit our
documentation at the URL listed and
visit the Oracle Learning Library for
more demos thank you
