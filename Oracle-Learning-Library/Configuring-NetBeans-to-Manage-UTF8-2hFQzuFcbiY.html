by Stacy David Thurston NetBeans is a
developer tool for programming and
managing text files however the default
installation does not handle utf-8 files
hence this video to show how to
configure it for utf-8 here's the steps
I'm going to go through the first one
being got a demo net means managing
utf-8 text files and properly I've
created a sample and what I'm going to
do is as open it here in my folder my
home on my computer today for today
folder NetBeans UTF double click it and
that's txt files are made to open in my
notepad plus plus window and as we can
see we have multiple languages here with
multiple character sets you have this
and what we're gonna do is open it up in
NetBeans so if I go to open it in
NetBeans the first thing I am is I'm
prompted that cannot safely be open
because the encoding isn't windows 12:52
you want open it anyway I say yes as we
can see the regular alphabet a PA to Z
alphabet is characters are fine
however the others aren't as they are
here so I'm just gonna so what I'm gonna
do is if I edit this so I'm just gonna
put do a little editing here edit and I
do a save ok and I close it I reopen it
and I can see the edit is but the
characters do not look correct if I go
here into notepad plus plus I can see
need to reload it I reload it and we can
see the characters are messed up some of
them have stayed that she's the same the
Chinese is fine some of these others but
it's still it's just not right
next I'll demo notepad plus plus
displaying and editing utf-8 files
properly notepad plus handles utf-8
files fine so if I open it up here
concede that it was it's not it's no
longer good from from that means so what
I'm gonna do is just I have a copy here
of it I'm gonna go back to here and
replace it so it's now back to normal
and I'm gonna close it open it up again
we can see it looks fine I'm gonna do
some editing as I did before save it and
then what I'm gonna do is close it yeah
I'm gonna reopen it then it all looks
fine and this is what we want to happen
in NetBeans now I'm going to configure
NetBeans to manage utf-8 text files okay
now I'm going to configure the NetBeans
by configuring the NetBeans
configuration file so that NetBeans can
manage utf-8 files now to do this I need
an editor which runs as administrator
I'm on Windows 7 here would be the same
as in Windows 10 you need to run the
utility as administrator so I'm starting
my notepad plus my C Drive Program Files
that being one etc' file and there's my
NetBeans config file I'm going to open
up I've linked it to that config files
will open up in my notepad plus and here
is my NetBeans configuration file and
I'm going to scroll down and to my
NetBeans default options and what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna option now this
option I had already typed in as a
learner's experience just makes it
quicker so I've pre-typed that in so
there's my new vowel that value like my
new option which is the encoding for
utf-8 files so I'm going to do a save
and because I'm running as administrator
it saves just fine and the config files
now update and finally I'm going to
confirm that NetBeans does display and
edit utf-8 files properly
start it smell starting starting up and
this time we should see that it's going
to handle the utf-8 so what I'm going to
do is open up my working example here
and here we can see it is that it's
opened it up and it's now visible and
I'm gonna remove my editing here just to
show that now it's edited save it close
it go back here and if I was in here I
can open it up with with this yes and I
can see that the editing from NetBeans
is working fine open it up again edit
again you can always cut and paste
something that the Japanese for though
which works fine save it close it open
it up again and the editing still there
there we have that one we've done it
we've configured you NetBeans to now
work with utf-8 files that concludes the
video using net needs to manage utf-8
text files by Stacy and David Thurston
