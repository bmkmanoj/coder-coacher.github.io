memory and this the problems associated
with huge pages huge pages in Linux are
extremely important to use the more my
team actually actually looks at the
systems built without using huge pages
we're more convinced that you must use
huge pages and we do appreciate that
they're difficult to configure they take
a bit of time a little bit of planning
and strategizing and figuring how much
memory you want to allocate to huge
pages and then you have to reboot the
systems actually to get the huge memory
page memory but you know in reality
we're just finding that the systems are
better behaved more stable more
predictable this in itself warrants the
use of using huge pages a lot of people
ask me what what are linux huge pages
well conventional pages and Linux
they're actually quite small and what
actually happens is is that share memory
region of your s SGA is becoming an ever
increasing piece of memory and when they
user process connects to the SGA they
have to map between their virtual
address space and the physical memory
which is where the shared memory is
actually located and this mapping set of
entries or often called tlbs
are pieces of memory that are taken out
of the Linux kernel now if the pages are
quite small you can imagine the number
of these entries is quite massive and
they occupy quite a bit of memory
themselves now the whole concept of huge
pages this make the page bigger so you
actually have less TLB entries and see
you allocate less memory to TLB
in trees and so you can actually
basically map in the SGA without doing
as much work in the Linux kernel and
taking the lesser Linux kernel memory
and whilst this seems all very
complicated in very computer science he
like it's actually not that difficult to
understand when you sit down with the
mechanics of it but rather than sort of
give you a lecture on basics of the
Linux memory we just actually would like
to show the impact on systems that have
been configured with huge pages and
those that have been configured without
huge pages so you can see the
pathological race conditions and like
many real-world performance demos that
you're able to see we built this demo
it's because we kept on seeing it and we
didn't like to get on conference calls
isn't completely explain to people why
they should do it it became a debatable
item as far as real-world performance is
concerned huge pages should be used at
all times
hopefully these demos will help explain
it to you
and understand what goes on when you run
out of memory on Linux and perhaps you
know we can educate you and perhaps we
can save you from taking a system outage
okay so on the demo here we can see we
have two systems one built with huge
pages and one built with conventional
pages and what we've done is break up
the memory regions in these middle
sectors where we've seen the pink and
the green stripes to give you an
indication of where the memory has been
allocated now I've just increased the
connections to nearly three thousand
four hundred on both systems and the
thing to notice is that whilst on the on
the huge pages there's been an increase
in the pink area amount of memory
allocated by the process space there's
still a certain amount of free memory on
the system now when I do conventional I
haven't used huge pages you'll know that
you'll see the notice the bump in the
pink
but we'll also see another bump in this
green area and those are these page
tables translation pages I spoke about
earlier and the memory being allocated
inside the Linux kernel associated with
those things those pages now the other
thing to also learn about is we don't
allocate those entries until the shared
memory is being referenced
so just connecting all the people to the
database will not necessary allocate all
those entries they have to connect to
the database and start doing work so as
you'll notice that as we run this
workload the amount of free memory is
diminishing and diminishing all the time
and this area of thick ever becoming
thicker green line so when I started and
had all the connections in the page
tables was thirteen point seven
gigabytes now at this point in time it's
got 227 gigabytes and it's
ever-increasing so if we actually have
to look at the conventional memory model
and we see how much memory is free well
notice the amount of memory free is
dropping all the time we're not seeing
that on the huge page case it's just
sitting there statically okay and at
this point in time you'll notice that
we're eating memory and we're down to
about 1.2 gigabytes of free memory now I
know in about a second
at this point in time we're going to
trigger a point where we run into memory
starvation and at this point in time the
Linux page daemon is likely to wake up
and start having to swap the pieces of
memory out and we'll see this manifested
in a format that basically we start to
see the performance degrading and we're
starting to see this but the pink light
with the system degrading to the point
that the performance almost dies but you
notice we're still keeping the CPU busy
and it's starting to race as the page
daemon does some work and now we were
starting to get into a stable
instability where suddenly it's
reclaiming memory and suddenly and it's
able to run a bit and then it runs out
of memory
the page stinking grows crazy the
throughput drops and it's unable to rain
we're in an unstable situation we can
see this w-shaped curve up here where
the system is bouncing between stability
and instability and the more it runs the
more page table entries we take and then
it renders it out of stable then the
page demon keep the kicks in and tries
to claim back more memory so you can see
that we're bouncing between stability
and instability all the time and to the
point that the throughput sometimes is
zero and sometimes it's not zero but
this is what happens when we run out of
memory on Linux sometimes it's more
pathological and if I was to actually
increase the number of user processes at
just a little bit more I probably could
get to the state where it would
continually swapping memory out and
we've driven the system into the ground
at this point in time interesting to
note that the huge page case has hardly
changed at all there's very little
change on the huge pages it just remains
stable and now we've driven the system
completely into the ground and then it's
reflate it's got back to a 1 gigabyte
memory and it's coming back to life
again likewise I can remove a few
processes
and free up a lot of memory and the
listen area the performance comes back
the problem is is we just cannot predict
when things are going to go stable or
unstable when we run out of memory and
so if on your Linux systems you're
getting periods we've got a large number
of connections a large SGA and then the
system just periodically appears to just
stall you're probably running out of
memory and it's starting to swap and
then it may recover itself and then the
system looks great
but you can't predict when it takes
place the other thing is just connecting
to the database doesn't necessarily mean
we'll take the memory we have to touch
to start touching enough pages to take
it out so dropping the process count in
this place I've freed up the system and
now we're nearly at 7 gigabytes free
memory by itself but we're still
continuing to eat memory even though we
freed up memory and it will continue to
eat it as these processes are running
you see it started to diminish again and
again I can literally add a few thousand
process a few hundred processes again
which will cause the memory to get
allocated again you can see the thin
green line that we freed up the memory
here will be diminishing very very
rapidly and we cannot with system over
again down to three point four gigabytes
of memory rapidly falling again 3.2
three
we've killed it again you succeed we can
just literally run out of memory and the
erratic nurse at the pink line and the
spike in the pink CP you can see that
the page demon is coming in trying to
free up memory and we're seeing memory
getting freed up and then the
performance comes back and then because
the performance comes back we touch more
pages and then the page dealer has to
keep back in again
