third of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle yet in this part you'll learn
about Jets built-in accessibility
features for persons with disabilities
jet components have built-in
accessibility support that conforms with
the web content accessibility guidelines
version 2.0 at the AAA level wcag 2.0
AAA which is developed by the World Wide
Web Consortium w3c accessibility
involves making your application usable
for persons with disabilities such as
low vision or blindness deafness or
other physical limitations this means
for example creating applications that
can be used without a mouse used with
assistive technologies such as screen
readers and screen magnifiers and used
without reliance on sound color
animation or timing jet components
provides support for keyboard and touch
navigation zoom screenreader rows and
names sufficient color contrast the
first point jet components follow the
web accessibility initiative accessible
rich internet applications why area
authoring practices the API
documentation for each Oracle jet
component lists its keyboard and touch
end-user information when applicable
including a few deviations from the Y
area guidelines jet supports browser
zooming up to 200% for example on the
firefox browser you can choose view zoom
and zoom in for screen readers jet
supports screen readers by generating
content that complies with wide area
standards and no special mode is needed
jet component rows and names each jet
component has an appropriate role such
as button link and so on and each
component supports an Associated name or
label if
lickable finally jet provides the elta
theme which is designed to provide a
luminosity contrast ratio of at least
four point five to one jet components
are designed to generate content that
conforms to the wcag 2.0 AAA standard in
most cases you don't need to do anything
to add accessibility to the jet
component since its built-in
to the component however there are some
components where you may need to supply
a label or other property for these
components the components API
documentation contains an accessibility
section that provides the information
you need to ensure the components
accessibility content generated budget
is designed to conform to the wcag 2.0
AAA standards however many standards are
not under the complete control of judge
such as overall UI consistency the use
of color the quality of on-screen text
and instructions and so on a complete
product development plan that addresses
accessibility should include proper UI
design coding and testing with an array
of tools assistive technologies and
disabled users why area Landmarks
provide navigational information to
assistive technology users landmark
roles identify the purpose of a page
region and allow the user to navigate
directly to a desired region without
landmarks assistive technology users
must use the tab key to navigate through
a page for configure in high contrast
mode high contrast mode is for people
who require a very high level of
contrast in order to distinguish
components on the page for hiding the
screen reader content sometimes you want
to have some text on the page that is
read to the screen reader user but that
the sighted user doesn't see in this
part you have been introduced to the jet
built-in accessibility features for
persons with disabilities for your
homework for this part select a few
different components from the cookbook
and read the jazz docs to get a better
understanding of how keyboard touch and
gesture support is provided for each
component</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
