talk to you about contemporary user
interface design patterns implemented in
Java effects to dot 2 so how many of you
are javafx developers or half years you
can raise your hands are you beginners
okay okay so at least I know well my
standard is ok so I'm Peter program I
developed software for a living I live
obviously in London I normally work for
financial services right now I am an
independent contractor working for
various banks and 0 in a city of london
a job a champion are being developing
software since in java especially since
1998 in since it was cool java 1.1 and
then we from applets then to the server
side to the eee side and then kept going
with the e side but i've always had this
fantastic interest in user interfaces
and that comes back from developing
before then in games and even turbo
pascal and doing 3d style who remembers
terrible pasco anybody yes who remembers
year I never could cry afford that amiga
audio at Atari ST so in Britain we had
something called the BBC model B but the
BBC microcomputer and assembler 6502 and
that's my claim to fame so this is
design patent I guess you are all
software developers you know about
design patterns in in terms of software
you know it's a common means to solve
problems and and christopher alexandra
so just in case we do have some absolute
beginners in the place design patterns
is these this is the guy who invented
the idea of patterns as I had a book or
patent lie language which was to do with
architecture and building and he came up
with some timeless ways of building
architecting and of course and in the
90s we've had the Gang of Four the
famous Gang of Four Erich gamma Richard
helm Ralph Johnston and recently
Jonathan I can't even say his name
properly do does anyone I'd spell his
name I was getting getting wrong such an
hour respect his that by letting you
reader and so design patent sinister
classic idea of object-oriented program
architectures and and the like and
believe it or not the this idea of
patterns also is valid for presentations
someone's that which in the book about
design patterns for presentations and so
good this is about user interface design
so utility interface design also has its
notion of visual metaphors and it's
about I would say less about rounded
corners and getting your application to
look like a bookcase in its
controversial yeah it's about concrete
application let's first start and your
pattern in as well as has to be valid of
course it's about products not processes
and it's not about one single user
interface element like a button it's how
you combine these elements together and
the stuff behind the scenes like a tight
accepting event which goes to make up to
make up a visual method
or pattern and we just like a singleton
in the software context it it does not
make one single pattern does not make
your software application of course you
get businesses that tell you that one
too they think they're agile and you
know really great because you're using a
singleton pattern or a tomato patterning
of course that does he does not compute
and some would have a question there was
guy about ways in his hand and of course
that doesn't compute the idea of visual
design patterns is you know to solve a
problem functionally for the user so I
have some design patterns that I
implemented in Java effects to dot two
and they consist of yeah really an
attempt to develop some of these you to
interface patterns and and I realized
now that I'm missing a slide of of all
the visual patterns which I will have on
my blog when i published the slides
denied so this is so there's some of the
visual design patterns to our like
accordion like saving real estate I
should really describe them I can't
really walk around but there there's
things to do with event import
organizing how you lay out your display
organizing how you accept and display
and visualize data and so forth so I'm
graded the system upgraded these Java
effects these design patterns and how
I've implemented them in javafx if they
are moderately easy to implement that
means that you can make the jump since
many of you raised your hands
dolphin affects it beginners you should
be able to do this quite easily and you
have the advanced difficulty here which
will would take you a bit longer to you
need to be able to understand a bit more
about the framework in or not in order
to solve or implement a design pattern
and then there's what ones that are
super tough and the only person who can
well I could solve them obviously then
and there's a probably hand solar he
could solve some of those or Steven gin
so again it could solve solve those
problems so the first design pattern is
a data tip and a data tip is what you
see in Google Finance which is
displaying a lot of graphs and you have
a sort of two tips and it shows you
numerical information that you would
like to display or to show to the user
so it's a way of saving real estate and
this is a obviously a visual metaphor so
what you must do to complete this
pattern just like you in a singleton say
if someone exposes the constructor as
public then you know it's wrong the
pattern has been wrongly implemented so
in the visual metaphor you need to be
able to show that data or the the data
behind the data point that is being
displayed so I can understand that many
of you are software engineers is it
should have are there any designers here
okay one or two so I'm being tested so
right so as software developers you
probably in are going to be almost
certainly going to be working with two
people either the business
who probably don't know exactly what
they want in terms of design but you're
the get go to girl or guy that has to
implement this in Java effects and so so
your data tip it's used to show data in
graph format or it could be something
else in your imagination or something
like geolocation and a map and it
generally allows the user to quickly
posso ver or hover over that data point
and then should show that data so as you
imagine you save a lot of real estate
and reduces the cognitive load and of
people who are going to look at this
into interface that you as java effects
developers are writing and if you have a
complicated set of data and you want to
display that it is there's a
psychological impact in how much you can
process so if you present it all at once
with all the numbers if your data points
contains wiens of data then that may not
be the best way to do it so in javafx
yeah when I fought about this
presentation I was in two minds how I
could present it should it be technical
and or design orientated so this the the
actual gist of this presentation should
be from your point of view as being
sympathetic to what you would what you
would have to do is in order to fulfill
one of these design patterns so I for
the benefit of the recording our switch
to has the IDE the code
and the first one I will run a school
day 2 tip demo
so this is an application that displays
data of the UK united kingdom met office
in a meteorology office weather data as
you can see you know this is showing how
JavaFX hovers over you can the intercept
mouse events over the individual nodes
of a chart component and as I'm hovering
going and the mouse event is entering
and exiting those knows a data tip it's
being visibly shown as and so therefore
it fulfills the design pattern and i
were to the rise here so what you see
around underneath is a line chart and
you could use a pie chart any sort of
data chart in in effect it could even be
map data if you are implementing your
own component so it's really
straightforward to implement this sort
of thing in java effects you just look
at the on have to understand the event
handler and and how those things how how
to intercept events from and listen to
events from components so if I squeeze
some of that down needs to demo the key
method to display data
it's dis event to handle here I'm shine
which is you sorry for each data point
in your XY chart and and you can have
pie charts or historic scatter charts
whatever chance they are you add a vent
handler so from this is a slightly
different methods on from the if you
were the tutorial yesterday so you can
we add event handler you can add more
than one mouse event you can add a
serious event in it and java effects we
will call your events in sequence so you
from the event have that you can
obviously receive the yeah two
coordinates as you see here from the
scene graph and then display a tip they
display your data tip and the other
thing I have implemented is a custom
component and and a good tip here for if
you are implementing costing component
its doors have a demo it shows so the
demo tip displays takes a label and a
shape and so we've Jonathan effects were
in order to implement that bubble or
that speech mark it's a combination of a
rectangle and a polygon and so you can
make another shape by taking one shape
the first shape and making a union of
the second chain which is really quite
useful so and therefore you can overall
I haven't shown it here you can get
create clouds or anything you like of
course the the animation
is activated inside that in that inside
the data tip component so this is just
one way of implementing the data tip so
question yes the answer is yes no so
note the idea that's the actual wrong
answer that I gave there so what you
what you do is yes I did actually and
because i'm confused in two different at
that so there's no performance concern
because each data point is a is a node
in the scene graph so it is what was
your use case yeah okay yeah and so you
okay so are there any more questions
okay so I go back to the presentation so
the next design pattern is
straightforward it shows a data is
called the data spotlight and it shows
it's a design pattern to show numerical
information just like the original the
previous one and as the user roles his
mouse or touches a data item and the you
also then want to fade out the
surrounding elements oh it's some if you
have a data point like thousands of them
you may want to get the user to focus on
a particular node or point in the so
this is a design pattern which is then
used to
a reveal obscured information when it's
really hard to do some dis ambient
individual sets the graph points and and
really complicated structures so and
this is and it provides a affordance I
sort of a way for users to explore that
data so if you have thousands of points
and then in the actual professional
application you can show that give that
user the twice tend to display or
navigate and with understand what is
going on with with his or her data so
let's go back to the slide to the code
and I will run this demo so that's
exactly what it does so as you are
hovering over the note not only is your
are you getting a highlight but the
other grass in the background layer of a
line charts actually disappearing and it
hurt so there's ways and there are many
more ways this is a simple example to
the ease without making it so fancy and
so complicated that the developers won't
big will find it difficult to understand
and the coder understand so I'll make
the code also available and from on my
blog and the way this example works it's
almost the same code be behind it and
the almost code is almost exactly the
same it's that where we have a couple of
extra methods here to fade in and out
serious the series of data the other set
of data which is not being hovered over
so and for each for a line chart the
data is organized how perhaps didn't
quite explain this in javafx first since
you're new to chart the line chart it
sets a series of data points so each a
data point is in a structure core in a
class corner XY chart serious you
instantiate that and then you can set a
name to it and as you're iterating or
building your data strap structure from
the database you add your data points
one by one and I've got some various
things and honored to convenience
functions to do mapping virtual data
points
le let's see strings and the data point
is a map collection of a map collection
of strings so I'm reading a rubber data
that wing and then converting that to a
map collection of string to a number
which is obviously displaying the month
say like April to the actual temperature
so you have like map collection and so
and then once the data tip i'm using the
same class the data tip class yeah once
I've hovered over record added a change
listener to the data point where would I
have it okay a mouse handle up to the
data point then I can fade out the other
serious and then once i have if i press
a mouse button or anywhere else indeed
any any other node in the chart then i
fade the the other serious the all the
series of data points back into view and
of course javafx has this notion alder
the scene graph nodes have this above
okay sitting so okay back to the
presentation
okay so this is how this is really
explains this this is source code that
explains how to fade out to apply to
create a fade transition toward the
nodes in a series and then get it to
fade out from one to zero so alternative
view and you have you definitely seen
alternative view in google maps where
you can look at you can look at street
or satellite or a hybrid view and of
course there's a we all know there's a
couple of things happening with IRS maps
and you've what you've definitely seen
the alternative view in powerpoint or or
or whatever word processor you like
which you gives you the outline view and
so that's really straight for to
implement in java effects as well well
if you have your data yet the only
difficulty is is when you have a
business requirement which requires you
to implement a specific type of you so
which may be an outline view it might be
something more complicated so i would
catalyze this design pattern as a
moderate plus on the for java effects
and and sometimes you may have come
across a situation where you have to
business requirements and and from two
different managers for example and you
want hey how can i solve this issue and
you can give them this idea to well
perhaps we can have the best of both
words i'll implement both your designs
and give you your both your views and
i'll make a tab pain or two bar which
shows you view number one view number
two so so what I'm going to show you
when i switch to the size is
something called a heat map which I
created as an example of an alternative
view again using the UK revered enter
and as you can see this view is using
the data tip but in a different way and
Jessie and you're getting a different
view on the right hand side so a simple
manner of heat map it could be something
completely different like a graph or
three whatever data there is that and so
heat map is a simple class to show which
has a grid of row column rectangles and
a function called a spectral color value
and interface that the developer must
implement and it could be anything so
this is the function that you would do
for your own data set so you would
provide some mapping function that gives
you a different view of the data and but
keep the same data as it is read for
mongodb or the database or whatever
database you have so it's generally a
map in exercise and then mapping that to
a a view that you probably will design
so if I go back to the presentation
so this is a very this is a tougher one
and it's called movable panel and I
should have and so it's about giving a
lounder user to have a range information
in sorry about that right and their
information you typically typically have
a porter application or news aggregator
and you want to give their a degree of
freedom so there you actually give
flexibility to the users it's a sort of
stick ability that business managers
always say they want and so you you put
your the content into boxes or viewable
frames and allow the user to personalize
a very good example of this what is
obviously porter applications and google
the I google website and various other
things to customize so this I get I
graded this as a super tough because
it's really not for beginners this you
really need to know understand a little
bit more about Java affects how to
layout children how to layout component
C and it depends also on the type of
layout that your business requires is
this a it's a nice way is an easy way to
do it to implement this which would be
to just allow users to drag knows all
over the place and then save the
positions but then if you then want to
then constrain users into vertical row
or or columns then a little bit more
forties required and how you implement
your layout our girlfriends and yeah so
that's the why of it and provides the
users a degree of power configurability
and managers and businesses love it
because it drives engagement it's this
stickability so it's a nice to have if
you have somebody implements it for you
but typically you you have to implement
some or customize someone else's code to
get exactly what you are required for oh
yes so drive engagement tool application
satisficing Oh satisficing and satisfies
them is a amalgam amalgam of satisfy and
sacrificing something it's a it's
basically what it means is that if you
think about it you so if you go to you
want to learn Java fixed and your I just
want to do my job actually I don't want
to know the exact details of how to of
the how it was created i don't care if
it's created by christopher Olivia I
just want to get and do my job so you
sacrifice detail in order to satisfy the
user so I'm going to drop straight to
what there was one more slide I should
do things it this is why this is super
tough because it has it implements a
region pain it's a control and there are
four sub classes there's a abstract
window frame container so this is a
window frame border class so you can
drag the content around there's a
draggable hint frameborder class and you
have this implementation of dragging
wind
frames around and also animation the
ability to maximize window and also
minimize the window and so you can
already visually see what's going to be
implemented if you've seen this
thousands of times before so and so
let's go straight to the IDE I almost
had it there right did behave okay okay
movable panel and again this is
something I showed last year it could be
you can drag components around so each
of these window frames containing a
resizable image component and you can
drag your content around and it's just
enough to fulfill the design pattern so
if I keep dragging and explaining to
fully implement this design pattern
weird require the ability to close the
content and also to resize dynamically
but you can maximize one component and
then you can't obviously cannot drive
bracket anymore I'm trying to drag it
with the mouse and so that's being
blocked and then I can minimize that
component again
and so did the animation as you can see
is happening and if I try and drag
things off it springs back yeah and so
you know you can see design pattern are
not necessarily about rounded corners or
physics or athletics that it only helps
you first have to understand the thing
that you're trying to achieve and does
it solve the actual business
requirements that a user demands it's
all about the user if the user once this
if it helps in how they organize their
work then yeah we're all winners here
and it's I said that I graded this as
super tough and the reason is is that
let me overall the demo is quite short
let me close all of us here okay I've
closed them all okay think about this
movable panel implementation is quite
long however compared to developing
something like this in swing it's it's
bit easier it's a lot easier to do that
with something I've broken something
here because now longer are they ago so
you have a net skip the structure up
because then it's easier again using
visualization it's easier to see okay so
that makes it easier so look at or the
methods so first thing you have created
a window frame event so you allow to
create your own custom events in java
effects
and so that's that one over there window
frame event and so that this is I'm
going to put the code I'm going to put
the code all up on my blog so you'll be
able to study so there's two sorts of
events one to minimize and one to
maximize so this that's the window frame
event class then I have a frame border
and but before and that is my F abstract
class and so it's a nested region class
type of region a container and then I
actually don't have my window frame
border class which implements the that
shall frame around my child and then I
have the drop hint frame border which
uses in line styling don't do this and
yeah it's a great for demonstrating the
design pattern but if you really want to
do it properly yeah everyone should
prefer to do CSS or Java X CSS styles
and so of course it's yet is there's a
bug in the CSS I discovered so I had to
specify the text field twice or that the
field twice yes so I wondered why that
wasn't working so it obviously I guess
it gave the green and dash border yeah
so the rest of it you probably don't
really need to know you can study on
your own behalf and so there's a whole
heap of event listeners and I think to
write this you you need to write this
properly to get started it would take
her about five days probably would take
Garrett three days ways to it took to do
the kind of things five days of work
five hours a day and with T brains
and to get things organized and rights
and then there are things that that
obviously help you finding the drops out
and so as things I've been dragged
around yawn you'll find that events
mouse events have the XY position to
coordinate positions of the note so you
can drag the mouse inside that wet tango
or the boundary of the node but handily
enough you can get where the scene put
coordinates which is the coordinates in
your scene and I wish Java effects
allowed a way of getting the coordinates
of an arbitrary pair one of my note so
if I have a parent and the parent I wish
there was a way of doing it easily I
probably you can do it by computations
and probably that's probably too much
implementation detail there is there
anything so this all sorts of things in
Java effects there that that to be aware
of for you can for each node can take a
bit of user data so you but the user can
also use that data for itself like the
developer could if you're right in a
proper library container you probably
don't want to use that so this is the
reason why I created other components
such as the window frame border and did
some refactoring in classes so I can
get different position so obviously
you've got the RO position and column
positions of where your component is in
the in your layout and of course the
obvious implementation of the movable
panel is to allow the user to lay out
exactly where they want to do but if
you've got a constraint layout system
and there can't be any overlapping of
components then you need to come up with
an algorithm depending on your business
requirements you can always tell your
manager I just don't know how to do that
and that's open but I don't think I'd be
quite happy this is exactly how it
should operate and you should do this
and ok as so to a couple more things for
each yeah if you've done of any user
interface development you probably want
to know what's the width and height of
my child so javafx has a mythical layout
children and I'm be and what before a
layout posts or a layout call is push
through from the SDK it will you can
tell the pier when it was asking you
what size you want to be what your
preferred side is so if you have a if
you'll be managed by yourself then you
owe it to do this calculations and so
that you complain nicely in the Java
effects well just like and that's the
same thing in in Windows or any other
user interface graph
skip that and so great javafx has a
couple of methods that are very useful
to implement compute preferred height
and compute ferd with and so I'm storing
values in the cache is what happens
sometimes in Java effects you get a lot
of weak crest layout events because
people that things have been moved
around or something's been animated so
you don't want to keep asking the same
children if they never change size just
store that store that information okay
so that is why I call it implementation
tough it requires a bit more knowledge
of Java offense a bit more experience
and but you can do it and so you can
learn by just looking at the code and
yeah I'm happy to answer questions ok so
that was the most that was the toughest
one chance on the time ok I will finish
this up quickly and ok so the next one I
call is a broadcast media well national
broadcast media and it's obviously allow
the people to this is a design pattern
that everybody knows it's you push the
button and you play video or audio and
there's thousands of these things in on
the internet for flash and there is a
dutch guy can't remember his name JW
Gervin or something like that he made a
fortune selling his and flash player
which is and which is why I've said this
is advanced conceptually if you go to
the javafx website download ian sambal
there's a media player in there and it's
the code is short but then there are
things that your customers may want or
you may want so
so the media player is obviously to
display a title and a duration of your
media player and then optionally if you
want to scrub or allow the user to
control the timeline then things can get
sticky there whereas in team as I said
in this in the slide business they
Sunday one immediate play thankfully
Java effects plays great media h.264 fov
mp4 MPEG fours and as you know you may
have focus on evil crime minute so now
need to provide some journalistic
function and and then you may have a
business where well the users are a more
visual you're taking care of that of a
psychological side of the users
experienced user experiments so they
like looking at information barber and
reading reams of documentation ok so
I've called this the national media
player because the standard things
thankfully that the Java effects team
have provided so they prefer already
provide a media class and which contains
young your media a media view which is
the view this to seeing graph node and a
media player which is the thing that
plays them near the media player so and
then there's how then do you implement
this what kind of media player do you
you can have endless arguments no can I
should there be a stop button now if
it's just pausing what do i do what
should we do and and then what kind of
slide control do you want dual slider
single slider and what how things should
fade in and out so this is the final
implementation and obviously and switch
to the IDE
I
so
I'm not going to touch the button here
so for one that's gone so as I'm moving
the mouse over and over that player the
controls fall away and and again this is
incomplete because when you look at that
what is it so maybe there's a design
discussion to say maybe we should have
an hour or some kind of reference a hint
that is a media player here maybe it
should fade in announced again it's not
about rounded corners it's about giving
that user the information he needs to
complete their job which is obviously
here watching content but it could be
market trade data for a trader as to
trader suddenly opens this screen and he
just says the blank and does not have
the visual hint then what does he do is
Misty's you know stock if I goes to some
other competitor so it's very quite yeah
a little subtle mistake in
implementation can make a great deal so
as I move the mouse over and obviously
this is an implementation of a national
broadcast player sort that is available
in the UK and it looks sort of like
their player so my jewel staite buttons
function as when the background color
changes so they're actually this jewel
staite button is actually two images
which i created in Photoshop than the
background was transparent and it's a
simple triangle and the strokes they if
you've used Photoshop anybody use
Photoshop here a bit yes so you do not
already know then
how to implement some of the images
again I should just play so why was it
described it so this is james gosling at
the Silicon Valley roundup I'm in 2010
so and this is Java effects this is what
it's all about this is why i am pleased
i'm digressing hear that you know why
I've lost a player yes I have its back
why I'm pleased it's going to be part of
the why is part of the JDK from seven up
and well so to a few things here in the
implementation I there is there are a
couple of classes so if you keep the
mouse button in the bottom region then
the transition never happens and again
this is a design discussion this is why
I call it from advance to super tough
because you can go round and round in
circles so can anyone see things that
are missing in this media player there
there's no volume control things that
for instance there's no maximize yes the
maximizes there that's strange it
definitely works when in when it's in
non projector mode and it can play the
question is about you know multi-core
what can we do about it what's the right
thing to do with job and then you can do
that get up
mexi I'm the media well that's the
design question how far do you go
because there's thousands of things for
lots of skins on the internet is then
you start with a simple media player and
you add that dynamic content and what
happens if you're streaming and stuff
and of course it works and that's this
that's I'll turn the voice down browser
so out of full screen it's no problem at
all and of course I just loved the
scrubbing the only thing that's missing
for those who love video editors and
Premiere Elements is the scrubbing noise
where you could really go yeah we're
really on that sort of thing that'd be
fantastic then the job will be complete
and am so so so I get out of that and
talk you through some code we get rid of
structure get with the structure so at
the moment is quite simple there there's
a Time Shift let me fire at the time
shift demo because that is a skinnable
component so this is a Timeship demo so
this is I could have implemented this in
using the slider control but I wanted my
own look and feel their so this is this
is also a design decision whether the
actual control is sufficient for you in
Java effect so you can take something
from JFX extras and customizing question
no okay and and then they are ok they
are doing
so there's a in this class package
there's the book out player you this the
demo the deuce take button is simply
taken to images and just displaying it
on on an off state this the time shift
ctrl + sorry and this is not long at all
the actual broad class player is not
long at all inside just 500 lines of
code and the demo code it is generally
that and the actual player exposes the
property for full screen you just for a
listener on it and you work out how big
your screen this this is one way to do
and there's another way to do it which
is to throw up a new stage and then move
your component unpair into making an
orphan temporarily and then move it to
the new stage and then once you've
detected a closed events on on your
stage above move that parent and we
parent it these are all ways and means
so generally I go back to the
presentation and finish up this so let's
go so implementation details and what to
look at out for so as I said before
prefer the SDK methods there really are
your friends and to layout component
especially a few implementing custom
components so in region which is the
most common parent or the most there is
a layout in area and and positioning
area I tend to use the methods in node
that evidencing node has but doesn't
know sometimes don't doesn't obey not
every node in javafx is resizable but my
but every node is relocatable so you can
position things even if they are not
resizable and java effects understand
java facts events event handlers are the
handlers that actually consume events in
the way effects of events works they
bubble up bubble down rather to the node
that is the furthest away from the event
source event filters are handed lestat
can intercept and and decide to Eva
consumer event so that might be useful
to prevent event traveling to a node
especially fish under under animation so
and if you're dragging nose and as in
the nose around prefer to move the nose
through translation and once the
translation is done you can capture the
translation coordinates and then put
them into layout Corday so it's a bit of
learning to do so javafx has nodes have
two different coordinate systems there's
the coordinate system or in translations
which is the position and there's also
another coordinate system for layouts
and the two of them combined so so you
what that means is that if you translate
a node and keep the layout the same then
you can get a bouncing ball but if you
start if you layout layout is
specifically for layin out of coordinate
CUA so what's guaranteed with layout
chordate and you always are you can
always position to know that a certain
point if it has zero translations so
what's a a question no good okay and
going forward now I if you can implement
controls your custom
as as controls you can use region for
containers as I have shown here the
reason why you probably would like to
use a control is that controls our style
and they have this style class that
means you can use the CSS and if you're
writing and use applications that that
are skinnable you definitely want to
write her control sir and this
presentation is has been inspired by a
user interface designers one of them is
john knox on he of the java posse he
used to be a software designer but he's
now a user interface designer he works
exclusively in front of shop and
illustrator and who else when the Tesla
Motors actually and the book for design
user interface design patterns I is by
Jennifer Tidwell designing interfaces
and there's a humongous set of a design
patterns in her book and there's a
slightly older one it is a book in a red
book which is the design of sites which
is specifically for websites is
jennifer's has mobile and design pattern
she talks about social networking and
and things like sharing and and as well
as the accordion and fat borders and
things like that so II going coming from
from the web and design world is a it's
a fascinating world that I see on the
sides i'm a software developer by heart
but in but if you are working with user
interface guys then it's the world that
you have to explore as well and so yeah
get to know use interface design
patterns its knowing how to do things
and understanding why what they are
why they are and then how because
obviously you are too I how guys and
girls and what's missing is this the wat
and y and then if you know the upper two
questions then you can interact with the
designer and give some feedback and say
alright like we can work together then
so that's the end of the presentation
and thank you if you have any questions
I'm happy to answer them yes ah no I
haven't yeah thank you very much so the
question was there have i contributed
any code yeah i probably can I'm
thinking of put given it as educational
stuff to put in that in github see ya my
problem is they're there for process and
I would because I developed privately
then I tend to use my own version
control system and then I come to events
like this and then it has to go public
so I'll probably will push it to get up
as I said the code is some unfinished so
this home and JFX extras is meant for
guys like you guys and girls like you to
develop within professional applications
so that's the Ettin oops any more
questions
yeah I think it's really good I clips
user or visit well for my day job is
eclipse and spring too sweet and
intelligent seems to work I'm a new guy
for intelligent and I find it the best I
de force Carla at the moment and yeah he
works with greevey quite well it's a
java effects it's the code completion is
really good yeah yeah yeah well the
advantage what is the advantage reason
google web toolkit and yes it's over the
web then if you have a yeah if you have
a desktop application yeah and that's
the requirement then you can use java
effects with that if you do too yeah
it's it's back to the business so really
if they want that application for
performance everybody knows the JVM runs
shockingly fast and Java is running
there I don't see the problem however if
your your end user is limited they can
only execute web applications then GWT
or some other framework that is a web
framework is the one for you yeah
user yeah it automatically comes down to
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
