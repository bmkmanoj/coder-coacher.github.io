next which is as we will see during the
session working title to express it this
is the profile which is becoming the
successor of the I'm P&amp;amp;G profile which
is currently in use in the embedded
world my name is fuckable ha I'm a
standardization prototyping engineer at
Oracle and I used to be suspected of IM
p and IM P&amp;amp;G several years ago and i
will be speculative sees new embedded
profile two terms okay we only have one
portable my cell my name is to inspire
i'm a product manager and technologist
at oracle i'm actually the product
manager for the Oracle Java ME embedded
product that was released last week I've
had several talks at the conference so
you know we don't have a large
attendance today and I think it's
because you know I MP is a bit of an
obscure profile that not many people are
aware of but it is the platform for
these mass-market devices that we're
talking about going forward so I believe
there will be many many more developers
who get to know this profile as time
goes by so you're at the forefront yeah
okay as is this light you have probably
say most often on this conference yes
yes at least there's a lady right so
it doesn't show to you ok so the agenda
for our talk is first we go a little bit
in the history of I am peas or what have
been the versions of inp before YFC been
created and by Ozzy not good enough
anymore then terms will give us a few it
is embedded world as it is today as a
requirement and needs coming from there
and which causes us to to to make a new
profile version here all these
requirements and needs will also show
you that's as a big need for optionality
in this new profile because we have
their very broad variety of several
kinds of devices we will go deeper into
this and then have a look at new
features and new API is coming with this
new profile person ok and yes the first
I MP has been created in the beginning
of the century amidst the phone hype
this was it type is a time of MIT p100
where Java ME has been established as an
application platform for mobile phones
and at this time said bells at the
beginning of the m2m programming and the
search for an a good platform for this
broads of people also to java and mid p
was not suitable for this because mid p
hat of course a user interface and many
of the embedded devices had very limited
space and though there was no need and
also no space to have a user interface
there and that's why mid p1 dot o-- have
been IM p1 dot oh sorry has been also
called the headless mid p so it was a
mid p without a user interface the mid p
developed and
there were some new requirements for
improvements mainly security issues and
also other things and that's why mid
Pete's tirado and later two dot one has
been created and we wanted to have these
improvements and new features also in
the embedded world and as a consequence
IM P&amp;amp;G has been created which has been
released 2005 you see it's already seven
years ago and since then it has been
actually the profile which has been used
in the embedded world and as Terrence
will show you now as there are a lot of
new requirements and new developments in
the embedded world which makes I'm p ng
a little bit outdated and created the
necessity to bring sounds something new
for the developers and they embedded
dirt yes I don't know how many people
were at the Java embedded at javaone
keynote this morning of the business
conference Judson althoff brought on a
number of partners arm freescale number
of partners and you know I think it was
a very very compelling story if you look
at the explosion of cheap as he called
it disposable hardware you know systems
that cost a couple of dollars that have
connectivity that have enough horsepower
and memory to make the world around us
much smarter you can drive business
Valley you can make better decisions you
can create new business use cases and I
think we're at the right time at the
right moment where all these different
aspects come together to drive this I
think what many believe the third
revolution of IT you know you look you
could look at different predictions and
most predictions put the number of
Internet of Things of connected smart
devices anywhere you know above a couple
of billion up to 50 billion devices
depending on the account right so in the
past we had you know mainframes we had
personal computers we're at the point
now where we've actually crossed the
boundary of more people we have more
connected devices than people on the
planet but it's still limited by the
number of people we have on the planet
essentially because you know how many
smartphones can you use we're getting to
the point where we might be surrounded
by 10 20 50 smart devices in the near
future and these things need to be
programmed somehow we need to manage the
software on them we need to make them
smarter and it's it's a huge opportunity
and a huge challenge from a software
engineering perspective so if you look
at the breadth of devices today that are
running embedded soft words it's very
vast you know that many different use
cases the requirements are very
different from device to device Java is
actually present on most of these today
and for good reason you know because of
the flexibility the platform
independence the security you know
robustness aspect but what is kind of
hampered embedded job in the past was
that it was always or often point
products right there were specific
markets specific verticals not
generalized embedded platforms and in
order to drive the next wave of m2m we
need to build a horizontal platform
infrastructure that allows people to
build services on both on the client as
well as on the enterprise side that
scale quickly to harness that wave so
the the challenges for embedded devices
are changing rapidly with with this
shift from from point products to
scalable horizontal solutions that it
can reuse that puts a burden on the
local processing capabilities it's not
good enough anymore to just you know
create create a dedicated device with a
dedicated software stack you write one
application you burn it in you deployed
in the field and you're done forever
that's not good enough anymore you need
the ability to
degrade with other systems you need the
ability to upgrade the software over
time as it's in the field too for
example to adapt to new standards to fix
potential security issues you might have
and to add to the longevity and the
value of the product in the in the field
over time to provide more value to the
to the customer you need to you need to
start providing value up stack right
there's the model of reinventing the
wheel and the plumbing every time you
build a solution is is not scalable so
you need to rely on an infrastructure
and then build your value your expertise
on top where you can really
differentiate local intelligence is very
important because these devices will
create a lot of data the luge of data
that needs to be processed and managed
and what do you want what you need to do
is make that data and turn that into
information that is more relevant to
your business case so instead of just
blindly sending everything up to the
enterprise server or to the to the
Gateway you do some local processing and
filter that data on the local device to
add you know to extract more value and
reduce the sheer amount of data that
you're sending around and finally what's
also become very important is to be able
to separate the hardware from the
software cycle development cycles so you
want to be able to develop software in
parallel to hardware development and not
serialize those two in order to cut your
time to market so a number of challenges
for small embedded devices and we
believe that you know Java is uniquely
positioned to to make make this platform
I'll turn this platform into a much more
capable delivery service delivery
platform that allows you to create
better embedded products quicker ok so
I'll hand back to poker and takes it on
from here yes so as Terence has pointed
out we have a broad variety of devices
here and it would not make
to make a new profile for the embedded
world which is very static and contains
a lot of features which has to be done
to be used because we have on the one
hand side we have have high-end devices
with a lot of needs and a lot of several
kinds of applications running on them on
the other hand we have still the low-end
devices which are very simple and but
being messed devices they must be
expensive and they have only very few
capabilities to house any api's and so
on so say hi n divided embedded devices
as you may find it for example in the
medical area some device which
supervises your medical state and sends
alerts to your doctor may be including
some picture information some diagrams
or something they typically have in
high-end resolution display several
complex applications run on these these
applications have helped see need to
communicate to each other they have to
be updated over-the-air do you have to
the need for an HTTP connection and this
has to be done on the regular basis on
the other hand same as devices the
low-end devices they have no human
interaction you can imagine something
like a little device sitting somewhere
and a pipe and measuring the pressure
and sending an SMS every few minutes to
a central java about the pressure at
this stage it is part of the pipe and if
you have a long pipe below the sea or so
you have maybe millions of such devices
and they are very small they have very
few needs and very limited resources and
they have no need for those advanced
features like graphics and so on and say
also do not have
the space left for it so what is
optional I am PNG had one single place
where we had optionality this was with
respect to the media support you know I
am PNG was still headless as there are
no graphics so there are major support
only in the form of audio support and if
configuring this I am P&amp;amp;G you have been
able to choose whether to configure it
Wiz Zee's audio multimedia support or
without you can see this has changed we
have a lot of parts here with
optionality first of all first of all of
course graphical user interface
something which hasn't been appeared at
all and the former I MP versions due to
the high end devices requiring this we
have to offer here it's a possibility of
the full graphical user API we will go
more into detail on later slides on this
we may have also a simple device just
line oriented without graphics and for
this of course we need a more simple
graphical user interface without support
of widgets and so on and of course we
have still these small wireless modules
without a display and of course for
those devices has no need for graphic at
all so that has to be also the
possibility to say ok from for my
devices I want to configure the new
profile without graphical user interface
in the persistent storage bahama we have
set our honour has a record management
system you know from from it p this has
been also in IM P&amp;amp;G and some of the
developers and user complaints that it
is too big for their purposes it is
maybe also too slow
and so one possibility would be here to
offer our arm as in the full
functionality as we have it in IM P&amp;amp;G
but also simplified RMS which is
stripped from filters and several other
features and that's why gets smaller and
also faster and of course there should
be also the possibility to say in my
applications i do not need any
persistency i want to drop the
deposition storage interface from from
the configuration of my IM p next the
media support i have already mentioned
before has already been optional and IM
P&amp;amp;G this remains of course but besides
the two possibilities taking nothing or
just audio support as we have now also
graphical support possible as the third
possibility of course to have the full
media support as it is defined in GSR
135 there are other things which have
been mandatory an IM P&amp;amp;G which have
which will evolve and have some more
functionality that's the same time time
become optional in order to avoid zat
somebody who does not actually need it
needs a lot of space for it this is a
push registry in case you want to update
your applications and so I am Cesar
intermediate communication as a protocol
which enables mitla to communicate
applications to communicate to each
other if you have a very small device
running just one application which is
fixed installed on its and there's no
need for in the inlet communication of
course the AMS is the new API coming
into this profile we will discuss as
late as it is
extended application management which
offers some possibilities besides the
normal application life cycle which is
of course mandatory and the power
management is also a new API coming into
this profile based on the requirement of
several users and developers but of
course this also will also be optional
let's have a look at the new features
more detailed i start with the graphical
user interface if we have a big or an
high-end vilas module or embedded device
within within high-end display sends s
need to have widgets and a graphical uia
support with menus with commands with
images text fields and so on as you know
it for example also for mobile phones
also an IP phone for example can be in
embedded device so that you can say is
that the mobile mobile phones I actually
a vertical segment also on top of this
embedded platform what we also want to
offer here is a multiple display support
in case you have multiple displays on
your device five selectors tabs and also
touch screen supports which makes also
sense for embedded devices for example
if you have a medical device you have it
on your body in in order it sends some
information to your physician and then
you may have a touch screen keep
keyboard also where you can put
additional information how you feel or
whatever as an alternative to the full
functional graphical you I we have the
line oriented
user interface which is a simple API a
bush which supports line oriented
displays as I have shown it here so we
have no pictures they are no graphics
just a line display with one or more
lines it's also possible that we have
several colors there may be scrolling
supported and so on but just text of
course okay
I
yeah sure yes first of all of course are
some parallels but this is not identical
right we have here several api's which
are not available in mid p3 and the
reason for this is that mid p3 is of
course a profile which is suitable for
phones right there's a phone api and we
speak here now about a new profile for
embedded devices and there we have a
much broader field of requirements and
necessities and optionality is for
example one of the big differences to
make between mid p3 we have all these
things mandatory because it makes sense
for phone you need all these things for
an embedded device depending on which
kind of embedded devices you won't right
yeah
companies and also boxes
boxes for the James our country five
companies on me but what the impact is
what exactly was a question and yes okay
we are not so far that we already know
exactly about the license smaller but
probably it will be the way that in this
profiles there will be a reference to
135 and that doesn't mean that the api's
will be doubled into this profile but
rather that the profile reads we need to
support for jsr 135 here or you can
choose yeah I think one thing we should
clarify which we didn't mention is so
this is a new jsr that was filed two
days ago yeah it's number is jace are
three supported / sales that's your
answer okay so anyway that was your late
breaking news you know now people can
put things into perspective so he'll
share the good news later so this is the
beginning of this j srs and we're
basically outlining our thoughts your
based on our experiences our input on
what we've seen in the market the
requirement but the jsr has just started
so the standardization process will
continue over the next couple months
135 is final what do you mean by 135
moody media 01 see that's fine but this
is final for a long time already right
yes yes so what I wanted to say what
Terrance mentioned already what we show
here is our starting ideas for this jsr
what we would propose to the expert
group to standardize here and one would
be with respect to the media support
that we say similar to what for example
also in mid p was a case that there is
an hint that Jace are 135 should be
supported but we have it optional here
because of course they are embedded
devices that actually does not need it
okay I think we were through with the
graphical user so this is a multimedia
support slide you can see those three
janitors we have here we have the full
multimedia support as it is defined
edges are 135 how it is exactly defined
in the GSR the expert group has decided
the idea is to have the second
alternative that we have audio only
multimedia API support as we have it now
already in IM P&amp;amp;G which is also optional
there of course and the possibility of
no made your support if you have a
narrative I swear you does not need it
at all about the optional records
closest system i have mentioned it
before the idea is to support the full
rms as it is style used in IM P&amp;amp;G as an
alternative this stripped reduced
feature reduced by feature and also by
footprint as an alternative a simplified
record management system and also the
possibility which has been not which has
not been given in the IM P&amp;amp;G that you
just say i have no position see in the
applications running on this device i
want to configure this new embedded
profile without any record management
system okay is this is another great
feature we have in mind and chance will
tell you about sales platform right so
this is actually one of the one of the
more exciting areas coming to embedded
devices so so most of what photo has
been talking about is sort of
incremental improvements over I am P&amp;amp;G
optionality new features but the thing
that I believe actually will make the
biggest difference is you as I mentioned
or these devices sit out in the field
for a long time and it is essential that
you can upgrade the software on these
platforms over time to either add value
or you know make enhancements fix
problems and in order to do that
efficiently so on some of these devices
you have very low bandwidth connectivity
right cellular somewhere out in the out
in the field with 2g very low bandwidth
and in order to make that efficient you
have to be able to modularize your
application and so that you can only
push small changes down to the vice and
you don't have to you know update the
the entire software stack I mean that's
what's typically done today with native
Native systems you have to rebuild the
entire flash image and then you send
down many bits and the whole system has
to be reflashed and reboots itself with
Java we really want to go to a services
enabled platform where the platform can
run multiple applications at a time you
can component eyes your applications or
marginalize them the system can run
these efficiently on the resource
constrains provided and these services
can talk to each other and you know
leverage each other so that you can
module eyes your applications one
example that we've seen out in the field
is for meter management or smart
metering where in the system the
software running on this is is module
module lized in think five or six
components that run independently on the
system so there's one one module that
manages all the connectivity to the
backend you know establishes the
connection maintains a keepalive does
retries switches from one channel to
another there is one application that
interfaces with the meter itself that
does all the data collection filtering
error handling there's one part of the
system that acts as a system controller
that coordinates all these efforts um
and is able to install and start and
stop applications right there's a maybe
a statistics module the law
module so that allows you to modularize
your application which is good from us
after development perspective but it's
also good from a infield upgrade
perspective because you can swap these
individual components right and and
these can come from a cloud and we're
seeing that in in other deployments were
increasingly these systems are connected
to management servers and you can push
software components down to these
devices out in the field so the business
value and the technical value on both
both sides is really that you can extend
the longevity of your system make it
more valuable and add features over time
and you do not have to retest the entire
software stack every time you push down
one of those components because the
impact on the system is limited to that
component so what we're doing in in the
inp next space for the new API so the
new profile is to basically use key
components of the java SE service
provider framework so java SE has a kind
of little known service provider
framework it's it's a set of api's and
contracts that you can use so there's
the concept of a service provider and
there's the service itself so service is
basically a set of interfaces it defines
the contract and then there's a service
provider who is an implementation of
that interface the benefit of that is
that you can actually swap out the
implementation so an application relies
on a certain service you can actually
swap out that implementation of that
service without changing the the
application that's using it right and
you can provide that service
implementation in multiple ways you
could either use that you know provide
that with a shared library you can
actually have another one shared library
library declare dependency and another
shared library and the system finds you
know the system does dependency checking
resolves
the correct implementation binds that to
the interface you know using appropriate
security checks and so on and and so
this is a really good way where you can
start module izing your application and
you can just implement different service
providers depending on your use case and
you don't have to modify your
application on top you can even now you
can even have so so the system yeah so
so there are parallels to always joy
obviously what we need to do is we want
to bring some of that functionality that
our osgi obviously you know that's very
valuable we want to bring that into this
platform which is very resource
constrained which you know you don't
have multiple class loaders and things
like that you have limited amount of
memory so the system is is simplified in
what it can do for example the the
binding of the services will actually be
static so you actually have to stop your
application the the runtime will rebind
the service to a different version of
the implementation then you start up
your application again so it's it's a
yes and that can be done remotely it can
be done by the local system controller
because you're in control of what runs
on the platform so it's a very it's a
very simple model that provides
flexibility but keeps the system and the
semantics of the system very simple so
you can't have things like dangling
references you're not going to you know
run multiple applications of the same
thing at the same time so we've we've
tried to simplify it and keep it useful
so the components of this are the the
java.util service loader so that's taken
from java SE so that is the service that
basically binds an implementation to the
the interface the service provider
interface is what is the implementation
the the oh sorry the service provider
implementation implements that interface
as I said
you can either have libraries shared
code depend on each other or
applications depend on shared code and
the important thing is that this is
integrated with the application
management concept so there could be a
system controller application also
written in Java that can manage the the
binding and the running in the starting
stopping of these components now on top
of that I and P&amp;amp;G or actually sorry I MP
next will also support multi tasking of
applications so you can run multiple
applications in parallel and so those
two concepts together the service
provider concept and the ability to run
multiple applications at a time that can
talk to each other actually creates a
pretty sophisticated application model
that provides a lot of features and
allows you to modularize your
application while still you know fitting
the constraints of the system so this
this is something that application
developers will sort of need to get
their mind around but I think it'll
provide a lot of benefits in the long
term and the way we develop these
applications so and I think with that
yes some mazhar a new features we have a
mind for this new version of the profile
system application events so an event
management as you may know us know it
also from other platforms that the
system can notify to get informed about
certain events and react on it
I always business yes business
concurrency is that we can run several
applications in a concurrent mode to set
monitors on chardon resources and so on
the interim led communication as it is
possibly also known from from mid p3
shared libraries has already been
discussed by terrance from IM PNG and on
there had been the possibility to sign
em let's em let's ease is in name for
the applications in I MP and what should
be introduced here as a possibility of
multiple inlets wheat sinus this is
necessary if you are on an application
which uses several services which can
dynamically loaded as Terence explained
it right now so they can come from
different suppliers then a model for
permissions very similar to what's known
from java SE so we have here in case of
an alignment between mes you already and
fault tolerance in the sense that you
have a support for quality of service
that you can require certain
quality parameters for your connection
for example certain bandwidth and have
the possibility to get notified if this
quality of service is not fulfilled
anymore and you can react on this for
example by defining a strategy how's the
device should react on the loss of
quality of the service or complete loss
of the connection by retrying retying
immediately retrying after some time out
switching to another connection and so
on then notifications we have already
mentioned here the possibility to be
noted to be notified about several types
of events coming up into the system life
cycle then new Inlet types for example
auto how to start em let's an
application which starts automatically
if the device is switched on and boots
and of course other inlet types which
are caused by the fact that we have
graphics now for example something like
a screen saver if you have in a display
it is useful to have also screensavers
there or an idle screen inlet which for
example shows some measurement values
which are shown if no certain
applications running their support for
opentype fonts also part of the new
introduced graphical capabilities
optional extension of the application
management functionality we have the
next slide about this coming to make
this later and power management also
mentioned before was in requirements
that can be also handled in the API also
for this we have an extra light coming
up
now power management should be
integrated in the event management API
that means we have system power states
we have the possibility to get notified
for example if the power goes down so
that the application has a chance to
save important data into the persistent
storage we should have the possibility
to access information about the current
battery level about an estimate about
the remaining battery life and of course
we want to use if this system is using
an external power sources that we do not
consume the battery this is the extended
application management API which has
been mentioned before of course we have
the application management as an
mandatory part of the profile with
respect to everything which reflects the
normal application lifecycle as this
cannot be optional because you have the
necessity two halves of functionality of
the system to drive the lifecycle of the
normal applications what is meant here
as an optional part is something an API
which enables a settings management so
you can do system settings or specific
settings for a certain application you
can do some task management ones and
some sweet management so you can be
notified about an update often sweet or
on task an update or certificate what is
newly downloaded and you can doing some
settings for example for reading a file
how often will the permission get asked
by the user will it be one spare used
once per application and so on
tickets were political to use more
sophisticated forms that are walking
around the desktop and the mobile space
like trusted environment this is also a
possibility so we are about to define
this and of course you are also invited
to join the expert group and to bring in
your ideas there then we have the line
oriented user interface I have mentioned
before this is for simple devices owning
a line oriented display only so without
graphics in this case we have possibly a
key event support in case as an user
input device assigned so if you have an
modula device somewhere and a technical
a environment it is possible that you
have a little keyboards there or a touch
touch screens keyboard so there's so
that users able to input some data we
have vertical and horizontal scrolling
support in mind support of single line
or multiple multiple line displays and
also support of more than one text color
ifs of course always if this is
supported by the hardware which is used
so it should be my one should be able to
configure this in the API yes and this
has a last new API to be shown here the
simplified record management system it
drives basically the same principles as
the RMS as it is known from IM P&amp;amp;G but
it is should be become smaller and for
smaller and faster because we have no
filters which makes sense if you have a
small amount of data and the overdrive
filters and so on is too much no expert
eat also ization mode so it may not be
useful for sensitive data or access by
more of one user but in the embedded
space you have very often isolated
devices we are also the book there only
the old owner has access to and there's
no need to explicitly save the data from
from us access yes these as a good news
which Terence has already told you
though not a surprise anymore SI je sais
been fired this week monday as a json
immerse 361 and you see it is called
Java ME embedded profile which makes
sense because in a
I MP seven or nine years before has been
chosen of course with respect to these
little wireless modules and this profile
targets too much prota set of devices
and embedded profile I think it's a good
name for it you can see is the side in
the gcp orc a space of this new GSR
which came up the day before yesterday
and of course you can just go to the gcp
or homepage and puts this 361 number and
the search grid no I'm not sure I'm not
sure yeah I don't know so in the
template they still ask for which which
AC should vote about this and this was
of course IM eec so let's see yeah so
okay yeah
merciful for their zombies the roadmap
in potent chemicals smoothly okay yeah
it's actually a good question so when I
was sitting down here i just realized
okay we we should have presented a slide
which maps this to the roadmap of
product so that was an oversight so let
me let me step back a little bit so
throughout this week's javaone I think
it should have been pretty clear that
Oracle is putting a lot of emphasis on
embedded Java going forward right
unmanly money levels business technical
and especially small embedded Java we
want to make it a horizontal platform
that's very easily accessible to
developers and really encourage a lot of
traditional Java developers to have a
look at embedded so to this effect not
only was jsr 361 filed but also jsr 360
360 is cldc eight so we want to bring
the cldc configuration the underlying
configuration up to java SE standards in
terms of languages language features on
most of the api's so really leverage you
know that horizontal platform and make
it very easy for people you know it's
just java and ok after watch out for my
resources right my power consumption my
processing capabilities but it's the
same language the same API set as as
much as possible and i can easily
migrate right it's just one continuum in
terms of the runtime right so we haven't
filed new java me j srs in a long long
time so this should be an indication
that oracle serious in moving forward we
have a bunch of supporters on board
already for both j srs and i think we're
going to move on these very quickly so
in terms of the products the the current
plan is to have the jsr s basically
ready to vote it to be voted on roughly
mid next year you know it always depends
on the JCP process and and timelines but
we want to get this done very quickly
yeah the final sorry the final the final
ballots are approved because the current
plan is to have products based on this
in the second half of next year right so
moving very aggressively as soon as we
have the functionality to find so I
spoke about this product that I'm the
product manager for Oracle Java me
embedded 322 that we released last week
which is an implementation of cldc one
and IM P&amp;amp;G for this kyle board so we
want to make it available to developers
to get started very quickly we are
planning to update that product to cle
c8 and EP java me EP as soon as the the
specification has settled to make it
available again to a broad developer
base as soon as possible unreal hardware
right integrated with the tools and
everything so we're moving very
aggressively to really make you know dr
broad adoption so that's the back
well yeah so I mean this is all of this
is last-minute developments right I mean
two days ago the jsr s were filed and we
can you know make product statement
based on something that hasn't even been
filed yet so so things are very much
evolving rapidly and you know by this
time next year hopefully we'll have a
bunch more technology that we can play
with right exactly so we're updating the
version numbers to indicate the
alignment so you will actually be able
to use the same compilers on the same
tools at least that's the plan as much
as possible yes yes yes yes so most of
the java SE 7 features will be supported
except for invoke virtual invoke dynamic
and something else so i mean we still
have two separate VMs right of ace those
can't merge because the VMS are just two
different in terms of their their space
but the CLD c vm will be upgraded to
support most the Java Sea features
including generics type annotation or
annotations type annotations I'm
actually not sure annotations and a
bunch of features
freescale Frisco freescale yeah okay so
all right so yeah so we can switch that
topic so anyway so there's the big
strategies to have java SE and emmy
align to make it a more seamless you
know development environment get this
functionality out into developers hands
as quickly as possible in terms of the
functionality of the product stack so
for example gso 256 sensor api we're
actually debating how to do that there
is essentially the decision is between
at which level do you support I oh right
you could always support IO at a high
level where you abstract the I own it
becomes sort of high-level access so the
sensor API is very high level you just
basically read a value but that makes it
difficult because you have to adapt the
API to different devices it's not very
flexible it's high level or you do low
level access where you give the
developer essentially the way to fiddle
with the bits of the peripherals and
then they can wrap their own java class
and abstract it into the device that
they want to have and what an entirely
sure what the best approach is currently
in the in the product and the Oracle
Java mitad product we actually have a
new API called the device access API
which is currently an Oracle API but
we're considering standardizing that and
that allows application developers to
access peripheral i/o directly and then
they can basically write little java
device driver wrappers on top for their
specific functionality which would give
the developer more freedom rather than
baking it into the platform so when
right exactly right right right right so
so the new API wouldn't it depends on
the it's called the device access API so
if you look at the Oracle Java embedded
32 product at the data sheet there's
also the documentation is out there one
of the API is is device access API and
it has features it's you know it's on
the web page you can look at the at the
Java Docs and it gives you a basic way
to access devices hanging off one of the
bus systems that are supported so the
way we envision that happening let's say
you have you know a temperature center
or accelerometer or something hanging
off the i square c boss right so but
it's a specific type of device and you
as the system integrator you know
exactly how the device works so what you
would do is you would write a little
java library that basically uses the
device access api to fiddle the bits on
the device extract the data then you
wrap that into a nice developer api that
just returns the value and the developer
doesn't have to fiddle with the
initialization and you know that that
works it gives you a lot of flexibility
what it doesn't really do is doesn't
handle devices that for example have
interrupt capabilities there is no good
way to do that in Java right you can
send events around but you might miss
event so we're talking about different
possibilities if you have input let us
know and
projects out there at keeps for example
grunts oh is that they are seriously
looking at I so basically you did on TV
I was more or less the result of the
cheese after 35 that was stopped at the
time is very violent crime world yet but
at the moment there are more people that
use the old to certify or use what I
then even using that 256 which
practically right my man okay so we are
at the end of the time and cause of our
presentation these are the presentations
which are related to this one but they
have already been earlier this one but
if you have the printed materials so you
can use it as a cross reference to the
others and these are our contact data so
the question the answers we had already
in between so I think thank you very
much for coming and for your interest
thank you enjoy enjoy the rest of the
show and we'll see you next year with a
faux hawk because everybody wants you to
embed a java sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
