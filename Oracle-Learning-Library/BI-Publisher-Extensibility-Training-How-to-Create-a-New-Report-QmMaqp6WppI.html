extensibility training in this lesson I
will demonstrate how to create a report
this will include how to create a data
model how to generate some sample XML
data from that data model how to create
a report definition how to create a new
layout and how to add that new layout to
the reports definition the first step is
to navigate to the location in the VIP
catalog where you wish to store your new
data model
once you have navigated to the
appropriate folder you can click on the
button in the top left hand corner to
create a new data model
once the data model has opened up one
first steps is to create the data sets
these will retrieve the data which will
be used by the report but before we can
do that we will need to create the
parameters which will be used by the
data sets in the parameter window click
on the green plus sign to add a new
parameter for each parameter you can
also add a display label this will be
used if you run the report online from
the VIP server for the purpose of this
demonstration we are adding several
parameters that will be used by the
sequel query that we will create in the
data set section you'll notice that we
define all the parameters as data type
string this is because if the report
will be called by the Oracle Enterprise
scheduler service and the parameters are
passed by this as strings
once all the parameters are added we can
move on to define the data sets the data
set section is where we define how the
data model retrieves the data that will
be used by the report for the purposes
of this demonstration we will create a
data set based upon a sequel query
in the crates equal data set window name
your query and address equal code now
notice that parameters referenced in the
code are prefixed with a colon it's
possible to create more than one sequel
dataset and join them together to create
complex reports but for the purposes of
this demonstration we'll just create one
the next step is to generate some sample
XML data which we can then use to create
a new report layout to create some
sample XML data click on the get XML
output button in the top right hand
corner on the next screen enter
appropriate values for all the
parameters select the correct number
rows to return and then click run
once that XML has been generated click
on the open menu button in the top right
hand corner choose the option to export
the XML and then save it to a local
directory we will then be able to use it
to create a new layout
also choose to save the generated XML a
sample data you can then create an
online template if you wish to once you
have exported and saved your generated
XML click on the return button to go
back to the main data model screen and
now is probably a good time to save the
report
once the data model saved is then time
to create the report definition so now
get to location in the catalog where you
wish to create this new report
definition
once you have navigated to the
folder click on the create item button
and slept report
our window will be immediately displayed
which will allow you to select the data
model to be associated with your report
definition so navigate to the directory
where you just created your new data
model and then select it you can see
that in the top left-hand corner the
selected data model is now associated
with this report definition the next
step is to use Microsoft Word to create
the report layout to create the new
layout open up Microsoft Word and create
a new blank document a prerequisite for
this stage is to ensure that you have
the bi publisher template builder word
added installed this can be downloaded
from the home screen of the VIP server
first step in creating a layout is to
navigate to the bi publisher template
builder add-in and upload the sample XML
data that we generated earlier
select the sample external data from the
local directory where you saved it
earlier
once the sample XML data has been loaded
you can now start to create the report
layout itself the next step is to create
a header region or we can add a report
title
once the header region has been created
typing the text for your report title
you can align the title you can make it
bold and change the font size
once the title has been added you can
then start to add date fills to the
report body
for the purposes of this
well at a table
in the insert table form you can drag
and drop groups and films that you wish
to see in a report from the data source
side to the template side
in this example
drag the group t1 from this suicide to
the template side group G one contains
four fields we don't wish to have
customer ID in the final report so you
can select and delete this one
once you satisfy
feel selected click on the ok' button
the next step is to save the report
layout be sure to save it as an RTF
format
once you've saved the report layout you
can only use the bi pop shell word
add-in to preview the report layout
using the sample data
this example we have generated
output in PDF format
once you are satisfied with your newly
created report layout you can return to
the report definition to upload it
type in the layout name and then browse
to the directory where you save your
newly created layout
as the type
and choose the appropriate account
once the new layer has been uploaded
save the report
it's now possible to test the new data
model report definition and layout but
before you can do this ensure the
properties are set to allow you to run
the report from the bip server ensure
that the options to run a report online
and to show controls are checked if you
also plan to run the report from
Enterprise scheduler service ensure that
the report is controlled by consumer
application is also checked and click OK
you'll now be able to run the report
from the VIP server to do this click on
the view report button in the top right
hand corner into appropriate values for
all the parameters and then click apply
the data will be retrieved from the
database using the new data model that
you created and formatted using the new
report layout that you also created
let's the end of this lesson which I've
shown you how to create a new data model
to generate some sample XML data to
create a new report definition and to
create a new report layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
