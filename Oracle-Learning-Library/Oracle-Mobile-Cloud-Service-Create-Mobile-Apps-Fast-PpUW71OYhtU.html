ready to use Oracle mobile cloud service
to develop your first mobile app with
Oracle mobile cloud services mobile
backend you get features and platform ap
is that can send push notifications to
both iOS and Android mobile devices
store application data in the cloud so
it's protected and easy to get at cash
locally stored rest resources to
optimize application performance provide
user login capabilities and test real
users and roles gather usage data and
generate analytics reports and monitor
health and troubleshoot problems when
you create a mobile backend it uses
authentication to provide access to the
Oracle mobile cloud service ap is you
can associate your mobile backend with
one or more ap is for use with your
mobile app and you can create custom
functionality described by the AP is and
implemented with nodejs and JavaScript
let's explore each feature in depth have
you ever tried to implement push
notifications in your mobile app it can
be a tough task mobile cloud services
notifications API has made this simple
we manage the complexity across the
Apple and Google frameworks so all you
have to do is send the push and blood us
do the rest to register the app just
choose the iOS or Android platform
upload your Apple certificate or Google
key and the notification service will
handle the registration with the OS
vendor add client code using our client
SDK and you're ready to send where can
you store application data Oracle mobile
cloud service includes access to storage
in the cloud for easy secure access to
your data the storage API optimizes data
storage and retrieval cloud storage is
secured by role based access control to
make sure the right user has access to
the right data you have a storage
solution but how do you synchronize data
when the user goes offline the data
offline API manages the caching of
locally stored rest resources such as
images and JSON payloads with the
storage API
and custom code mobile cloud service
provides a client SDK so custom API
resources will be available by default
how do you manage users securely the
user management API makes it easy for
you to provide logging capabilities for
your mobile app users the user
management interface lets you quickly
configure and test real users and roles
for your mobile apps once your app is
out in the field how can you keep tabs
on how it's doing Oracle mobile cloud
service automatically gathers usage data
about your mobile app and displays it in
the analytics console the analytics API
collects system event occurrences such
as number of users API response time and
geographic locations it also allows you
to define your own custom events to
track the specific patterns you want to
see you coded a great app but how can
you debug it the Diagnostics console
provides many tools to help you
troubleshoot problems a change in color
indicator light alerts you to the
overall health of the mobile backend it
prominently displays the level of 400
and 500 errors the API requests count
and API response time you can drill down
to get more information about each API
request such as the request method its
parameters and the elapsed time and if
that isn't enough you can view the log
messages which are correlated with each
API request to get fine grain
information to pinpoint the root cause
of any problem within minutes you can
set up a mobile backend with a rich set
of platform ap is that you can use to
quickly and easily develop and
troubleshoot your apps Oracle mobile
cloud service is the complete solution
for enterprise mobile application
development you can find additional
information in the Oracle Help Center
Oracle Learning Library and at Oracle
University thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
