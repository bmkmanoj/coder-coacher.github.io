going to import and run an Berkeley DB
Java sample program in the IntelliJ IDE
in a previous tutorial we have already
built it's necessary Berkeley DB
libraries and copy them to the simple
programs directory so let's open a DJ
and import the projects now let's import
and run a sample program in IntelliJ
before that we need to make sure that
JDK 7 is added to the platform SDKs to
refer that click configure project
default project structure and make sure
that JDK 7 is added to the platform SDKs
now let's open the project click open
navigate to the sample programs
directory and open the project file now
we need to configure the project to use
the Java libraries view from the
Berkeley DB release package right-click
on the project and select open module
settings in the dependencies tab click
add draws out directories in selected
jar files we copied from the Berkeley DB
buta rectory
to run a sample program we need to
create a run configuration for it
click Edit configurations and add a new
configuration for application give our
new configuration a suitable name and
select the main class as part in demo
set the VM options to use the sample
programs with directory at our native
library path click OK to save it now run
program
we can see that the simple program has
run successfully let's take a quick look
to the output of the sample program
the sample program simulates five costs
entering and leaving a parking lot when
each car enters the parking lot it gets
a ticket with a unique ID when the
leaves the parking lot the paces parking
fee based on how long it stays in the
parking lot at the end of the simulation
two statistics are also computed the
total number of cars enter in a parking
lot
on a specific day in total parking fee
is collected on the same day before
wrapping up the tutorial we also like to
show you how to select the api's used to
run a sample program open the parking
demo class at the beginning of the main
method you can select which API is to
use to run a sample program
by default we use sequel which means the
JDBC API is used we can change it to
bias to use a basic key value API
we can use DPL the direct persistent
layer API
this wraps up the tutorial thank you for
your time for more detailed information
