session focusing on Oracle's mobile
development solutions g'day my name is
Chris spera I'm from Oracle's mobile
platform team
now one of the problems for new
customers learning to use Oracle
technologies is why we have a wealth of
documentation and learning Clairol much
of this focuses on very discrete topics
within each technology rather than the
bigger picture of how to fit an entire
application together end to end now I
don't know about you but when I started
a program I had the opportunity to stare
at the shoulders of city developers and
watch them create an entire application
and to end as they add code for one part
of a system they often in sequence we
have to build out the other end of the
system to provide the necessary
infrastructure ok so I'd only by
observing and watching these developers
did I start to understand what was
needed to be built the bigger picture so
to speak so with this guidance in mind
to this session rather than going
through a bunch of slides instead I want
to run a practical demonstration of
quickly building the code for an entire
mobile app or mobile system running on
Android and iOS using Oracle jet backed
by Oracle mobile cloud service which is
going to Athena Kate a mobile user but
also is going to serve data from an
on-premise server 3 end to end
development as a result of this session
you're going to see a lot of code and a
lot of development which I hope will
give you a taste for our good yet
specifically building mobile apps
adorable yet and how I can plug into
Oracle mobile cloud service to talk to
on-premise service end-to-end ok ready
but for the purpose of this session say
we're working on hypothetical sales
application our salesmen are heavily
dependent on the contact details of our
customers therefore in customers while
they're on the road to break a deal
water in the area however our customers
contact details are frequent and
changing customers come and go so the
sales team needs to need the latest
contact details from that on-premise
client management system right so how do
we go about building this mobile
application
with article jet and article mobile
cloud service well let's start the
overall application build with article
jet for this video we're going to assume
you know a little bit about article jet
one's purposes and I'm also going to
assume you've already installed there
are budget tooling if you'd like more
details about how to install the tooling
the following two articles discuss the
installation instructions so both the
web and hybrid mobile version object you
are use in this video now you will need
to follow the instructions in both
articles in sequence
so once with the auricle jet tooling
installed by the command line we can
create a basic jet application scaffold
using Yemen so here I'm calling the yo
man yo executable we then specify that
we're going to use the local jet hybrid
template generator and this will create
the basic scat out of our application
our application source code will be
placed in the subdirectory called
phonebook when we use the basic get
template to create our empty application
scaffold will support both the Android
and iOS platforms the application ID
will be Condor ethnic phone book
and the application name will be packed
mean phonebook
once the ERM generator is completed it
would be nice to test the basic jet
application scaffold and test that it's
actually up and running to the test
system Android we can run our
application in Android emulator by first
doing into our applications directory
then calling grunt serve stay we want to
run our app on the Android platform and
our destination is an Android SDK
emulator virtual device server setup
called Miami D now the Android emulator
can be slow to start sort of accelerated
the video so you can see the end result
of our running application ultimately if
we want to see the same on iOS I'll
control see the running session in
maternal then kill the Android emulator
and this time type grants Earth the
platform is iOS and the destination is
the default emulator which equates to
the iOS simulator and after waiting few
seconds we can see our basic app is now
running in the IRS Simulator 2 and for
speed we can also run the mobile app by
the local browser so again I'll kill the
running session with a control C kill
the iOS simulator instead this time type
grant serve platform equals iOS as a
destination equals browser
very quickly we now see the app running
in my browser one of the big advantages
of running by the browser is it's easy
to open the browsers developers options
so we can look at the source code the
JavaScript console Network calls and so
on which all will help us to bug the
application
moving away from the running application
let's now take a look at the basic
source code structure so here I'm going
to add my favorite text editor and under
the source directory of the scaffold
that we generated we can see the
index.html page which is the main
launching page for our app
the oil page has a bunch of code
injected by the template which for this
video we'll skip over could that have a
lot of time to cover all of its roll up
for the moment let's make a simple
change and between the oj hybrid at
layout content div where our main custom
page content is to go we'll add a span
tag to output a value from a variable
message using knockout
if you're not familiar with knockout and
it's super powers I suggest you check
out the following article which will
give you the lowdown on knockout and how
the data bind attribute allows us to
access JavaScript variables in the
background
now let you next page is backed by the
main jazz JavaScript module where all
our state and logic for the index.html
page will go so in the main view model
class we can place the variable your
name that our hype small span data by an
attribute refers to a knockout an
observable is a variable that page can
bind to it will automatically be updated
on the screen if the variable value is
changed in the background without having
to use jQuery to manipulate the Dom
amazing these changes in our code if we
turn to the browser we can see our
changes are live or hot loaded and our
little welcome message is displayed
already with the application scaffold in
place we're ready to start building our
app to do what we're really wanting to
do so let's sue bliss our goal for this
app is to show a list of customers and
their phone numbers so sales team can
call the customers while I am about on
the road however before we allow you to
see this list we would like them to log
in supplying a username and password now
this is where Oracle mobile cloud
service will come in and it will be the
remote repository of our application
users that we want to give access to the
phone book application on our mobile
devices so it is in mind let's first
build the login page in our chat then
we'll cook in Oracle mobile cloud
service to derive the MCs users later
for our logging in terms of user
interface component of UI components you
can imagine when the app opens we mainly
show a login dollar with a username and
password field and buttons to log in and
reset the fields if the user enters an
incorrect using angle part of in
addition you can imagine we need to show
an error message dialog that shows the
login has failed to back the login
dialog we'll need some variables to hold
the G's name and password as well as
logic each for the login and reset
buttons for the login button will first
check at the username and password epi
and their peers will do nothing waiting
for the user to edit some values of both
unwise if they are not
we will call Oracle mobile cloud service
to its Finnick add user with the
supplied is name and password the
username password proves to be invalid
but then hide the dialog and display the
phonebook data but certainly if user
name/password proves to be invalid we
want to hide the login dialog and show
the arrow dialogue instead now going
back to the login dialog alternately to
the reset button when selected we simply
want to clear the user name and password
fields alarm user to enter new fresh
values finally return to the Eric dialog
from the user speedy error dialog and
let's select the ok button to
acknowledge it we want to hide the error
dollar dialog and return to the login
dialog to give the user another chance
to log in okay so with all this in mind
the pseudo code in place let's actually
start building our application first
let's build the login dialog in the
index.html page now when working with at
your application when you want to add UI
components to your page the article jet
crop book is your big friend now we can
find this couple at Oracle jet dot or
then we select the cookbook option which
gives us access to the cookbook
containing all the components supported
by jet and hundreds of recipes on how to
use those user interface components this
is why it's so useful if we look at all
the UI components we find there is a
dialog component which we will be useful
for our login box and select leads you
consider at many different recipes
available for dialogues now specifically
we want a modal dialog and selecting
this option in the cookbook it gives us
a runnable example which if we click on
a button indeed we can see this will be
perfect for our login box in our
application beneath this we see example
code for creating the modal dialog in
our HTML page essentially we need a div
tag which is mapped to the Oder dialog
component we can get the diavik title
and we can specify the dialog is
initially visible when the page displays
which is good for us as we want the
login box to be visible when the app
first opens it turn the dialog is made
up
dialogue body where we can add 200
components as well as a footer section
for our login reset buttons you're
looking at the JavaScript to support the
dialog we need to add is a dollar as a
dependency for our module and as the
dollar contains buttons we will also
need to add a JSON button within the
example we can see how to open and close
the dialog programmatically we simply
called jQuery with a dialogue ID then
the Ocho delay function with the open or
closed key works great so that all seems
pretty simple so let's copy the
downloaded code across to our actual
page
with a code let's change the title to
welcome change the initial visibility
property to show delete existing body
elements and we'll leave the button for
a moment I do that as a dialog in its
button to that page we must act age is
projectile log and page is button to the
listed page the penises in the main j/s
JavaScript module now in this dialog we
want to show a user name label a user
name input control as well as a platform
able and import control if we return to
the cookbook we can see under forms
there are recipes for input text
controls
this is a basic recipe is a libel
component with some text the libel is
met to an input test component
this value is mapped to a variable value
then in the JavaScript you can see we
need to add Oh Jo J input text as a
dependency and then to add the value
variable we simply add it as a knockout
observable again this all seems pretty
simple enough so let's copy the label
and input component over to our page and
we'll add it twice once for the username
and once the password field from here
will change the component ID
and map it to a variable username and
we'll make it require
we'll then change the label components
associated the same user name ID and
will change the label text to having on
the user name will it repeat these steps
the part route
as these components refer to a username
and password variable we need to add
these to our main JavaScript file as
knockout observables so the values can
be stored somewhere for the application
to access we've mentioned earlier if
you're not familiar with knockout or its
observables effectively but you knock
out and calling the observable function
these variables expose so that our page
can reference them and automatically see
any updates to knockout is incredibly
powerful and saves us a lot of Dom
manipulation favored by jackaroo as a
results finally it will finish with
creating the login and reset buttons in
our login dialog when we copy the dialog
across from the cookbook it already
included button and so I'll quickly
modify this first I'll duplicate the
button code as we need both a login
panel set button then we'll change the
first buttons ID its label and we'll
specify that when it's clicked call a
method login click
if I go to the cookbook and look at a
buttons example
here we can see a simple push-button
example
where if we click on my behind the
things the button mo has a knock out
properly click
which we'll call a method button click
looking at the JavaScript you consider
method button click which performs the
actual logic for the click so we need to
set up something similar so let's copy
the clip code and return to our page as
you can see our method is called loading
to it we open a JavaScript module we can
then copy the example click method and
change the code for our purposes for now
we'll just substitute the simple alert
message
in addition returning to our buttons
I'll modify the second button to
represent our set button as you can see
my page I've referenced there were six
its function so we need to add that to
my main JavaScript module to
just as reminder we need to add a soj
button to our JavaScript penalties for
this module but thanks to adding the
data example earlier that already had a
button example within it I've already
done that so I won't be doing that again
great so at this point we can actually
test application which provide a useful
sanity check if everything so fires
hanging together properly if we return
to the running application we can see
that it is updated itself to now share
the login dialog by default however
something is wrong I can see the user
and password level but there are no
actual input text fields what could be
wrong we open a browser developer tools
looking in the console we see that the
application is complaining and it
doesn't know what Oh J input text is hmm
harder try R of course I've forgotten I
need to add it to the dependencies of
mange is so quickly returning to my
Darius we can see Oh Jo J input text
isn't included that was one of the
things I'll never do earlier so I'll
just type it in then save and now when
we return to the app we can see the
username and password fields are
actually appearing if we click the login
button we can see the associated load
message we can prove another button and
the function the click is working and if
we separately press the reset button we
can see its alert message too okay let's
continue with adding our application
logic
if we return to our wireframe interior
logic you can see at this point we've
achieved well we've added a login dialog
with the username and password fields
and the login and reset buttons
we've also left the username and
password field to the appropriate
variables and then log in and reset
buttons are linked back by functions at
this point great
however the functions are incomplete
because we don't have the Associated
logic come in pseudocode so let's work
on coding the pseudo logic node now the
like and click functional copy in the
pseudo code commented out we can use
that as a guide to moving forward to
adding logic to our actual application
we first need to test if you use them in
parts where observables are null or anti
streams and if so will do nothing
waiting we user to edit that into both
next we will call MCS to aesthetic 8 the
user within a password now for the demo
just at the moment going to hold off
doing this as we haven't set up MCS yet
so instead the moment let's just add a
boolean check to see if the username and
password equal height coded values Joe
and the literal password password
respectively this allows us to actually
test the password logic is working
before we integrate MCS now if the
result is true we'll then use jQuery to
close the login dialog by calling it a
dialog close the result is false well
then use jQuery to close the login
dialog in a similar fashion but then
open the error logging dialog to display
the error to the users that their
username and password is incorrect
now we haven't actually created the area
login dialog in that
index.html page so let's do that now
returning to our index.html page I'll
copy over the previous dialogue code and
changes ID and changes the mutual
visibility of hi
next we'll delete the body content and
add the text stringing these name of
password is incorrect
then delete one of the foot of buttons
and change the remaining button to an OK
button
why the dollar will add the current to
the okay button now
little copy in the studio code which
instructs us to write code close the log
and arrow dollar then show the logging
dialogue to allow the user to try
entering your username and password
again then we'll quickly convert that to
Dakota Cross which instructs us to write
code to close the login area dialog then
share the login dialog to allow the
users to try entering a username and
password again in addition we'll enter
the username and positive values saving
the user from having to clear this down
themselves which is always painful in a
mobile app now back in our running up if
we enter an invalid username and
password we can see the arrow login
dialog is displayed I'm pressing ok
we're taking back the login dialog good
finally if we then press the reset
button oh sorry
we've still got the alert we need to add
cope this to so again we'll copy and
paste our pseudo code in and then we
write at the top of it where we simply
want to reset the username and password
such this is simply the same code from
the error dialog but functional alrighty
back to our running application so I'll
enter it use them in password but this
time press reset and we considered
values get cleared down if I then enter
an invalid username password you then
get to the area dialog and I'm returning
if we then enter a valid username
password of Jo and the little password
password the login dialog disappears and
we are now on the main page waiting to
show the customers details
nice let's our login page done though
admittedly we haven't hooked in Oracle's
mobile cloud service touch it let's
continue to build out a jet application
creating overall layout and components
we will add the logic for MCS in a
moment and the reason I want to do this
and it's twofold firstly I want to show
you how fast mobile developers can build
up an application without getting tied
down to a back-end but secondly when we
do add Oracle's mobile cloud service to
our application I want to show you how
easy it is to add MCS as a back-end
without having to majorly restructure
our application now as a reminder what
we want to do once a dedicated need of
either login dialog is to show to use it
a list view
containing a list of customers and their
phone numbers salesmen can call them as
you can likely imagine from the
code soon so far this requires we add to
user interface component to our page
which sources its data from a knockout
observable and the JavaScript behind the
scenes to construct a ListView once
again the article jet cookbook comes to
our rescue now we can see there is
section for list views with a number of
recipes now I'm going to take a pilot
and say we want to use a list view based
on an array in example we can see it has
a list of rows showing information about
various servers as you can see each row
has an icon title a number of labels and
their values we will want something a
little simpler than that just people
names and phone numbers but this is
approximately what we want if we look at
the source code we'll find a simple UL
tag map to it okay this view component
you like the ListView component says it
gets its data from something called data
source to the variable and down lead
defined in our JavaScript module
it also says for each item that is going
to use a knockout template called server
template now knock our template is
simply a JavaScript script tag indeed we
can see the server template script tag
below which it will actually do in this
case is for every element in the data
source which is an array it will call
the script so think of it as a for each
loop where it will stamp out results
using the script if we look in that
script tag we can see it will output for
each item and Li tag and a series of
other child tags within that to print
out the current items values now I won't
go into all the detail T I'll reserve
that proper training course but the same
at DIF here you can see it is including
a div and a span tag outputting the
static string my web logic in the
current items name variable for the down
version nodes and CPU and so on and
where are all these values come from
within other current elements of the
data source the list you tag is
iterating over to produce the ListView
component and its items that we see here
okay so returned dazzles how is that
defined in our code we look down a
little further we can see data sources
stored in that JavaScript code as an au
j dot
a table data source passed in a plain
old array called data which above we can
see the JavaScript array object
containing all the rows of data that is
shown in the ListView at runtime sweet
so this seems pretty easy to add to our
application with a dualist view UI
logical UI component to our index.html
page first so under our dialogues are
copy across the list view component code
having answered the code let's make some
changes to make it more suitable for our
use case will give the ListView a more
meaningful name and same for the data
source we also change the template name
to row template I think it's more
meaningful for lot the knockout template
does for us prints out road is based on
a template we've done that I'll need to
define the road template strips now for
the purposes of this demonstration I'm
going to cheat to not copy over sample
template from the couple an example has
lots of tag instead I'll simply copy and
paste out of thin air this exact
solution and explain now so here we have
four row template script the de list
view will print out for each element in
the phonebook datasource peach road the
Li tag will have an ID of the current
data source elements name on it helps
identify each row from each other when
they're all stamped out on the page in
case you wasn't a new plate a single
road by the Dom we've been in terraria a
bunch of jet layout components now the
overall row is 12 columns wide so with
this layout components the Roma splits
to divs taking up six columns each then
within each of those will print the name
and phone number of the current row of
the customer from the data source the
road template is proving out nice so
that takes care of the UI components the
lives you let's now create the data
source behind the scenes and we'll
hard-code the customer names and numbers
for now - first I'll declare and
observable array for the phone book data
source that will start at Epping again
I'll cheat here then copying the sample
code and explain it rather than relying
on good book next popular
arrey we only want the code to be called
once users benefit occator so I'll add
it here now eventually this code won't
be high credit at all but it will derive
the start from NCS at the moment with
building up road samples so you can
understand each step along the way then
as you can see here I'm adding a
JavaScript object array of customer
names and their phone numbers
next notice apply the list you can find
the data in the form at once it will
create an instance of a jar a table data
source passing an array this adapter
class take care of transforming arrays
in the compliant data source for the
ListView component then I'll expose this
data as a knockout observable as we've
added the odorless view component and
the og RA table data source to our page
in code we need to add these as
dependencies to our JavaScript module
then we're done so I'm saving and Ray
Knight logging in we now see the list
view component showing our static list
of customers from the array in our
JavaScript module
sweet we're making some progress so at
this point where you have our jet
application up and running with all the
UI components and javascript logic now
admittedly the user's authentication as
a phone book of customers is hard-coded
but we've got a app up and running
visually how we want it to look from now
you need mock-ups earlier on nice
so of course using high code data is not
going to cut it for production
application we really want to extend of
code the users against the real list of
users and your ID the data from our
back-end systems in order to achieve
this we're going to bring Oracle mobile
cloud service now into the mix what the
mobile cloud service is what we call an
MS and mobile backend as a service
essentially a mobile flavored
cloud-based pads LCS provides a lot of
different capabilities for mobile apps -
which includes allowing you to
authenticate users remotely as well as
build your own API during REST API for
fetching data from your on-premise
servers and essentially ascertain them
to your mobile applications so let's
imagine you had an on-premise server
that exposed the following data for
customers via a REST API and we want to
MCS to fetch this data and compose the
data so the names and phone numbers are
combined like this for our mobile
application
how would you believe this is a really
trivial example of Oracle mobile cloud
services superpowers you can do much
much more than a simple example but the
simple example is useful for teaching
you how to use Oracle mobile cloud
service in essence be using MCS like a
service bus a traditional service bus on
prank but using it in the cloud to
access one or more external and remote
services some of them might be your
services or like any other services
provide by clouds or even some of your
customers systems or whatever now we're
using MCS we're using it to orchestrate
the data through our mobile app which
needs combined fields and then we're on
publishing an API for our actual mobile
application to consume right so in order
to do MCS what we need to do is define
firstly we need to create something
called a risk connector to connect to
our remote rest on-premise servers to
expose the customers
two MCS itself then in MCH we create a
custom API with its own rest endpoints
to allow our mobile app to access the
data in terms of implementation behind
that custom API we write node.js code
that will accept the rest request from a
remote mobile application and use the
connector to retrieve the data from it
on-premise server modify the data to our
own meter mobile applications need and
then pass that back to the mobile now by
default our REST API is nemesis
unexposed externally so we also an MC
ask me to define a mobile back end to
make the API publicly accessible and
then finally in our mobile app we
actually need to write the code in our
mobile app itself to call and see it
okay and let's remember right moments hi
coded okay so let's do that now
first I'll create the mobile back in
then option at connector and finally
I'll create the custom API to call a
connector as well as exposing the API
through the mobile backend for ready so
here we have the Oracle mobile cloud
service user interface where we'll
create the necessary artifacts so to
create a new mobile backend we do this
by slope from the hamburger menu
applications mobile backends and select
the new mobile backend button the
resulting dialog will give the mobile
back in the name phonebook and enter a
short description then okay once the
model bucket is created notice settings
on the screen such as the base URL
dedication type mobile backend ID and so
on later when the mobile application has
two core API through the mobile backend
it will need those fittings so do
remember this page in order to model
different mobile application platforms
calling MCS such as Android or iOS
within the mobile backend we need to
create a client configuration so to do
this we click on a client option and
nuclide button and we enter the name of
our client the platform I'll start with
Android the app version number the
Android package name and select create
we're creating the client MCS will give
us an application at key again we'll
need this key later for our mobile app
as
your app can also run on iOS I'll create
a client to represent the iOS client
platform to
once created we will be given a separate
application by mcs that a client
application will also need later in
order for a jet application users with
dedicated user Gibson sis NGS means this
soil sits list of users from somewhere
now in sis can support connecting to a
remote identity provider but for the
purposes of demonstration let's just
create a hard-coded user in MCS which
we'll use instead do this we click on
users new user and then enter a username
and email address as well as a name then
we click create now one thing I won't
show you in this demo is MCS will create
and send a temporary password to the
users email address now as I have to use
a private email address to do this I
won't show you the temporary password
rather to the rest in assistance you
might change the password to something
like mobile one star and will use that
password when required to the rest of
the demo okay so at this point we've
configured the mobile backend to clients
one for Android one for eyes and a user
account now let's set up our API and
connect it to call the remote on-premise
service that will serve our customer
data now as the API is dependent on the
connector I'll create the connector
first I'm selecting the applications
connected option then the new connector
button and followed by rest we'll
presented by the dialog to enter details
around the connector and remote
on-premise web service which will
provide the core of our customer
phonebook data here we are
interconnected name of phone book on and
the same name for the API name which
will be used to identify the connector
in the custom API code will build soon
the part of defining the connector will
specify the remote services URL and for
demo purposes let's assume it's
certified the following URL exists then
asks for a number of other settings for
the connector which we can leave as the
default value too now
however forgive the test page this
provides a useful option to test on the
connector itself so here we can see the
internal URI for the connector inside of
MCS for the connector that had no J's
code we'll call and then MCS will
translate that into the external URL of
our on-premise web service in order to
give the list of customers I need to add
the customers resource here in order to
test the connector consent requires that
we use the mobile backend and the user
that we created earlier that's from our
remote service we can now see the
results
with the connected built our last job is
to build our custom REST API now in MCS
our custom REST API is made up of two
parts the API interface which includes
the resources and valid definition for
the API and a node.js implementation
we'll start with the interface first
to create a new API which like the API
is option than the new API button and
then the Express API option
the new Express API dialog will use the
name phonebook same to the API name too
and then this you can see the URL that
this API will be exposed as to our
remote application as we type the name
while entering the short description and
create by the Express API we can then
quickly create a new rest results by
selecting resources then new results in
the resign withered will call the
resource customer plural customers
the window they want some sample pilot
data to the results which we can copy
and paste in from earlier
having done that on the next step of the
results with it MPs recognizes the
payload elements were made up of a name
and photo like this type string and it
has an ID field to act as a primary key
for each seal automatically finally in
the last step of the wizard
it displays what rest endpoints will
automatically be created for us in our
case get post patch in delete for our
customers resource clicking finish and
save we can actually test our API as a
stop selecting the test button the
resulting test screen shows us all the
end points which we can select and test
against and I'll take the default get
endpoint here select our mobile back in
and motor
and by the result we can see returns at
f-style we just entered in the API
interface definition this is very useful
it allows our mobile developed by the
site using the API even though we
haven't implemented any code in ojs yet
right so the last thing we need to do is
write the node.js code for the REST API
which put a request from the mobile app
will fetch the remote customer phonebook
data via the connector that we just
created
standards for return to API and select
the implementation option and there we
click on the JavaScript Scapa button
which downloads the scaffold of the
nodejs code we need to fill in
and looking at the file system we find a
zip file which we expand and it contains
the following files
of importance is the package.json file
which is our archive manifest file and
the phonebook JS file where our node.js
code will go the other files can be
ignored in opening the node.js file will
discover it has functions that represent
the words of our REST API that is get
post patch and delete these methods are
the no J's expressjs handlers that are
called when a request from in my model
application requests the URI and
specific verb as you can see the get /mo
VAR slash custom slash phonebooks most
customers function already has some
demonstration code in it then coming
through requests the medes determined of
the request is of type application jason
and if yes the red object representing
the response returns a HP status code
200 and one of our sample records as a
hard-coded object now what we want to do
instead is call our connector to call
the remote service so let me copy out of
the existing code with a new solution
and explain how it works
the first thing we do is get a handle on
the internal mcs certified SDK which
makes working with the MCS services
easier with the SDK in hand we can use
it only phonebook connector we just
previously created and as you can see
here we're going to issue a get request
from the customer's resource and this
will translate in a call to whi comm
/resources for slice customer the get
function allows us to define two
callback functions one for success and
one for failure
for the success callback function this
implies the code was able to connect to
the external service and return data and
if possibly started back in object
handler we called success the data in
hand we then can convert it from Jason
to a real JavaScript object corn Jason
to pass we then determine the number of
customers in the return payload next in
the loop for every customer in return
payload we strike one by one each
customer from the old payload and
convert the data over to the format we
need for our mobile application in our
case concatenated the customers first
name and last name into a single name
field as well as a phone number area
code and phone number into a single
phone field we then push each newly
transformed customer record into a
customer array and once a loop is done
return all the customers to the mobile
app with a HP status success rate of 200
as well in the other gate function
callback handler if it connects a
returners error we return it straight
away to the mobile app using a hex
preset code of 500
the other file we need to modify is the
package.json file which is a metadata
file for the JavaScript as you can see
it includes things like the custom API
name and it's version as well as a spot
for any dependencies as I coded a
dependency on the phonebook connector we
had a here is internal URI and MCS
including the version number 1.8 having
completed our code edits within the
directory up containing our files and
returning to the MCS UI user interface
we want to drop the zip file into the
implementation page or selected by the
file open dialog and upload
the far success rate lines we see well
there's two versions of the
implementation listed that are version
1.0 file we just uploaded and a mock
version the map virtual represents the
test area we placed in the custom API
endpoint design we can switch between
using the mock implementation and our
own code by selecting other entry and
sleeping this set as default button will
stick with the new clothes now from here
like we saw earlier you can now test the
API but with a real Noda code so again
we'll select the test button and select
the customers get endpoint we want to
test let's select the model back end set
the authentication options and finally
the test in point button itself
and the response we can see
the API dispatching has data from the
remote web service transforming the data
into the format required for a mobile
application nice sleep we've now built
our NCS infrastructure we have published
a REST API that extracts its customer
Fogel data from our on-premise server
missing piece of the puzzle is our
mobile app does not yet know how to call
and test to Seneca a user and access
that phonebook data let's complete that
now in order to arrive on access sensors
from our jet application you can either
write code to access the risk API
directly or to see much writing a lot of
fairly tedious REST API code we can use
a client sdk provided by mcs itself to
do the call for us so it's looking at
how we add the MCS Cloud SDK is to add
your app and then we'll add the
remaining code typically for a mobile
app and it uses Cordova under the covers
NCS provides the Institute Cordova SDK
amongst others with libraries to make
this a simple function call to add a
custom over Cordova SDK to an app we
cover this in a further video which you
can review here but the basic steps are
to
so from MCs we download the Cordoba SDK
and we unzip it
you
they will copy the M sister Jaya
which is the main library into a Japs
Australia's directory
you
the sourcejs main dad is far within the
required areas content path option we
add the new and surf's library if you
don't know what requirejs is here's an
article to help you you then create
under the J s directory a new file mcs
config dot J's with this code this code
will be used to initialize the MCS
library when start the right settings to
do this within that file will copy
across the contents from the cacique the
Oracle mobile cloud config J's file into
the M sub config J's file we just
created
so in the copied code here we copy all
its settings for the jet to call MCS
body and statistic a JavaScript library
we've just copied in now miss demo we're
only going to use HTTP basic
authentication for any calls from an apt
MCS so I'm going to cut out the options
for a lot Facebook or and so on and
token off maternal is option to sync and
six Express and not used in this video
itself coming out to player will copy in
the MCS mobile backend settings we
talked about earlier
you
you can place the Mohawk back in tonight
you
by Shiro
mobile backing ID
an enormous token
we also need to copy in the application
key for the mobile backing clients now
however videos you remember and just get
us to one for is and then one for
Android suicide it's rather an hi
cutting the application key will make it
derive from a variable of the same name
you
now you'll notice this particular
expression includes a call to a cordova
plugin called device and a
called platform which can tell you the
applications running on iOS and Android
so that plug-in is an available to our
applications by default so I need to go
back to the command line suit either
hybrid and add the devices plug-in to
our application
returning to our code within the MCS
config function will then need to add
code to initialize the SDK finally in
the main J's file we must also add the
MCS config javascript file to available
require J's modules and then add it to
dependencies of the main module
you
great so having completed this last step
I am CSS decay is now ready to be used
in applications so because of that we
have two remaining things to do firstly
we need to in our mobile application
rather than hard coding for user we now
need to call MCS to cenek on our user
second once the user is authoritative we
need to fetch the phonebook data from
MCS the REST API that we do so right o
we turn back to where we started right
back to the application Coby wrote in
jet I'm going to multiply it now to do
this like an out main J's file because
of that as an empty of content depends
to our code we're now going to make use
of it so we have code where we then
hard-coded the username and password
check before will now replace it with
this character authenticate the user
name and password against MCS that is a
call to insist config mobile backend
authorization authenticate passing in
the username and password
this function provides two callbacks to
respond to the successful authentication
of user or not now this is successfully
authenticated remember we want to close
the dialog and go to the main page when
I was my failure we want to flip across
to the era dialects we're just popping
in the original Co here however it's the
success we no longer want to fetch our
data from a hard-coded array object
rather we want to fetch this from MCs so
now that we have a dedicated user by the
entity K we can then call the mobile
backend custom code invoke custom code
gates and request method passing in the
endpoint and the operation this in turn
allows us to define success and failure
callback function
methodical back we're just going to be
lazy and at a console of error message
but in the success callback will then
provide the results to listviews data
source that we saw right back earlier in
the video okay I'm saving our work
that's everything drove all the see if
it all works
so upset
when we log into it failed one a lot if
we open the chrome debugger which can
attach the Android emulator we can see
in the background that the application
is having a core there're so fixes we
need to add the running apps IP address
the emphasis security allow origin
policy to add a cause of attention now
what a quarter the app runs on Android
this is ten point zero point two point
two point eight thousand for iOS this is
1 to 700 one for 8,000 to make this
change we log in to emphasises user
interface from the administration page
fill in the policy file
- it
and change the security of our origin
policy to listen to addresses unsafe
then upload the silences
then once loaded we're good to go so
back to the app and we'll try the login
again
and this time we get success it is the
list of customer phone numbers fetch
from MCs fetch from our remote service
nice I promised you a practical
demonstration and building an article
jet application connecting to Oracle
mobile cloud service connecting to an
on-premises end-to-end all
demonstrations and development very
little slides I hope and seeing with the
whole end-to-end application coming
together in its Oracle code online
session you've got a real taste for how
easy it is book jet applications and to
build MCS application hook them together
to serve your on-premise data
I brought the session has been useful to
you my pleasure to presented to you
today and I hope to catch you in another
Oracle video very thing the remaining
time in this session is set aside for
your questions please use these final
few minutes to submit your questions via
the Q&amp;amp;A widget
you
less than five minutes remain
for any final questions for this session
please take advantage of the Q&amp;amp;A widget
