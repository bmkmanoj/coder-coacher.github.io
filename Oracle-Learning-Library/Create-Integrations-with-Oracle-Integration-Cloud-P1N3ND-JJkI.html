integration cloud how do i integrate a
source connection and a target
connection then map Business Objects and
services between them quickly using
integration cloud I'll show you how to
create an integration the connects
Oracle RightNow with Oracle sales cloud
efficiently without any coding and
without installing or managing any
infrastructure to do this from the
integration cloud home page
I select integrations and click create I
select the map data pattern I give the
integration a name which automatically
generates the identifier I provide a
description for the integration and
click create the integration is
successfully created first I add
connections to the integration you can
see how I created these connections in
another video in this series I'm using
the Oracle RightNow connection as my
source connection I drag and drop the
source connection onto the canvas enter
the endpoint name and say what the
endpoint does then I click Next now I
can trigger the request process since I
want to receive organization objects in
the request I select organization from
the list and click Next
because this is a one-way flow and
there's no response required I select
none and click Next
I review the information and click done
the designer now shows information based
on how I configured the source
connection I repeat these steps to
configure oracle salescloud as my target
connection I drag and drop the
connection onto the canvas enter the
endpoint name and say what the endpoint
does then I click Next I select services
and then account services because I'm
creating an account in Oracle sales
cloud I want to make sure the option
create account is selected and click
Next I review the information and click
done and I save the integration now that
the source and target connections are
configured I'll use the mapper to map
the data between the two connections
using the mappers covered in another
video in this series
when I complete the mapping I specify
business identifier to allow the
messages to be tracked using the
monitoring dashboard the integration is
complete and is ready to be activated to
learn more about Oracle integration
cloud check out the other videos in this
series thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
