applications with social networks for
user authentication social login allows
users to authenticate themselves to
applications using their credentials
from a social network provider and
accomplishing this with Oracle Identity
cloud service is simple here for example
a user accesses an application that
requires authentication the user is
redirected to the Oracle Identity cloud
service login page where the user can
choose to log in via Oracle Identity
cloud service itself or via various
social network providers here the user
chooses to login via Google and after
entering their Google credentials is
successfully logged into the application
let's take a closer look at how to
configure this in Oracle Identity cloud
service first access the Google
developer site and create a new project
then configure our client ID credentials
for this project configure the OAuth
screen consent by providing the name of
the application as Oracle Identity cloud
service you can also add further
information such as the privacy policy
and the Terms of Service URLs select the
web application type and provide both
the authorized JavaScript origins and
the redirect URL both URLs must use your
Oracle Identity cloud service domain
name a client ID and client secrets will
be issued this information will be
needed during the Oracle Identity cloud
service configuration log into the
Oracle Identity cloud service console
and access identity providers and add a
social identity provider for Google
select the type Google enter the name of
the social identity provider and then
enter the client ID and client secret
that was issued by Google the Google
social network will appear in the list
of integrations activate it and
configure it to appear in the login
screen now you need to assign the social
identity provider to either the default
identity provider policy or a new one in
this example you assign the Google and
local identity providers to the default
identity provider policy alternate
Sibley you can choose to create a new
identity provider policy and assign the
social identity provider for Google to
it you then assign your registered web
application to this new policy now when
users try to log into the application
Oracle Identity cloud service gives the
option to login with their Google
credentials because you assigned only
the Google identity provider to the
policy it's the only one that appears in
the sign-in page if the user has not
been previously registered in Oracle
Identity cloud service then the user is
asked to register before accessing the
web application you can also add other
social networks the steps are almost the
same just be sure to retrieve the client
ID and secret from each social network
developer site and to provide the Oracle
Identity cloud service callback URL in
each of them register social identity
providers for these social networks
assign them to an identity provider
policy and then the links for the
identity providers appear in the sign-in
page to learn more visit us online at
