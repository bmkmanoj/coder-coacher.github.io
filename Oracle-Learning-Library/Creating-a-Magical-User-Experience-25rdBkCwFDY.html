of all languages I can look into my
session on creating a magical user
experience first a little bit about Who
I am my name is danno Ferran I am a
software developer by trade I have had
that kind of a passing interest in magic
my whole life you can see right here I'm
actually doing magic tricks at my
nephew's birthday party and that's my
son there poking his head out doing a
little bit of cups and balls i'm also an
open source contributor I've contributed
code to the groovy project I mean
co-founder on a framework called the
Griffin framework which is a swing in
javafx desktop client sweet and I'm also
been interested in magic my whole life
however I am NOT a magician and we'll
get into why I say that I am NOT a
magician even though i like to do magic
tricks and even though i'm interested in
this oh forgot to plug my book i wrote a
couple chapters and andre's all mary is
Griffin an action book which
unfortunately was not in the store and I
think it might be back in stock in
Amazon I don't know they were running
low on one point but who do I work for I
work for a company called intelligent
software solutions I actually right
swing code for living all day and I've
been doing that for nearly 10 years now
at various companies in the colorado
springs area to the products we have
their web Taz is the product i work on
and the other one is called sydney if
any of you have been quote unquote in
theater in Afghanistan Iraq there's a
chance you've heard of one of those two
products on there pretty big out there
we're actually headquartered in Colorado
Springs Colorado we have offices in
Denver Hampton DC Rome New York Boston
in Tampa and just like every other
company here yes we are hiring if you
want to go to the job page and look at
it we are a defense contractor so you
need to be clear I'll ultimately so the
question probably everyone here is
thinking at some point is why magic did
I just want to get a free ticket to Java
one by performing a few parlor tricks in
front of a crowd I mean maybe I should
have submitted to talk on method
dispatch or maybe programming languages
I did they turned him down this was the
talk they took so you know I tried my
best but as I researched this it's
actually surprising just how well some
the concepts that go into creating a
good magic show and a good magic trick
or the exact same concepts that you have
put into making a good user experience
for your application now I use the word
user experience user experience as a
word that's really come into vogue more
so in the past five to ten years because
it extends to more than what the old
word that we used to use which was user
interface usually in the frame of
graphical user interface user experience
extends more to just the experience
between the human and the computer it
extends to you know how you
conceptualize the way you work with your
application the way that it's delivered
to you I mean it extends all the way to
how macbooks are shipped and how to put
in the box and you open it up and you
can open it right up and you get a nice
beautiful screen helping you get in so
it's those on those little extra things
beyond just the pixels on the screen
that really help you get a better
experience but the letters you I were
not always for a user interface when I
was researching this I learned that Alan
Kay back in the 1960s and 70s when he's
working on the alto project in Palo Alto
he first coined the phrase as user
illusion at the time computers you know
you you if you were lucky you had a
green screen more likely you had a
teletype machine spitting out letters
and numbers at you and you give him a
stack of punch cards to make it work so
when you put a television screen in
front of somebody and you tell them it's
computer they don't believe you and that
actually kind of worked in his favor
because what he wanted the user to do
with the computer to make it personal
was they didn't want to think of it as a
1960s big box room full of computer he
wanted it to think that you were working
on a desktop working on a piece of paper
you were writing a letter so he was
talking about creating the illusion of a
piece of paper on the screen using
graphics i'm using borders and shadows
and corners and the pointer was the
illusion of you interacting with that
illusionary piece of paper and like all
desktops you have more than one piece of
paper on it so that's where the
overlapping windows come in you move
stuff around and he act on the desktop
so back in the 1960s this is a big deal
for people to
work with computers like they would work
on their desktop it was really
revolutionary and when I think of the
phrase user illusion I thought you know
maybe I should have had another name for
this talk you know user illusion one
lies it's a little guns and roses
reference so if I give this talk again
next year javaone i'm probably going to
call it user allusion to the skeuomorph
incident again the spaghetti incident
was another one of the guns and roses
albums we'll get this cute morphism a
bit later but right now let's talk a
little bit about human behavior you're
probably familiar with the concept of
taken psychology of Maslow's hierarchy
what this is is this is layers of ways
that people act that bill there we go
it's not showing here how it's building
out there that's kind of annoying but
it's showing 5 different layers of the
way that people act in a given situation
in most cases give it a situation if you
are hungry and starving you are going to
take risks you ordinarily wouldn't take
but if you're full and you've had a good
meal and a line is chasing you you're
going to run away from that lion whereas
if you're hungry you're going to try and
kill the lion and eat it and it goes up
to socialization you know once once
you're safe you're gonna you're going to
seek out friends and then self-esteem
you're going to seek out friends that
you like and that like you know it's
some people it's more important to have
friends that have people that friends
that like you and once you have friends
that like you you're going to go up to
the final level of Maslow's hierarchy
the very peak of the pyramid and that is
to try to be the best person that you
think you can be once you have fulfilled
all those four base needs you cannot you
can you can fulfill that so let's do a
little bit around almost as long as art
is art is art is art as we existed
magic as we know it since dave is if
it's roughly 2,000 years and the very
first trip was a trick called the cups
of the boss we have evolved we have a
cup in on up so if it's really simply
take the ball and this was done by you
know old charlatans of time thank you
keep our money i'm just going to do one
long one cup you know you take the ball
you could in various places not going to
choose my pocket get some hot spot
optimizations and we top of
optimizations you know keeping that ball
as a problem gone except it's not really
gone i'll be done we just hit somewhere
else Oh magic tricks um it works on a
hierarchy enough you don't trick wrong
you know I'm kind of rooting here so if
it's done properly you know you see this
magic wand and then you see me waving
scarfs and if I do it poorly it just
kind of falls apart looks kind of silly
so your applications similarly to become
magic need to work on a similar
five-step hierarchy that begin with your
application must be functional they must
do something applications that do
nothing don't go very far I mean at
least those those noise apps on your
iphone do something you know they
ringing a cowbell or whatever noises
they want to make the next step is that
your application must be reliable it
must be willing it must do the themes
that you expect it to do every time you
try and do it then it has to be usable I
mean if it reliably makes a noise it's
going to sit in your pocket unless you
happen to have the right time to play
that noise application that keeps you
updated with your social network is you
can get far more use than that finally
it needs to be efficient I mean imagine
if you have a excel table and you had to
delete each one of your 500 rose
manually that would get tedious but if
you could select all 500 one of your
rows at once and then delete them with
one step that makes a better application
but finally once we have all four of
these levels filled finally your
application can work on becoming a truly
magical application just like a magic
trick if you don't have the base
down if you don't have the things
prepared that you need for your
application to work who cares what what
cool visual graphics have going on in it
and what what special effects you have
going on if it crashes all the time
nobody cares it's got to be efficient
it's got to be usable reliable and
functional it's got to be stable before
you can go to the top of that hierarchy
now success is fleeting here I have what
I consider to be two of the most
important applications in the past 20
years and you know the progenitors that
made these things most famous on the
first one from the 20th century is the
internet browser and that is of course I
believe it's the second version of
Netscape I found a picture for version
20 we don't use in that scape today you
know it was a big major game changer and
it was magical and was awesome but we
don't have it today it's similarly with
iTunes itunes probably innocent sense
than the internet browser the most
important application to change the way
that we interact with the world if you
look at Apple stock rise it didn't start
until you didn't start going straight up
until the day that they release the
itunes music store they replay replaced
they release the ipod people yond there
please they release the ipod for windows
people yawn they gave you the itunes
music store up up up so what this is
it's it reliably gets music on your iPod
or iPhone from it from it from people
selling it and getting all those record
companies to agree to one standard was
truly a magical trick however failure is
forever if there's one thing that the
version 6 of the iOS operating system is
going to be remembered for its how bad
the maps are even when they fix it even
when they get it right it's going to
have a bad reputation that's why people
stopped using Netscape they released
Netscape version for way too early it
was full of bugs it wasn't reliable and
blew up on a regular basis and people
said you know what I'm going to start
using Internet Explorer it wasn't so
much that a Microsoft beat Netscape in
that case more that Netscape pulled
defeat from the jaws of victory in that
situation now whenever you see people do
magic tricks invariably they're going to
ask you know well how do you do the
trick and the magician is always going
to not tell the trick because there's
three well established rules of magic
they're probably going to tell you when
they do their magic trick the first rule
is never reveal the secret of the trick
to the audience if you know the secret
it's not magic anymore it's just slide
of hand it's just juggling it's
acrobatics it's not magic anymore the
second rule is to never do the same
trick twice for the same audience and
the reason is you want to keep them
wondering like Jerry Seinfeld said he
feels that mower he gets off the stage
where they still want more and if he
does more it would provide actually less
that's the moment you want to keep them
wanting more so that's why you never do
the same trick twice because you know
people think of reason to do the same
trick twice as people might figure out
the trick but then you're feeling their
needs it's not that they're going to
figure out is that you give too much of
it and the third rule is to never let
the audience see your secret
preparations if they see that the the
bunny is not in your hat but he's
hanging you know on a bag on the side of
the table they're going to see the trick
coming tricks are most effective when
you don't see it coming when you're
surprised and astonished by it when you
don't expect it that's when it's best
now there's more than rules that
magicians work by than just the rules of
the show there's rules the magicians
operate by within magicians themselves
and back in the vaudeville times before
a magician would share his tricks with
another person they would usually make
him swear an oath and this is why I say
I'm not a magician I have never sworn
any such oh and the oath is basically
this says that as a magician I promise
never to reveal the secret of any
allusion to a non magician unless that
one in turn swears to uphold the
magician's oath I promise never to
perform any illusion for a non magician
without first practicing effect until I
can perform it well enough to maintain
the illusion of magic and this is
something the magicians would hold each
other to I mean it started breaking down
in the 70s and 80s and 90s with
television and the internet and just
about any trick out there you can look
on the internet figure out how they do
it like Penn &amp;amp; Teller's Magic Bullet
trick no one's figured out all nine
secrets that Penn &amp;amp; Teller do but they
pretty much figured out the most of it
but even then when you know the secret
it's pretty good show to go watch it's
pretty entertaining so even magicians
you know when they share with each other
they keep these rules to work with
themselves they also form organizations
the magician's circle is ISM ism
magic organization based mostly in the
United Kingdom and their oath which is
written in Latin and I don't quite know
what the Latins for that is how to
pronounce it but I did know that the
English translation the rough
translation says that they are not apt
to reveal secrets so you're going to get
in this fraternal order and you're going
to share your tricks with everyone on
the premise that your tricks are safe
with everyone in the room that knows
your magic tricks it's it's a big ol
thing a trust the reason why it's
important to keep some of these magic
tricks secret is a little literary
concept called the suspension of
disbelief and this was coined by a man
named Samuel Taylor Coleridge if
anybody's seriously studied English
literature I'm sure you've heard of him
I had to go to Wikipedia figure this out
and in the part where he was where he
was quoted for bringing up the fray
suspension of disbelief it was coupled
with another term that I found really
relevant to magic into your applications
probably more true applications in a
magic show the suspension of disbelief
only really works when there is human
interest in a semblance of truth for
example let's take the story of a young
farm boy who doesn't like his life on
the farm and he finds an old knight who
in turn teaches him the secrets of the
knighthood and then he learns that there
is this princess that is his is hidden
up in this dark nights stronghold so he
goes he invades a stronghold rescues the
princess and then destroys the
stronghold and that sounds like a very
compelling semblance of truth that's not
like something that could happen but
when I tell you that this whole story
happens in space takes the entirely
different turn I've just described the
plot for Star Wars so you get these
human interest and you know without
without the young farm boy who doesn't
want to become a moisture farm and be
stuck on tan to eNOS whole life you know
the number of people who want to watch
you know laser battles and start and
Starfleet and start stars blowing each
other starships playing each other up
and there's still people that want to
see that but it's significantly less you
get a good story in and you cater to the
whole audience so let's talk for a
minute about these two characters on the
left this is the sort of person you
might find in a back alley around here
in San Francisco with his cardboard box
and and he's got a deal for you if you
can tell him which one
these three cards holds a queen he'll
double your money I mean let's do the
math two-thirds odds to 21 payback yes
and then there's the man on the left and
what he says is hey give me fifty
dollars up front and I'll make things
disappear now the man on the left is
your typical con artist and what he's
using is he's going to use the same
techniques of magic to do his trick I
mean it seems like a good odds you know
three two thirds oz for a 2-1 payback
you're going to lose all your money
there are so many magical tricks that
they use between crowd plants and and
sleight of hands and card flipping and
sometimes just plain old dumb luck that
you're gonna lose all your money and
you're going to be upset about it when
you start following people like this
other man and this man is called David
Copperfield this is a picture from 1970s
before he became really famous if you
start you know paying your fifty dollars
up front to see him you're going to be
spending fifty dollars again to see him
and again and again and again the
difference is this time you're going to
feel good about it what separates these
two characters what's the difference
they're using the same tricks they're
doing the same things once dressed a
little better expectations actual
clothes ethics you have the expectation
that these guys are going to perform in
an ethical manner the card shark on the
street you expect him to rob you blind
or you're going to be robbed blind one
or the other and the magician you're
expected to walk into there and he's
gonna lie to you he's going to tell you
these outrageous lies in these huge
deceptions and you're expecting that and
when he's not good at lying to you
you're actually kind of upset what's
different ethics the difference is when
you go on when you go to see David
Copperfield feel perform he takes care
of you know things that are important to
be ethical and the card sharks they're
just to try and take your money I've
been in a fight for things that I think
that most magicians really need to to
take care of the first one is safety the
second one is integrity and then respect
and proactivity now the safety of the
magician he needs to be concerned about
the safety of both the performers and
the audience if there's a wild tiger on
stage and he asks for audience volunteer
to come up on stage he has the ethical
obligation to keep you safe similarly if
he's his magician assistant he's going
to put the magician's assistant in a
cage with a tiger needs to make sure
that the Tigers not going to eat the
magician's assistant the second one is
integrity these magicians need to keep
secrets we've already talked about the
society so they belong to and the OS
that they used to give to each other to
keep these magic tricks secrets they
expect the secrets to be kept and then
there's respect when a magician sees
another magician perform and he figures
out his trick there's a certain amount
of respect or you don't just take the
trick and you do the exact same trick
the exact same way I mean you might
learn some pointers you might learn a
new technique or two but when you take
another magician's trick you were under
obligation to make it your own you don't
just you know copy you steal and you
make it your own kind of like what Apple
does and finally proactivity Steve Jobs
own words finally there's the issue of
proactivity if you go to a real modern
ethical magic not some person who's
going to try and convince you that they
have paranormal powers but a real
magician he's going to do things that
are gonna make you think he has
paranormal powers but at least once
during the show either at the beginning
the end or maybe even multiple times he
is going to tell you that everything
that goes on the show is an illusion
he's going to he's going to tell you he
was going to lie to you that this is a
fraud and then he's going to do it he's
going to pretend like it's real and you
understand it's a stage show you can
suspend your disbelief you don't have
the expectation that he can actually
levitate cards out of his hand for real
it looks like it it has the effect of it
but he's going to tell you it's an
illusion so how do these apply to your
application first bit with safety
whenever your users trust data to you
you need to respect that trust and honor
net trust it's a sacred trust their
identity their information I mean
sometimes we're going to give you your
bank card information you need to
protect that when you're going to create
all these you could this magical
experience people are going to want to
use your applications and use your stuff
you need to be ethical and respect it
you need to keep the secrets that they
give you just like a magician keeps
their magic secrets if you're using a
proprietary API you need a respect the
developers that have given you that API
and the rules that they have for
interacting with it if you're using open
source software you need to respect that
life
integrity keep secrets and proactivity
from something goes wrong in your
application if there is a data breach
you have an obligation to tell them if
if if there's a chance of you they might
lose your data if your backup service
you need to outline it these are called
service level agreements you need to
tell them what they can expect from you
upfront ahead of time so that when the
data center goes down because there's a
giant wind storm on the East Coast you
can say well we told you we did our best
but we told you so the important thing
when writing your applications is don't
be unethical lense is probably an
example one of my favorite examples of
unethical uses of magical techniques on
the internet are you focusing on the ad
or you focusing on the content I mean
the placement is one thing but that's
you know that's just part of the game
but to have the motion and the
fluttering and a face and all the
interaction with it that's just not
right that's not ethical they're they're
using the very same techniques that you
might use to tell the user an alert that
hey it's time to go to your meeting so
let's go back to the rules of magic
discuss these for a little bit what is
the one unifying thing in all of these
three rules never never never okay
that's a good one I never thought of
that never never never in that rule is
broken often many times they do that if
you ever seen Penn &amp;amp; Teller do their on
cups and balls with clear plastic cups
that's that by the way is the fourth
rule of magic never ever do the cups and
balls with clear plastic cups and it's
an amazing technique if you want to go
see it and it works is what I think is
amazing what's common with these is the
audience all these rules talk about the
magician's interaction with the audience
the audience is what's important without
an audience there is no magic to be had
there is no performance it's you're just
practicing without a performer and
audience to perceive the performance
there's only one world to go to realize
when you're building your application
that you need to consider your audience
you need to think about your audience
and think of what they're doing now
there's many ways to separate your
audience members out there if there is
entire conference sessions about
how to adapt to your users but when I
think of this in a magical sense I split
it into three groups and I've got male
names for these groups and female names
on the right because it's important you
know pc gets a bad rap and sometimes but
I think there are some cases where it's
been proven that if you always use men's
names people are going to think Oh
astronauts are all men so in this case
I'm using Mint name and woman's name so
we got for the women we have Helen the
rock band heart and hair Monet those are
three groups and then the guys
equivalents will be Mike Metallica and
Merlin well we have here is just your
random normal user your entry level user
and then you have the rock stars they
know what they're doing they're awesome
on what they do but boy if they find a
brown M&amp;amp;M and that bowl in the backstage
they are going to trash the place true
story it happened about an hour south of
me and finally you have the geniuses the
people who actually know everything so
we could think of this in Harry Potter
terms as the muggles who don't know
there's a magical world the squib who
knows there's a magical world but aren't
magical and of course the Wizards and
the witches who know about the magical
world and our magical roughly speaking
people who don't know the trick people
who know the trick and this is the most
important distinction people who can
actually do the trick because I know how
a lot of magicians do a lot of their
tricks and I am in awe because there is
no way I could possibly ever pull some
of those tricks off so it's kind of cool
so how might you leverage these three
kinds of audience since a programming
environment so we have here first is
Alice this is a program that has been on
promoted in several Java once this is a
programming environment to teach mostly
kids how to learn how to program but
pretty much people who have no exposure
to programming before you got you got
this little this little Rover up here
that you're animating in this case but
you make scenes where people do stuff
and instead of thinking it as abstract
context to have people in scenes doing
things you have nice nice large you out
user interface items here there's not a
single curly brace in sight so people
can learn the concepts of programming in
this in this integrated development
environment now the rock stars they
might use something like IntelliJ or
netbeans i personally use IntelliJ
because everyone else in my office use
IntelliJ i would use netbeans if
everyone else did but in this case you
have a lot more power to do a lot of the
different things that you could do here
in this case I've got you know a
distributed version control system open
up but i'm looking at commits i have the
code i have the file layout i have a
bajillion things that i could do in the
toolbar let's see there is a there's a
you know open save undo redo cut paste I
probably used all of those at some point
although not frequently so this gives me
all the power that I need but the real
wizards kind of ruined it but they use
VI they don't need fancy code
completions they know what they're doing
in fact the real wizards could probably
just hack out the bytecode by themselves
if they really need it too so those are
those are the three ways that you might
leverage you uh you might leverage a
trick yeah okay so this here this is
probably the American version of what
will be the Magic Circle this is
something a place called The Magic
Castle it's down in Los Angeles and this
is the theater that all real serious
professional magicians aspire to be
admitted to in to perform in its it's a
big deal to get there it's a big deal to
be admitted there you're only you only
get there if you are a magician or if
you're coming with the magician who has
been admitted to the magic castle so
this is like the highest echelon but
what's interesting a note is in here
they don't have just one theater they
have three theaters because the type of
tricks that you do is different based on
the stage that you perform on there some
tricks that you would attempt in one
theater that wouldn't attempt in another
just because the nature of the way it
works so so leverage your blood with
your stage when you do your application
so the three theaters that they have in
the magic castle or the close-up gallery
basically the Quillen of what someone
who is street busking might do the
second one is the parlor
prestidigitation more of a family room
or living room type setting where you
would get together and do magic tricks
on on a closer scale there's a there's a
theater just a few blocks from here then
I'm kind of bum they didn't do shows on
Monday Tuesday or Wednesday
I have a flight at seven so I can't go
see one of their shows it supposed to be
a really good place and the third stage
a to perform on is the Palace of mystery
these are the large stage effects this
is where you might you know roll a
locomotive on stage you get a really
quiet and really fast hydraulic lift to
make it disappear that way and you know
the tricks you do in a close-up gallery
you got to realize that people might be
at all angles of you so the tricks have
to work 360 degrees around when you in
the parlor prestidigitation you have 720
you can block some stuff and you can
bring stuff with you you can bring your
suitcase of tricks and set up your own
little platform most of the tricks that
I'm doing today are of the parlor magic
variety and finally have the palace of
mystery people are sitting in an
audience they have a stage they have one
perspective on the trick if you see
these these stage magic tricks from
behind you've ruined the trick and you
know what's going on but usually if
you're seeing the trick from the back
side of the trick you're a page stayed
HAMP paid stagehand and you know what's
going on so I might ascribe these two
three different platforms that we
technically target web applications of
course be the close-up gallery because
you've got to bring everything with you
when you do a web application you want
to use nodejs guess what you're
downloading it you bring it to the web
page when you load it up the second one
is desktop application you generally
install these if you need something you
install it you have it there and
prepared you can bring some stuff but
you can't bring other stuff and the
third one this is probably head
scratcher some of you people an embedded
device it's actually the smallest of the
two platforms but why would I put it in
the biggest stage the reason i put the
embedded device for the biggest stage is
that in an embedded device you control
everything you control the chips that
are in there you control the shape and
the hardware of it you control the tints
of the screen you control the angles
that they look at and it you can't
reenter ole absolutely everything in
these so again web applications when you
run your web application you pretty much
have to bring everything with you and
load it caching helps in this regard but
technically on your web page you're
saying bring this with me desktop
applications you will install the code
and embedded devices it's all on the
chips so here's three different
techniques of the video stages of how
people do video
first one is YouTube that's technically
seen on a web page they use flash they
use the codec that flash has they bring
all their graphical user interfaces with
them every time which is really nice
when they want to change your design
it's just changed it bring it with them
the second one would be VLC this is a
video codec program for windows and mac
and linux and this program plays every
video and audio codec out there that's
their point that's their pride and joy
if you have a dot AIF file that you need
to play you play it on VLC you don't
even try with quicktime and windows
media player you don't try with all that
kodak mess it has it but the trick is
it's it's kind of a large program it's
got to bring every single codec for
decoding it with you and the third
example is an old competitor for tivo
called the replay TV in an interesting
piece of trivia for the tivo not the
tivo that the replay TV is when they
bought it they bought knowing that they
are buying some defective mpeg-2 chips
there were some defects in the encoding
that it didn't feed the fit the mpeg-2
standard but it was reversible you
encoded it with this flaw you decoded it
with the flaw and it looked fine but you
know what it's it's a sealed box you're
not getting any video off of that unless
you're doing it through television set
so who cares about the mpeg-2 standard
we control all the chips we control the
reading and the writing we don't need to
interact with the other world we control
the stage they're leveraging the stage
of their of their big stage there to
control absolutely everything in their
effect so who's in the mood for another
magic trick don't have a lavalier mic so
I'm just going to have to do it kind of
up here but here we have you know our
typical deck of cards so I need a
volunteer from the audience to pick a
card all right now I want you to show it
to the audience lift it up in case you
can't see that card is the three of
clubs
it gets more impressive seven one two
three four five six seven now an
interesting fact about this car this is
Penn &amp;amp; Teller's favorite car because it
is easy to detect at a distance that
there's three of them and the clubs is
easiest shape to recognize now this
trick isn't all that special you know
when you stack the deck with nothing but
the three of clubs it's a technique
called forcing a card and stacking a
deck is the easiest way the really good
magicians will use they can you slide in
hand actually make you pick a specific
card out of it if they're really good at
it I'm not that good I gotta cheat but I
gave me the suggestion that you had a
choice and it's really interesting we're
like halfway through the talk more
finally talking about techniques of
magic so let me let me let me step back
a little bit and tell you that the setup
and the preparation for magic is easily
half the time you got to think through
your application and setting up these
these magic these magical effects you
really got to plan it through planning
is half of execution the plan is useless
but the process of planning is priceless
and creating these magical effects so
let me get back to suggestion and the
illusion of choice so when I force that
card you have the illusion that you had
a choice you thought you could pick any
one of those 52 cards in the deck and it
would work just fine kind of like an eel
in the architect in the matrix it at
some point you got to give them a choice
whether or not they realize it and then
the matrix you know they actually had a
legitimate choice to make but your users
sometimes don't know the choices that
are presented to them and the trick is
you know you got you got think about it
and Murphy's Law you know if there's two
or more ways to do something and one of
them can always result in catastrophe
then someone will do it now that's
probably not how you heard the law but
it's proving the law because there's
many ways to state the law you've
probably heard it as if anything can go
wrong it will go
Google anything can go wrong it will go
wrong proving the law it's not
catastrophic and there's two ways to do
it and someone's done it so in creating
your choices for the users you really
need to got to realize that if there is
some choice that they can make whether
or not you're giving it to them they
will do it at some point even if it's
the keyway staff trying to find ways to
break your application it's better that
they find it before one of your users
find it now choice when you give you
choices illusion one of the things that
you can do to help this is is you would
limit the choices that a user could make
and they need to prepare for every
possible choice finally you need a
tailor your choices to the audience
because some people if you give them the
wrong sets of choices are going to say
no I don't want a RB i want see give me
see so you need to anticipate the things
that are going to want and it's kind of
a trick you know when you when you
prepare for your audience when you go
back to those three groups of audiences
the the joe user the rock star and and
the genius you really can only
effectively target two of those groups
if you try and target all three it's not
going to go that well it's best if you
can just target one but if you target to
you can kind of fake it so here's an
example of how you might effectively
manage the choice for someone who really
doesn't know what they're doing this is
get for windows it looks like a
smartphone app it's got nice you know
colors they're not scared by all these
hash codes that are being thrown at them
we kind of hide that but there's a
couple of important things you can't do
a pusher quest from get for windows yet
that's not something they expose and you
can't work with multiple remote
repositories now somebody who is new to
version control probably has no clue of
those what those two things are and what
I just said and they're happy to have an
application that they can create a
virgin tree of directories save stuff
commit stuff and go back and get to it
to them those few choices are magical
this is a revelation to some people that
you conversion your stuff and go back in
time and get it I mean look what Apple
did with Time Machine it's basically an
elaborate version control system you
delete your file you plug your hard
drive in you come back with a ninth
darfield and scroll back and go back in
time or something and you get your
information
and the people who know a lot about you
know the file system say oh they're just
you know committing the caches and and
storing the the log file and just
rolling it back and rebuilding it
they're not terribly impressed but
somebody who knows nothing about
computers and no that's you know had the
experience that when you delete a file
it's all gone this is impressive to them
now a squib might use something like get
integration in there in their integrated
development environment it gives them
more of their options it gives them the
options to use in this case I'm showing
the multiple remotes that you can use
inside of IntelliJ Eclipse and netbeans
have the similar capabilities you can do
a lot more the exotic operations like
stashing your changes and I'm stashing
them of doing gateway octopus merges
with seven different remotes you can do
all the crazy stuff in here but a real
wizard you know if you wrote it you
don't use these fancy tools you use the
command line that's what Linus does
actually Linus goes into the goes in the
files and edits of himself but you know
when your step below Linus when you're
one of his lieutenants use the command
line tools have been written and you got
to deal with ugly things like hash codes
sha hash codes and you gotta you gotta
really understand the difference between
a blob and a directory is and you know
you you got to know where you are in
your file tree and all sorts of other
things but these people these people are
geniuses they wrote get this stuff
doesn't scare them and they look at this
I think well I could improve it this way
and I probably go in and do it directly
and improvement so the choice is you
know when your when your when your
genius you need to have more choices
it's harder to write for them and
there's no way I would throw a command
line in front of someone who has never
used a source control tool before it's
just too confusing so the next technique
a classic magical technique is the
technique of direction sometimes when
you're doing a trick the effect is going
to happen in some place where they don't
expect it to happen which is the point
of the magic trick so you need to get
the audience attention control to where
the magic trick is going to be now
there's only two techniques I'm going to
talk about today because there's things
like fonts and colors and all sorts of
other things but I'm going to talk about
motion and faces our brains still work
on instinct I mean for a long time we
were used to looking for things moving
on the edge because they might be
threats they might be dangers you know a
rock falling from a mountain on us could
kill us if we don't move fast
similarly faces when you're in the field
when you're in the field when you're
when you're out when you're out in the
world and you run to a human being the
first thing you need to do is you need
to identify is this a friend or is this
a foe and the way that you do that is
you look at their faces the faces are
the most unique things about humans so
these things you know they're needed you
know they're they're really important
things that have been in our minds and
instincts and they're so hardwired they
are the first things that we go to so
here's an example for motion this is the
is going to start playing this is um
this is from Stack Overflow a website
that we all use and the categories that
they have here for their for their
health topics are not in the same order
that same placement of the icons in the
menu because the icons make sense in one
sense and the ordering of the help make
sense in another sense so what they do
is when you click on the heading to get
information about it they bounce up the
icons there possibly far away from the
help and they're relying on your
peripheral vision to associate that
particular help topic with that
particular with that particular icon
it's probably the best use of motion
I've seen in an application in my life
it's it's really subtle it's really
effective now the second one and you're
going to want to watch this put your
eyes right in the middle and don't look
on interfaces and I promise you all of
these faces have not been touched they
have not been altered in the slightest
bit but what's going on is your brain
does not have enough time to process all
of the details of the faces it only has
time to get the highest priority
information so by the time it has to
clear its cash it's only can remember
the most important parts and it usually
exaggerate them so these faces are going
to look very grotesque and very
exaggerated the longer that you stare in
the middle
and they're actually pretty people you
know they're absolutely visually
attractive people in this example but
when you're trying to compare them that
fastly it just doesn't look right and
that's because our brains are absolutely
focusing on processing the parts of the
face so when you're I see a face and
application there immediately going to
go for it try and recognize it within
the first five tenths of a second so
here's an example of how you might use
faces in an application you're probably
seeing it all over the place and don't
realize it any of the designs that have
had user icons that event 11 faces have
always settled on putting the face to
the top into the leading edge of the
text that you are reading across Western
cultures it's going to be in the top
left for some of the Middle Eastern and
Eastern cultures are going to put the
faces to the right of the status because
your face is going to your attention is
going to go there and they wanted to put
it someplace where you're going to start
reading so you're going to start reading
from the top left and get the attention
and if you just quickly glance on to
this page you're not going to see all
the texts on there you know you're not
going to see the jokes about Pearl Jam
and airfare tickets you're going to look
at the faces and that that Penn &amp;amp; Teller
magic trick on flag-burning it's not
what you think it is is actually pretty
effective but you know you got the face
here the face here here here here and
even even linkedin when you don't put a
user profile face in they put an outline
in its place because it's that important
to the layout it's that important to the
way that you're working with the website
so if you use faces be aware your
attention is going to go straight to
that face the very first thing assuming
nothing's moving on your page and it's
going to go there second and if the face
is moving it's going to go there
immediately so the next topic I want to
talk about I used to do in two parts but
it's really you have to do it in one
part simulation and dissimulation you
put these things two together and really
it's a form of magical disguise so what
does it mean simulate we all know what
simulate means it's you know to model
replicate duplicate behavior the parents
are properties up you're trying to make
it look like something that it isn't
dissimulate is actually the same thing
to hide or disguise by adopting a false
appearance you're trying to make
something look like something that it
isn't in this case to hide its details
simulate you're creating stuff that
isn't there and dissimulate you're
hiding it
so really you could think of this is the
double rainbow of magical disguise
things always almost always go together
so let's look at this thing this is a
cute little um a cute little log mill
out in out east of London you know we've
got the water wheel that spins there's
actual water in there we got a little
plow we got a cute little lake and does
anyone know what this thing actually is
garage closed it's not a garage it's not
a mill it's an electrical substation and
he wants to stare at that ugly thing in
the middle of your subdivision no you'd
rather look at the mill and say oh isn't
that quaint so that is simulating the
real functionality by simulating
something else that is simulating the
big ugly green box it's going to be in
the middle of a lake by putting a nice
rustic looking mill in the middle of it
simulation and dis simulation almost
always go together it's hard to simulate
something without dissimulated something
else it's hard to dissimulate something
else without simulating something else
here's another example from google
they're trying to dis simul it's it's a
if that it's their presentation
application and they're trying to
simulate that you're using a web page by
trying to make it look like an
application and and this is actually on
the page talking about from a talk I'd
be of previously and I swore I picked
this before the keynote I was talking
about the date component there and it
doesn't quite work though because
there's there's too many things that
that really betray its true nature even
when you maximize it and go full screen
and Mac application you still got on the
top here you still got this ugly this
ugly search bar they're putting up there
when you simulating to simulate
something it's not enough to get close
you have to get it completely or people
are going to obsess and focus on the
things that are wrong and when they
expect things to be there they're going
to focus on their absence which brings
us to a topic that is I'm currently the
big deal on a lot of the design blogs
the issue of skeuomorphism now ask you
morph its it came from archaeological
thing where they used to find pottery
that was made by technique that was
different from the old technique they
used to use metal rivets or some metal
marks on the pottery and they started
making it
and well with their fingers they would
still put the metal marks in as though
it was created by metal they don't use
that technique anymore and just like
your jeans the rivets on your jeans
ninety percent of that little ribbon on
there is useless that little thing in
the middle is what's holding the genes
together because they're made of steel
when there are made of brass they needed
the whole rivet why do they still put
the rivet there people expect it to be
there it reminds them it makes them feel
safe and let's look at some of these
icons these icons are from microsoft
office for mac when was the last time a
mac load of the floppy disk my printer
doesn't look like that i don't think
i've ever used a clipboard to save my
clippings on usually i'm handing it to
some something to somebody is saying
sign here and you know we don't really
create a paper we you know but the only
thing on here that's not really
skeuomorphic is this icon does anyone
know what that icon the second from the
left does new document from template and
that's kind of what the window looks
like when you bring it up if you were to
scale it down to 32 by 32 pixels and
they're probably gonna be stuck with
that for the next 15 versions of office
they've created their own new skeuomorph
but Apple is big on these real-world
simulations here is an example of I book
and what's interesting about it is you
got the little pages here you got a
little leaves like on here on the edge
of the pages you have the the little
gutter in the middle and over here and
you know you still got your buttons up
here and you got your page indicators
down there but what's important is when
you hand this to somebody who has never
seen a book reading application before
they look at this and I say oh this is a
book and it has pages so I should expect
there's more pages and how do i turn the
page they're going to put their finger
on the page and they're going to try and
start moving it so the skeuomorphism I
think skew more from is great when it
helps aid the understanding of the
application when you're simulating real
world things that actually help you
understand what's going on with the
application you should do it and we're
probably going to be reading books like
this forever you know back when we're
not putting them on dead paper anymore
it's going to look like a dead paper
book and this is the wrong example of
skeuomorphism when I don't know if you
can see this at a distance but these
buttons are stitched
you know when I see something that
stitched leather I don't think it can
move and I think they're playing a trick
on me saying huh we'll let you think you
can unsubscribe from this emailing list
but now you're subscribed and and who
stitches leather onto onto wood paneling
it's you know and this comes from a
website named skewed they've got all
sorts of these ske uit but this was one
that they bagged on they've actually
think it's actually a fairly good
indication of what what skeuomorphism is
about they are making fun I don't know
if you can tell it to the distance but
there's these little ridges on the
button and these little ridges what they
tell me put your finger on it and move
it to the side if I even had a smooth
button I wouldn't know what I tap it
would I nudge it from the side would I
shake it but those little ridges I
remember seeing stuff like that as a kid
you touch it you move it to the side and
when they have the on in the off words
it sells you another thing this is a
toggle so it's these these these subtle
little contextual cues that they use in
skeuomorphism to tell you how to use it
you don't have to read a 50 page manual
to figure out how to use this control
although some people are going to have
to write this manual up anyway so more
than graphics you're going to want it to
simulate and simulate your interactions
and this is another picture that I swore
I picked before the keynote on this is
reader rabbit and in this case they're
teaching kids how to use coin money
which may become a skeuomorph in its own
right if mint chip gets its way but what
they're really doing with the kids there
with these cute animated animals with
these stories with these compelling
interactions they're actually teaching
these kids they're tricking the kids
into educating themselves so the
behaviors that they're doing are being
dissimulated and simulated into various
ways and they got to simulate the look
of the money on there so when a kid sees
a coin in the real world they'll accept
it and understand it and you know when
they write this application for canada
and france and everywhere else they got
to change the coins but the interactions
are something there is important to
dissimulation this is about user
experience it's not about user interface
so here's one example of something that
you know we're probably de simulating
our interactions with it this is a
popular website stack overflow
you have a problem you post a question
people answer it the popular answers get
upvoted so ideally the best answers at
the top now you might think that the
point in this application is to create a
knowledge base of answers to questions
that are commonly found and in in the
early days that's what it started out as
but really it's become a recruiting
database to find out who answers which
questions the quickest and who gets the
questions right most often it's
something that they are starting to
leverage to make money they're selling
access its information to the recruiters
so that is simulating your interaction
you're you're demonstrating your
technical expertise and knowledge on
this website without actually having to
go through an interview or prove it by
revealing proprietary information
facebook is probably one of the the the
leaders in this this form of
dissimulation of of selling your data
you know I probably being a little too
hard on Stack Overflow on facebook i
don't know that i'm being that hard on
so so I've touched on this briefly nope
I'm supposed to do a trick here and you
know what you can use a different deck
of cards here this time I swear see it's
even the Java 1 2009 cards so here I'll
make it easy so what I'm going to do is
you know the routine i'm going to ask a
question and you're going to answer it
and ah I was actually so confident that
i wrote the answer right here on this
little notepad so go ahead and pick i'll
make this easy on you go ahead and pick
a card any card
okay show it to the audience is that
card the three of clubs no it is not
let's go go to me contacts you got to
get it right yeah the question I asked
is that the three of clubs the answer is
no when I give you that card and I say
pick a card any card six of diamonds
actually when you see a card trick you
thinking oh he's going to guess what the
card is but i told you i'm going to ask
a question and ask a question is at the
three of clubs no and the reason i knew
that the answer was no is that i took
the three of clubs and I shoved it here
in my little badge reel again another
cruel little trick but you think in that
context that I'm going to do one thing
and actually do another so that's the
importance of context these little
conscious and subconscious cues that
were given to people provide the context
of how you answer these these of how you
interact with it a little bit of context
is worth pages of manuals to tell them
what they're doing you know if they
don't have a document like in word when
you don't have a document that you're
editing you have nothing open there's
nothing on there when it's blank it's
there those little contextual cues so
here's another example of context it's a
little one of those spot the differences
thing can you spot the eight differences
now the context you're thinking is that
there's going to be eight different
things but what you're not expecting is
the eight different things your leg
number one leg number two leg number
three so the context and when you
realize the joke you started giggling
it's like are so foolish to see if I
love this the first time I saw this took
me over to realize that the joke was on
me that was just the eight legs that
were missing so the context is essential
so let's say I wanted to rate an
application I wanted to write something
as three stars how good is that I don't
know three stars is this three stars out
of four three out of four is are pretty
good whatever you know that's
seventy-five percent three out of five
not as impressive and what we're doing
here to community the context is we had
empty stars we have full stars so we're
community the context in this that there
is a five-star scale and then it's
received three of those five stars just
that little bit of context of filling
the star in and not having to start
there tell us the end user whether this
is a good or bad example but in this
case if I'm talking about a three-star
restaurant that I have you know
reservation a three-star restaurant
tonight most people who know about
restaurant ratings are going to you know
their jaws going to drop and say how did
you get that because in restaurants
restaurants are graded on a three-star
scale there is no stars which means it's
a restaurant there's one star yeah the
health department hasn't shut it that
was really what it means one star means
it's a good restaurant that you actually
want to eat there two stars means it's a
really good restaurant you really want
to eat there and this is this is from
Michelin the same tire company that
created this the star rating system they
had their little travelers book if the
restaurant was worth eating at they put
in the book who was a good one they give
it one stars it was really good they
give it two stars and if you should
drive out of your way to eat at that
restaurant they gave it three stars so
context know it goes two different ways
you know three stars sounds like a silly
thing to rate something but in the
proper context of restaurants a
three-star rating is awesome really it's
a 10 * scale and I start counting stars
at eight so the context operates usually
subconsciously you're looking at the
slide you're probably expecting more
because this one isn't centered properly
there's a lot of space there if there
wasn't more I'd be the top do it or
about doing on the center which goes to
an important thing context operates in
both directions your application can
communicate things to your user via
various contexts and similarly you can
learn things from your users in context
so this is Java one I have to do some
code I don't think it's in the contract
it'll make a sign a contract but I would
you know be remiss if I didn't put some
code in here and this is an example of
some swing builder code this is a groovy
framework that I wrote that does those
layouts it does the visual part of
putting a a GUI together
so here we have a panel and contained in
it or all these labels and so first let
me mention developers or users to when
you're creating a user experience you
got to realize that your developers are
going to be doing this experience to the
developers and another magical thing is
to put your code examples near the end
of the talk you can compress them if you
need to got about six minutes but what I
want to first start talking about is
this little line on the bottom and it's
kind of hard to see so I'll go ahead and
move it up top but right here up get the
laser button right here up here this is
a this is the calculating the hypotenuse
of a triangle we're squaring it and
we're getting a square root and what I'm
doing this application is I'm drawing a
triangle and calculating a size for them
so when I put this in context of a node
in my swing builder in groovy when I
have a labeled parameter text and I say
bind i'm giving it context i'm saying i
want this function as a closure the
braces hey it's a closure to be bound
what am I binding it too that's the
advantage of the name parameter text in
the runtime I can take this context from
the user that they have named the
parameter text and in context the label
happens to have a text attribute so it's
going to bind the value to that text
attribute when that equation changes
we're going to change the text on that
and it's really terse because we're
using as much context as we can get from
the end user to determine what
properties to change let's move it back
down similarly what properties to put on
some of these nodes is given by the
context I happen to be in a panel that
has been set with the grid bag layout
grid X grid y and anchor are not
actually properties on the label on the
j label but when i put it in context
with that grid bag container i can
figure out hey maybe I should take these
properties and actually apply it to the
layout and finally there is this random
variable model that in these scripts
when you see the full script is never
declared how do we know what model is
the context that there is from where it
lives in the file tree things way
outside where you might think might be
important or actually relevant and we
follow the conventions that are common
in rails and grails of matching up the
name of the view the model of the
controller
and what the framework does is it
automatically injects an instance of
that model into the script at runtime
all based on the context of where it
lives in the file tree and this is
something the developer has told the
runtime given that all the information
it needs in context context is a
wonderful thing context is a magical
thing with all the context in the world
you can figure out a lot of things try
and keep as much context and use as much
of it as possible because you can make
an efficient in a magical interface with
these magic so interview here are the
six items that have really talked about
there is the ethics that you really need
to consider when doing a magic trick and
you need to consider your audience you
need to leverage your stage your stage
is is very important um it's it's it's
an essential part of the magic trick and
when you give your users a choice
usually you're giving them the illusion
of choice you're limiting their choices
but you don't want them to know that
they're limited and simulation and dis
simulation or magical disguise in
context is a very powerful magical
technique one more thing now you put
these things together we have a context
of you know hey look I'm going to hand
up here out of thin air I do right again
I screwed the trick up so so let's go
back to Maslow's hierarchy in the first
four layers you got to do it you got to
practice it that's why I'm not a
magician but there's one more thing that
you need to remember is that when your
developer creating a user experience
there are two worlds there is the world
of the magician and there is the world
of the user the world of the magician is
what you are playing as a developer
creating this that someone else is going
to use whether they're another developer
whether they're an end user it is
reality and the users are in the same
reality they just have a different
perspective on it they're relying on you
as a developer to create a better
reality for them to help them understand
what is going on to help them use the
application because most magic tricks
when done properly you forget about them
but when they mess them up like my magic
cane trick they don't focus you know it
doesn't fall through and that's that's
the that's the paradox of a good user
interface developer when you do your job
right
nobody notices it's kind of an
unforgiving line of work but you know
that's that's just you know the thrill
of seeing a user use it and and not
realize that they're they're being
shepherded and heard it in the correct
way to user application efficiently it's
got to be one of the most satisfying
things out there to be able to do your
tricks right so like to thank you for
coming to coming to the next-to-last ha
the conference have a room this full
it's really a great feeling we got two
minutes a minute for questions if anyone
has any yes having the ridges which I
thought was the right thing to do yes
how do you balance between open sourcing
and keeping it secret the first thing is
if someone if you're using someone
else's open source code you need to
respect the license they've given to it
and really it's it's you know how much
do you want to give back to the
community if it's something that's a
general purpose if my company if is
specific to the line of work we don't
open source it we don't open source a
lot of stuff it's its government but you
know what I've seen generally is if it's
specific to the line of work and unique
you don't open source of if its
framework if it's if it's glue work
share the glue don't share the pieces
you're going together that's kind of
what I've seen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
