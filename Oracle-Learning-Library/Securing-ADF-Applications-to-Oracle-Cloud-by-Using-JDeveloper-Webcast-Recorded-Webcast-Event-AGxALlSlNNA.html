webcast is to familiarize you with some
of the capabilities and features of
Oracle cloud using jdeveloper so today
we're going to talk about securing PDF
applications in Oracle cloud using
jdeveloper so this is the disclaimer
notice standard Oracle disclaimer notice
basically it states that this webcast
does not commit Oracle to what I'm
demonstrating today and to get the most
out of this webcast it does assume that
you do have some experience with oracle
jdeveloper and ADF some experience grant
Java Enterprise Edition development
however if you don't have a lot of
experience with these technologies you
can still get a lot of the webcast
presentation today because you get a
chance to see how gay developerworks in
this webcast and how we can deploy
applications to Oracle cloud directly
from jdeveloper so for this webcast I
actually have installed the following
products the oracle jdeveloper 11g
instance which includes weblogic and
integrated weblogic server and i have a
license trial version of the Oracle Java
cloud service which we use to deploy the
application and what I want to do is
spend a little bit of time talking about
Oracle's public cloud so Oracle cloud is
a platform as a service of path system
which means that it provides specific
application platform services including
database we have database platforms
application server platforms which will
include the services as web services and
rest support for ADF but also continuous
integration tools storage and messaging
services just to name a few what we're
really interested in today is this one
this is a part of the Java cloud service
it's an identity management service
and we're going to use this identity
management service to create some fine
grained but to create a fine-grained
application security model does support
others as well so let's talk about that
so actually there's three different
approaches that oracle cloud provides to
security in the first the application
can take advantage very simply with us a
simple tag can take advantage of single
sign-on which places all of the
applications under a general
authentication model fuelers have to be
authenticated with the identity
management system but once they're
authentic ated with the identity
management system all of the
applications running under that in that
oracle cloud instance the Java cloud
service instance are accessible by the
users of that domain so this might be
useful if you had a particular domain
dedicated to your financial services
applications or financial services folks
to your HR applications for HR folks and
so on the second approach is the one
we're going to look at today you can
specify your own roles and users in
those roles and this gives you some very
fine grained a very fine-grained
approach to security so for example here
I have an application that's going to
use two roles a manager role in a
developer role managers will have access
to all the parts of the application
developers will have access to some
parts of the application so here i have
a user in that role John Smith when John
Smith authenticates with the system
using his user ID he will take on the
role of a manager and he loved access
authorization for all of the manager
components of the application pages
views clothes and so on Jane Doe as a
developer will have access only to the
developer portion she still has to
authenticate
she still has to sign in but once she
signed in her authorization will be
limited to the functions that are
visible to the developer role now they
mentioned there are three different
approaches the third is public access
and the public access basically turn off
SSO and role-based identity and
authentication and it allows basically
anyone who enters the URL into the
browser access to your application now
this might not seem like a wise idea but
you might want public access to some
front-end application that then requires
authentication for other functions so
for example shopping site like an Amazon
or Ebay you probably want public access
to the open parts of the application and
then authentication for purchasing or
making bids or so on so in this Web cast
we're going to apply the users and roles
to a simple idea of application here
here i have the application snapshot of
the application so i have this tuesday
component it at there's a button that
moves to another flaw and a calendar
component this isn't anything real
obviously as a dublin applications meant
to just demonstrate what we're trying to
demonstrate in terms of users and roles
but any user in the role of manager and
john smith will be one of those users in
that role will have access to all of
these components conversely our Jane Doe
user what we have access to the
components that are in the developer
role and the wine and component that she
has on that same page is the calendar
component so she does not have access to
the button that goes to second page or
to the day to zerg important
so let's take a look at this live with
my application year so I'm going to
share my desktop okay so hopefully
you're looking at my desk tub now and
here i have the simple developed
disability of application again it has
the three components it has a deep
choose your component it has a button
that actually navigates to a second page
and my calendar component now the way
that these components work is that they
are only visible to users in a
particular role so for example let's
click on the choose date component and
here I'll move this over here so you can
see a little bit more clearly so this
choose date component is only accessible
it only rendered to users who are
authenticated in the manager role okay
the calendar component on the other hand
is rendered when users are in the
developer role and finally just do work
button also renders in the manager role
so those are the components
so those are my components let's take a
look at the the rural definitions user
in rural definitions for this
application so I'm using a simple file
based security definition I have two
users I have John Smith his login name
is jay smith he is a manager of
developers when he his name is displayed
its John Smith notice that John being
the manager is actually in two rolls
he's in the manager role and the
developer role this gives him access to
all of the components on the page Jane
Doe our other user is in the developer
role and in the developer role she's
only assigned to the developer role
itself Chris straightforward so I have
the integrated weblogic server running
in the background I've deployed this
application as it sits as I'm showing it
to you to the integrated weblogic server
so let's take a look at at this
application let's actually run it so we
can go through the process so as it
opens up there's a opening page which
leads to my authentication page so here
let's first sign in as jay smith with
the password
okay so after authentication the first
page is rendered and all of the
components are rendered because we
authenticated with John Smith jaysmith
and Jay Smith is in two rolls and the
manager role and in the developer rule
which means that my date chooser
component shows my calendar component
shows and this button which leads to a
second page that has a simple color
chooser on it all of that works now
let's click this browser and restart it
go back and login again this time will
login instead of as John Smith login as
Jane Doe and Jane being a developer and
never being in the developer role only
has access to the developer components
in this case she only has access to the
calendar component so the next thing
that we need to do is to actually create
these users and roles in the cloud so
let me open up another tab here you log
in to my cloud instance again as I
mentioned before this is my cloud
instance this is a trial version these
trial versions are available to you as
developers for free for 30 days so you
can simply sign up at cloud oracle com
and for 30 days you'll have access to
two year old cloud services I have to
set the services in my cloud instance a
database which is currently down and my
Oracle Java cloud service so what I
really want to do though is to go to the
identity console where I'm going to
create my to users and then create my
two roles so let's click on manage users
I click on the search button that shows
me all of the users that are currently
in the identity system I want to do is I
actually want to create a user and I'm
going to create John Smith
let's make John Smith that's company to
come by the way the email address is
important only in that should be user
forget their password or should you want
to reset the password this is one of the
ways that you can send the password back
to user so as it as administrators of
the Oracle cloud you can have users and
then reset their passwords or move your
passwords this is how they get them back
so we'll give them a user name of Jay
Smith just as we did before put in a
password okay and create John Smith is a
user okay so John has been successfully
created let's go ahead and create our
other user this time we want to create
Jane Doe same thing will create Jane's
email address obviously I'm putting in a
faking understand but you would
ordinarily put in the email address of
the actual user
okay so it created the two users and we
can see that by clicking on the search
button again so here's my user Jane Doe
my user John Smith the next step is to
create roles for these two users to to
VN so i will click on manage users again
click the search button to see which
sorry click on manage roles click on
search to see what roles are available
the system right now I only have one
role besides the roles that the identity
manager uses for administration of this
system so let's create some rules
specifically I want to create a role
called manager okay the case is specific
is these are case sensitive and give
them a description we call him the
manager of developers create that role
and then let's create the developer role
and these are just developers okay again
will click on search to see that we've
created these two roles now let's assign
let's assign these roles to our
particular root users click on the
manager role and I want to assign
particular users to this role this is a
way that you would grant all your
financial people access to a particular
set of applications and so forth again
you can click the search button to get
the list of all the roles I'm going to
narrow this a little bit because I know
I only want users that start with the
letter J still quite a few of those okay
so let's pick John Smith he's going to
be the one person that I wanted to
manager role so now John Smith has been
assigned the role manager next let's
let's assign users to the developer role
click on a sign and here I want to
assign Jane Doe as a developer okay and
then one more time I need to assign John
Smith as a developer as well as well
okay let's see which roles the users are
assigned and let's go back to manage
users and click on our user John Smith
this tells us the John Smith is in two
rolls he's in the manager role and the
developer role and likewise if we
clicked on Jane Doe we would see that
she is in the developer roles okay so we
have now successfully created the roles
within cloud learn oracle java within my
Java cloud service next thing I need to
do is to modify my application so that
it will run and use these roles in the
cloud so let's come back here to to my
application and what I need to do is I
need to slightly modify the way of the
components are rendered the actual role
that they're using the Oracle cloud when
a user authenticates with the Oracle
cloud cloud will prefix the role name
with the Oracle cloud identity domain
name let's just go back and look at that
per second these identity these rolls
are in the identity domain of trial tra
il abwe so all of these roles we
prefixed by God identity domain so I
need to add an identity domain to each
of these components so let's start with
let's try this over here let's start
with my two
sir I'm going to do is I'm going to add
tr-808 l.a pwe trial abwe dot to the
front of my manager role so now when i
authenticate in the cloud i will get
this identity domain plus the
application or enterprise role-name okay
let's do the same thing for button TR IL
abwe this is a easy place two fingers
are said to be careful click on the
calendar TR IL e be da da ok develop
alright so we'll save that sister will
check her real quick trial e awwe
why it's good to check okay now we're
all set okay so now I'm like my
components are going to use the identity
domain properly the next thing I want to
do is to deploy this application to the
cloud and test it there so I have
already set up I've already set up the
I've already set up so that I can deploy
the application to my clocks are right
and basically I've already set up an
instance of cloud server on my
jdeveloper instance and I covered up by
the way in a previous a live
demonstration it's also available
through the oll or by example so you can
see how I did that in a previous example
so I'm leveraging this pre-existing
service that I've already connected to
mine jdeveloper and I deploy the
application there and down here we're
going to get some status of that
happening it's going to do the
compilation that's going to pass the war
file over to the cloud service and
install it there and in a minute what
we'll do is we'll get a URL that we can
use to test the application so it's
still in the process of deploying takes
a little while and so what we're going
to do once we get this URL we're going
to access the application through the
URL and we should go to the same process
of having to authenticate using the file
based authentication that I declared in
my jazz I'm data file it will append the
identity domain trial bbws BBW e to my
authenticated user names and i'll be
able to use those affiliated usernames
to access the components of my
application so still going here
ok
then we can do is we can determine
what's going on by looking at the status
here in my cloud service this will all
be to determine where this what the
status of my deployment is to the server
okay right now it says that it's still
running just taking a little while can
also view log messages to determine if
there's any issues of problems and I
don't have anything right now on the log
so things are looking ok let's go back
and see if we kind of status update yet
and yet
it doesn't typically take this long
going to refresh there we go I think
we're now yep still going oh oh I love
demos all right well let's give it one
more second here and then all right may
have completed so let's go ahead and
click this link
here we go okay it did complete waiting
for my status to come back alright so
again I'm going to do the same thing
this is the same application the only
difference is instead of running locally
in my integrated weblogic instance is
now running on the cloud so if I click
on start here I'll get to a file based
authentication let's start by
authenticating is John Smith a one
difference here sorry what I need to do
is to have the identity domain diem so I
need to make sure that he is trial abwe
jaysmith okay and enter the password
that i entered into the user when i
create a user account for john smith on
the cloud so now we're going to the
process of identity of authenticating we
come to our application and here we are
we are Charlie VW John Smith that's the
username we have access to our date user
component to our calendar components and
to the second page which is protected by
this button and if I login again um here
we go i finally got back my see if i can
log in again i think i'm going to have
to create a new session let's try this
yeah so this is the same as I mean
solving the same session credentials as
they did with the integrated version so
if I quit the browser and restart it I
basically eliminate my session I can
type in my or cut and paste in the URL
and this time I'm going to go in as
change Oh
endowment that's where I'm not surprised
by that okay well I must have messed up
the password when i created this user
any rate hopefully you get the sense
that the application that i created here
in jdeveloper custom love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
