service and the designer role the
designer normally works with a test
automation tool to create tests scripts
and scenarios and once he's done with
that he can upload them into Oracle
Enterprise Manager software library in
order to make them available for the
task users let's create a couple of test
assets so we create a functional test
asset and the way I do this is simply to
give this test asset a name potentially
a description and then upload already
created test automation script from my
file system and these are normally
self-contained
script zips from Oracle functional
testings and it gets uploaded into the
Oracle Enterprise Manager software
library let's upload a second test asset
so that we have a little bit more to
play one same procedure as the last one
so I have to give it a name and then
simply pick a file from my file
repository
once our scripts are uploaded into the
software library we can then ask the
administrator to make them available to
our users we're now logging in as the
test administrator and as you probably
have seen in previous demos you go to
the setup cloud section and testing and
here we need to go to the publishing
section and select what kind of test
assets we want to publish and whom we
want to give these to in our case we
want to publish on test assets so we
pick the test assets that have been
uploaded by the designer and then we
select which roles we want to provide
these assets to so we give it to the
test user and then we hit publish and
now we basically made those two tests
assets available for the test user now
let's complete the circle by logging in
as tas user creating our functional
tests with multiple test assets in it so
we log in we go to the my tests section
in the sub service portal followed by my
tests and here we can now create our
functional tests so we'll give it a name
and then we start adding the test asks
that we need and here you can either
select them one by one or do multi
select you can also move test assets up
and down and continue with defining your
tests and your trials this concludes the
demo thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
