several tasks need to be performed users
need to be created and assigned
appropriate role privileges connections
to so ax and service bus servers need to
be defined and reporting function needs
to be configured and enabled insight has
a variety of user personas each persona
has a defined set of roles and
permissions the areas of the application
a user can access vary based on the
permissions attached to the user role in
general it's common for a user to have
multiple role privileges for example
user Karl can be an admin a model
creator and an integration architect as
well the number of users and their role
permissions are governed by the business
need dave the weblogic administrator
creates new users and groups to
associate the users with insight roles
he logs in to the Oracle Enterprise
Manager Fusion Middleware control as an
administrator from the application roles
page he selects insight as the
application stripe then he selects the
role to which he wants to add users and
finally the users he wishes to add after
a business user creates an insight model
the milestones and indicators are mapped
to an Oracle cell a suite or service bus
application when a completed model is
activated insight starts collecting
metrics from the application for the
business owner both design time mapping
and runtime extraction of metrics is
done using data connections which allow
the system to communicate with a runtime
engine to configure a data connection
Emily the inside administrator opens the
administration tab in insight she
creates a data connection by providing a
name the type and the location for the
connection she also provides the port
number login and password for the
connection to use she tests the
connection and upon success saves the
configuration insight includes a number
of out-of-the-box business intelligence
or bi publisher reports as well as the
option of adding custom reports to
configure the insight reports emily has
previously installed bi publisher and
sent runtime
figuration properties she's also added
bi users with permissions to create
custom reports that can be published for
access and insight she's loaded the
insight out-of-the-box reports to the
correct bi publisher directory those
reports are now immediately visible to
incite users with suitable roll
privileges for more details about
performing insight administrative tasks
