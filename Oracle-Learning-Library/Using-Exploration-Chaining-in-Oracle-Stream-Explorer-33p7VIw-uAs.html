use exploration chaining firstly we're
looking to a stream Explorer
for this tutorial will enter the IOT
Internet of Things section of our
catalog and as you can see we've already
created an expiration that took
simulated event data from devices
filtered out unneeded information and
added a context by using reference data
for each of these devices this
exploration was published so now we can
show you how to use this exploration in
a new expiration so let's create this
exploration we'll give it a name and a
meaningful description we will now add
relevant tags in this case IOT to
indicate this is part of the IOT section
of a catalogue together with other
useful tags for this exploration now we
can specify a source as you can see
because we published a previous
expiration we can now use this
exploration and the output stream as
input into this new expiration and push
the create button now we can see the
exploration canvas providing us with the
streaming output from the previous
exploration now we can do further
detailed analysis on this new streaming
data will select using the group by the
various fields properties of the event
which were interested in
we'll add a summary which is a count of
each unique device address or ID will
include a time window so we're looking
for devices that are failing within a
time window of 30 seconds and we stream
the output as a slide of every five
seconds finally we'll add a filter for
the count of device IDs where the amount
of failures is greater or equal to three
so effectively looking for devices
unique devices that are failing
continuously in a streaming window of
three times in that 30-second window
here we can see now the stream Explorer
identifying those unique devices that
are failing more than three times within
a 30 second continuous window
for these failing devices we now want to
do further analysis by sending these
events specifically downstream or to a
target which in this case is a new csv
file located on my windows file system
we press the stream button and finally
now we're happy with this exploration we
will publish it for further usage
he will receive some graphical
representation of the streaming tabular
data and let's look at the file system
to locate the file the CSV file which
has been done a maclee created by the
stream Explorer and here we can see the
output from the analysis with a header
that includes the account of device IDs
and the other information that was
created and analyzed by the stream
Explorer and here you can see our new
expiration which is chaining from a
previous expiration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
