you how application express 4.2 enables
you to develop responsive web
applications that work Korea on
smartphones tablets as well as your
desktop computer I'll go into the
application builder click create
I want a database application which has
a form I want my form on em I'll click
Add page once my pages mad I'll click
Next and go through the other steps of
the wizard at the user interface theme
step I'm going to choose blue a
responsive theme 25 from the theme
select list
I'll hit create application and now my
application has been created I have
three pages let's first go into the home
page and add some regions I want four
regions side by side
I'll click Add
I'll go into each of these regions to
modify the grid layout attributes for
the first region everything looks fine
for my second region I don't want to
start a new row but I do want to start a
new column and I want this region to
span three columns theme 25 uses a grid
of twelve columns the three columns will
make that region one-fourth of a page
let me do the same for Region three and
four
you'll notice I'm not saying the column
attribute as apex will calculate this
automatically
at this point I'm going to go and remove
my breadcrumbs region as it's not really
necessary for a home page which starts
from itself
I'll run the page
and login you'll notice that I have my
navigation region which was created as
part of the wizard and I have four
regions which have just laid side by
side using apex for to use grid layout
functionality
now go into my form and I see a very
standard form which has a few fields and
has a crit button and a cancel button
let's change this region to look more
like an alert I'm going to modify the
empty region and start this region from
an offset of two columns so I once start
this as a third column and I want to
make this column span a total of eight
columns there's a two column gap in the
beginning and the end let's also change
the template from form region to alert
region
around the page and you'll notice how
its centered now the buttons are at the
bottom and it looks like simpler let me
demonstrate the responsive functionality
the responsive side of this application
as I resize my browser to be smaller
you'll notice the region snap into place
a different cutoff points for example an
iPad my display would look something
like this and as I continue to resize my
browser to be smaller you'll notice that
the regions will then go on top of each
other making it much more easier to
consume on a mobile device now let's
take a look at our form you'll notice
that the labels have shifted above the
form fields making it easier to look at
the labels and the form field together
at once as I scroll down you'll notice
the buttons have stretched to fill this
region making it a lot easier to tap on
mobile devices
you also notice the breadcrumb now
points back to home whereas on a desktop
device I was it was showing you where
you were I've just given you a quick
demo of how application Express for to
uses grid layout to enable responsive
web development for your applications
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
