process through data exchange in the
travel request example an employee needs
to provide travel information to
initiate the process managers interact
with the process when they need to
approve a request they receive
information about the request from the
process when a request is approved or
rejected the outcome is sent back to the
process and used to determine
conditional branching at the gateway
both these kinds of information travel
request information and approval outcome
need to be available to the process so
they must be stored the information is
stored on the process in containers
called data objects a data object can be
a simple type such as a name or date of
birth or a complex type such as the
employee type which contains multiple
attributes in process cloud service
complex data types are called Business
Objects data objects can have different
scopes each task or event can have its
own input and output data objects and
these data objects are local to the task
or event each process kind of data
objects that are local to the process
they are called process data objects
information exchange between task or
event and the process is done through
data Association tasks and events
receive information from the process
through input mapping and return
information to the process using output
mapping what kinds of data are needed in
the process what data needs to be
collected from the employee for the
travel details what data is needed to
determine routing what information is
needed for compliance check with your
