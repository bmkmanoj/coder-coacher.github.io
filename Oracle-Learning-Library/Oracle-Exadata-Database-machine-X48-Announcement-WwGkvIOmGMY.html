going to introduce you to the new Oracle
Exadata database machine x-48
I'm gonna pause for a minute and let you
read our safe harbor statement first I'm
going to give you a quick overview of
what an Oracle Exadata machine does so
we've designed the Oracle Exadata
database machine to be the ultimate
platform for all database workloads that
includes OLTP warehousing databases of
service and also a new generation of
in-memory analytics processing there's
two main parts to the Oracle Exadata
machine
there's the hardware and the software so
in the hardware we have a very modern
fully scale out architecture that
includes scale out servers intelligent
storage and unified InfiniBand
connectivity with cutting-edge pci flash
on the software side we have a lot of
specialized algorithms at the compute
storage and networking layer that
dramatically improve performance and
cost an important part of an Oracle
Exadata database machine is that it's a
highly standardized platform it's
identical at every customer and every
customer has an identical configuration
to Oracle development and Oracle support
it's a very highly optimized platform
we've optimized everything from the
firmware to the software to the hardware
everything is optimized in the end to
provide dramatic performance
improvements also it's a very hardened
platform provides extremely good levels
of availability we've tested all the
different failure modes and we fixed any
issues that might be there also we have
very specialized support offerings for
Exadata including platinum support which
is the highest level of support offered
by Oracle let me start by giving an
overview of the Exadata x-48 hardware
architecture and exadata has everything
you need to run an Oracle database that
includes database servers
networking and storage each of these
components is highly optimized for
database servers in the next 4/8 we use
two very powerful eight socket servers
these servers have a total among them of
240 cores of processing power and they
support up to 12 terabytes of DRAM so
it's an amazing amount of DRAM in
system we use a unified ultra-fast
InfiniBand network in the x-48 we use 40
gigabit InfiniBand both for
server-to-server communication and
server to storage communication we use
standard 10 or 1 gigabit ethernet to
talk out of the esse data to the rest of
the data center and probably the most
unusual part of an exit data database
machine is the storage so instead of a
traditional storage array we use
intelligent storage servers so we're
actually using two socket intel intel
socket based servers for storage so in
the case of an exploit we have 14 -
socket servers that have very large disk
drives and lots of flash that we use for
storage and we write software in those
storage servers to offload database
processing from the database in the
storage so we have a hundred and sixty
eight cores of processing power just in
the storage and the storage can have up
to 672 raw terabytes of storage of disk
drives and 44 terabytes of pci flash
before compression which then is further
expanded by pci level compression that
we have in our exit data flash cards and
you can expand that Exadata x-48
hardware from one rack all the way up to
18 racks by just adding cables all the
switching and everything is already
included in the servers
the thing that makes exadata really
unique is all the special software that
we've written specifically for exit data
so let me go through that so first of
all we have database offload software in
storage so I mentioned that for storage
we use two socket servers so we have a
lot of compute power and storage so
we're able to offload data intensive
query operations directly in the storage
so instead of running data intensive
operations and the servers we run it
directly in the storage right next to
the disk and flash where we can operate
it much more quickly using our offload
we can achieve a hundred gigabytes per
second of sequel data throughput per
rack which is an extraordinarily high
level of data throughput that no one
else in the industry can match we also
have very special algorithms for things
like storage index data skipping that
skips data that's not relevant to a
query we have special security
algorithms we have special decryption
algorithms so there's a lot of special
software that we're running inside an
exit data storage server we also have
very specialized pci flash and exit data
so a lot of people have flash we use our
flash for smart caching of database data
so because we know the database
algorithms and how it's using flash how
it's using data we're able to cache just
the relevant data in flash and do it
very quickly using our PCI flash in an
exit data x-48 we're able to achieve two
point six six million database i/os per
second in a single rack and these are
full and then from database all the way
through the storage and back and these
are full aki OS we also have ultra-high
speed flash compression so we're able to
compress data as it goes in and out of
flash at full flash data rates with
absolutely no overhead on any of the
database processing and we also have
specialized algorithms to speed up
transaction processing by speeding up
log writes which are very critical
latency sensitive aspect of databases in
exit data we have a very specialized
form of compression that we use called
hybrid columnar compression which is
extremely efficient it can provide
typically 10 times database size
reduction we also have specialized
messaging software so not only do we
have the fast
InfiniBand hardware
we run specialized database specific
protocols over that hardware to make it
super fast for database and these
protocols provide both extremely high
throughput and low latency and very high
reliability for database processing
we've also written a lot of database
optimized quality of service so we can
prioritize request and then from
database servers through the network and
through the storage and a very efficient
and database specific fashion so we can
have databases that are higher priority
than others we can have requests that
are higher priority than others and we
can do this at a very fine grained level
beyond what anyone else can do and an
exit data is also very highly available
platform within the hardware we have
redundancy at all levels we support all
our database high availability features
like data guard and rack ASM golden
Gate's
but within the hardware itself we also
have extremely fast recoverability so
for example when when a database server
fails we can recover it extremely
quickly when a storage server fails we
can recover it in just single-digit
seconds switch failures are almost
instantaneous failover we have
extraordinarily fast backups in exit
data because we can push a lot of the
backup work in this into our intelligent
storage and we've also written a lot of
software that checks configuration and
status across the entire rack everything
from storage to network to OS the
drivers to database software that
validates and and assures that
everything is working properly I just
talked through the unique software
features that are available only on
Exadata platform so now I want to focus
on the exadata x-48 the specific
platform that we're introducing today
now exudate is split into two broad
families the x42 which is based on two
socket database servers and the x-48
which is based on eight socket database
servers the x-48
contains two very powerful eight socket
servers each of these servers has 120
cores of database processing so it's of
each of the servers extremely powerful
server it's the equivalent of one of the
huge snps from a few years back each of
the servers also has a massive
memory so they come by default with two
terabytes of memory but their expandable
to six terabytes of memory each which
gives a total of 12 terabytes of memory
for database within Iraq the storage and
networking is identical in the x-48 and
and x42 platforms so it uses the exact
same storage servers and exact same
InfiniBand network and also the exact
same capacities now the 8 socket exit
data's have a long history of being used
for large-scale OLTP and data warehouse
workloads and those all still apply but
today I want to focus on a couple of
newer use cases which are database as a
service and database in memory both of
those are interesting because they
require very large amounts of memory
together with very large amounts of
processing first I want to talk about
database as a service the x-48 is an
amazing platform for database as a
service when you're bringing together
lots of databases in a consolidated
environment the bottleneck tends to be
memory you tend to run out of memory
well before you run out of compute power
and as I mentioned the x-48 has massive
amounts of memory so this will allow
dozens to hundreds of databases to all
be consolidated together very key to
consolidate environments databases
service is the ability to support mixed
workloads extremely efficiently when you
put lots of databases together you have
an inherently mixed workload environment
you'll have many OTP databases running
simultaneously you'll have some
databases running reporting and ad-hoc
analytics at the same time they'll have
data Mart's and data warehouses running
you'll have loads and backups you'll
have in memory analytics running so
you'll have all kinds of workloads
running simultaneously and the fact that
exit data can support all the different
kind of workloads with extraordinary
performance everything from warehousing
to high-end OLTP to any kind of batch
makes it a great platform for database
as a service and then the other key
thing about databases of service is you
have to isolate these workloads so you
don't want one system one database
overwhelming every other database that's
on the system so in exit Atta we provide
extensive CPU Network and i/o
prioritization and resources
we can prioritize both at the database
level at the network level and at the
storage on an Iowa by i/o basis so all
these things together make the Exadata
x-48 an excellent platform for hosting
database as a service now I want to talk
about how exadata x-48 is a great
platform for our new Oracle database
in-memory option so first of all when
you're talking about database in memory
you need a lot of memory and as I
mentioned the exploit has a massive
amount of memory so we have up to six
terabytes of memory on every node and
when you combine that with the memory
compression that Oracle database of
memory brings which generally ranges
from two times to 20 times you can get
tens to hundreds of terabytes of data
directly in memory in an x-48 the other
key aspect of memory processing is
performance so our Oracle database and
memory option can run orders of
magnitude faster sequel using the vector
processing instructions that that exists
in the already in the x-48 processors
and also in x-48 our Oracle database in
memory algorithms understand the
topology of an x-48 and especially
scheduled in-memory processing so it
runs on local DRAM of each socket so
when we're running an algorithm on a
socket we preferentially try to access
DRAM that's local to that socket to get
the fastest possible access and that
helps accelerate the whole throughput by
a substantial margin the other thing
about it x-48 is it has these large SMP
processors and SMP processors have an
advantage for in-memory processing
because each core in the server can
access all the memory in the server so
normally if you have a clustered
scale-up configuration you have to
distribute sequel across all the nodes
and there's a certain amount of overhead
associated with that in an SMP
architecture you can directly access all
the data using the super high speed
memory interconnect and an S and x-48 we
can do that and also when we need to
distribute queries across the nodes we
can use our super
InfiniBand network to make that run
really fast also the Oracle database in
memory option includes a unique feature
we call in-memory fault tolerance and
this feature is available only on
engineered systems like the x-48 the
goal of in-memory fault tolerance is to
keep the system available even though a
node crashes or ports and the idea is we
duplicate the in-memory columnstore
across the nodes of the cluster and this
is very similar to how storage arrays
mirror data across this type so if you
lose one disk drive you can just access
a data on the remaining destroyed we do
something very similar here we duplicate
the memory the column vectors across the
nodes of an X for a cluster and this can
be enabled by the user for specific
tables or partitions so you don't have
to duplicate all the memory you can
choose to just duplicate the memory for
recent or important partitions and maybe
leave historical stuff unduplicated just
to save some more memory and the benefit
of the fault tolerant feature is that if
a node goes down you can continue
accessing as if nothing happened because
you just simply access the duplicate
copy that's on another node contrast
this with other in-memory databases
where if a node goes down it takes all
its memory with it and then you have to
wait usually many many minutes for that
memory to be loaded onto some other node
so this is a much more effective at
architecture and it's really Enterprise
ready most enterprises don't like to
wait many minutes or hours even to get
their database system running again from
after a simple node crash or database
crash and that's exactly what you get on
an X for a you get memory in memory
fault tolerance which is a unique
feature of engineered systems
the x-48 like all Exadata has a unique
storage tiering architecture the idea
that architecture is to get both the
best performance and the lowest cost in
a single system so we're able to keep
the hottest most active data in memory
in our in memory formats we're able to
keep a little bit less active data
entirely in flash and we're able to keep
colder data that's less active on very
low cost disk so this has a lot of
different benefits for one thing the
size of the database is not limited by
the size of DRAM like it is for a pure
memory database so we can get as good or
better performance and then as a pure
in-memory database but without being
limited to the size of memory we can
have databases that are much bigger than
memory another big advantage is that
we're able to achieve higher performance
at the flash level than an all flash
Thor jury because of our scale out
architecture our InfiniBand are
intelligent storage and all our exit
data special algorithms we can achieve
higher io performance than a pure all
flash array and furthermore we have an
advantage of cost also because of our
hybrid columnar compression combined
with the massive amount of low cost disk
in and exit data we can achieve lower
costs per byte than a conventional
storage array so in an exit data x-48
you blend all the different benefits
higher performance than the pure memory
database higher io rates than a pure
flash system and lower costs per byte
than a traditional storage array and
it's all possible because of the special
algorithms that we implement at every
level of a hierarchy and it's also all
transparent to the application so when
we run a query it can actually
transparently use data that's in memory
that it's data that's in flash and then
it's on disk and blend that all together
seamlessly without any input or
interaction from the user it's all
completely transparent and it provides
the best of all worlds in one package
not I've talked about some of the use
cases let me come back and talk about
how the new exadata x-48 compares to our
previous Exadata x-38 machine and the
main picture here is that x-48 has much
more compute flash and storage capacity
than we ever had before so in terms of
compute capacity per rack we have 50%
more database of quarters than we had
before with now 240 cores of the fastest
Xeon processors on the market we allow
up to three times more memory than we
did in the x-38 now up to 12 terabytes
of memory in iraq we are using a new
generation of InfiniBand PCI 3 based
cards that allow up to 2 times faster
InfiniBand processing and also we're
using larger local disks inside and
exadata x4 8 which that's the enables
consolidation further by allowing more
for example oracle homes and other data
to be kept locally in the storage
comparing an x4 system to an x3 system
we've doubled the physical flash memory
so previously we had 22 terabytes of
flash memory using PCI cards and now we
have 44 terabytes of flash memory
we've also further doubled the flash
memory using our Flash compression so I
mentioned that we have compression
algorithms that are built in Hardware in
our flash cards that can double the
amount of flash and do this completely
transparently to the application and
also run this at full data rates with
absolutely no performance overhead the
new generation of flash also supports
much more i/o so we're able to run 77%
more flash iOS so this means two point
six six million 8k database reads and
one point nine six million 8k database
writes directly from sequel and the ends
from sequel not measured at some low
level by some low-level tool so these
are real achievable numbers we also in
the x4 generation increase the capacity
of our disk drives so we have 33 percent
larger high-capacity disks so we have up
to six hundred and seventy two terabytes
of memory in iraq and if you choose to
use high-performance this those have
doubled in size so now we have 200
terabytes using
the high-performance 1.2 terabyte
distance so let me summarize what we
talked about with exadata export
database machine
the export Exadata x-48 is a family of
exadata machines that uses two very
powerful eight socket database servers
so we have a hundred and twenty cores
and two to six terabytes of drm in each
server it runs all our normal use cases
which are large-scale OLTP and
large-scale data warehouses however I
focus today on a couple of new years
cases which are database as a service
and database and memory and both of
these use cases are interesting because
they require very large memory capacity
which is what we have in the new Exadata
x4 8 I also mentioned that we have CPU
Network and storage prioritization
workload management that really help
with mixed workloads that are unique to
exit data I also talked about how the
exadata x4 8 is a great platform for
Oracle database in memory because of the
extreme capacity of memory and the
extreme performance that we've achieved
with the vector processing and the
localized memory access in x4 8 we also
went through our Oracle database
in-memory fault tolerance which is a way
we keep databases highly available even
though we have massive amounts of memory
that of data that's just in memory and I
talked about how the transparent memory
flash and disk tiering achieve both
highest performance and lowest cost
together and really make it the best
platform for running the Oracle database
so now I'm done with the normal
presentation and any of you that just
wanted an overview of the exit data x-48
can log off now but I'm going to go on
for a little bit longer and talk about
some low-level technical details for
those of you that are owners of a
Exadata and really want to get into a
little bit more low-level details
first I'm going to talk about some of
the low-level details of our database
processors that we use in the x-48 and
these are based on the new Intel 15 core
Ivy Bridge xeon e7 v2 cpus in our case
we're using the fastest version of this
which is the 2.8 gigahertz version so
this is one big difference from x3
previously we had 10 core processors now
we're using 15 core processors in terms
of memory we now have a standard of 2
terabytes of memory that comes with each
server and that's using 64 32 gig dims
and we allow expansion up to six
terabytes of memory using 192 32 victims
this is much bigger than before because
before we had 128 M slots and now we
have 192 DIMM slots in terms of local
disks we've increased the capacity of
local disks we've doubled the capacity
from 300 to 600 gigabytes
although we reduce the quantity of
districts by one and the reason for that
is we're making the battery hot
swappable and I'll talk in more detail
about that later we have the same disk
controller as before but as I just
mentioned the battery now is hot
swappable and I have I have a diagram
for that in the later slide and in terms
of InfiniBand we're using the latest PC
i3 infinite bank card so that roughly
doubles the throughput and allows us to
make all those InfiniBand ports active
we've also increased the Ethernet ports
a little bit we have ten one Gigabit
Ethernet ports per server and we have
eight 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports so we
have a lot of Ethernet connectivity out
to the data center in addition to the
InfiniBand throughput that we have
inside the exit data one more change in
the x-48
is that we now allow online replacement
of the disk controller battery so you
can see in this diagram here we've taken
one of the disk drive slots and replace
the disk drive in it with the actual
battery from the disk controller so you
can pop it in and out just like you do a
disk drive so this allows online
replacement of the disk controller
battery without taking the server down
at all
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
software versions of Exadata software
and that go along with the x-48
so we have two versions 11 to 30 31 and
12 1 1 1 which are associated with
export which is essentially a
maintenance release that enables the
x-48
Hardware this software is not just a
villain x-48 it's actually the new
software that's available on all our
database machines and is backward
compatible to all supported executed
configurations
the new exadata storage software release
primarily adds support for this new
hardware so whenever you come out with
new hardware you have to add new
firmware and some OS hooks for that
firmware and that's exactly what these
new new exadata releases do they add
support for the new hardware and exit
exadata x-48 while we were at it we also
added support for 4 terabyte
high-capacity disk upgrade option to
some of our previous servers like the
x32 and the x2 2 and we also added a
small feature that allows latency
capping of radios so occasionally a disk
drive will have a spike of high latency
and with this feature it allows us to
move the the i/o to a different mirror
copy instead of waiting for some sort of
short latency spike that's happening on
a disk drive the main goal of 11 2 3 3 1
and 12 1 1 1 was really to improve
robustness and availability so we rolled
in all the software fixes and firmware
updates that are needed to catch up with
every single issue that's been reported
on Exadata and we've added a little bit
of extra automatic service request in
support also that simplifies some of the
some of the reporting of hardware
failures so that requires less callbacks
to customers
in terms of operating system the x-48
updates our Oracle Linux distribution to
5.10 including all recent security
updates in in the Linux kernel that you
would caked kernel we haven't made any
major updates however we have made a
number of improvements to scalability
and robustness so as we were testing the
x-48 we discovered that Linux had some
bottlenecks for high core count systems
and we fixed a number of problems in the
base Linux code that were bottlenecking
performance and we included those in our
UK release that goes out with the x-48
and this is a great example of some of
the benefits of exadata because we test
the entire platform and we optimize
everything that needs to be optimized
whether it's the database software
whether it's storage whether it's
firmware or whether it's the OS we
optimize everything top to bottom it's
all completely tested and ready to go
when we ship the system to conclude the
exadata x-48 continues our history of
innovation in both hardware and software
on the X data platform as time goes by
we're adding more and more capabilities
into Exadata at the hardware level and
particularly at the software level that
further and further separates us from
generic hardware so I talked for example
about some of the database and memory
optimizations that only exist on Exadata
some of the database as a service
prioritization capabilities that only
exist on exit data so we continue to
innovate and add more and more
capabilities that are exclusive to
Exadata to make it the best platform on
the market for any kind of database
workload so for additional information
