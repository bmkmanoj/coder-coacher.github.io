tasks of a sales process or other
business process do you want to automate
tasks like approving a quote generating
orders and ordering documents and
entering sales order numbers Oracle
integration cloud enables you to do all
this and much more integration insight
part of the integration analytics
feature of integration cloud empowers
you to define important business
milestones and view advanced metrics
right in the browser without making any
changes to the application with these
advanced metrics you can understand
conversion problems identify weak spots
in the sales pipeline track significant
volume increase or decrease track sales
team performance spikes and dips
identify product trends early and
surface regional sales hot spots sign
into integration cloud and create a
model from the insight section on the
models page and are a name a description
and a label then select a unique icon
for the model now define the milestones
within the model milestones are points
in a business process that represent
important events you create several
types of milestones including initial
standard error terminal and terminal
error these milestones are mapped to
points in the business process
implementation in this example the
opportunity to order business process
starts when a sales rep creates an
opportunity an oracle salescloud you
first create a milestone to represent
that event this particular milestone is
classified as initial every time this
milestone is passed a new instance or
order is initiated in insight you add
additional milestones to the model that
represent interim points of normal
execution these are known as standard
milestones the next milestone you define
is past when a quote is rejected
automatically by the process application
if the discount is too high because it
puts the order into an unsuccessful
State you identify it as an error
milestone the order can be resumed after
the quotes updated for that reason this
isn't defined as a terminal milestone at
another error milestone to represent
when it
customer rejects a quote this isn't a
terminal milestone either because the
order will be resumed once the quotes
been updated add another error milestone
to represent an order cancellation
because the order can't be completed
after being cancelled you identify this
milestone as a terminal error milestone
finally add a milestone that marks the
successful completion of an order this
is a terminal milestone when milestones
are passed indicators can be extracted
as insight observes the execution of
business processes indicators are key
pieces of raw data they allow business
users to gain insight into the proper
functioning of the business process and
also allow comparisons between orders
there are three types of indicators
identifiers measures and dimensions
identifier is guarantee uniqueness among
all business processes you can specify
an additional identifier to correlate
one business process to another like
correlating an opportunity to an order
measures identify values that enable
quantification of the state of the
business process dimensions provide a
type of grouping and categorization of
instances that enable slicing and dicing
of aggregate measures indicators can be
created once the milestones are defined
start with the unique instance
identifier next to find a measure
associated with a milestone and then
define a dimension associated with a
milestone finally add additional
dimensions and measures and associate
them with the remaining milestones after
you've defined each indicator save the
model and sign out of insight in the
next video in this series an integration
architect Maps each of these milestones
to the underlying implementation and
activates the model to learn more visit
