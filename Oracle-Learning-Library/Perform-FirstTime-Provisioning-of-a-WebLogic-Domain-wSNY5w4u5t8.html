Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to use
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c to provision Oracle Fusion
Middleware software for the first time
by using an existing media provisioning
profile this video is applicable to
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c release for with Fusion Middleware
plug-in release 12.1 point zero point
seven this demonstration assumes that
the required installation media in this
example the media for Oracle so a suite
has already been downloaded from Oracle
uploaded to the enterprise manager
software library and exposed as a media
based provisioning profile next I assume
that host targets exist unto which I
want to create this new installation
similarly I also assume that a database
target exists to which I can provision
the database required for this profile
and lastly I assume that any Oracle HTTP
server or LDAP server targets that I
want to integrate with this domain
already exists
in order to provision from an
installation media profile I will log in
as an administrator who has been granted
the provisioning designer role
navigate to the Middle where
provisioning page this page provides a
summary of all of the middleware
provisioning profiles and deployment
procedures available to this
administrator in this example I want to
install a fresh copy of Oracle so a
suite 11g patchset 6 onto a new piece of
hardware so I select an existing media
based provisioning profile with that
label and click the provision button
since I want to create a so a domain
that spans two hosts I add to host
targets and specify the same credentials
for both
you
in the middleware section I accept the
default file system destination for my
middleware profile I also select a Java
installation which in this example is
already present on the two destination
host targets in addition I must provide
administrator credentials for the new
WebLogic domain
in the database section I specify
settings in order to create a new schema
and an existing database that I already
discovered in enterprise manager Cloud
Control earlier
you
in the identity and security section I
select an already discovered ldap target
and then provide its credentials and
schema information
you
in the web tier section you can
optionally front-end your new WebLogic
domain with an already discovered web
server target like Oracle HTTP server
select the target and then provide its
credentials
you
now I could simply submit these values
and begin the installation procedure now
but alternatively I can save these
inputs as a custom deployment procedure
in order to accelerate future
deployments these custom procedures can
also lock certain input fields which
will restrict other users from modifying
them when they run the procedure
you
by default only the creator of a custom
procedure may execute it so I grant
access to another user
you
now I will login as this operator user
and launch the custom procedure
you
in the schedule section you can choose
to either run this procedure immediately
or at a later time you can also
customize the notifications such as
email messages that you will receive as
the procedure execute and finally you
can optionally run the procedure in a
special analyze mode in this mode
Enterprise Manager will run all of the
prerequisite checks for the procedure
but not actually provision anything
after submitting the deployment
procedure I can track its progress from
the procedure activity page and for
troubleshooting purposes I can view the
details and results of each step
involved in the procedure
you
and lastly I verify the presence of
these new middleware targets
you
so that concludes this demonstration on
the use of an existing media based
middleware provisioning profile with
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
12c now you can quickly and consistently
install Oracle middleware products
across your enterprise thanks for
