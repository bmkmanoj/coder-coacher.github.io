useful feature of enterprise data
quality now and that is reference data
writing so let's start with a quick
recap of what reference data is and how
it's used by reference data is data
that's held within enterprise data
quality within its repository and it's
maintained there you can create it
manually if you want to and you can edit
it manually if you want to with an ed Q
and it can be used in order to check or
enhance the working data that you're
working with in your data quality
process okay there are some examples on
this slide of the kind of things that
you can keep in reference data so your
reference data might contain lists of
valid or invalid values you can check
the values in your working data against
the valid or invalid values in your
reference data or your reference data
might contain de limiters or noise
characters have I got noise in a
particular field well the way we check
is we look against reference date to do
any of those noise characters like
hashes or pound symbols or percentage
characters that we don't expect me in
the field are they there okay now let's
just think about using reference data to
enhance the working data one example of
that Lisa it's a simple one is a title
gender map so for example if you're
working data doesn't hold reliable
gender informational perhaps doesn't
hold any gender information but you have
titles so mr. mrs. MERS miss you can
derive the gender from the title so to
do that you create some reference data
which is map reference data you look up
on the title you return the gender so if
you look up and you find the title is
mr. you look in the reference data you
find the gender associated with that is
male or for mrs. or miss
or mercy it would be female or F so
that's an example of how you can use
reference data but really the sky's the
limit you know you can create your own
processes using your own reference data
now that reference data could be
manually created in edq it could be that
you've copied it and placed into edq
from some other source you do have the
ability to look up on external data
outside of ed Q and use it as if it were
reference data but what we're looking at
here is the ability of ed Q to enable
you to create your own reference data
automatically from an ed cubed process
so that's what we're looking at here the
ability to write out reference data from
an ed Q process so you can put together
your own process in ed Q it can be as
simple or as complex as you need it to
be and at the end of that process you
can put on a writer the writer processor
and that right a processor yes it can
create stage data yes it can write to a
real time stream to web service but it
can also write out reference data so you
can create ed Q processes at the end of
them put on a writer that writer can
write out reference data you can then
maintain that reference data within ed Q
you can edit it manually if you want to
you can keep on updating your reference
data by running your process again with
slightly different variables or
different incoming data and the
reference data you create can then be
used in another ed Q process to check
the working data or to enhance it
generally
so what I want to do now is to show you
one or two examples of how you might use
this reference data writing
functionality to automatically create
reference data which can then be
maintained in edq and used in other edq
processes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
