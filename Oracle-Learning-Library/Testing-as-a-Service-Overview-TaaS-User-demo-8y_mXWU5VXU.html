as a service testing as a service offers
a platform where you can build your own
private testing cloud within your
organization that allows you to be work
more efficiently studies have shown that
many customers spend over 50% of their
testing time with just setting up the
application on the tests and preparing
the test tools for a testing we're
testing as a service we reduce the
complexity of the testing and allow the
testing tool to provision the
application on the test as well as the
testing tools this means that you can
spend more time focusing on the testing
and less on the preparations it also
allows non-traditional testers to attend
and participate in a testing like IT
operations application owners etc in TAS
test designers creates and provides test
assets like test automation scripts
scenarios and assemblies that are
templates for the application the
administrator makes these assets
available for the test user and the test
user can log in to a self-service portal
and consume all the assets that have
been made available to him now let's
have a look at testing as a service
we're now going to log in as a task user
into the self-service portal in the
self-service portal we can have a look
at our servers or databases or
middleware but let's have a look at
testing as a service on the home page we
can see how much resources we are
consuming we can also see if we have any
ongoing or scheduled trials as well as
if we have any completed trials the my
library tab
shows us all the different test assets
that we have so any kind of scripts or
scenarios that are available for us as a
user if you click on one of them they
will expose what kind of scripts and
settings they all have the test
environments are basically all the
different applications that are
available to you as a tester under my
test tab we can see any kind of test
that we have predefined and they can be
of load testing or functional test type
let's create a load test first we have
to specify a name for the test we can
also provide the description if we want
to and we have to click test assets
meanit's scripts that we want to run for
our test once we do that we also see
what kind of settings it has we click
continue
next we have to specify what kind of
target environment do we have we can
either pick one from our library we can
use an existing Enterprise Manager
system as well or simply the environment
that it was required against let's pick
an environment and what you don't notice
is that we automatically map the URLs
from the test scripts to the appliance
meaning the new application that we're
going to deploy the hardware estimation
gives us some estimates on how much
resources we need and now we created a
test the next we have to do is to create
a trial which is equal to executing the
test so we create a new trial we give
the try the name because you can have
multiple trials for a test
then you can provide an instance name
for the application that you want to run
the test against and provide the root
password for those virtual machines you
can also define if you want to delete or
stop the instance after the test is done
or after a specific point in time if you
have been given access you can also
change settings for your test so in this
case let's reduce the number of users to
100 instead of a thousand that we want
to run for a load test and then we
specify the root password for the test
driver that we're also going to deploy
into the private cloud if you want you
can increase the number of load agents
that were going to use let's keep this
as suggested we have now created our
first test and trial and TAS is
deploying the application and the test
drivers into the cloud let's have a look
at an existing trial I can have a look
at the status and you see it's already
completed but in the status list you can
also see that TAS is actually checking
out coders and doing a lot of
verification before it can deploy and
start testing now let's have a look at
their result of the trial that we have
here first we have a look at the summary
report this shows us when it has started
how many users we had during the load
test the pages per second that we had
all the different settings for the
scripts as well as the results per page
if we look at the performance tab we can
create our own performance reports in a
graphical chart we can use the time
slider to focus on specific time frame
that we have for our
test so it's basically soo-min out
functionality you can see here that we
have a couple of predefined metrics we
have the hits per seconds and number of
virtual users but we can also add
monitoring metrics from Enterprise
Manager like CPU memory consumption or
any other kind of metrics that Oracle's
Enterprise Manager provides so let's the
free memory if you tick the checkbox it
will create a new chart into this page
but you can also drag and drop a metric
from the metric palette into a chart and
it will then draw that specific plotting
into that newly added chart that you
have and this way it's very easy to
correlate any kind of monitoring metrics
with any kind of performance metric that
you get from oracle load testing for
example to figure out where you have
bottlenecks and problems here we can add
the kilobytes receipt per second into
the number of reuse so you can see it's
very easy to see where you can have some
kind of correlation between any kind of
metric if we click on the test
environment tab we will see the test
environment that we had for our tests as
well as the agents and the configuration
shows us what settings we had for a
scenario how many users we had what the
ramp-up is and so on and if your
application has an Oracle database you
can also pull out the Diagnostics
reports from the database so now that we
looked for load testing let's create a
functional test so we create that the
process is very much the same you have
to provide the name of your test
potentially description and then you add
test
now for functional testing you can add
multiple test assets so if you happen to
have more than one test script in this
case you can add that and you can also
order these in in a sequence for the
test execution similar to the load
testing you have to provide an
environment where you want to run your
scripts so we're going to provision a
new application for DM the environment
and same here you can remap the urls
from the ones that you have in your test
automation scripts to target the newly
deployed application on the tests again
we have to create a trial and the trial
of course also has to have its own name
one of the differences with functional
testing is that you have a lot of
different settings for the functional
playback that you may want to be able to
control
Ian's tasks you have a couple of
different ways of doing this but here in
the trial you can for example define how
the different scripts are going to
behave when they are executed should
they stop should you stop the full test
execution if you have a failure or not
as well you can also define a lot of
different settings for the script itself
like what kind of browser do you want to
use for the playback how do you want to
treat certain errors and so on and if
you have data banks meaning that you're
feeling your script with different data
from a file or data bank you can also
define that here last but at least the
test driver should have some root
passwords defined and this is if you
want to later log on to the test driver
and to do some checking or something
now our test is completed we can see the
green result bar indicating that
everything was passed we can look at
their status from the status we can see
that everything worked fine during the
playback so let's have a look at the
report the report shows us all the
different trials that we have we can
select the trial to have a look at the
result more detail when you do that you
can see how many different steps you
have in the script that were successful
in this case we have three different
steps you can see all the different
steps how long it took them to play back
you can even go and have a look at the
screenshots from the playback as you can
see a tester typically wouldn't have to
care too much about the infrastructure
that he's dealing with or the
application he simply picks the test
assets that he has available and the
application template and he can then
launch the tests this concludes the demo
