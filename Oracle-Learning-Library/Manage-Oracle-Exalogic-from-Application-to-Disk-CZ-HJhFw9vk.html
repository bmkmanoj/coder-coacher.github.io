in this demonstration will show you new
capabilities for monitoring and managing
an ex illogic environment using Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c we'll begin with
a hardware schematic view what we see
here is how all the pieces of the puzzle
including compute storage network exa
bus all of the virtualization drivers
have been integrated together into a
high performance low latency cloud
platform if I drill into a particular
component I can see all the details for
example that this note is running on a
hypervisor I can also continue to drill
down and I can see how this relates to
the built in cloud layer within exalogic
so for example what we can see here is
that this rack is part of a server pool
which has been pre set up and that
server pool is part of something called
a virtual datacenter a virtual data
center is a logical abstraction of
resources and this abstraction will
allow the cloud users who are going to
access exalogic through the new
self-service portal and Oracle
Enterprise Manager to consume these
resources without understanding the
physical layout of my data center it
simply tells them here's the storage
networking and compute resources that
your application workload requires for
example these are the network segments
and these are the storage pools and
these are the server pools because we
have access to a large supply of
processing power I also have the ability
to create virtual slices and assign them
to different groups of users we would do
this through accounts as you can see we
have multiple accounts created and I
would have the ability to fix the size
of the virtual slice allocated to each
account as an administrator I want to
see what's running on this box so far
we've looked only at the hardware and
the without abstraction layer but let's
go see what's actually running on this
machine here we are in the exalogic
application dashboard we're looking at
the same rack view but this time from a
software perspective we can see all the
applications being deployed all the
domains running the coherence cluster
and similar what I can see is that my
sales order application seems to be
having some issues we can see here that
for some reason the request processing
time for this application is unusually
high so something is going on here now
if we look below we can see an
integrated hardware and software
topology we see how the nodes are
talking to each other now they're
connected to a database and to the
networking switches it will also tell us
that the sales order application is
running on a node called XO node one
which seems to have a critical issue
let's drill in and see what's going on
we
see that this incident points to a
possible memory board failure this could
explain why the application performance
is being impacted because overall memory
available applications has been reduced
so let's go look at the hardware view
and figure out exactly what's going on
we can see the enterprise manager is
already detected that this memory board
has failed and we probably need to order
a replacement part for that now normally
you wouldn't see all of this information
in one place from your application all
the way to the disk but then secondly
and even worse once you did find this
problem you'd have to go into my Oracle
support and file an SR and do all of
this activity now if you're using normal
hardware and normal systems management
tools you'll have to juggle across all
of those tools and of course wait on the
phone for several hours thankfully all
of Oracle's engineered systems including
Exadata and exalogic come with automatic
service requests this allows them to
sense these kinds of failures and notify
Oracle immediately hopefully in this
case a service request has already been
created and sure enough what we see here
is that a problem has been identified
and reported to Oracle we can see the
status is parts dispatched now I'm a
cynical person I don't take most things
on their face value so let me just drill
down go to my Oracle support and make
sure that that is the case and here we
can look at the service request and it's
indeed the same service request and it
tells me that the part will be
dispatched to be in the next few
business days in this demonstration
we've shown how the integration of
exalogic with oracle enterprise manager
provides a better management experience
including the ability to remotely
monitor systems and automatically raise
service requests if there are any issues
