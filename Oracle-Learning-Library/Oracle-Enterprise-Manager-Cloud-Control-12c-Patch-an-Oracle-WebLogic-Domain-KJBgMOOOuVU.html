cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to
apply multiple patches across all
servers within an Oracle WebLogic domain
once you are logged into Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud control as an
administrator with a patching operator
role you can apply patches to the
domains to which you have access to
access the patching functionality
navigate to the enterprise menu expand
the provisioning and patching sub menu
and then click on the patches and
updates menu item from the patch search
region you can search for patches
available on my Oracle support either by
supplying a specific patch number or by
providing a product name for the
purposes of this demonstration
select the product or family option
select the product is Oracle WebLogic
server select the release as for example
1035 and select the operating system
platform as for example Linux 64-bit
after applying these filters initiate
the search by clicking on the search
button the patch search results page
appears identifying all WebLogic server
patches that match our search criteria
from the results page you can review the
patches descriptions access the patches
read mieze add one or more patches to a
patch plan or download patches for the
purposes of this demonstration deselect
the first patch and select a couple
other patches that you wish to apply to
the domain
after selecting the couple patches add
the selected patches to a new patch plan
a patch plan is simply a collection of
patches that you want to apply as a
group to a domain give the patch plan a
name such as production 1035 plan select
the target type Oracle WebLogic domain
click the search icon and all the
domains being managed by cloud control
will be displayed select the domain to
be patched and click the create plan
button a message is displayed at the top
of the page indicating that the plan was
created successfully let's go ahead and
view the plan notice from this page you
can confirm the patches that we just
added to the patch plan after clicking
on step 3 deployment options choose to
apply the plan in a rolling mode rolling
mode applies the patches across multiple
nodes one at a time this avoids downtime
for your web logic deployments the other
option parallel applies patches on all
the nodes at the same time in which case
downtime may occur depending on the
patches to be applied as not all patches
require the manage servers to be brought
down notice on step 3 the region labeled
rollback this feature allows you to
rollback or uninstall the patches that
were applied as part of the patch plan
for example let's say that these patches
had already been applied to the domain
if by applying these patches new
unwanted problems occurred you could
create a new patch plan with the same
patches that were already applied and
select this rollback option in order to
rollback the patches in the last section
of step 3
this is where you specify credentials
first specify administrator credentials
for the domain to be patched second
specify operating system credentials for
the WebLogic server home to be patched
for this demonstration we have already
saved preferred credentials for both so
these preferred credentials will be used
in applying the patches to the domain
identified in the patch plan after
clicking on step 4 validation click the
analyze button in order to compare
installed software and patches against
the candidate patches in the plan or
validate patches within the plan itself
any patch conflicts version issues or
other potential problems will be
identified after analysis is complete
for this patch plans analysis we see
that one patch that we had selected has
already been applied to the domain and
the other patch that was analyzed has
found that some other domains that are
not discovered as managed targets and
Enterprise Manager would be affected by
applying the patch as they share
binaries with the domain we did select
for the purposes of this demonstration
we are fine with this and we'll continue
on to the final step after clicking on
step 5 review and deploy review the
summary and click the deploy button a
job is then submitted to apply the two
patches to the domain specified in the
patch plan to track progress of the job
scroll back up the screen and click show
detailed progress by default this status
page is set to manual refresh to have
this page automatically refreshed pick
real-time 30-second refresh when the
patches have been applied to all manage
servers as well as the administration
server for the domain the status of the
job changes from running to succeeded
now that the job has completed
successfully let's take a look at the
various steps involved in applying the
patches in this patch plan first the
patching procedure initialized by
downloading the two patches from my
Oracle support and creating components
in the Enterprise Manager software
library then the procedure validated if
the WebLogic targets were supported for
such patching and if all necessary
target properties and associations were
available the procedure verified the
credentials that were specified in the
patch plan and the procedure upgraded
smart update to the latest version if
the latest version of smart update was
not already installed
then the procedure staged or move the
patches from the software library to the
management agent on the destination host
machines the procedure performed various
prerequisite checks at the destination
host machines as well then the procedure
started a blackout of the target to be
patched brought down the target applied
the patch brought up the target and
stopped the blackout this was done in a
rolling fashion across a list of targets
in the domain
the last step of the procedure was to
collect updated configuration data on
each of the WebLogic server homes as
well as each of the WebLogic server
targets and to store that collected data
in the Enterprise Manager management
repository database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
