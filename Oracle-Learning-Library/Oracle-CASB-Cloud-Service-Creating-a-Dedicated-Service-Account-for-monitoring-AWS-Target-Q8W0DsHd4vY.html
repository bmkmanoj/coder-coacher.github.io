cloud service can use either an identity
and access management user to act as a
dedicated service account or use an IM
role AWS recommends the use of roles as
now access and secret keys are required
and it's viewed as a more secure
integration this walkthrough will show
the creation of an IM user account for a
single or standalone AWS account or a
targis accounts configured in cross
account login for more information on
cross account logging please review the
cross account logging videos in this
series to create the dedicated service
account create an IM user account and
assign a specific policy to it to do
this select services and then under
security identity and compliance select
I am this takes you to the welcome to
Identity and Access Management screen
select users to create the account
when you add this new user you need to
provide a username
this user will never need to log into
the AWS management console but you will
need the access keys
so select programmatic access and
navigate to the permissions screen
here you are going to attach one or more
existing policies directly to the user
you can register your AWS account into
Oracle Caspi cloud service in one of two
modes read-only
and readwrite in both modes your
baseline your AWS security controls in
Oracle Caspi cloud service any
subsequent changes to the security
controls in AWS will generate an alert
in Oracle Casbah cloud service in read
write mode Oracle Cosby cloud service
can revert those changes back to the
baseline settings keeping your AWS
instance in compliance however in this
mode AWS requires Oracle Casspi cloud
service to have administrator access to
make these changes directly back into
your AWS account read-only mode requires
the read-only access policy enter
read-only access in the search filter
scroll to the bottom and select the
policy
then navigate to the review screen here
verify the name of the I am user that
the AWS access type is set to
programmatic access with an access key
that the correct policy is attached to
the I am user and then create the user
download the CSV file to view the user
security credentials the access key ID
and the secret access key this is the
only time you'll be able to do this if
you lose these access keys you'll have
to regenerate a new set in I am an
update oracle Casbah cloud service with
the new keys in order to continue
monitoring your AWS accounts best
practice is to rotate your I am user
keys every 90 days so you will become
familiar with this process if you are
not already this is called a dedicated
service account because it should be
dedicated to the Oracle Caspi cloud
service to monitor your AWS account no
human or any other application should
use this account to log into your AWS
account once you have downloaded your
access Keys navigate back to the I am
dashboard where you can view the user
that you just created with Cloud trail
enabled an s3 bucket collecting cloud
trail log data and the dedicated service
account you are ready to register your
AWS account into Oracle Casbah cloud
service thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
