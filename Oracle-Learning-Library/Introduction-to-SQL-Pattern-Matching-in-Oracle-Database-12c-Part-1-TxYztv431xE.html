the new and very exciting 12
matching feature my name is Keith mica
senior principal product manager for
data warehousing and big data Oracle if
you have any questions about sequel
pattern-matching please feel free to
contact me by my blog this is the first
in a three-part series of podcasts that
will cover the following topics
introduction to pan matching next we'll
look at sequel pan matchings concepts
syntax and reviews and demonstrations
and finally we'll look at some
real-world use cases so what is patent
matching all about patterns are usually
defined as a repetitive series or
sequence of specific events or actions
and they occur everywhere in business
the ability to find analyze and quantify
individual or groups of patents within a
data set is now a key business
requirement it can help you gain a
better understanding of your customers
behavior and associated operational
activities seek out new opportunities
drive additional revenue streams and
even help identify malicious activities
that could to lead to your business
incurring significant costs here's a
real-world business case from a
telecommunications company that is
trying to understand how the sim cards
in his phones are actually being used by
its customers the company suspects that
some of its SIM cards are being used in
multiple handsets and they want to look
for the pattern where a SIM card goes
from phone a to phone B to phone C and
then back to phone a within a specified
time period and where this pattern is
repeated multiple times within a seven
day period this is an important business
case because this type of pattern can
cost telecommunication companies a lot
of money for a number of different
reasons to search for this type of
pattern developers have typically used
multiple self joins along with connect
by with clauses and window functions but
this makes the sequel quite complicated
is there a better simpler way than using
self joins with connect buying window
functions
what do we need to help a search for
these types of hands let's look at a
different data set to explain the type
of syntax we need to help us search for
patterns
this time let's consider a flight
arrival and departure data set there are
already pattern matching declarative
languages such as Perl that allow us to
create statements such as a plus B C
this would allow us to search for one or
more instances of event a followed by
one instance of event B followed by one
instance an event C and we might add an
additional requirement that the whole
pattern should occur within a one minute
interval so what is needed is a native
sequel construct that allow us to search
across row boundaries the solution
should align itself with well-known
regular expression declarative languages
such as Perl oracle database 12c
provides such a feature and this will be
incorporated into an ANSI C call
standard the following slides will
provide more information about this new
feature is much recognized and is part
of Oracle Database 12c let's start with
a simple example based on a data set for
a ticker stream where we have stock
price over time in this case for each
day within the data set we want to look
for w-shaped patterns where the price
goes down then up then down and finally
up again once we found a w-shaped
pattern we want to return the start date
and the end date for the pattern we want
to calculate the average price during
the second up leg of our W shape but
we're only looking for W shaped patterns
that lasted less than seven days of
course we can search across multiple
ticker symbols within our data set
between the following slides will limit
the data set to a single ticker stream
keep things simple to create a pattern
matching process we use the match
recognized clause the source data that
will be searched is the table ticker
listed in the from clause the first step
in building our match recognized Clause
is to organize our data set by
partitioning it into logical groups in
this case we'll split the data based on
ticker name using the partition by
Clause and within each partition we will
sort the data by time using the order by
Clause the next step is to define the
pattern for our W shape in this case we
need to look for for specific data
points and these points need to occur in
the in a specific order therefore our
patent Clause is X plus followed by y
plus followed by W plus followed by Z
plus what do X Y W and Z represent using
the define clause we need to specify
what each of the four patterns is in
this case X is an event where the price
is less than the previous price and this
is the first leg of that W shape as
shown in the graph y is defined as an
event where the price is greater than
the previous price and finally W and Z's
simply repeat the first two patterns to
complete the W shape as shown here so
now we've created the pattern and define
the elements within that pattern now we
need to determine the outputs or
measures that will be returned each time
a match is found in this example we want
to return the start date and the end
date of the patent
therefore as X deferments the pattern at
the start of the W shape we need to date
from the first instance of X which is
shown as first X time Z defines the end
pattern of our W shape so we need to
know when that pattern finally ends we
need to extract
the last date relating to Z which is
shown as last Z dot time we can control
the level of detail returned by the
match recognizer command and in this
case we want to return a single row for
each match the alternative is to return
all rows for each match which will
create a much more detailed report the
table at the top of the screen shows the
output from a much recognized clause
there are two w-shaped patterns in our
dataset so there are two rows in the
output as shown here now we've
determined what we're going to output in
the level of detail the next step is to
find the patterns that last seven days
or less and calculate the average price
to limit the results to those patterns
that last seven days or less we just add
a new criteria to our define clause
using the z dot time and x dot time data
points as shown at the bottom of the
statement in bold and finally we
calculate the average price during the
final phase of the W shape pan using the
standard cycle syntax of average and
then we have our match recognized clause
to church for a w-shaped pattern that
lasts for seven days or less and outputs
the start date end date and the average
price during the final up phase of the
pan so during this quick podcast we've
reviewed y pattern matching is so
important and looked at a real world
place from the telecommunications
industry finally we've explored the new
12c match recognized clause that allows
us to search for sophisticated patterns
using sequel in the next podcast we'll
look at the syntax of this new clause in
more detail and do some demos using our
ticker string data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
