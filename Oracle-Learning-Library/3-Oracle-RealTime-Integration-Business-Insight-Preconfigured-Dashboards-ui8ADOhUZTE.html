how to design and map models in Oracle
real-time integration business insight
now let's move on to gaining insights
through dashboards the model is
activated it starts to collect metrics
to monitor and manage a large volume of
data John the business owner can gain
meaningful insight into business
performance right away through consoles
integration business insight provides
you the insight console which contains a
milestone status table and
pre-configured dashboards you can also
create customized dashboards the
milestone status table shows details on
the number of times that each milestone
has been passed John can filter the
counts by different criteria for example
when an instance started or ended how
long the instance took to complete or
which milestones have most recently been
passed for example John can check how
many tickets were rejected in the past 5
days you can also check over the past 30
days which milestone has been taking the
longest time to complete by sorting the
average time to following milestone
field in descending order remember the
default console also provides a number
of pre-configured dashboards that give
quick and intuitive understanding of how
the business is performing John can
quickly learn how many instances that
were started on March 8th are still
running by checking the active instances
dashboard and selecting March 8th as the
date it can also learn the average
instance completion time with just one
click on the completion time dashboard
the pre-configured dashboards also show
you which milestones have been passed
most often on each day and all errors
that have occurred over the filter span
integration business insight provides
you the ability to drill across
dashboards for example John can drill
down to the details of all the failed
instances by checking the instance list
of the red bubble all the failed
instances will be listed on the business
transaction dashboard in a new window
you can also check the details of any
particular instance this cross drilling
feature is available to all the
milestone dashboards and custom
dashboards for more information on how
to create news custom dashboards to get
more specific business insight check out
the creating custom dashboards video in
