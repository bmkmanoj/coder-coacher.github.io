provides a complete lifecycle
development environment to automate your
company's specific processes turn your
company specific processes into process
applications by creating a process model
that includes requests approvals
decision paths and roles for each task

applications and to collaboratively
develop them to help other developers
decision makers and stakeholders

descriptions of the process and its
components cost metrics links issues and
comments using the rich set of ready to
use business properties use the
implementation pane and data Association
tab in the process editor to configure

become the user interface for process
applications process analysts can create
web forms manually and generate the
underlying data automatically or create
the web forms from existing data
structures web form rules can be added
to automate and control the behavior of
the web form if you want to automate a
decision based on several interacting
factors for example is the expense limit
for a travel request higher for a
customer visit than for training and
create a series of if-then rules or
create a spreadsheet like decision table
two-way multiple factors and generate
multiple outcomes interact with other
applications using web service
connections or a built in REST API
before deploying an application use a
process player to test that the
processes flow correctly validate the
application for errors and use snapshots
to maintain multiple versions so that
processes in play are completed before
you retire older versions deploy to a
test environment first to fine-tune your
process design redeploy until end users
and managers are satisfied and then
promote to production generate reports
to provide business analysts developers
and managers additional information
about an application and for analysis
and process improvement use composer to
collaboratively develop your
applications using the business friendly
graphical tools for designing processes
rules forms and data deploy test and
refine those processes before production
deployment transform the way you do
business with Oracle process cloud
