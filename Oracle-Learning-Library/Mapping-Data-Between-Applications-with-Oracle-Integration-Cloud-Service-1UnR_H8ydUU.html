data using different identifiers and
mapping data between these applications
can be a real challenge
you need to met the message received
from the source to a form that the
target application understands for
example you need to match the IDS
between three different applications but
one calls the field simply ID the second
calls it organization ID and the third
calls it org ID
part of the solution is to create a data
map that identifies what fields in one
application correspond to what fields in
the other application here you see that
idea name a map to organization ID an
organization name however data mapping
is the most complex error-prone and
time-consuming task in any integration
development a lot of guesswork goes in
to mapping the data between applications
and you may not be familiar with the
message structure and the content
expected by the applications you're
integrating
the solution is the easy-to-use visual
data mapper that's embedded in
integration cloud service you can define
data mapping between different data
structures of the source and target
applications using drag-and-drop
you can create mappings from simple data
assignments to complex expressions or
computations transformation is supported
between XML to XML and it can even make
mapping recommendations to automate
things you can also add customized
mappings to pre-built integrations that
you import from Oracle marketplace the
data mapper comes with the mapping
builder to easily create advanced
mappings for example you can loop
through repeating elements using the for
each statement you can create
conditional statements using the if and
choose statements you can use a variety
of XPath functions
operators and XSL elements to transform
the data you transfer between
applications and you can reference
previously created lookups with a
special lookup function lookup value
integration cloud service also helps you
support fault handling you can map
portions of a message into the fault
message to compose a description that
helps you understand the fault
once you've specified the type of fault
for example server error fold you simply
click the map icon so integration cloud
service makes data mapping easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
