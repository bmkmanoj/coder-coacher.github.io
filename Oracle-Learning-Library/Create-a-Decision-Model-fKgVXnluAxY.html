have decisions to make in your business
processes Oracle process cloud service
supports decision model and notation dmn
the industry standard for modeling and
executing decisions a friendly enough
expression language F EE L makes
development intuitive and decision
models are reusable so for simpler
decision-making use D MN instead of
Oracle business rules
let's explore decision modeling by
automating a simple decision like do I
need an umbrella a raincoat or an
overcoat for today's weather the
business process starts with a form
where you enter forecast values for the
current temperature and the chance of
rain the decision model analyzes the
data the human task displays the results
how can you make the decision fast and
effectively with decision modeling first
create the model it's the container for
the decisions input data and decision
services let's look at the five main
steps in designing a decision model
begin by adding the result decision what
to bring for today's weather then add
the supporting decisions that feed into
the result decision you'll use two
additional decisions temperature and
weather rain is expected to decide what
to bring the decisions pane shows the
decision list a decision can reference
several of the decisions that occur
below it in the list which is why the
final result decision is listed first
followed by the supporting decisions
after your decision framework is in
place define the criteria needed to make
the decision add a data type for the
forecast define temperature and
precipitation as its attributes and then
add forecast as input data continue by
defining the logic behind a decision
making process if the chance of
precipitation is greater than 80 then
the condition is true and rain is likely
if the temperature is greater than 65
then it's warm else it's cold the what
to bring result decision uses a table to
process the supporting decision results
temperature and rain and provide an
answer
use a decision table anytime there are
multiple conditions that interact to
determine different outcomes each row in
the table is one rule these columns are
for input data you can add more columns
as needed the last column is for the
output data easily select values based
on the input data you already define to
enter the four possible outcomes of the
final decision if it's warm and rainy
bring an umbrella cold and rainy better
wear a raincoat cold and dry bundle up
in an overcoat warm and dry you're all
set no need to bring anything it's a
good idea to test the decision model for
example it is 85 degrees and there's an
85 percent chance of rain
then it's warm and rain is expected so
carry that umbrella to use your decision
model in your process applications add a
new decision service define what to
bring as the final decision to output
and define forecast as the input data to
use you created a decision model but how
do you use it in an application first
deploy a snapshot of the decision model
to the dmn server add the decision model
and service to the process map the data
coming in to the decision and exiting
from the decision and then try it in
workspace just start the forecast
application enter the temperature and
chance of rain and submit the form now
view the result and be prepared for
whatever the weather may be thank you
