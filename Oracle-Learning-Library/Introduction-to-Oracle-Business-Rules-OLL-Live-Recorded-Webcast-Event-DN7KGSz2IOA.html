Oracle business rules using Oracle
business rules specifically in people
our presenter today is going to be Ron
Pinkerton he's a principal curriculum
developer in the server technologies
curriculum group here at Oracle oh this
is the time for me to sign off and for
Rhonda pick up to tell you about
business rules
so here you go Ron okay very if you'll
hand me presenter yep it'll take a
second you've got it
all right well thank you for the
introduction Gary and to everyone hello
and welcome to this oh L l live
presentation about Oracle business rules
today I'm going to guide you through
such a bridged version of a course that
we offer and what we're going to see
today is a conceptual introduction to
Oracle business rules and then an
exploration of how those business rules
can be used from within a beetle process
the goal of our course today is to offer
you a brief introduction to the business
rules there's plenty more to talk about
then we're going to get to and to
acquaint you with some additional Oracle
business rules Oracle Learning Library
offerings that are available about
Oracle business rules so let's get
started the same so we have our outline
here we'll start with some basic
vocabulary and concepts we're going to
assume that - so a wide range of
experience respondents although a couple
of you indicated you weren't familiar
with Oracle business rules so we're
going to start by talking about some
basic definitions vocabulary and
concepts that describe the underpinnings
of Oracle business rules we're they
going to translate those concepts into a
configuration plan step through a little
mini case study and then take a look
within the product itself to see how we
might configure an Oracle old business
rules service component within a
composite application and call it from
people so we'll start by talking about
the Oracle business rules dictionary
that's a container for one or more rule
sets and data models for an application
as we see in our diagram the rule set is
a container it's got definitions for a
group of related rules and decision
tables every dictionary has one or more
rule sets the data model includes
descriptions of the data values
variables things like that that are used
in the rules and decision tables now if
these are new terms to you don't worry
these are the things we're going to
start talking about so we want to tie
all this together for you in the next
few slides so we'll start with talking
about rules we refer to Oracle business
roles as declarative rules and we use
that term because the
the rules Mike declarations based on
conditions and actions rather than on
coding they typically take the form of
an if-then statement in other words if
condition then actions we see an example
of that on the screen so the condition
portion of the statement tests whether
some business condition is true in this
case whether a customer is a premium
customer and here we're thinking about
business not programming it's one of the
advantages of using Oracle business
rules were able to extract business
logic and business policies from coding
and programming make it available to
business analysts for configuration and
maintenance so excuse me so we have a
business condition being tested is
customer or premium customer if if that
statement is true then the action
portion of the rule is executed one or
more actions are taken in this case if
the customer is a premium customer we'll
apply a 10% discount now all of these
statements are declared without any
control flow again we've isolated the
these things where they're going to be
managed by the Oracle business rules
engine and we've extracted them from the
programming layer so keep that in mind
as we step through the rest of our
conversation next thing we want to do is
talk about facts rules apply their logic
to data objects known as facts our facts
are discrete pieces of data they
typically constitute input and output
values for the business rule so for
example our fact can represent customer
information or sales order detail fact
types describe facts so you can think of
fact as an instance of a fact type if we
want to put it in more Java like terms
the fact types are part of the data
model that we saw earlier contained in
the rules dictionary and they need to be
defined before we can actually create
any rules in Oracle business rules
there's several types of facts that we
can that are supported including XML
facts based on XS d definitions
Java facts based on a java class rules
language facts based on a rules language
function we've only got a short period
of time today so we're going to confine
our conversation to XML facts a global
represents a data value or an expression
that can be evaluated in rule conditions
Global's can be variables or constants
they're visible to all rule sets in the
dictionary remember we said there may be
more than one rule set okay
Global's can be a variable or constant
they're similar to public static
variables in Java so for example if
orders over a certain amount require
approval we can create news and approval
limit global that's what we see here so
we see a completed rule if order total
greater than approval limit then needs
approval equals true so there's our
business rule we see order total so I
can order total greater than approval
limit there's our condition order total
is an incoming fact approval limit is
the global that we're using me then
needs approval equals true that's our
action item so if the order total is
greater then we're going to set a value
for needs approval equals true one of
the advantages of using Global's is they
can be used across multiple rules and
multiple rule sets so they're visible
across the dictionary and this is also
important because in the case of things
like business policy again the approval
limit is for instance four thousand
today it might be three thousand
tomorrow or five thousand tomorrow based
on business rules because we're using a
global we can change the value one time
in one place and all of our rules are
automatically updated so contrast that
with the notion of updating rules one at
a time with hard-coded values and I
think you'll see the advantage of using
Global's bucket sets are another feature
or element business rules dictionary
that we want to talk about bucket sets
provide the ability to define lists of
values for ranges of values that we can
using our business rules the way a
bucket set works it splits the value
space of a data type into buckets so
they're defined as either lists or lists
of ranges so let's take a look at what
that might mean here we see a pair of
example bucket sets one list of values
red blue green so we have three separate
string values we have a second example
range of values less than one one to ten
greater than ten so I can associate the
bucket sets with decision tables we'll
talk more about those in a moment fact
properties Global's or within functions
and function arguments okay so this
association and can be used as a
constraint to limit the acceptable range
of values so in the place where we might
have an answer that's red blue or green
by using a bucket set those are the only
answers we're going to see so we'll use
an example in a moment of using a bucket
set in a decision table but first let's
talk about the decision tables
themselves okay we took a look a moment
ago at a very simple example of a
business rule one if condition then
action within the real real world of
business our business policies and
probably more complex than that we may
have many many rules that apply to a
given situation a decision table offers
us a chance then to express those rules
in more of a spreadsheet like format so
we can use a decision table to create a
set of rules that cover all combinations
of values and actions or a set of rules
in which no two combinations conflict if
you take a look at the example on screen
we see rows labeled condition and action
and we think about plugging in the
various values here in the three columns
if shift choice equals to day then use
carrier read shipper if shift choice
equals five day then use green shipper
and so on so we see here the value of
providing constraints or lists of values
the customer imagine are we have
customer order data and they've made a
shipping choice how fast do they want
service we've given them exactly four
choices one of these four value
it's will be part of the order data so
what we want to do is determine which
shipper to use based on their choice and
we have a list of only three shippers
that we use so rather than putting a
more verbose if shipping choice equals
to de then use red ship or else if
shipping choice equals five de then use
green ship or else if shipping choice
equals next day or international then
use blue ship that gets to be a little
verbose a little more complex so the
decision table offers us a more complex
compact and intuitive choice when
there's many rules our combinations of
values that need to be analyzed
so let's take a look then how does a
bucket set really work within the
decision table okay so we learned their
bucket sets can be associated with
decision tables and fact types and we
see an example on the screen okay our
bucket sets have been defined within an
Access D file that describes the facts
used in the decision table remember we
said we talked about XML facts today so
here we see a sample schema we have a
XML element known as shipping info with
a child element known a shipping choice
similarly shipping company and carrier
and then we see using XML constraints we
define the four values that can be used
for the shipping option the four vet are
the three values that can be used for
the carrier so these are all defined
within the single excess D file they
provide us the list of possible values
and those drive the values that can and
will be used at runtime within the
business rules so we've covered a lot of
ground in a short time let's go ahead
and pause for just a minute check our
understanding here with a couple of
polls
okay looks like four out of six of us
have answered ruleset we have one bucket
set and one no answer and rule set is
the correct answer there so I think we
have one more poll kewda
all right and we have four out of six
folks answered at action the other two
abstained and action is the correct
answer on that alright let's go ahead
and continue then talk briefly about
Oracle business rules engine so we
understand we've taken a quick look at
the pieces that go into a rules
dictionary let's see why they we care
and how they interact at runtime so
Oracle business rules engine includes a
client context and a rules session focus
our attention on the rule session first
we see there's an area known as working
memory and we see the rule sets we
talked about those right container for
our rules and decision tables over on
the client side the client has the
ability to assert or add facts to
working memory we learnt those facts can
be XML data or Java objects among other
types the rules engine then attempts to
match rule conditions to the facts in
working memory remember we said if
customer is premium customer so the
matching engine is going to try to
determine based on any of these facts do
we believe the customer is a premium
customer when matches are found what
happens is known as activation and the
rules are actually cued up in an agenda
which is also in working memory so when
all of the matching has occurred and all
of the activations have occurred that
are going to the rules are then fired
and this is the place then where the
action portion of the rule is executed
so first the conditions are all
evaluated then the actions are executed
okay so among the actions that can be
taken or I should say the action then
can't has the ability to add change or
delete the facts in working memory so
changes are made directly to facts okay
and if any facts are added
or changed or deleted the matching
activation firing an action cycle
happens again so this is cyclically till
there are no further matches which yield
no further actions so that's the basic
operation of the business rules engine
take a little bit a little bit different
tack we're going to look at it one more
time here
the Oracle business rules engine is what
we call an inference engine an inference
is a conclusion that's logically made
based on a set of facts or circumstances
in our case the word facts applies very
well so an Oracle business rules the lod
excuse me the Oracle business rules
provide the logic okay available data is
the facts see in the inference engine
then is going to do the searching until
it finds one where the condition is true
so we have here again another look at
our member our rule session we have a
rule set
that's populated by a series of rules if
customers goal discounts 10% their
platinum 15% the customer spends between
three thousand four thousand nine
hundred ninety nine make them gold more
than four thousand nine hundred ninety
nine make them platinum and then we have
working memory remember we said that
client has the ability to assert facts
into working memory so we're going to
make a real small simple example one
fact asserted hackney widgets has placed
an order worth six thousand so we'll
assume that's all the assertion that's
going to happen so the next thing that
kicks in the matching begins so there's
an attempt to match customer is a gold
customer so we want to match the
condition to the fact there's no match
there there's nothing in that fact that
suggests a customer's goal if customers
a platinum customer discount is fifteen
percent no match customer spends between
three thousand four four thousand nine
hundred ninety-nine again no match
however the fourth rule we have a match
customers spent more than four thousand
nine hundred ninety nine so we have our
condition is met so we have an
activation so we're added to the queue
and the agenda now in our case that's
the end of the matching so all of the
activated rules are going to be fired so
now the action force
make the customer a platinum customer
remember we said that that action
includes asserting facts in the memory
new fact asserted Acme widgets is a
platinum customer we also said if there
was any change cycle would occur again
so we see that now customer is a gold
customer still no match however this
time around the second rules a matched
customers a platinum customer now the
other two rules we'd attempt to match
they wouldn't match so again this would
be the only activated rule discount is
15% new fact asserted the matching
process would occur one more time
because there's been change but no
additional matches would be found
so we've now determined the return value
of our call to our business rule Acme
widgets discount is 15% so we've placed
the order data in we've received the
discount value out so this cycle because
the forward chaining excuse me
forward chaining inference remember we
said inference draw conclusion from fad
for retaining because this is self
driving cycle it will occur again and
again until there's no further facts to
evaluate so let's go ahead and check our
one more time one quick poll on our
understanding of that and we'll move on
to the service component and the V pal
call
okay looks like we have four out of six
saying assert we have one answer in fact
in one abstention an assert is indeed
the correct answer to that question so
let's go ahead then move on and talk
about the service component we're going
to take the concepts we just discussed
and translate them into a configuration
plan and then we'll move to the demo
portion excuse me of our conversation
and see how that configuration of the
service component and the vehicle call
work so we have a little mini case study
at the top of the slide business v4
business process within a composite app
handles incoming purchase orders any
order with the total greater than 4,000
must be reviewed so that's the cut
that's our requirements so we take all
the things we've just learned and we say
well what does this mean to me how and
where do I start how do I build a
business rule so we start by answering
some questions we say what is the
business policy your automated our
examples pretty small pretty easy to see
any order with total greater than 4,000
must be reviewed we want to refine that
policy to one or more if-then statements
so we say if order amount greater than
4,000 then review required equals true
I've chosen the words order amount and
review required arbitrarily we're simply
using this placeholder variable names
for our conversation so we look at the
refined policy and does it use one or
more else if statements in other words
is there a case for using a decision
table here our sample is pretty small
pretty simple don't really see the
justification for that so we're going to
say no so we add the business rule to
our requirements and we continue asking
questions what input facts are needed to
complete the rule test well we need to
know the order amount and we need to
think about data type that's one of the
things we're going to have to assign so
we say yeah the order total now what
does it need to look like we
a whole number in our example but it's a
good guess that a decimal value will be
more appropriate now we're using simple
data types here this is all based on XML
so we could have larger more complex
constructs in the real world we're going
to keep this pretty straight ahead
pretty simple one more question to
answer
what will the response or output fat
look like review required equals true
well that word true is a hint that we
probably want to use a boolean value to
flag whether the review is required or
not so one more thing then we want to
turn our attention to the opportunity to
use Global's or bucket sets to make our
example more sound
are there any values that may be used in
many places we don't know we see there's
an approval threshold there we don't
know we don't have any information so
based on that we might say no however
the next question says are there values
that may change with business policy and
because this is a business policy again
could be 3000 or 5000 tomorrow yes there
is a value that may change as we saw
earlier that's a pretty good indicator
that a global is a good idea here and
then finally we think about bucket sets
are there any lists or ranges of values
we want to apply as constraints to our
facts or Global's again based on our
modest case study the answer will be no
this time around so that's us processing
our case study so we review our
configuration plan then we've actually
answered all the questions we need to
first we need to define facts in an xs D
file and we'll create a composite
application and we'll import the XS D
file we'll create a business rule
service component in our composite
application that's a given and we'll
link it to a rules dictionary and
finally we'll configure that rules
dictionary making sure it includes a
necessary factor I'm going to back up
there and I'm going to switch to demo
just to talk about got some editing
windows open here first we can see for
instance the order type decimal no
further configuration specified here
similarly element review with a child of
type of type boolean
required some a review dot required of
type boolean that's all that all that we
needed to do to define our XS D I'm
going to click now on the composite XML
window this is our graphical
representation of the composite
application it's a couple elements I
want to draw your attention to the first
disordered processing this is our befell
process and this arrow in connector to
the left to the orange box says order
review order review is our business rule
service component so that what we see
represented in these two elements is the
business process calling the service
component let's go ahead and take a look
at the service component first a double
click we've already created this or in
the rules designer now looking at the
contents of the rules dictionary there's
a series of tabs down the left here that
give us a window into what's inside I
click the facts tab and we see here a
fact called order and one called review
there's a third overhead fact not of
concern to us generated automatically so
I have the ability to add edit or delete
facts from this window so I can dig into
the order fact make changes if I need to
ok I can add fact I can delete and so on
we said we were going to use a global
we've got one created here called review
threshold of type bigdecimal
that's going to value a 6000 our rule
said 4,000 we're going to want to edit
that so when I click on my pencil icon I
see here I could change the name the
data type I could associate the global
with a bucket set and I can change the
value I'm going to click on the
expression builder here to do exactly
that so I replace this with 4,000 I say
ok constant final description all in
place looks good now I've made this
single change no matter how many rules
rely on this the change has been made
well globally so rather than have to go
in and edit rules one at a time
tediously we've just seen an advantage
of using the Global's now we say we
weren't using bucket sets this time we
won't have time to talk about links
decision functions but let's go ahead
and take a look at the rule set I see
the rule set here I see a rule named
review required so it's got a logical
name
and I see if order dot amount greater
than or equal to review threshold then
assert remember we said we could put
facts in memory a new fact of type
review the element required set to true
go ahead and add one more fact here call
it snow review and I'm going to insert a
test I have a series of pull downs here
product already has some intelligent
ideas about what's available based on
what's in my composite application so if
order amount is less than the global
named review threshold then I want to
assert a new fact of type review and set
its prop it's child value property
property think we need to use the
expression builder on that we can select
from the drop down false no review
required and that's all there is to
defining a rule all of this has been
done by us in just a matter of a couple
of minutes within the editor and we see
some benefits or something known as a
decision function added the decision
function provides the ability for the
business rule to be called as a web
service so all of this has been defined
automatically what we're really looking
at here is the equivalent of an abstract
wisdom yes it'll be invoked as a
stateless web service here's the name of
the service it's going to invoke here's
the input and the output again order and
review so this is how Beatle is going to
be able to call our business rule let's
go ahead and take a look at the default
process okay we have an unfinished
business rule or business process here
we do have the key pieces in we have a
client is passing data to the business
process that input is being received and
then that input is being passed to
business rule
this is our activity or discrete step
within the business process excuse me
that provides us access or the ability
to invoke our business rule I see here
there's a dictionary associated order
review was the data dictionary that was
created we're invoking the decision
service that we just saw a moment ago
attach description of the operation and
the input and output fact it's here that
we're assigning data from the befell
process to be in location and to do that
I clicked on the plus icon and what I
got was a GUI that generates a copy
statement so I have a representation of
the entire order data for the customer
remember we said we want to check the
order totals so that particular element
is highlighted the right-hand pane I
have a variable known as DSN stands for
decision servicing in this case and I've
selected order dot amount of type
decimal with these two fields
highlighted I click OK and the
appropriate VPL copy instructions per
generated to assign this to the
invocation similar process went into
assigning the output facts and that's a
that's about what was involved excuse me
in invoking the business the business
rule service component now remember we
said it's going to return a value so
we're going to want to process that
within B pal we'll do that with an if
statement here so I say if we have a B
pal variable called needs approval here
if needs approval equals true and then
the if statement splits off where I can
plug in the actions our process is
incomplete if it needs approval I might
add an invocation here to a human task
where I'd actually get a human being
involved to review the order and approve
it or possibly reject it if it doesn't
need approval I might put
programmatically in here a befell step
that automatically updates the order
status to market as approved
in any event one myth whether it's
manually or automatically the order will
receive its approval or rejection
potentially and then that responsibly
passed back from V pal to the calling
client
so I'm going to move back to be Pelle
now gir to the presentation I'm going to
skip past a couple of slides here we've
seen this piece already we've done our
demo and that brings us them to the Q&amp;amp;A
session I wonder if the your chat window
you might have any questions about
anything we talked about
or potentially anything we didn't
don't be shy go ahead and use that chat
window Ronda looks like we don't have
any questions okay
yeah anything else that you wanted to
say run well just briefly I'd like to
point out that the Oracle Learning
Library at the URL that you see on your
screen now has free demonstrations and
tutorials including a couple of Oracle
business rule titles this presentation
was a distillation of a very abridged
version of two of those titles
introduction to Oracle business rules
and using Oracle business rules from V
foe so I certainly invite and encourage
you to visit the Oracle Learning Library
take a look at those and other
demonstrations and tutorials that are of
interest to you all right well thanks
Rhonda okay and I would like to take one
last second and say I'm Ron Pinkerton
and thank you for your time and
attention today
and a big thanks to you run for great
giving a great presentation a great
introduction the Oracle business rules
that brings us to the end of our
presentation and I like to mention that
if you're interested in playing back
this webinar of Acts or accessing other
free content just go to the Oracle
Learning Library and it's the Earl that
Ron presented earlier and you'll be able
to do both so that concludes our webinar
many thanks to you for all attending
we're going to have more of these in the
future and wish you a great day bye
