incompetents that motivation equals
innovation ? so we'll try to see if it
actually equals or not if you have any
questions during the course of the talk
just go ahead and ask them I want this
to be more of a conversation than just a
presentation and when I am speaker and
you are the audience and I'm having all
the fun you have none okay so two words
about me my name is Andre breslov
ambling project cabin and jet bring it's
a new programming language which is good
for there are many things and I'll show
you lots of examples of artworks today I
also work on project lambda in JCP so
I'm trying to improve Java not only my
own language ok so today we'll be
talking about basically how new things
and innovation in general comes around
and in particular how Kaplan comes
around and where features come from so
what what we put into the language what
we don't where ideas come from so on so
forth first of all why bother with a new
language it should be a good question so
common started as a modern language for
the JDM so we looked at the present
moment at that time it was what two and
a half years ago and it looked very
funny java was started in 1995 and it's
been a great platform and a great
language at that time and a platform has
evolved a lot so we have many new few
frameworks new libraries lots of stuff
but the language didn't change that that
much if you draw a parallel with
Hardware in 1995 I used to have this
kind of monitor well actually it was
maybe 1998 already yeah and I ran java
and displayed on my monitor today I have
this pretty monitor and run basically
the same language
I mean I displayed the same language on
this monitor which is kind of in this
match I mean this is so much better than
this but and take so much less space but
my code is still lengthy and ugly and
everything this is unfair I mean
everything should be economic not only
hardware so I think this is the main
reason for the huge demand for new
programming languages that arose there
were recently so the year we launched it
was 2011 three other industrial
languages were announced so it's not
like some enthusiasts in their garages
are trying to come up with new fancy
languages just for the sake of the you
know the fun of developing a new
language but industrial players have
realized that we really need something
new or rather something weren't there is
no point in just being new for the sake
of be new we need something usable so I
like to think about colin has a modern
language for industry which means that
we are basically up to date with the
state of the art so we do not really
cutting-edge but pretty up-to-date
things and this is like what you can
possibly do and your constraint is
that's that you have an industrial
setting many huge projects while leaving
code bases many people on the team so it
should be readable should be
understandable by many people should be
manageable as a body of complexity so
for me it's mostly about right
abstractions safety and to and support
by right abstractions I mean that so
it's very easy to eliminate stupid
boilerplate from your code just you know
amid those public static final in front
of your main and you're so much happier
already but this is not really essential
well this is important
by the way I really hate the term
syntactic sugar because like all of the
languages syntactic sugar over whatever
byte code so it's not about like making
it a little nicer it may be a huge web
but still it's an easy thing it can fix
the syntax or some basic conventions but
there is a bigger thing behind it your
language has to provide right
obstructions for you to be able to put
your common patterns you go over and
over again in your code into the library
not to repeat yourself enlarge repeating
yourself in the small is annoying but
not that crucial it's much worse than
you have to do something big all over
again for the 10th time because it can't
put it into life into the library so a
huge point there is to have right
abstractions in your language another
thing is safety of course if you're
working a lot of project you want to
make sure that certain kinds of errors
just don't happen period so static
languages are very good for large code
bases m 2 in support is huge again if
you have lots of code you need to
navigate you need to refactor
automatically so on so forth and another
constraint here is that we all have so
much code already written in Java that
if you if I come to you and say okay I
have this great language that is not
interoperable at all with anything you
have so it's so cool you just abandon
your old code base and move to my new
language you look at me like this you're
crazy okay good thank you all right so
for example with jetbrains we want this
in your language as well and we have
like 10 years or 10 year old code base
with 50k classes and we can't just
rewrite the mall in copper so
interpretability is a crucial thing now
how things are when you are trying to do
something new where you look for
for inspiration for features for stuff
basically you have people coming over to
your workplace for example and saying hi
I always wanted that you're like God the
guy has no idea what is talking about
it's absolutely impossible to that just
doesn't make any sense so basically
people who don't know much about how
languages work internally like what the
compiler actually does what's the
bytecode so on so forth the country and
say change the world for us that's what
we actually want and you're an expert
you know what you can do what you can do
and you know what people actually do how
it's done like what's the tradition and
you're like had guys you're you have no
idea just back off it's not possible and
this is a this a very common thing in my
point here today is that those users
normally make sense I mean they may put
their wishes in some kind of an odd form
but there is usually sense to what
they're talking about it's it may be
actually hard to do on or impossible to
do all together like you have 10,000
users every 10 want something else and
you've maybe not able to put everything
together but usually it's a very good
idea to listen to those in competent
people here who know nothing about your
abilities to build this or that or
implement this or that or over JDM but
they know what is needed so I'm trying
to you know avoid this arrogant dad if
you have okay here's my expert box I'm
in there I'm not getting out I'm
reaching out for her those incompetent
user so i think in competence is really
important here so because they they
think out of the box because they don't
know about the boss this is a huge point
so this is great for requirements really
great but then of course you need some
really competent people to implement
that but for requirements
it's very good that you just don't know
that the box exists at all for
implementation you need competence you
need people who know compilers and
everything and so me being one of those
people it's very important that I pay
attention to what do you say no matter
how ignorant you are about the box the
box is mine you don't care so for an
example people can say okay constructors
my god i hate constructors so much
they're so stupid I don't want
constructors neither getters and setters
I just one feels it's it's so easy so
straightforward there why don't you just
put fields into the language and get
freed of all that you know and I'm
like hey stop pushing against Proctor
how do you initialize those pills you
can do without them of course you need
getters and setters it can't guarantee
any binary compatibility without them so
it does make any sense right and then
okay what they exactly say me not make
sense but they want a reasonable thing
they won no stupid coat and we can do
that so if I show you a little bit of
cuddling now it will be like we're going
from this here so what users actually
hate is this so this is a class that
does what thank you this class is
nothing and doesn't fit on the screen
it's just an affair and look at the
repetition like first name first name
first name first name first name first
name it's really convincing the compiler
knows that I'm talking about the first
name it's sure because I said it like
this many times so this is what users
hate they don't really care about the
construction being there or not being
there the fields anything they want just
a reasonable way to write code so that's
what we eat them first of all we start
with
like this say okay well you can actually
emit like half of the repetition first
name first name person not that bad okay
and well in fact there is a constructor
and the Arab gathers and no setters here
because the class is immutable but there
could be setters as well good but you
don't have to write all that you know
boilerplate stuff just here is the
constructor in the header of the class
with first name last name and age its
parameters and here is the body of the
class within initialization ninety
percent of your constructors will fit
into this better now it's not how we
actually do it I mean this is matt pabla
three times per name of repetition and
then string and string here spring a
drink here in than in here it's not very
good so what we actually do after a
little thinking and learning from other
languages in fact is this so this is how
you actually define data users hate
constructors well it's just data
declarations users head getters and
setters dear you're automatically users
one fields well that's wrong but what
they get is basically very much like
fields because you can access it just by
name it works Duke hear that again ER
gets cold somewhere probably not any
questions okay I would never write that
um yeah well let me just just repeat the
comment so the ID takes care of the
boilerplate right meaning it generates
all the boilerplate like it's the idea
is a boilerplate producer aren't we like
shutting off our business of generating
boilerplate
by coming up with this language well
probably well if that is our business
then yes but our business is actually
factoring and navigation not generating
boil boil bite so if we solve a boiler
plate plate generator that would be a
terrible disaster for us but we don't
sell that would okay any more questions
oh you don't have to put them here and
just to show you one more thing if you
say data in front of it it's sorry it
will have to string and equals in
hashcode automatical again the
boilerplate generation part of the ID is
not that needed anymore so you used to
just say add equals and hashcode and get
some code that you never read well now
you never see ok any questions here dec
08 you get getting setters anyway and
data it gives u equals hash code into
string yes yes you can say I want my two
string to return a doosra just pray no
yes okay Garon's and setters yes but not
in this form so to dispense if I catch
some Gators you need to have the fields
in the body of the class properties of
the body of the class sale to specify
and gather explicitly you will have to
repeat yourself but you they rarely do
that frankly Yeah Yeah right and you
initialize with this first right
and so here the our final so these veils
mean that they are not mutable there are
no setters but if you say bar there it
won't be as together and said it there
good okay then to the next question that
poor user comes up and said well you say
everything is an object right can I say
just three dot to string why should I go
wide string dot value off three desert
ridiculous you're like okay you know
there are those primitive types there
start differently they represented
differently in memory so and so forth
you can actually pass them by reference
blah blah blah and then really it
probably can do something about it in
fact so the wake up and sees it Oh
doesn't want to show you the ID sorry
abandon the way karbonn actually does it
is that you can say 1 dot to string no
problem it's a method in a glass and you
also can say one plus three and if you
want your own class to have a plus you
can also say that you have a plus
function here whatever it says i can add
an into user makes no sense but i can
still can do that return 0 so i'll be
able to say here John plus 5 it will
work ah sorry it's too low so it's a
uniform what they call it a uniform tops
is so everything is a class no matter
that it's not a class at one time so for
the jvm of course we use primitive
values because we need perform and so on
so forth but it doesn't mean you can
call methods
on numbers the compiler can figure it
out for you okay now no I'll have to
start the presentation over another
concern people come and say guys that
string class in the JD King has so many
methods but elects so many methods to
like I don't don't have anything to like
say string that words or string
capitalized or file get extension I
can't do those things and I can't say
filed upload text just to read the text
from the violent this is a very common
task so why don't you somehow add those
things to do the classes oh my
interesting well you know that jdk is
not my product right it's like coming
from from article i probably can submit
a patch to openjdk but it never gets
through so sorry about that but then
okay what user actually wants is not
like alter the class what they want is
to be able to say string dot words or
file to load text right so the point is
not to actually add a method to the
existing class but to enable them to
pull what they want to call and that's
what we do for example okay this will be
the first example for example to iterate
over a string you need to be in trouble
right or now in Java you would need to
be in trouble in common you just have to
have the iterator method so the point is
there is that a string has this iterator
defined for it but it's of course not
there in the string class we're using
Java strength and still you can call it
and for work why so I'll just navigate
to the source of this iterator
here here is the source it's a function
that looks like this or normal function
would say fun iterator whatever and this
one says fun string dot iterator
whatever this is called an extension
function something that can be called on
an instance of a string with a dud it's
not a member of that class it's in fact
it's just a static method like those in
your string you tell class string util
dot iterator off string but the syntax
goes so that you can call it with the
dot and it makes all those conventions
possible so that i can iterate over to
string this way and i have code
completion here so if i hit control
space i have the proposal listen I can
explore the whole API not only what's
declared in the class with everything
including those extensions and I can see
it in the familiar form questions so the
yeah the question is so this is good but
only halfway through we would like to
make string actual iterable again we do
that in fact you can not in goblin for
example in scale up they have this
notion of implicit conversions where you
can convert your data implicitly and I
think this is something I just don't
like in the language design because it
hides things from you so this thing is
explicit you have a method call here but
if you do an apposite conversion so you
benefit from being able to treat a
string as an interval but you don't see
the code that it
that is getting cold and well my
experience with Skala and other people's
experience with skala is that this can
be really problematic because you just
have a line of code which does so much
because of those implicit and you have
no idea that they are there so what this
may be a whole point but I really yeah I
once spent like 40 minutes probably
trying to figure out one line of code in
the scallop standard library because it
was it was a straightforward method I
just couldn't see how it does what it
does and so that is not the point the
point if excuse me to to remove those
things that are not needed to
communicate the meaning to the reader
and there are so semi Collins are not
essential because you can see everything
without them but calls are essential
otherwise you don't know what's going on
yeah yeah so the question is can we do
something like in a hour total direction
without like making the string integral
but providing some way of treating is it
somehow like an iterable we're thinking
about something like this it's pretty
hard to do but it's on the table okay
let me go on just to save time because
we're not there with theft here all
right another thing is of course
collections here is my list this is how
you create the this is how a list
literal looks in cudlin is just a
function call and you pass the list I
in and this is how you filter a
collection is a collection dot filter of
a predicate does it make any sense i
mean this notation here you understand
what it is and so this is what they call
an anonymous function or a lambda
expression or mistakenly it's called a
closure although the quarter is empty
here the point is that this filter is a
function that takes another function as
an argument it's an old familiar concept
it's called a strategy right so actually
this function takes a strategy for
filtering elements and the easy way to
write this down is just too but a single
function in there the important thing
about having filter and extension
function and not like utility function
in some collection unit class is that
this way you can stack them one on top
of the other in the right in the
readable way so if i want to say filter
and then say that map and map every user
to its first name his first name oh
sorry first name i can do this and it
says exactly what i wanted to say like
take the users filter them add them up
if you imagine what it looks like when
you use utility static utility function
there are not extensions you say it's
map of filter of users and this
predicate comma this predicate this
function here so it's all backwards and
that's why this syntactic sugar is very
important any questions ok so now let's
go and see the next i was arranging by
their users
what are your values too few we're on
board well this is actually problematic
so I'm not just giving stupid excuse
here because the JVM bytecode doesn't
let you in any way to return more than
one thing from a function so all you can
do is pass a reference back or a
primitive value no other way but users
don't care in many situations sometimes
may be problematic for performance to
allocate a new object but Ramon
situations you want just to return say a
pair and to assign it to multiple
variables on the call sign so the
current solution for that is that if you
have a pair object you can just assign
it to a pair of variables anywhere so if
any function returns you a pair you
don't have to then mess up with this
pair everywhere you just say assign it
to this pair of variables and that's it
so the more interesting example would be
have a map by the way this is how you
create maps in the code it's a hashmap
then key to value key to another value
key to the third what value these are
all function calls no special syntax so
in the for loop you can do multiple
declaration as well so you can say okay
I have a map it's basically an iterable
of g2 value but actually it has an
easier appears from key to failure and
you can say okay for my key and value in
the map I want to do something with them
this is basically the answer to ninety
percent of the cases when you want to
return anything from the function and if
you want something special you can again
fall back for data classes and say here
is my not a pair class but say a triple
clause
and you can since you have this data
annotation here you'll be able to assign
this foo object your terms humor your
function to a triple or variable just
dick instruct it down to call sign
watchin okay it also is doing some thai
or not really now it's easier so if i
have a fool if I have a few i can assign
it to a triple and outwards actually it
calls special functions component one to
assign to a component to to assign to be
component 32 scientist ii and these
functions also get generated by this
data data annotation go ahead yes we do
local type inference so you can declare
local variables without type
specifications we infer so in the
previous example filter all the types
for for the functions here where
inferred and the type of this variable
and the types for arguments to these
functions although local things are
inferred okay these were multi
declarations time okay now to the next
question
we have this huge frustration in Java
when you have something that takes a
list of object and you can pass a list
of strings in isn't it unfortunate any
understanding of the audience like why
not don't you say hate it like why all
right so let's see what it's like in God
lon sorry bring it up here okay here's
my list my print of a list so here's a
print function it takes the list and
print it out here is a list of integers
so it's type which is inferred here it's
actually there it's an ArrayList of int
not any and still I can call print of L
tell them roll no we're better than that
about inferring covariance is that is
actually a very dangerous thing to do so
the point here is that what this print
does it only reads from this list right
so if anybody knew that it only reads it
will be fined bass strings or int inside
because the problem with this I can't
assign a list of strength to list of
objects is that if you have this
reference to list of objects and put an
imp there it will conflict with other
strings and it will blow up somewhere
else but if we knew that this was
actually read only it will be fine right
and here is how we handle this this is
the goblins collections hierarchy we use
Java collections you saw the ArrayList
there so it's Java collections by the
better version it's one hundred percent
compatible but we have read-only
interfaces in triple collection set and
lists are read-only and then we derive
mutable interval mutable collection
mutable said immutable list
which reflect basically the full Java
interfaces and derive the ArrayList a
hashtag prompt dear it's a pure
compilation time trick so these classes
actually don't exist and these are
exactly the java.util the interval
collection set list but the user doesn't
care what you want is to pass a list of
objects elizab string where list of
objects is expected so this fixes two
problems one is this usability issue and
another is the problem of creating
immutable collections because now you
can derive directly from here and have
you mutable classes behave properly
questions all right that was easy mm-hmm
now another question what do you like
that so why wait I was told lots of the
time that nulls are bad just don't use
nulls why is that because it blows up on
here basically you have your null you
pass it around and some point you just
try to call something out and you get it
stupid nullpointerexception it gives you
no idea where this now comes from
because you can't just track it in the
program so it was actually a very
competent person not an incompetent
bunch of users who came up and told us
that we have to figure out the nose and
we took the challenge and it basically
worried so let's have a look here is a
piece of Java code so this has a bomb in
it Obama's this list files because the
java.io.file API is such that if that
does not exist or is not a directory you
don't get like an empty list or an
exception here you just get in null why
not empty lists or empty arrays in this
the situation are so critical let's give
them a null that's why anyway so you're
nothing warns me about the problem here
is the cosmic version so in the comic
version i'm doing the same thing here is
the java.io.file i create an object here
and say list files and now i'm trying to
print as files of size and it doesn't
let me do because it knows that this
thing maybe know if you look at the type
that is inferred here it has a scary ?
it says okay that is an array of file
may be either in rio file or a null so
the file of the type system tracks the
null ability of the things and if you
have this ? over here you can't just
reference it right away you have to do
something before you actually put a dot
there a one reasonable thing to do is
say that if files is not now I want to
do that again the compiler is just it
just has all the information you can do
that or you could say if files is now I
want to return and otherwise I can
dereference it or you could say it files
us now or files that size is zero I want
to return and hear your dereferencing
but you already know that this was not
true because you are on the right of the
or exactly exactly
questionable so we're talking Manos here
if somebody doesn't know about it yet so
the approach taken by Haskell and some
other languages is that we well in
Haskell there is no such thing as null
anyway in skala for example there is
such a thing but they say okay if we
don't care about knows we have this
option type that says if i return an
option of an array of file then it may
be an actual array of file inside an
object or just and nothing or non object
that says there was no away that's good
it has some merits to it and multi had
some problems first of all we have to
wrap into an object and then this array
of file that ? is a super type of an
array of file I can assign to their if I
have an actual read don't have to wrap I
can just assign and that may be
important when you have to the problem
the difference with Haskell is that it's
a nominal taxes I have subclasses and
subtyping so I have to take care of all
those assign ability issues and hash
codes not there so they have this luxury
and also wrapping is very cheap they're
here it's not that cheap all right any
more questions yeah good question yeah
so the question is how do we know that
it's now about here well actually the
default is that anything that comes from
Java is knowable because you never know
but that would be really annoying to oh
I have those question marks all over the
place so we have a smart tool that looks
at your jars and figures out what's now
a lot more thought the tools tools in
the works but it will be there pretty
soon currently so this particular case
here was handled manually so we would
just went over most popular classes in
the JDK and annotate them manually but
now we have a tool it does that for us
okay mark whiten said red if you don't
put a question mark here it just does
bomb because this so this here on the
right-hand side has this type where the
question mark and it's a super type of
this not a subtype so it won't just be
able to assign uh well at compile time
it's a very good kind of a pointer
exception it tells you what's wrong
where and before you run a program yes
yes you can't go say as whatever or you
can just say get away yeah so this says
okay I know better okay throw this null
pointer exception if you want but I know
there will be no no so this throws a
null pointer exception if if something's
wrong and actually it's intentionally
ugly because you know you'd better write
the code that checks properly and not
blows up everywhere and by the way in
this in this exception where throw here
we have a proper message that tells you
what's wrong at least locally all right
now have to restart my presentation
again another question with a different
domain people come and say okay down it
doesn't it know that TD must be inside a
TR I'm like what I'm doing like
programming here what HTML are you
talking about they're like okay we're
generating out HTML and we're messing up
the structure all the time and the
tables go wrong and so on so forth what
can you do about it well let me say well
well we do it like like groovy builders
where you have to you have not seeing
things and I may represent tags like
okay we can see about that I'll see
about that in a second and here it is
your HTML this is how you generate HTML
the column will just say table under
edit TR TD and so on so forth and this
is code so you can do some templating
for I in 1 to 10 it can have your TRS
generated and now the question is why
doesn't it know it does it just doesn't
fly to you put a TD outside the gr the
interesting thing is that it's no
language feature involved I mean it's
not a special language feature we can do
HTML in the language it's all functions
and function calls so this is a declared
function that has some parameters and a
proper declaration like this it's one
lighter actually or say that for its ER
we have a TD but it turns a TD object
and for a table we have a TR that are in
the TR object so on so forth this is
short extract from from the library that
handles this so this is the type safe
way of building basically arbitrary
tree-like structures in a declarative
why with type safety and performance of
a static language don't you like it all
right in how about when the P tag you
mean ok yeah p is there while it's not
declared there but you would say
something like like text here or it will
be P and you would put multi-line
strings in go and have your texture
I mean the feet goes anywhere yeah well
it allows be everywhere it fits or where
it fits because those classes for text
they have the inheritance hierarchy so
you have this body tag that can contain
like content tags and P is a content
tagged so any body tag will contain a p
it's not problem that is an easy part if
the higher part is to go the other way
around okay so what we do now we we
refer the presentation again another
question some people like JavaScript for
its flexibility some people think it's
just too permissive you want something
with more discipline both points have
something to it and if somebody comes to
me and says okay can you run that
language in the browser I'm like Huh
What need to do something about it but
we did and here is the very small
unfortunately in browser ID for God line
that can run colony in the browser and
by compiling it down to JavaScript so
that you take it's a piece of code here
which you can actually edit and you get
some syntax highlighting and everything
there so you get an error messages so on
so forth and you can run it and we'll do
some H some sorry javascript generation
for you and this is html5 canvas being
drawn on by JavaScript generated from
cobbler so this is a very small
application running directly in the
browser and you can play with it change
it right there without installing
anything and you can you what javascript
was here it's not very pretty but pretty
reasonable
question normal situation you generate
your JavaScript and deploy that yeah
like GWT grew them no more patches okay
then just show off maybe one more thing
and we're done yeah by the way just to
show that it's not all the HTML you can
build many things in this dsl ish way
for example this is swing and i think
the most interesting thing i would like
to communicate here is that swing is a
terribly old java library which is not
nice in any way but you can make it this
nice just by throw any extensions in so
it's no like rewriting of the whole
swing it just but those extension
functions that make it nicer and look
like this so here we have the structure
of the components reflected by the
nesting of functions and you can attach
event handlers two buttons right right
next to the button declarations all
right here and all reads like a
structured declaration of the tree
another thing I skipped over was this
one so it was an actual question a
student came up to me before I started
cuddling and as well we keep saying this
in Java like if that is instance of this
class then cast and do something why say
the same class twice I mean it knows
already that is instance of that class
white water and it's a good point
actually so here is an example where I
have my expression abstract class with
two cases a number and it's um and I
want an interpreter that computes the
value of this so what I do in Java is
check then invent a new name then cast
and then return something what you do in
common is you just check and use it
because the compiler knows what's there
you just say if these num used as a no
that's it and there is a shorter version
of this if Al's if contract which is a
generalization of the switch operator so
the same code can be written written
like this when e is a num return the
value if it is a sum add the two
expressions together otherwise throw an
exception questions so this is a
generalized switch expression so you can
do value switching like this for example
if I have my LX I can say when X is 1 do
this is two or three do that is in 10 to
20 do this is not in a hundred to two
hundred do this is output and type here
just to make it not so trivial is a
string do something is not a string do
something else else do something else so
these are the capabilities of this
generalized case operator just to you
know get rid of all those stupid if else
if else if else if it just gets to these
questions all right so then if you are
interested in things about admin to go
ahead and check out our starting page
there are lots of dogs and everything
and you can contribute so it's an open
source project just go
ahead and submit a badge thank you very
much for your attention and go ahead and
ask more questions if you have them I'll
get sure well you can but yeah yeah so
here is a goblin class cool right so you
saw that i'm calling java from cuddling
all the time so that way interpretive is
is it now i'm creating a Java class next
to it calling it test and i put my main
function and say new fool and there it
is so you have the foo here and you can
if you put some on bar here whatever it
does you just say food at bar it's there
if you have your properties there like
fields you get getters and setters so on
so forth yeah so it works in in loop
yeah oh and contravariance of generics
Elizabeth well it's actually declared to
be clear and I'll show you just in a
second yeah here is the engineering
class that that list I'm I was talking
about yeah so we just say on the
declaration side it's covariant in this
primer that's it I can tell you why not
every particular out of language so call
out a name and i'll tell you okay so i
told you in the beginning that the point
was to have a language that gives you
all the good things and is suitable for
an industrial setting so we tried
different other languages for different
things and dynamic ones just don't
work at large scale by definition
because performance problem because of
it's very hard to hard to refactor the
whole huge code base and say groovy or
Ruby or whatever then you have for
example skele but we had a huge problem
with scallop for two things one thing
it's very hard to make an ID for skala
which we are trying to do still and
scallop people are trying to do and
nobody's there yet and it's been four
years on our side and eight years on the
air side and nobody succeeded so far so
it's an innard problem and another more
philosophical thing is that skala code
is full of implicit so it's very hard to
control this readability issue of the
code yes yeah so if you have a project
oh sorry yeah if you have a project
written entirely in Java you just throw
in your column files and you can compile
it all together and it's called Colin
Kent called Java and Java can call
Cortland you mean the at runtime
currently we don't maintain any API like
this there are like experimental
particular applications that just call
the compiler so it's possible but we
don't maintain a public API currently
it's all like 300 k and it will be
smaller
yeah yeah so a few unique things here on
the safety side it's not knowable to
tracking nobody else does that too
that's that's right yeah so for the
object-oriented background it would be
the extension functions and the ability
to alter ap is this is I think it's very
important and for objective-c they are
dynamic and they're there for C sharp
for example yeah so this is unique on
the JVM so I think the good thing to say
here is that we're not trying to invent
like something really you were not
making a scientific contribution here
and so the point is to take the existing
components most preferably the really
reliable was tested by somebody else and
put them together in a way that they
will constitute a good tool yeah so
that's it could be a critical game
please performance gains okay there are
very minor performance gains and no
known performance penalties so gains are
on the part of primitive types so it's
very technical but when we generate if
you subclass a generic class and put an
int for your tea sometimes we can avoid
boxing in that class so it will be a
little faster but in general it's very
hard to be significantly faster than job
on the JVM no yes we're desperately
looking for someone who helped us with
eclipse
I mean really it's been like half a year
i'm working for a person who we can do a
decent eclipse integration because we
have no experience for the clips yeah
right and by the way it's a real
challenge like integrating with IntelliJ
is very easy because it's like a huge
language framework within eclipse if you
want to integrate with the java support
in eclipse it's super hard and well to
be honest it's almost impossible so it's
cala people for example use aspects to
hack on eclipse AP is to actually get an
extended improper way and this is just
terrible but we'll have to do something
like this as soon as we find anybody who
can do the act yeah and if you want to
start that project as an open source
thing i'll be very grateful mar question
okay thank you very much for your</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
