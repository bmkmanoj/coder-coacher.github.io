to add a model to a subversion
repository from data modeler you first
want to create a repository connection
so we're going to open up the version
navigator we're going to select the new
repository connection specify the URL
specify a connection name of data
modeler and then a valid user that has
access to this repository and select
test read access then click OK
your repository connection has been
created so now you want to expand and
create a remote directory off of the
trunk so we're going to go in and
specify a directory name of release 1
this is where the model is going to go
when you check it out
so we're going to create that remote
directory connection and then we're
going to check out a copy or a revision
from that remote directory we're going
to give the directory a unique name in
this case release 1 user 1 and click OK
what this is going to do is going to
create a directory within release 1
where I'm going to do all of my work so
the next thing we need to do there's
nothing in that directory yet we need to
put a model into subversion so we're
going to open up a model and then we're
going to save it into the subversion
repository so we're going to do a file
save as and then select the directory
that we just checked out which is
release 1 user 1 and it's now going to
go ahead and save this model into that
remote directory in the repository here
it's asking us whether or not we want to
add it to version control so we want to
click yes and then we also need to
specify the directory where the system
type files are going to go so we select
the same directory and it's now going to
be copying the model into the release
one user one directory in our repository
you have just learned how to add a model
to a subversion repository</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
