ability to return results from the
stream of event shapes when identified
properties have changed within a
specified time period for example when
monitoring a temperature value and the
movement sensor value in the event
stream and both change within a
specified time this could perhaps
indicate a person has entered a room and
increased the average temperature then
this pattern will publish The Associated
event shape in the live output stream
first we give the pattern a name
followed by a description
followed by tags which can be used to
search in the catalog and press the
create button the change detector
pattern requires the following
parameters event stream is a previously
created event data stream of shapes in
which one or more property values should
be identified and monitored for change
criteria is an event shaped property
generally and a unique identify in the
stream such as the inventory level or a
movement sensor value window range is a
streaming time period which had elapsed
during which any changes in the defining
event shape properties is identified the
range is between nanoseconds to hours
change criteria is one more event shape
properties column names which have to
change within the time window range
before they are recognized in the live
output stream these values are aligned
with the alert on group change option to
indicate that all of the identified
change criteria event shape properties
must have changed for the results to be
reflected in the live output stream
once the change detector pattern
parameters have been specified the
pattern exploration immediately and
continuously executes identifying and
publishing to the live output stream but
only when the values have changed for
each event shape specified in their
partition criteria within the define
window range
