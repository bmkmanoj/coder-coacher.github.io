Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series metric extensions are way to
expand monitoring of your targets to
monitor all specific conditions in your
environment they are the next generation
of user-defined metrics these
demonstration is the first part of a
series of two this part shows you how to
define a metric extension and the second
part will show you how to deploy to your
targets in this first part of the demo
we would like to create a new metric
that monitors the CPU utilization of the
agent process running on the host to
locate the metric extensions
functionalities go to the enterprise
menu then monitoring and then select
metric extensions this is the metric
extensions library that shows you all
the metric extensions that have been
created so far right now there are none
so let's create one click create these
Wizards works you through the creation
process of a metric extension however
the first step is to plan for the metric
you want to build and especially create
a script you may want to use for your
metric extension the wizard starts with
the general properties page where you
need to specify the target type on which
you want to deploy your metric extension
if you look at the the target type
drop-down list you'll notice that we
support all Enterprise Manager target
types for this demo let's just keep post
now specify the internal name of your
metric extension here we call it agent
CPU idea is that we want to create a
metric extension to Manito the CPU usage
of the agents process on your host next
you define the display name that will
appear in the UI choose a more
meaningful name here the adapter
determines how you are going to query
your data
here we will use an operating system
script and the description is optional
the collection schedule tells enterprise
manager how often to collect the metric
data and we will leave it to the 15
minutes default value here so let's
click Next
based on your adapter that you chose the
adapter page will ask you for additional
pieces of information here we need to
specify an operating system command that
the agent will run we invoke the Perl
interpreter to execute our pre created
script now you need to select your
script first give it a name and then
click on app load and use browse to
locate your script once done click OK
what this script does is basically to
return to metric values the first one is
the process ID of the agent and the
second one is the CPU utilization of
that particular agent notice the values
are delimited by a vertical bar and it's
prefixed by the name eeehm and the score
results equals click OK you can skip
arguments as we do not have any for the
script then as we've just seen the
delimiter is the vertical bar to
determine what character separates the
different values you want to return the
start with field is used to determine
well your output values are in your
script and we've used a.m. and the score
result equal you can now click Next
these page allows you to specify the to
metric columns that corresponds to the
output values of our script we need to
give them a display name if you will so
click on add to add the first one which
is the process ID of the agent again
specify an internal name and a display
name
here we consider this column as a key
column which means it uniquely identify
the set of values that follow it is of
type number now click OK
let's add the second column it is the
CPU utilization again give it an
internal name and a display name this
column is a data column and this is the
default it's also a number and we can
add it compared to threshold values to
generate alerts if we want so let's use
the greater than equal operator and set
ten for the warning level and 25 for
critical you can see we could use more
advanced features but we will keep it
basic for this demo click OK we are now
done with columns so click Next you now
need to specify the credentials that the
agent will use to execute your script by
default it will use the monitoring
credentials of that particular target
but you could also specify your own here
we'll keep the default click Next this
is an opportunity to test your script
and what you specify it until now so
click on add select your target then
click on run test you can see it
deploying your script and executing it
all seems to be working fine and you can
see the output from this execution click
Next here you can review one last time
your specifications if satisfied then
click finish
so we created our metric extension and
as you can see it is in editable status
which means you can still make changes
to it now if you think it is ready to be
tested the next thing you need to do is
to put your metric extension in
deployable draft notice the name of the
metric extension is always prefixed by
Enterprise Manager with ma dollar
however this is never exposed to user so
select the metric and click actions then
select save as deployable draft when a
metric extension is in deployables raft
you can stop testing it and deploying it
to targets and check it returns the
right values and alerts if you specify
threshold values in the next metric
extension demonstration we will show you
how to deploy it to a target this is the
end of this demonstration thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
