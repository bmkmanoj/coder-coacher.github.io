MySQL cloud service instance using SSH
the command line MySQL client and MySQL
workbench when you drill into the
service details you can see the public
IP address of the instance we'll use
this IP address to connect first through
SSH when I created this instance I used
the wizard to create a public/private
key pair ssh requires that these files
can only be accessed by their owner
so after setting the required
permissions I can specify my private key
file with the - I option and connect
with the OPC user to the public IP
address of the instance the first time
you connect to a new server SSH prompts
you to accept and store its fingerprint
the instance displays a status message I
can now perform operations at the
instance level to use my SQL commands I
must switch to the Oracle user which I
can do with the sudo command
I can now connect to MySQL using the
command-line client installed with the
instance specifying the root password
that I set in the wizard the status
command shows that I am connected with
the root credentials from the localhost
that is the same host as the server when
I show the databases I can see the
schema that I specified in the wizard
when I try to use my own local
workstation to connect to the instance
public IP as the same root user again
I'm prompted from my root password but
the connection does not succeed
after some time the connection fails
because the MySQL command line client
cannot contact the server at the
provided IP address by default only
local clients can connect to MySQL cloud
service instances you must configure the
access rules when you want to connect to
MySQL from somewhere else
the default access rules permit public
connection to SSH and local connections
to MySQL as well as to disabled rules
that allow public access to MySQL and
MySQL Enterprise Monitor and a system
rule when I create a new rule I provide
a unique rule name a longer description
and a source network when I select a
custom source network I can then add my
own local IP address the destination is
the MySQL master alias to the cloud
service instance and I used the standard
MySQL TCP port 3306 after a moment or
two the new rule has been created and I
can see it when i refresh the access
rules screen back in my command prompt I
can execute the same statement that I
used before when I enter my password
this time it connects immediately with
no timeouts or errors the status command
shows that this time I'm connected by
tcp/ip from my own IP address
now that I've configured an access rule
to permit connection for my local
workstation I can connect to the same IP
using other clients such as MySQL
workbench
I can create a new connection naming it
appropriately and replace the default
local IP address with the public IP of
the instance I have the option to store
the password in a local keychain when I
test the connection it connects
successfully and I create the
connections so that it appears in the
home screen workbench also enables
tcp/ip connections over SSH which gives
you the benefit of end-to-end security
as well as being able to connect without
creating any additional access rules for
the MySQL port I enter the IP address
and SSH port of the cloud service host
as before the SSH user is OPC the SSH
key file is the same identity or private
key file that I used earlier this
enables a secure connection that does
not require a password every time I
connect the other settings identify the
MySQL server and credentials relative to
the SSH host in this case at the local
machine
after storing the password in the
keychain I can test the connection and
again it succeeds
when I click okay I can see the newly
created connection in the home screen
from here I can click my new connection
and it connects successfully once I'm
connected I can use standard workbench
features I'm presented with a query
window I can see the newly created
schema and browse into its tables and
views and other structures I can launch
the performance dashboard which shows me
the network status along with other
performance metrics
you can of course connect your own
applications to MySQL cloud service use
SSH for administration tunnel over SSH
for applications that require it or
create access rules to permit direct
connections to MySQL
