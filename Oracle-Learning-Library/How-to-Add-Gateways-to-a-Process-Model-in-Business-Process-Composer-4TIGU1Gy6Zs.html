curriculum developer at Oracle I'm going
to show you how to add two types of
gateways to a process model in Business
Process composer gateways help you
define the flow of a process by
branching and merging paths this is the
third demo in a series of demos on
modeling a business process using
business process composer let's assume
you are modeling a simple sales quote
process and your process model looks
like this you have to find a number of
roles and you have placed the user tasks
in swim lanes corresponding to these
roles as currently modeled all process
instances flow automatically from enter
quote details to business practices
review and from there to approve deal
let's assume not all quotes require
business practices review you could add
a gateway before that task that tests
whether a given quote requires that
review if it does the process instance
flows to the business practices review
task if it does not the process instance
flows directly to the approved deal task
by passing business practices review let
me show you how to add that gateway to
your process model when you're in edit
mode you can double-click the gateway
icon to display the different kinds of
gateways you can add in this case you
want the process to go down just one
path so you want to add an exclusive
gateway click and drag the exclusive
gateway to the left of business
practices review and release the cursor
the exclusive gateway appears click the
label to type a more meaningful name
so now you have added a gateway but it's
not connected to anything you need to
rear out the transitions so process
instances go from enter quote details to
the Gateway and from there either to
business practices review or to approve
deal simply select the transition coming
out of enter quote details and move its
endpoint to your new gateway next define
a conditional transition from your
gateway to the business practices review
task mouse over the Gateway click the
transition icon and drag it to business
practices review let's label this
transition and make sure it is
conditional mouse over the transition
click the properties icon type yes in
the name field and change the transition
type to conditional then click anywhere
outside the properties window follow a
similar process to define a default
transition from the Gateway to approve
deal watch as I do that
you have now added an exclusive Gateway
to your process model if process
instances meet the conditions in the yes
transition which must still be defined
they are routed to business practices
review otherwise they proceeded directly
to approve deal now let's turn our focus
to the approved deal and approve terms
tasks as currently modeled all approved
quotes require both types of approval
and these approvals are performed
sequentially could these be performed
simultaneously to save time let's assume
the answer is yes in that case you could
add a parallel gateway which routes all
process instances to both approval tasks
at once since you'll need to change most
of the transitions leading to and from
these two approval tasks you can start
by deleting all of them to clear the
canvas
then align the two tasks vertically now
click and drag a parallel gateway from
the component palette to the canvas
positioning it to the left of the two
approval tasks the first object will be
used to split the process flow and the
second object will be used to merge the
flow give these objects more meaningful
names and move the merge object to the
right of the approval tasks now add the
necessary transitions
when you're done your process model will
look something like this whether or not
a quote requires business practices
review it is routed to the approvals
parallel gateway and from there to both
approval tasks simultaneously that's all
we have time for but check out the other
two demos in this series if you haven't
already seen them I'm Rosie pillar
