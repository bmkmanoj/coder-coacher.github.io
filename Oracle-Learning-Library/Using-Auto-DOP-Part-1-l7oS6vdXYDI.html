the intent is to show you how to enable
auto dop for use with parallel execution
in this first part of a set of two
demonstrations you'll see how the Oracle
optimizer chooses the best execution
plan based on two of the primary
parameters that influence Auto DLP to
begin let's look at two parameters that
have an impact on how Auto DLP behaves
the parallel degree policy parameter
controls how Auto DLP functions the
default setting of manual means that
auto DLP is disabled right now the
parallel min time threshold parameter
determines the minimum elapsed time for
which parallel execution is going to be
considered by the optimizer the default
setting of auto is equivalent to about
10 seconds now we'll go ahead and turn
on auto DLP and then next we'll connect
as the SH user and generate an execution
plan for a single table scan during a
select but first let's just check to see
if there's a dop setting for sales and
there is not the degree parameter set to
default so let's let's set a DLP of four
on sales and then just make sure that
that's taken and there we go so now the
degree value for sales is four so let's
go ahead and generate the execution plan
and let's take a look at the results now
as we can see the optimizer has selected
serial execution notice a dop of 1 is
shown in the note at the bottom of the
plan table output with auto dop enabled
the optimizer is going to choose the
execution plan with the lowest cost
regardless of any dop settings for
specific tables and in this case the
cost
the elapsed time of serial execution
which we can see is about six seconds
this is lower than the cost of parallel
execution given the the value for the
parallel min time threshold parameter
right we set it to auto and that's
effectively ten seconds so now we're
going to go ahead and reduce the minimum
time threshold parameter and then we're
going to run the same single stable scan
again to see whether parallel execution
is chosen so we can see that auto DLP is
on the time threshold is set to auto so
let's change that now to one second
let's go ahead and log into the SH
schema and now we'll go ahead and
generate a new execution plan and we'll
take a quick look so now this time we
see parallel execution has been selected
the optimizer determined that the
elapsed time for parallel is now less
than the serial execution notice the
parallel execution should take place in
four seconds in addition the optimizer
has determined that a dop of two had the
least cost even though we set a dop of
four on the sales table itself now let's
say into this demonstration please move
on to the next demonstration to continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
