design tool the managed file transfer
product has three sections design
monitoring and administration in our
related demo working with managed file
transfer so ax 12c we showed you how to
monitor a file transfer this demo will
show you how to design and setup a
managed file transfer to get started
click the design tab in the left
navigation click transfers enter name
and then click create a palette appears
now that the transfer is created we can
set parameters for this transfer let's
start by creating a new source coming
from the embedded FTP server
first we'll name the source
the drop-down lets us choose the types
that are available and there are various
web-based protocols b2b protocols and
even remote sources available for this
demo we will select FTP embedded enter
the path or choose the Browse button to
select the path so now we have just
completed an inbound source next we will
define what types of files we will be
receiving here is a choice of files
let's enter star zip with this option we
can put files in the folder on the FTP
server and the transfer will pick up
files of type star zip that reside in
that folder and there are other options
for creating other transfers from
different file types now we need to
create a target or we can reuse existing
targets we want something related to
sowa
so let's filter here using search to
find what we want which is a so a target
click and drag into the target pane or
click add target and select it from the
list it now shows up in transfers this
is going to a so a composite and BPL
process here we can specify delivery
preferences for each transfer we can
always send a reference to the file if
the file data is too large the advantage
to sending a reference instead of
attaching a large payload is to avoid
storing all of the people process data
in the database instead just specify
sending a reference if the maximum size
is greater than one megabyte if it's
less than one megabyte go ahead and send
the entire file we will choose file for
the reference type now we can add a
scheduled Oracle incorporated the
Enterprise scheduler that ships with 12c
into the managed file transfer product
so you don't need to install a separate
scheduler we can choose to only invoke
so a target in afternoons or early
evenings we can specify frequency so
daily and set a time to begin such as
start at noon these transfers sit in the
MFT repository in an active scheduled
process we can also specify an end date
and duration this is an enhancement to
scheduler that we added for MFT we can
remove dates such as holidays and we can
add them back so there are lots of
options we need to set the
pre-processing actions so the files
transferred are encrypted we need to set
the process to decompress the file and
then select the decrypt option and add
it to the list now select a decryption
alias that's configured in the backend
system click OK and the options appear
next we can go back and add another
target type go into the filter string
and look for file the use case for
choosing another target type is for
archiving by putting it in a file system
outside of the MFT repository we can
drag and drop it to target or create a
new target we can reuse existing file
targets by just creating a new
subdirectory for the file target this
will overwrite the old location with the
new location now we will add a
post-processing action click Add and
select post transfer notification look
at the parameters it gives an email
notification and can apply to all file
types we can choose to filter the file
size this notification lets us know when
larger files have been submitted we can
configure the email message with an
email template for instance the email
can have the header information and
email body and more information once
everything is setup in the parameter
section click deploy in the top right
corner the deployment mechanism knows
what artifacts are new and it tells us
what will not be redeployed click deploy
and we get a message saying it was
successful
the last thing is to look for the bulk
order transfer and we can use search to
find it so here is the transfer select
it and click show deployment details the
information shows the last deployed
current status the referring targets the
sources and more information this is
good information from the runtime so for
the most part in MFT we have separated
design from monitoring but this is a
case where design has visibility into
the runtime system so that's how you
work with the MFT design tool see our
other MFT demos for more information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
