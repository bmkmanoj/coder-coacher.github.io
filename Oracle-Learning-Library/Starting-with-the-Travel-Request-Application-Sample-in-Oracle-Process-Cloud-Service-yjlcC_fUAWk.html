application sample to point out for
advanced features used to create this
application business types define the
structure of the data stored as part of
your process and they are used to define
the business and data objects accessed
from web forms decisions and other
process activities
enumerated types and exceptions are
additional business types available
in this application some business
objects and their attributes were
defined to be used in the process
activities there are also business
objects created while building the
webform notice that by convention
attribute names start with a lowercase
letter the process editor is not only
for creating the process but also
manages the process data use data
objects to view and edit existing data
objects or to create new ones data
Association shows the data objects
associated to the selected process
activity the available data objects can
be dragged to the input and output
fields the inputs are data required by
the activity outputs are data produced
by the activity this application uses a
decision to evaluate the travel requests
and determine if it requires management
approval the condition evaluates the
travel requests total amount purpose and
the number of days until travel based on
these conditions it will activate the
appropriate rule within the decision and
carry out the corresponding action value
sets are used in the decisions to
specify discrete values or ranges they
can also be used in association with
conditions to decide which rule to
activate value sets are named so they
can be reused and all the values are of
a particular datatype
alias has helped to make the values more
readable when using them in business
rules this Trauma request process
includes calls to to other processes
defined in the application the first
uses a send and receive model to check
costs and compliance the second uses a
simple synchronous call to the fulfill
request process thank you for watching
