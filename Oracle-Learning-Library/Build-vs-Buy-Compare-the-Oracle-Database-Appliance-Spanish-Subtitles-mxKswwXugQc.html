high-availability always on database
environment up and running in less than
four weeks I was like yeah right so I
told the CIO let's make this interesting
she does it her way I do it my way and
we see who's up and running first so now
the race starts in three minutes and 47
seconds I've already got all my
components lined up right where I want
him maybe this just isn't fair Heather's
never even touched in Oracle Database
appliance until today tuning Alone's
gonna set her way back which is why I
made sure outside contractors are
against the rules so where's the rest of
the stuff this is it what about the
hardware to put the server together it's
all here you just plug it into the
network and it's ready to go I guess you
don't need an OS oh that comes
pre-installed yeah I knew that what
about firmware H a software that's why
they call it one button deployment but
still you're gonna need a couple of
weeks before you're ready to migrate
application data right nope that's what
Oracle appliance manager software is for
everything is integrated
how long do diploma take from OS to
database about an hour now I'm loading
application data so we can start testing
tomorrow
what's this this is how I monitor
transactions oh I'm kind of worried
about Ted though he seemed pretty
stressed yeah yeah I told you
everything's connected at least I think
so my problem is my servers aren't
talking to each other
yeah I tried that listen I bought some
time but I still need you to come in you
can't tell anyone all right somehow a
disk up pulled and the network cable
came unplugged and the power cable
failed despite all that the Oracle
Database appliance just kept going as if
nothing happened it shows I pulled the
disk just keeps chugging along no biggie
thanks to Triple mirroring and plenty of
hot swappable redundant hardware it
really didn't even slow us down must
have been the cleaning crew Doug oh come
on in guys so it's been five days how
are things coming along actually I'm
done yep we're done we wait a second Ted
I thought you wanted to keep doing it
the old way wasn't that the whole point
of this exactly we wanted to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt that the
Oracle Database appliance is the way to
go uh-huh we put this baby through the
wringer power outages pull disks network
interruption this thing is an
unstoppable force yes an unstoppable
force
Oracle Database appliance a highly
available and optimized platform for
Oracle database the world's most popular
database it's a complete package that is
simple reliable and affordable and it's
based on Intel Xeon processors to ensure
a high level of performance and
scalability
