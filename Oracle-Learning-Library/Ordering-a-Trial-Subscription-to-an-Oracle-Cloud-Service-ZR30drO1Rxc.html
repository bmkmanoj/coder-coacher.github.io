curriculum developer at Oracle in this
first of a two-part demo I will show you
how to request and activate a trial
subscription to an Oracle cloud service
part two will show you how to administer
the service including the management of
users and roles before we proceed let's
pause for a moment and view a diagram of
the cloud service ordering workflow so
that you can get an idea of the
different roles and steps for requesting
activating and administering an Oracle
cloud service trial subscription the
first step is to order a free trial
subscription to an Oracle cloud service
by clicking a try it button in the cloud
Oracle comm website as a trial requester
you are automatically assigned the role
of the account administrator for the
service next as the account
administrator you receive an automated
notification email to activate the
service in a free trial subscription you
as the requester are also assigned the
roles of service administrator and
identity domain administrator a key task
of the identity domain administrator is
to define the users and the user roles
that will give users their access
privileges this is performed in a
security page of the my services
application the identity domain
administrator creates users and roles
for all of the purchased or trial cloud
services the job of the service
administrator is to develop and
administer a particular cloud service
using the my services application one
important task is to assign roles to
each user of the cloud service another
task is to provide all the cloud service
users the URL to access the service here
is a list of the six steps I just
discussed this first video of the Oracle
cloud service trial subscription process
will focus on the first three steps
ordering Oracle cloud services and
activating the services the second video
will cover administration of the service
including the management of users and
roles

your new password twice based on the
password policy in addition choose three
challenge questions and provide answers
for each one to help if you forget your
password there's a drop-down menu with
four questions from which you can choose
I type in my answer to each question
then click Submit my password and
challenge questions were set
successfully and I am signed in to the
my services application as the account

two database trials that I ordered

managing my database service I am now
ready to open the cloud database service
