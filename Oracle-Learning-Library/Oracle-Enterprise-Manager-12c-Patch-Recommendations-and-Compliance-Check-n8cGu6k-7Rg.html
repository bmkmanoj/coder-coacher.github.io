search for patches recommended by Oracle
for Oracle products how an administrator
can get alerted and notified about
recommended patches for the environments
they manage trend analysis and score
cards showing overall compliance of a
data center site let's log on to in 12c
this is the enterprise summary page to
search for recommended patches pick
provisioning and patching patch and
updates menu the recommended patch
advisor clicking on this we can see a
search box where you can search for
products by releases and platforms to
see the recommended patches also we can
search for products in the context of
another product for example let us
search for let's say Fusion Applications
release eleven one five and let me pick
for identity manager all the patches
that are recommended here I see is a
list of patches that have been
recommended to apply for on our Oracle
Identity Management instance when used
in the context of an Oracle Fusion
application you can see the patch
details when it was last updated the
size of the patch let us do another
search this time let us search for
Oracle database patches and let us pick
the latest really is eleven two or three
and search these searches can also be
saved here I see large number of patches
that have been recommended for different
platforms
and the sizes of these patches clicking
on a patch I can see further details
about that patch what are the bugs fixed
the readme and also from here you can
add this patch to your patch plan and
having designed a patch plan you can
apply that to all the databases that you
manage
let us navigate back to the patches and
updates and check out the patch
recommendation section this section
shows recommended patches as 25 security
and 87 other recommended patches also we
can see them by target type I see that
we have two recommended patches for
Oracle Identity Management for four OMS
78 for the agent and I have 23 patches
for so and for a DB clicking on Oracle
Identity Manager I see that there is a
patch the same patch has been
recommended for two Oracle Identity
Management sites that are managed now
wouldn't it be ideal if we can get
alerted and notified when these
recommended patches are missing on any
environment that we manage am complaint
standards check can help us get that
let's view some compliance results on
this e/m site there are two compliance
standards checks that have been enabled
against each of them we see target
evaluation results violations with an
average compliance score for the
standard this helps prioritize with
standard violations we address first PM
reports missing recommended patches as a
critical violation patch Delta compliant
standard has an average score compliance
of 63% let's drill down to see trend
overview tab shows
at a glance average complaints core
number of targets for compliance targets
evaluated graphically
Samri tab shows target scorecard and
rule evaluations to environment CPF cqf
we see three critical violations for CPF
which explains that 26% score further
drill down shows the reason for these
violation
voila we have these three patches that
are missing on this target CPF now that
is actionable once we apply these
patches this environment will become
compliant also administrators can set up
notification rules to get notified of
these compliance violations via emails
or tickets in their ticketing system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
