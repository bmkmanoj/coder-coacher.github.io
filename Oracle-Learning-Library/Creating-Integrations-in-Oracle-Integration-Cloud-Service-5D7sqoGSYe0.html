source connection and a target
connection and then map Business Objects
and services between them
I'll show you how to create an
integration that connects Oracle
RightNow to oracle salescloud
for this integration I'll choose to map
the data myself
first I need to enter some identifying
information about the integration like
the name a unique ID a version number
and a description I won't add this
integration to a package see the online
help or the video using packages and
integration cloud service for
information about packages
in order to create an integration I need
to have connections to the application
in instances I'm integrating I've
already created right now in sales cloud
connections
I'll configure the right now connection
as the source
I'll enter some identifying information
about the connection
now I can configure how to process the
request since I want to receive
organization objects in the request I'll
select organization from the list
because this is a one-way flow and there
is no response I'll select none
now I'll finish up in the wizard
you can see that the designer now shows
information based on how I configured
the source also note that the progress
meter is at 39%
now I'll repeat these steps to configure
oracle salescloud as my target
you
this time I'll select the account
service service because I'm creating
accounts in oracle salescloud
i'll also be sure that the create
account operation is selected
now that I'm done creating the source
and the target I'm ready to use the
mapper to map the data between the two
connections for more information about
mapping go to the online help for the
mapper or view the video mapping data in
Oracle integration cloud service at
