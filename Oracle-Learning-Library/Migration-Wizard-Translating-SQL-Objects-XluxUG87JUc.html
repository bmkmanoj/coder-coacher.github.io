we're ready to move on to the Translate
step and it translates that this is
where all your super objects will be
translated into Oracle since this is the
first time you're running through the
migration wizard the default is to
translate all your constraints functions
procedures figures and views now if you
want to see a full list of all the
sequel objects that are available for
you to select from you can exit out of
this wizard when you choose the option
to proceed to the summary page it will
go ahead and exit out of the wizard and
it will do the capture of your source
database and then convert the source
database into Oracle so sequel developer
right now is creating your capture model
and then it will create your converted
model once that completes you can go to
the
decoration navigator expand Sybase cuts
do and this is where you can see the
captured database objects so these are
the objects from your source database
the converted database objects or all
the objects now converted into Oracle if
you take a look
right hand side these are where all
these reports are available for you to
analyze your migration there's an object
report to review all the objects that
have been converted here the columns any
issues that you may have encountered
during the capture and the conversion so
now when you're ready to do the
translation to select on the converted
database objects right click and select
translate this will take you back into
the wizard when you click on next it
will go ahead and skip all the steps
until it gets to the translate step and
notice that it our we'll have a full
list of all mystical objects that are
available to you you can now select the
objects that you want translated so
let's just say I'll go ahead and select
just my procedures that I want
translated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
