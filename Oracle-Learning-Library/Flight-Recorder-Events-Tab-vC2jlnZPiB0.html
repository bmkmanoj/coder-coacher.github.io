gonna look at the events tab for Java
flight recorder so let me go ahead and
click on that and voila finally we have
some data in our events type tab so we
have all the various kinds of events
that were recorded during our recording
and then over here in our tab group of
course we have a number of tabs showing
us detailed information about all those
different types of events we see at the
top whether the events were related to
the runtime or to the hotspot JVM and we
get counts for both of those and times
for both of those and then here we have
the event types and a nice pie chart of
those here can scroll down a little bit
we can see the various overall kinds of
events that took place and let's look at
each one of these tabs a little further
so if I cook to the log that's a
detailed log of all the events that took
place during the recording so we've got
lots of stuff in there and let's say I
wanted to search by a event type I
wanted to say what's something in there
that might be lets say thread sleep
would be a good one if I type thread
Slayer see yes
let's sleep let's see if that finds it
now I think it's gonna have to be
there we go and then I have now filtered
that to only event types that were a
thread sleep so you can see that like so
so that's a good way to filter through
this stuff and of course I can click on
this and then I've got a nice little
action event attributes table down below
here and it's showing me all the
detailed information about that event
when it occurred how long it was when it
ended stuff like that so the next graph
or tab here is the graph tab and this is
a graph of the events grouped by various
categories so like if we look at the
main group of events then I can see here
this is broken up in my application I
can see all the various events that
occurred from the main method so we know
event queue from looking at our other
tabs we know that that was one of the
main run threads or classes that was
used throughout this application so you
can see here I have a lot of stuff going
on if I mouse over this I can see what
the various events are that took place
during my recording and I can do look at
the same thing here so I can look at um
I can scroll over that for the Java
request time memory monitor so we got a
lot of threat sleep stuff going on here
RMI I can see what I did there I was
doing some waiting let's see what that
oh that's our socket read right there
and you have some options up here where
you can filter this a little bit show
garbage collection stuff like that so we
can add that in there like so so anyway
just a lot of detailed information you
can find out about your application
while it was running
if I click on threads I can see how
events were occurring in various parts
of the application so we can see the
event queue once again had the most
events and then the various parts you
know RMI the screen updater and various
things here that had the most recorded
events during the recording the stack
traces tab once again is just showing
stack traces I can see once again an
account once again I can sort this by
time or percentage or count and then
once again I can expand the subtree to
see exactly what was getting called by
that particular method or yeah method in
this case all right
and then finally histogram here we can
look at events in various ways the
default here is allocation size I think
I'd rather look at it by um class it's a
little more familiar with those and then
I'm gonna sort that by count and I can
see here that my char class was getting
or was getting the most had the most
events related to that once again
clicking on it I can get stack traces
and see which methods were using char or
object or let's see if I can find one
application object here surface data
there's one or rectangle there's a
simpler one ought rectangle right there
and I can see what was using that in the
application so that's basically it for
the own before I before I leave this I
almost forgot so you can drill down into
exactly what you want to see with this
so I'm back on the overview tab here so
notice I can actually you know now that
we have the events type tab populated
with the various events I can then
filter
based on what I'm interested in so if I
wanted to say the socket reads and then
the thread sleeps I can then pick what's
going to show up in these tabs and so
then my tabs would only be limited to
that data
I select over here or I can go up to the
top and select everything so that I in
fact have more data in here than what we
originally started with so very powerful
there's a lot of neat and interesting
stuff you can do with this but that's it
for the java flight recorder events tab
group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
