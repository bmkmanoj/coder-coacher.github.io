I'll give you the top five best
practices for middleware configuration
management using Enterprise Manager
cloud control 12c viewer targets
configuration history from the home page
to see what changes were made in the
past week here on a WebLogic domain home
page we can see for configuration
changes were made we can drill down and
view the history records and here we can
see what was actually changed view this
configuration history if you notice a
change in a targets performance often a
sudden performance degradation can be
attributed to a recent configuration
change so viewing configuration history
can give you valuable information to
help resolve problems quickly comparing
configurations of two targets lets you
quickly and easily pinpoint the
differences between them which helps to
keep systems synchronized and reduce
configuration drift in addition it
simplifies investigations into why
systems that are presumed to be
identical are behaving differently a
common use case for this is when you're
comparing a WebLogic server in a staging
environment with another server in the
production environment there's a
performance problem with the production
environment but not the staging and
originally the two are identical upon
comparison you discover that
configuration changes were made that
introduced the poor performance in the
production environment so comparing
configurations can help you resolve
performance problems
create gold standard point in time
configuration snapshots for later
analysis in comparison
for example save the configuration of a
WebLogic server you know is configured
correctly for your production
environment then at any time you can
compare the current configurations of
the any of your production web logic
servers with the saved gold standard
configuration to determine if any
configuration drift has occurred this
ensures that your web logic servers are
all configured consistently with this
known reference also during critical
outages you can compare current
configuration settings of the target to
the gold standard and quickly identify
changes that could be the root cause
customized comparison templates to
specify which property differences to
ignore when you do a comparison and
which differences should trigger an
alert Cloud Control provides many types
of comparison templates for example here
I'm customizing the defaults our
infrastructure template it's already
setup to ignore differences between URLs
in the different environments as these
are expected to be different across
lower targets but I'm interested in
tracking any changes an audit level from
the standard so we'll check that to be
notified on any differences so review
the out-of-the-box comparison templates
and customize them to meet your specific
requirements schedule jobs to perform
the comparisons with your gold standard
configuration on a regular basis for
example at the end of each week or the
first of the month and when you do this
into your email address to be notified
of changes are found by scheduling the
comparison job regularly and entering
your email address you can automatically
be notified on a regular basis if any
configuration drift occurs in your life
configuration from your gold standard
following these best
practices will enable you to easily
track and control configuration changes
in your middleware environments thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
