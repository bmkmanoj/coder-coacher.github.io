senior software engineer with the LTFS
le design team and i am here today to
talk to you about LTFS and more
specifically about LTFS library edition
so the agenda for what I'm going to go
through today is just to give you an
introduction to self-describing formats
the benefits of LTFS software and
Oracle's LTFS software and in some LTFS
use cases so LTFS is a self-describing
storage format and that provides
customers the opportunity to have a
lower TCO simplify their file management
and improve their file access what is a
self-describing format well it's a
specification for writing a file and
it's descriptive metadata to the same
storage medium meaning a tape now there
are two relatively common types of
self-describing tape formats tar and
LTFS LTFS is supported by the storage
tech Linear Tape file system which is
what LTFS stands for it was introduced
in 2010 the standardization is currently
in progress whoracle is the co-chair of
the sneah committee working on that
standardization and it has clustered
metadata and i'll show you what that
means in just a second tar on the other
hand has been around for about 30 years
you know it as part of our Sam qfs
software it does have a standard and is
dispersed metadata what we're
recommending at this point for customers
is if they have a tape drives or less
they should look at an LTFS based
solution from oracle if they have more
than a tape drives then perhaps Sam qfs
is the right solution for them either
way Oracle has been developing software
that supports self-describing formats
for more than two decades so how does
LTFS make a tape self-describing
basically what it does is it partitions
a tape cartridge into two partitions the
metadata partition and the file
partition so all of a files metadata is
in the first partition at the beginning
of the tape
metadata partition as shown in this
diagram and then all the files follow in
the file partition so what that means is
if you have a movie about buttes and
canyons and deserts the index for that
will be at the very beginning followed
by the file in the file partition and
then if you add a movie later on about
penguins B or any other file for that
matter the index will follow for that
file will follow index one and then the
file file to the penguin movie will
follow file one on the tape now that's a
little bit different than how at our
formatted tape works where there isn't a
strict partition at the tape it just is
written sequentially where you see index
file index file index file there's
nothing wrong with that per se because
it is again a self-describing format
that the one downside of it is is that
it's difficult to access what is on the
tape quickly with an LTFS formatted tape
you can read the metadata partition and
immediately know your entire file
contents on that tape whereas if you had
at our format a tape you would have to
read the entire tape before you really
knew what was on there so again as I
said LTFS large lowers your storage TCL
how it does that is by eliminating the
backup or archive application from a
user's environment a backup archive
applications are really not required to
access files if you use a
self-describing format the way an LTFS
cartridge or l looks like is the drive
simply looks like another shared drive
or thumb drive in your computer just be
like if you put a memory stick into your
laptop it's the same thing as what a
drive would look like and you could
access it from there and LTFS Library
Edition expands that so instead of just
one drive looking like a memory stick
you see a whole library of tape
cartridges are opened up to you simply
without the need for a backup or archive
application
you can also lower your data and
transfer costs and dr costs LTFS is a
really big motivator for customers who
require data transport ability you can
see from this graphic you know obviously
storage has different costs to it but
there's also a different level of
difficulty in transporting large amounts
of data over fiber or flash or disk if
there's one thing that the Postal
Service has its bandwidth and so it's
very easy to drop a tape cartridge in
the mail and be able to send five
terabytes of data or eight terabytes of
data overnight whereas you can't really
do that effectively via fiber and flash
and disk storage doesn't really make for
a good transportable media because of
the reliability issues with disk and the
cost issues associated with flash in
fact IDC has identified tape is really
being the most suitable format for
physical transportation of large amounts
of data so Oracle has two different LTFS
offerings there's Oracle storage
technology FS open edition and then
Library Edition open edition is the
single drive version of LTFS it's
available simply as open source software
you can download it for free we support
the T 10,000 and the lto platforms
whereas the library edition is available
on the edelivery cloud again it also
supports the T 10,000 and LTO tape
drives but as the name implies it allows
you to see an entire library as a
essentially a big bucket of thumb drives
or memory sticks so it's much easier to
ax access large amounts of data without
the need for a backup application or
other sort of specialized software
so we've talked already about how LTFS
can lower your storage TCO it can also
simplify your file management if a dry
drive or cartridges look like a big
bucket of thumb drives you can just drag
and drop files from the libe the tape
library onto your desktop and and it
works with simple sift sand POSIX
interface you can also improve file
access again there's no need for
proprietary applications you can
transport large amounts of data and
still access files in the future because
it's all self-describing so how this
works working from from right to left if
we have our cartridges all in an SL 3000
library with drives whether it be lto or
t 10,000 we manage with library edition
we manage which files are we're on our
with our LTFS le application which sits
on a on a server and via the POSIX sifts
interface you can see which cartridges
which files are where all the cartridges
in the library essentially appear as a
folder in this giant shared drive and
the user can access folders or
cartridges as they please you can
organize cartridges into higher-level
folders if you want you can you can do
all sorts of things with your corporate
security infrastructure to make this a
very simple solution for customers to
access large amounts of data so as I
said we do support the T 10,000 and LTO
tape drive lines an initial release
we're supporting the SL 3000 as one
would expect as as we expand our library
edition offerings we will also be
expanding our hardware compatibility for
both tape drives and tape libraries you
can download the software for free for 4
30 days you do need oracle linux and
from there you just also need a
browser-based user interface we can also
see there the client operating systems
that are supported linux and windows
basically as i said before five lisa
sips and posix and here there you can
see some of the basic specs for the
server so I mentioned briefly a browser
user interface what the end user may see
is just as I said a shared drive with
lots of folders that are really
cartridges to access data we do have an
administrative buoy so that the storage
administrator can can manage the data
appropriately that can give that that
buoy gives you a capacity overview gives
you a basic understanding of of the
drive and media that you have in a
library and some some notifications and
activity logs for example when when
volumes are added into the library or
when volumes are ejected or if there are
any errors that occur you can format
LTFS tapes so at each end thousand or
LTO tape doesn't come formatted for LTFS
you have to put the partitions on there
and this application elopes you do that
easily with just one click of a button
and you can also do some some resource
allocation so that you have your
hardware setup as need be for your
environment so to give you some example
of some use cases of where this is
applicable oil and gas is an exempt is
an excellent example when they're
looking for oil deposits they
essentially shoot radar sonar into the
ground looking for four spots where oil
might be and this these result in very
large files and the easiest thing to do
is to put those files on tape and then
you can then ship those those tapes back
to a headquarters or research facility
for analysis and you because you put
this on tape you already automatically
have a local backup and or an archive
backup on file another good example of
where transportability of files as
important is in median entertainment so
you can if you're on location shooting a
movie or a television show or whatnot
you can record that directly on site to
tape and ship that back to a production
studio and again have that local
archived copy another common use case
that I'm not showing here in this in
this slide is a lot of times movie
studios outsource some of their work for
example there might be a company that
specializes in sound effects and so to
send the sound effects company is seen
that can be a very large file it's
easiest to just put that on tape ship it
over to the third party a sound effects
company who can then load the tape up
because they have LTFS as well even if
it's just an one drive open source open
edition version they'll be able to load
the tape up see what's on there add in
the sound effects record a new file and
then ship it back on the same tape and
everything works seamlessly you don't
have to have both the studio and the
third party have the same types of
backup applications or the same type of
editing software or whatnot the file
still works just fine so that is the end
of this section of the introduction of
of LTFS and LTFS library edition thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
