tasks, such provisioning instances, adding
users and gathering service health statistics.
Oracle API Catalog Service is a great tool
to learn and test these REST APIs for your
automation scripts.
For example, let’s suppose you frequently
use Oracle My Services to provision MySQL
instances, and you want to write a script
to automate this process.
To quickly get the information about the Oracle
MySQL API, search for MySQL, and select the
specific API that you want to learn about.
In this case, you want MySQL Cloud Service:
Services Instances
The catalog shows the APIs’ operations.
Expand an operation to see its details.
Before you can test the REST operations, you
must do two things.
First, sign into the catalog with your Oracle
Public Cloud account.
After you sign in, the Try It button appears
for each operation.
Second, you need to set up authorization credentials
in order to send REST requests to the service’s
endpoint.
For MySQL you need to provide and authorize
your username and password, and then provide
and authorize your identity name.
The catalog doesn't verify what you enter,
it just stores the values for this session.
To verify your credentials, click Test Credentials.
Notice that a blue info icon appears for each
operation.
This indicates that you can now use the Try
It feature to send the REST requests.
It’s a good idea to get the information
for an existing instance to see sample values.
For MySQL, you use the View a Service Instance
operation.
Enter the service ID, and then send the request.
When the request completes, copy the results
to an editor.
Now you’re ready to set up your request
to create an instance, using the Create a
Service operation.
To help create your payload, click Example
Value, and then click the example value.
The example now appears in the payload text
box, which lets you copy it.
Copy the payload and paste it in an editor.
To help you fill in the values, use the REST
Reference.
This shows you which properties are required
for the request body along with an example
request.
Then look at the information you just retrieved
for an existing instance to help you fill
in the values.
When you’re ready, paste your payload and
send the request.
When the request completes, the catalog shows
the response body, response headers, and the
cURL command for the request.
You can use this cURL command in the scripts
that you build to automate the process.
The job will take several minutes to complete,
and you want to monitor the progress along
the way.
You can view the progress from the UI,
or you can copy the job ID from the response
and use the GET job operation to see the status
of that job.
You might want to copy this cURL command for
your script too.
Now that you have the cURL commands that you
need, delete your test instance, and get started
building your script to create a service instance.
Don’t forget to close the browser tab to
get rid of any sensitive data that you might
have entered.
