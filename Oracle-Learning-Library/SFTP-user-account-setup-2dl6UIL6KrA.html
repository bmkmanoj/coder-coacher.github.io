the SFTP user account you use the SFTP
account to upload and download files
related to your Oracle cloud service you
need to be an identity domain
administrator to carry out this task I
start out at the my services page
there's various tabs the overview tab
tells me information that I need for
this exercise and that is the service
SFTP details so I'm going to need
several items from this one is SFTP host
yeah there's the port number and I'm
gonna need the user name so here we have
this user name I can go ahead and copy
that I'm gonna use the identity console
to reset the SFTP user account password
I'm gonna go to managing users I'll go
ahead and start typing in SFTP to limit
my results search and so the one I was
looking at was 32 this trial a3q I'll
highlight that what we wanna do is just
select the user here so for instance
click on first name and then where it
says reset password we're gonna go up
there click on that want to make sure
that's very important we want to make
sure to click manually change the
password and then enter your new
password that you want to set for your
SFTP user account
now I've already reset this password so
I'm not going to do that but you would
go ahead and click on that and you'd get
a confirmation message indicating that
as chain
and they cancel out there for now okay
so now I have my SFTP account set up I
want to point out to you for instance
one of the reasons you might want to use
SFTP is to conduct data export I'll show
you how to deal with data export in
another video but for now
that concludes our effort to set up an
SFTP user account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
