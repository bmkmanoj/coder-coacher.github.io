database testing demonstrate the
integration of tear masking real
application testing as a first step we
will make sure that we have created an
application data model before we start
running our data masking and real
application testing integration so
navigating over the enterprise already
management point you did a discovery
upon clicking on their discovery
modeling we arrive at the home page if
there is career modeling and you listed
an application they don't want was
already been created let's have a quick
look at this application did a model in
it logging into the database using your
own named credentials and continue
you'll arrive with the application in
tables this view arm in this we can see
all the tables underneath the
application cpc-h have been identified
in addition clicking on the referential
relationships we can see that all the
relationship had also been introspected
from the database and brought into the
application data model in the data
scenario modeling section and lastly the
sensitive columns have been
automatically discovered by the create
job discovery intact the discovery
results has sensitive here you can see
four columns that have been identified
as sensitive let's save and return
what's being sure that our application
data model has been created in the data
discovery and modeling we will navigate
over to the data masking definition
creation and we do this by clicking on
enterprise quality management and going
to data masking definition once we
arrive in the data masking definition
we'll go to create a data masking
definition for application data model
let's give it a name select the
application data model that was created
earlier once we have selected it click
on ensure workload masking compatibility
this ensures that the mass before that
are selected are compatible with the
masking or real application testing
artifacts as the integration of data
masking and real application testing is
natively done within theater masks
let's click on that let's go ahead and
select on the in credentials and log in
from the schema here we will simply type
since we have only one application
inside the application data model we
will search for all the sister Karli
identified in the data Mart here we can
see four columns have been selected for
the sake of this demonstration we will
choose account number Bank name and from
them to demonstrate once you select them
we will then go ahead and define the
format of each of these columns that
we're going to mask the data within it
clicking on the very first account num2
mask here we will just simply use random
numbers and we look at samples in the
samples we can see random numbers have
been selected over total length of 13
with the data type clicking ok let's
mask the next column defining the next
column here the bank name we will choose
a table column in this table column we
have test data pre-populated the test
tables name in the schema of TPC H is H
test Bank names selecting the H test
Bank Bank that contains a sample data
testing every one column we can see the
sample data have been pre-populated into
this tape clicking ok lastly we will use
the phone number and define the Masen
format here we will use a new format
type of encrypt this allows us to
maintain the characteristics of the data
within the table by defining a regular
expression and looking at the sample we
can see that the characteristics of the
data the form of the data is maintained
click on OK click OK we return to the
home page
we are done now what we need to do is
click on OK and generate the script dear
masse let's generate the script this
will run for a few seconds here we can
see the script is generated let's go
ahead and click on return what's the
script is generated our next step is to
run the data masking job to mask our
database and as well as the real
application testing artifacts before we
do that let's go ahead and have a look
at the data before we run the masking
inside the database we can see inside
the database we have Koski and we have
nine names and we have phone numbers so
let's return to a masking and
the job and execute the mask as a
first-ever ski mask we will give the job
job name
we will then give it a seats as we use
the encrypt typed encrypt that uses a C
in combination with a regular expression
to drive a mass value for the column in
consideration we'll choose a simple one
we will also take advantage of masking
cycle training sets at the same time and
it capture files we will select or
capture directory we will also
capitalize on the facility available to
perform an impact analysis due to
masking to ensure that there's no
proposed regression we'll choose a
single tuning set to perform this
analysis we will provide those
credentials I will also provide the
database protections this completes the
necessary inputs for running the data
masking job on the application data as
well as the real application testing
artifacts simultaneously click on submit
once we complete clicking on the submit
we return to the home page of data
masking definition creation here we will
monitor the job to its completion we can
see that the data masking job has
completed successfully let's go ahead
and close out of this tab and return
back to our home page of data masking
definition let's have a look at the data
that's being masked here we can see that
the masking process is masked the
application data you see that the see
bank name is now all test banks and
notice that the phone numbers have also
been masked while keeping the
characteristics of the phone number
moving back to what it was before the
last process and after masking process
now let's have a look at the real
application testing the artifacts to see
how they were masked as well prior to
our last process this was what we had
seen inside our application testing
artifacts left side by side compare what
what it is now after the fact here we
can see that the data has been masked
consistently this was before this was
after the capture and now we have the
data inside the sequel tuning set any
buying values have been masked
additionally we can see that any mention
of sensitive columns inside the database
replay capture files have any last
consistently
Federal Reserve has turned into test
Metro Manila and bailout Bank has turned
into tryst bank just Chartered Bank here
notice the bailout and the secret
training set and consequently after the
masking process test Chartered Bank
returning back to our homepage offered
an American definition we are also
selected to perform an impact analysis
oversee group using secret performance
analyzer or within a massive job let's
click on the single performance analyzer
task having a look at our report we can
see that the impact of data masking on
our application has had did not have any
adverse effect on the performance of our
application this concludes our screen
watch on data masking real application
testing integration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
