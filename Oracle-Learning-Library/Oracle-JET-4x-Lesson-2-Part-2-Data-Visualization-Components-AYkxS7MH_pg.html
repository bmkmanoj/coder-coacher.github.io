second of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle jet in the first part of this
lesson you are introduced to the theme
for this week which is to explore Oracle
J's features use cases and scenarios the
first area we'll be exploring is the
Oracle jet data visualization component
sets these are the most visually
appealing parts of a reco jet as well as
some of the more complex you're likely
to want to get familiar with them as a
first step after getting to know the
basic concepts of Jets which we dealt
with in the first week of this course
let's start by looking at the charts you
can use chance to present flat or
hierarchical data in a graphical display
for data analysis as an example let's
put a chart into the employees module
that we created earlier in the cookbook
find a chart of your liking for example
let's take a look at the picture chart
this is a relatively new chart in the
Oracle jet component library and is
especially useful for representing
statistics copy the section of the
cookbook that is relevant for the view
as a starting point and paste it into
the employees HTML file save it and then
take note of the data that is
represented by the chart in this case
represented by means of the piktochart
items observable array pasted into the
JavaScript side of the module
make sure to refer to the Oracle jet
component that you're making yourself
which is the piktochart and then simply
open the browser and you will see that
your chart is displayed there you can go
a step further and try and copy more of
the code from the recipe that might be
relevant for your context for example
the displayed data that is put next to
it paste it into the view and then go
back into the browser and you will see
your data together with the legend or
text next to it finally make sure that
you're familiar with all the variations
on the charts that you choose there
might be some features that could be
really relevant for your context without
you being aware of it so when you are
getting familiar with the different
charts spend some time browsing through
all the different ways in which charts
can be visualized and represented within
your jet application you will see that
each recipe within the cookbook has a
wide range of documentation and options
and events and configurations for you to
examine next let's take a look at the
gauges the gauges provided by Oracle jet
are led gauge rating gauge and status
meter gauge among others
for example rating gauges are typically
used to display or accept feedback on a
product or a service while lead gauges
are used to highlight a specific
measured value in relation to its
threshold let's go through the same
steps as before as a revision to add a
gauge to our about module we go into the
gate section status meter gauge and
notice that there is a circular
variation on these status meter gauge
which can be very useful very common
type of gauge that you see in many
applications and in there we see in the
view the HTML tag that defines a
circular status meter gauge we copy it
into our view we notice that there is a
two-way data-binding code value 10 we
copy it from the recipe
and we paste it and also we look for the
oj Gage component reference and paste it
into our define block in our view there
is another reference to a one-way
data-binding called label we look inside
of our JavaScript in the recipe and we
paste that property into the view model
as well back in our application we can
see that our gauge is now rendered
correctly using the data we have
provided simply by copying and pasting
from the cookbook the article jet
component library includes a semantic
net component which is especially useful
for sharing data with geographic
locations several built-in maps are
included as well as support for geo JSON
which is the official format for
encoding a variety of geographic data
structures included in the oracle jet
component library is a timeline
component which displays a set of events
in chronological order the timeline
component includes advanced and
sophisticated features such as a rich
support for graphical data rendering
scale manipulation zooming resizing and
object grouping to round off our
exploration of the data visualization
components let's take a look at the tag
cloud component tag clouds display
textual data where font style and size
are used to emphasize the importance of
each data item other data visualization
components to be aware of include the
diagram and box sunburst and tree map it
should also be noted that all of these
data visualization components meet the
wcag 2.0 standard this is important when
building applications for the enterprise
space in this part you have been
introduced to the data visualization
components you have learned that each
component has basic features as well as
a range of options that you can use to
customize them each component has events
which lets you connect the HTML view to
the business logic and JavaScript the
cookbook provides complete recipes for
each component as well as a link to the
related Java Script documentation for
your homework for this
choose one or two charts recipes in the
cookbook review the J's ducks pages for
the particular charts that you've chosen
and try and tweak them life in the
browser and see what the effect is as a
bonus tasks also try adding a gauge
component and an input field to one of
your jet applications and bind them
together so that changing the input
field updates the gauge and updating the
gauge changes the value in the input
field finally thank you once again for
participating in the course and Oracle
jet and we hope that you're learning a
lot and we look forward to seeing you
again in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
