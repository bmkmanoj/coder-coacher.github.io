of this presentation was not recorded we
are joining the program already in
progress that's that picking a good
configuration library on the JVM
platform I think it's to a crucial
because you have to solve certain
problems that's most of the time like
you have like your own development
configuration or your production
configuration you would like to have
like a transparent solution that's going
to work in both environments
transparently our favorite types if is
the types of compu library which i think
is a great solution to these problems
but there are other good libraries out
there go check them out okay so before I
talk about play I guess it's a good time
to act like how many of you play the
play or how many of you like simply
image no so there are few people that's
great so I mean the obvious question at
this point like why we need like another
framework so play one was originally
used in 2009 and it came in like a few
radical ideas what kind of like radical
ideas I'm talking about first of all it
can be like a rapid application
development so which is really similar
to like dynamic languages the workflow
I'm talking about is um where you go to
your editor but it's like you're right
if you tidy or like a modern text editor
we make changes to your source file you
switch to the browser you eat refresh
and your application is going to be the
calm finally loaded within the browser
if you see an error message then
there're message is going to be
presented in the browser this kind of
workflow is really really common in like
that that connected the dynamic language
word but it is something that you and
they introduced and its really kind of
increasing the developer productivity
the second thing that play was one of
the first frameworks that really
advocated a continuous deployment that I
mentioned before thankfully this is
becoming more and more kind of
commonplace these days like draftees art
so doing that which is another great
framework on the JVM and furthermore
furthermore play one
we like a lot of helpers that kind of
like help you with like a bday test like
motivating forums and dealing with x mi
llamo or whatever 54 man you need to use
and so these kind of features really
have to kind of take developer
productivity next level the one would
wonder like why why we went ahead and
created an entering new framework if we
had all this kind of awesomeness but
turns out look like many things have
changed since 2009 the first thing that
obviously has changed that many new
front-end technologies be merged since
2009 I'm talking about 110 technologies
like less CSS transformer coffeescript
Google kosher compiler for html5 the
second thing is many the publications on
the JVM moved from mostly synchronize
design with kind of folding long polling
base or like just a short poem based
strategies to more as synchronous
non-blocking kind of push phase once so
that's the reason why i play too
supports comment that suck at event
source and just kind of data streaming
in general out of the box the next thing
I would mention is that the third reason
why we decided to have like an anti-nuke
chamber because we wanted to provide a
framework which which is not a kind of
tied to one specific language but it's
actually tied to two languages so place
probably only framework that exists that
has to not EVP is and they kind of like
coexist kind of really nicely so that
was always like a big design decision so
in play you can use a native API if your
java developer or not EVP i just ate us
color double affair that shouldn't be a
big difference other than the features
that the specific line which provides
yes
I mean there are obvious differences i
will talk about the design kind of
course and i think that feel kind of
give you a bed there as fur but i
usually try to avoid like feature to
feature corporations because that's
somewhat misleading so i guess it's
going to be much cleaner than let me get
to that design I mean like I think the
easiest through this just like if you go
and try both and you know try to make a
decision based on your own acquirements
like I don't think like one is necessary
better than the other but I mean it's
hard for me to say anything considering
like I'm you know working on this
particular project so that's that's why
I think it's not necessarily like you
know kind of like you useful thing for
me just to discuss but there are certain
differences the easiest i think if you
just really be a two prototypes and then
just you know try to make your own
decision based on that but and the next
thing so so the 13 was like kind of
providing that EVP is both for Java and
Scala developers I think that's really
powerful thing because that is basically
allows you to start a project or in one
language and switch to another or like
my favorite kind of set up there I can I
can choose the two that that I think is
the best for that particular task so
it's really it to be like an application
we're kind of Java and Scala kind of
like bleep sliding in harmony and that's
a nice play application and furthermore
like we wanted to really push as many
things to the compiler as possible so
that play some coming with a kind of new
ideas that's kind of like pushing more
and more to the compiler so basic and
talking about the fact that like the
Pampas route file like if you ever did
like rails or Django or any
that development you I'm sure you
recognize the fight that it's going to
tell you that this you if you eat this
you other than invoke this action so
many frameworks had this kind of idea in
case of play this file is compiled and
what it means in practice that if you
make a mistake in this rad definition
that you going to see a compilation
error or your project is not going to
compile if you have a typo say in your
ratify and that's the same for like
templates as well but besides besides up
pushing templates and the right
generation to the compiler they also
comes with the support for like fronting
technologies so what this means in
practice that like if you're a front-end
developer you're going to see exactly
the same user experience that I was I
was talking about and we will see that
kind of feature in action shortly and
other than that like there are what this
other goodies that like you would pretty
much assume that your favor supports so
I'm not going to go through those okay
so uh so i play too was released in
febrile 2012 the latest three is 204
this was released yesterday it's just a
maintenance release the next major
release which I'm really rather Fitz 21
it's coming this year that contain is
like more than hundred bug fixes and a
bunch of a bunch of features that like I
will I be mentioned some of them later
we have right now about like 60 plugins
but the echo system is growing quickly
and thankfully we have like a really big
community to to work with the project
put lunch in fibrous I mentioned we
already have like a few big kind of
early adapters more to come I'm really
excited that we're kind of working with
these companies and just to give you an
idea like was the foundation for the
framer so these are the open source
project that would be at a play on on
top of native we used as like our a
synchronous HTTP library this is working
really valid acha which is like a
event rhythm a kind of actor messaging
rainbow and basically the the way the
framework is written that like the core
framework itself is written in Scala
Soviet Eliza many of the features that
Scott has to offer less we do provide
like a kind of like a Java API on top of
it and we also a be at a video on html5
which was accosted a really important to
support it as much as possible and as
far as design philosophy and this is a
slide that I I wanted to mention to you
regarding your questions so the mean the
most important thing for us is that we
try to focus on user experience or
developer experience in our case as
opposed to kind of say competing on
feature to feature and more specifically
we kind of came up with three goals and
we designed a framework the first goal
was that simple that should be simple by
a heart that should be also possible and
and the most important point from from
all of these that obvious focus on kind
of develop their happiness so this is
how the that kind of developer console
looks like so it basically just go to
your go to your favorite like I don't
know termina you just hit you just say
play and then you can launch your
application between the developer
console that you can see that like
another application is running and then
you switch to the browser hit refresh
then you're going to see an error
message potential like this so again I
didn't have the kind of the usual
workflow where I make changes to my
source file idea the whole wharf I now
wait for the compile a movie for the
container to just 3 diploma application
potentially minutes in this particular
workflow you just really make changes to
your source by heat to the hit the
browser and potentially an error message
like this and you can just go back to
your browser fix their or switch to the
browser hit refresh and arrow goes away
and you see your application in the
browser this is this is from a browser
this message
a similar error message are you going to
see then there is a typo or like and
there is something wrong in your rad
definition so in this particular case
you can see that there was a problem
with this rad definition the next thing
I'm going to show you is the kind of
similar error message that you see if
there is a problem in your template
again the template is some compile check
is using Scala but it's kind of like a
lightweight version of Scala more like I
would see like a lightweight version of
GSP in a way because it only allows you
to write like certain expressions but
you can't really write like a whole
application or like a whole thing like
in Scala it's just basically you can
just write simple expressions within
your template but it is compiled check
and the way it works that and we will
see that shortly that first you of is
defined on top of your file you define
the kind of parameters for your template
and then you can reference those
variables and also you can create like
what is a template text which strategy
can be familiar if you use say Django
before and as I mentioned like the whole
framework is working in such a way that
like front-end and back-end developers
actually experience in the same kind of
racket application development and of
workflow so in this particular case you
can see that like even javascript is
somewhat compiled what's happening
behind the curtain is that we're
invoking Google closure compiler which
which is giving you a like at least like
warnings if they're there is something
wrong in your JavaScript obviously it's
not the same as like a compiler but I
means more than nothing again what this
means in practice that if you try to
package your whole application and it is
a javascript error the package is not
going to it's not going to compile
that's like really powerful thing
okay so this slide is basically just
show you an example how you can use this
kind of message driven architecture in
play or like non-blocking very textured
in play so this particular example is
showing you a kind of like a chatroom
implementation using aqua actors and
this particular actor is sending
messages and receiving messages to and
from our web socket stream and you can
see that like this for like programming
programming this way it's kind of
leaving you have a completely new
architecture because instead of kind of
focusing or like Alex and
synchronization you really just focus on
kind of message below this is how like a
type sift kind of template looks like as
I mentioned on top you define the kind
of like the the variables that this
particular time attempt it accepts but
again it means if you really use this
template that if you try to pass more
than one parameter or a parameter an
argument that's different than a form
that you're going to see a compilation
error and you also can see here is a
that there is a fun healthcare implant
in play that lets you kind of bind and
generate like a whole form tag which
which you can map back to your
application the demo that i'm going to
show you shortly is actually using this
so video be able to see this in more
details we play we really take like
testing seriously so they comes with
both like a functional and like a unit
test solution because many of these kind
of modern web applications like using
javascript is like a kind of first-class
not like necessary language but at first
class earlier the whole kind of MVC
paradigm is kind of like more like
extended money be the next earlier more
often than not you want to have like a
function of test executor in in your
tool tool box because it's a certain
features are really hard to test without
the JavaScript layer
this particular test is just basically
showing you how to use like kind of like
an email Murray database with your
particular application and using just
htmlunit be using like a version of
selenium driver so anything that
selenium driver supports we also support
so you actually you can run this
particular test in your browser but this
one is using HTML you need to the
headless browser with minimal javascript
implementation but as I mentioned
nothing stopping you from using Chrome
or Firefox for your functional that's
one of one of the things that we really
wanted to take seriously from day one is
that why we provide you like a few ideas
what they think is kind of like the best
practices as far as the templating or
rotting is concerned we kind of
recognize that like you may have
different ideas or you may have
different preference when it comes to
say templates or rats or anything guys
that we provide so we made it really
easy just to swap out any components
that that we provide so it's kind of
like we give you like the kind of like
this is what we think is the best option
and that you can basically if you can
choose whatever you want so you don't
like our scallop based templates but you
prefer velocity or freemarker or whether
they're java templating solution you
like it's real easy to plug in like that
there is no special treatment for our
template solution other than that with
that that's the one that we recommend
then to play with but there is nothing
stopping you from using anything you
want if you don't like the writing
solution that there are hooks that let
you swap out our rat implementation and
then you can use anything you want there
is no single component in the play
architecture that can be swapped out at
this point and and of course we made it
really easy that users can write plugins
in this particular case this is just
showing you how you can access the hids
plugin yeah this is just like
for the readies key value store as we
use this plugin in my demo so this is
just giving you an idea how you can how
you can access it from your application
alright so let's dive into an actual
application so I'm going to leave my
presentation alright so what we're going
to do here is just like so I'm going to
walk you through like an application
have you make like a few changes and if
time permits have you just deploy to
Heroku so just to make it like something
you the word file I'm just going to fire
up my editor but you could use like
eclipse or IntelliJ or even not be
inciting so the heart of every play
application is the rat file but as you
can see the kind of the application
structure that we recommend which by the
way also can be easily aware written
this is just direct this is just
recommendation now you can see that like
you recognize the standard like MVC kind
of design pattern so you see control as
models and and views as well so no
surprise that like our templates like
sitting basically instead used by you
can see that like the one controller and
i'm going to show you what else as well
so this is our application please stand
there like even if you don't know play
they should give you an idea the
application structure in fact that was
the mean I mean reason why we kind of
still kind of stick with like and see
even though it's really easy just to
create this kind of like four layer set
up where the front end is a significant
part of your application so the easiest
to understand like a play application is
through this five because this fight is
kind of mapping HTTP to to your
application so just to walk you through
what we're seeing here we have one
controller method called index which is
the index page it takes like a message
and like as you can see you can create
like default messages but if you
if you check the last line you also can
see that like in this particular case we
said that if the user is providing like
a message query string and that should
all wear write that message that we
provided by default so in other words
like if you eat index you're gonna see
Hello javaone if you heat index and you
provide a message query string then that
string is going to wear right hello
chavo and 2012 the list you are a lease
URI URI is mapped to like lease users
control action and we have also a post
which is basically just going to take
care of the situation where then like a
user is record it let me show you the
application as well I guess that's the
easiest so I'm going to fire up the
development console it's complaining
about kind of the version differences
but just because I'm using like a
cutting-edge version here for this demo
you usually wouldn't see that so I'm
going to fire up the application so now
the application is running I also have
my ready server sitting here so that's
what I got here so I'm gonna okay so
this is the application that we're
talking about it's pretty simple it's
just basically showing you like the
intro screen and then you can just see
like a user and then there is a simple
thing simple way just to list users so
that's that's all I put together this
like in one hour or something so it's
really easy just to create something
like this so right now there aren't like
any users recorded so i guess i can
record one like
oh yeah Peter ok work ok so now this is
listing not showing vine user let me go
back to the index page and i'm going to
show you that there is also some
validation right so I I means both so
then that's not good let me just try to
come up with any invalid email address
i'm going to try to see the user is
going to say that the the email is
invalid okay so nothing fancy i I think
ok so that's the application that that
we talking about so you get from one how
you got the index page you get like a
list view and you can see the user
that's all so let's see how it works in
behind the curtain so let's start with
the index page and I'm going to walk you
through the whole work so that's good so
this is your controller read example
this particular in this particular
example I chose a technique called like
static binding so like my my controller
i met with returning like a static also
my country metastatic methods however if
you prefer to use like spring or juice
and kind of manage controller lifecycle
you can also do that so in this
particular example i just switch to this
demo project you can see how spring can
be used with play so by obvious you're
not going to see the kind of static
methods there everything is managed just
like a spring Dean you can do the same
thing with the Jews or you can do this
even manually which is what i usually do
if i am going to use like injection okay
I mean obviously the benefit here is a
lot because it statically buying like if
anything that happens then you see the
issue immediately by with the bit like
any dependency injection would see the
issue more like at runtime so you can
really get some benefit from the static
methods here but anyway it's a matter of
preference so let's let's start with the
index page so what you see here is that
like the index the index method is
taking like a string and then basically
just saying that like let's render the
view with this particular with this
particular form which is just
academically form and that particular
message so let's see that index form so
that's just to give you an idea again
the form you're talking about is just
this one right so this is the form we
talking about so this form s you recall
it takes two parameters one is the form
itself and other one is some kind of
just a message that we just show and
what you see here is that like we have
like a kind of like a sofa template tag
that's basically containing the layout
of the template and then just kind of
pretty simple template logic one extra
thing I would mention is that place
supporting a feature called reverse
routing so instead of hard-coding urs
both in pure JavaScript or and in your
template in play you can just reference
the actions and that also generates like
compiler errors if you make an issue
here so you never have to deal with like
urs in your templates that allows you
full flexibility when it comes to
changing your URLs or where time this
feature can be really family a few done
any rails develop and see where you also
see that what we what we have more than
this is that this is actually working
for JavaScript as well so if you have
JavaScript callbacks we generate
JavaScript that that's actually using
the same SMS technique to kind of hide
the URL from you so you can always just
change your rad file and add your
application should be working as I
mentioned this is compiled check so that
means sure what that means so obviously
this not this shouldn't be working so
I'm just hitting the browser here
and now it's containing that that there
isn't like a metal code list right so
that's true so I'm going to fix that
refresh the browser and then the
application was recompile reloaded i'm
going to show you the same feature that
like when when I have like a Java issue
here so I containing that like oh yeah
there is something wrong so let me fix
that I'm switching to my browser
switching to my editor I'm fixing there
or I save the files with to the browser
hit refresh what you don't see here is
the kind of traditional JVM burps oh
there you make changes to your to your
source files via the horror war and wait
for the content a container to deploy
this is the whole thing is like seamless
just make changes and switch to the
browser and I should see the computation
errors or the application that I'm
working on okay so that was that was a
template now let's see like a form
really quickly just let me see how much
times I still have time that's good so
um if you recall that we had this form
alright so what happens if you if you
submit that form play comes with like a
kind of like a form hat and the
validator framework the validator
framework is based on spring validator
so anything you can do with spring a
validator you can do with play so
essentially what's happening here is
that like we bind the form request to
this kind of form object and then we run
the validation through it and if there
was any error then we kind of rendering
a request where we say that like
something was wrong with your form what
I tentatively we first check that there
a user with the same email address or
the exist if that's the case so on I'm
talking about like save save user and
like user find user then if the user
where the exit
with the same email address then we
render this page with a different error
message but if things going but let me
just going to render the page with like
an okay two hundred and different for so
that's the that's the kind of control
layer let's see the implementation of
the modem so this is the model that we
have here this is the kind of spring
annotation that I was talking about so
we say that in this particular case that
we using the email validator that we
have and then we also say that like name
should be required so that's the kind of
annotation we have on own name and then
other than that I added like the video
kind of helper methods here the first
kind of you see here is that like we get
like access to this kind of reddish
plug-in that I configure for my
application this is a really simple key
value store kind of like a simplified a
database if you will so it's pretty
simple and that's that's the reason why
I chose it and Haruko is the support it
so that's that's a big win but so what
you see here like this is the kind of
type of fine user simply de o method set
so we get like a hids resource it's kind
of like a similar idea to like jdbc so
you get the resource if something's
going around that you have to make sure
that you close the connection otherwise
you're going to have like a hanging
connection so this is working kind of
similarly to jdbc and then we basically
just get like an email address from
reddy's and because reddy's only
supports like string type like we have
to kind of see utilize the data there in
this particular case so that's that's
pretty much it for for fine user when we
kind of try to retrieve all the users
the idea is very similar so which is
the weather data from readies for that
particular before for all the users and
then we just kind of be civilized from
that kind of antenna format I came up
with nothing fancy here if there was an
exception then we just print the
exception and bitter nothing and then
finally we have like like I'm the kind
of like the civilization logic there let
me just try to see the user so pretty
straightforward I guess and so let's try
to make a change so now I'm going to
just deploy this yeah okay and then this
is my application I'm going to just see
that demo time I'm just going to push to
Heroku I don't know how fast it's going
to be let me see why we waiting i'm
going to show you another feature I
don't know all right so slow maybe my
internet connection so i'm going to show
you like the test runner which i think
it's also kind of interesting and
certainly valuable so test our captain
test for their we have like a functional
test for this particular application and
what we'll be doing here is that like we
fire up like a whole application in
contests contacts against that port like
3333 using HTML unit which is a headless
browser and we have a callback which I'm
hoping that it's going to go away once
we once we had java eat support and and
then just we run our functional test
which pretty much just basically checks
but there's a certain string is there
right now like it is it like whether
dreamforce is there because
the grad test was there but let's change
the say to travel along and then I'm
going to run the test and see what we
have oh it's going to run yeah I think
it's going to hear because it's not
there but I'm gonna fix that really
quickly and open the this is compiling
the test it should fear rightly so
because this page didn't have a job or
Java 1 2012 one word and that's right so
I had to add the space let's see what we
got here in the meantime I'm going to
see ok so Heroku doing this thing so I'm
going to rerun the function a test and
it says that functional test was indeed
working since now I fix that fixed a
test ok so hopefully it's going to be
live soon and this is where it lives
probably waiting for eric ooh yeah so
this is the application I don't know why
it's not loading the whole thing
what why it's not loading the or page
but so but anyway so you would see the
same thing that that I just have here I
don't know why it's not doing the same
thing on Heroku but why waiting then do
you guys have any questions so I was
pretty much done the demo part and then
before I wrap it up I take questions yes
yeah which point I mean so the way that
the test is working that like you can
basically just set up your mock weather
there for every single test so you have
to just reset state but I mean the whole
thing is basically like still giving you
the option if you if you don't like
static methods you can just avoid them
so it is an option what you get with
them is like you can avoid like certain
kind of runtime exceptions but the
strategy is the same that you would do
with like an in a normal situation you
have to set up your state before you run
your tests and then they ran your test
one by one that's not running in Paris
so so you wouldn't have like any issues
with that but as I said it's a matter of
preference you you are not forced to use
static method but that's a good question
you're using dessert when he chose you
nice the offers a Starfighter and maybe
also
in fact like there is a that's an
excellent question uh about two weeks
ago we just launched our kind of
experimental feature and the release for
supporting syntax highlighting and some
context kind of dependent half hours in
the Eclipse plug-in this plug-in is not
tied to kind of this caller ID at all so
you can just download that as a separate
kind of plugins you have to just at the
types if eclipse nightly kind of URL to
your eclipse kind of update sites and
then you can have syntax highlighting
for your route files and syntax
highlighting for your templates as well
and you also get navigation which so
it's not just like basically syntax
highlighting but you can in eclipse in
your flat file yeah I know know that I
mean the the main idea here is that like
and that's the reason why it's kind of a
separate part of the ID that like I mean
if you just using a plain vanilla
eclipse and you not interested in scala
you can just install these kind of the
java user as i said like for us it's
very important that we don't want to
really have this kind of we don't make a
distinction between like oh you know
these are like scarlet uh professor java
developers if you want to use java
that's really cool we love java so use
job and we try to make sure that you can
use whatever you want
have to say about shorts complicates
anything
yeah sure other questions thankfully
IntelliJ users help us with the big
boats and like IntelliJ started working
on play two templates and rad support
and there is an offer release already
out I think it's just supporting rod
files but but the like thanks to the
community like Navi we got voting into
the kind of system so now it's kind of
like a high priority source apparently
people working on yeah I don't know what
was going on yeah it came up i was i was
surprised it was like actually Heroku
thing yeah I don't know why it's yeah
yeah okay cool I was really surprised by
what's going on but yeah that's it if
you guys don't have any other questions
I have stickers and buttons and we also
have like a booth like if you guys have
any extra questions don't hesitate to
come yes
I mean our biggest user is cloud and
they're doing like two billion request I
don't know I think a day I don't know
that number buddy I mean they using it
me just for for the back here what they
really using it for is just because we
have all these kind of hard Paris and
like the test run air and also this kind
of rapid application development thing
you still can take advantage of that
even if you're just building like that
kind of full year on um well it's over
the web api yeah
Johnson became very still
clips
we're going to play or
I mean so in case of cloud Texas can use
them again as an example like they just
returning like Jason Jason support is
built in so that's pretty standard setup
but it's usually like you're like this
design decision but there you want to
just be at your like web api in in play
in which particular case of course like
you can take advantage of all this kind
of nice kind of like streaming and stuff
like that but I mean depends on you are
really like your um your framework
because like I mean if you support
certain things and like you can even use
like say a synchronous streaming like
that's something that even if you just
be at an API if you want a stream data
you still can use that you just for
example with a comet implementation or
the WebSocket implementation would
require probably more like a full day
application but that's pretty common to
the API thing
yes so now I'm going to go back to the
presentation so two one is coming coming
approximate layer and like november
december likely targeting like that box
for for the first rc but certainly gonna
happen this year the one of the really
exciting features is that which is we're
gonna have like scaffolding and project
template what it means is that if you
ever use like rails before then like i'm
sure you're familiar with this kind of
code generation so like it's giving you
like say like a nice controller
recognized application saying out of the
box it will be able to generate certain
kind of snippets and you can also create
your own snippets so you can share it
with your teammates and the project
template is kind of like a similar idea
i mentioned that we just keep give our
recommendation as far as what kind of
components you should use because we
have project templates you can just
basically create your own project
template with your own default with your
own templates kind of wire template
engine wired up and then you see that
like in my team this is the template we
use in fact the standard play template
is just going to be one of these kind of
templates but there isn't going to be
anything special about that it's kind of
like really similar to realize where the
restive also just say stuff like this is
our recommendation but i think in
reality squad engine so then you also
can just create your own thing and in
your organization these are the defaults
that that you're going to use so that
scaffolding a project we be working on
like a materialization as well so like
just to make sure that like again if you
if you say using no sequel like the
first or you don't want to use jdbc and
stuff i'd actually make sure that like
you really have just a minimum kind of
requirement for 44 you're projecting it
on your classpath we we try to optimize
the kind of the rapid application
development for more that's pretty
exciting and the next thing that is
really kind of going to change the whole
thing is that you will be able to define
rats in sub-projects so
I mean especially some of our early
adaptors who they got to a point where
there r at five was like too big and
instead of really kind of focusing on
that like we want to focus on
virtualization so you will be able to
have sub routes and like basic you can
define rats and separate sub-project
sense you can have mini play
applications that you can wire up
together and that's that's already in at
21 we're going to have like SSS support
right now we have some limited support
on master but for two month i know that
is going to be like a full-fledged https
super as well and and on that kind of
front-end level we have required GS
support which is providing you like emd
kind of dependency low demand ism for it
for javascript i really like that
specific feature and we already use it
in production
so the way the video hobbies would be a
system works is that you can actually
publish an artifact so you're you can
package up your vote application as an
artifact you can publish your artifact
SSM even artifact but I mean it's not
using me and it's using a different beer
too but you can be used and every single
artifact from a van or IV you can also
publish as IV or maven but it's not
using me than itself yes so it's just a
char fight that you can publish through
this publish through this beer to called
SBT and and the SBT like lets you reuse
any existing maven or IV artifacts you
also can publish everything as ivy or
maven that's well no that's that's
that's what we got right now actually
somebody from the community created like
am even plugin i would recommend to
check it out that's and and talking
about plugins so one of the things that
we also try to improve is is that like
right now it's kind of hard to explore
and find plugins for foreplay so one of
the things that we try to address for
the release of 21 is to have like a
chrome store firefox add-on kind of
experience for the plugins where you can
read plugins you can see which plugin is
maintained and so the ecosystem is
certain something that we were focus on
for for the lunch yes
so fingers about for example blacks who
are using plain green size or large
projects for something they watch I mean
we actually work a constrained by like
the underlying technologies so like in
certain situations if use a less
transformer or a kind of coffee script
or Google closure like the our our
strategies that like we always try to
use the Rhino implementation of these
things by default because that allows
you just to download the package and
just use it as a standalone thing but we
always always try to make sure that you
can use the native compilers so some of
these things like requirejs or or even I
think less or coffeescript certainly
allows you to use like a not leave
compiler and we always make sure that
you can plug in those which would give
you performance boost so what the bigger
sites doing like instead of using the
the Rhino version which of course is
slower because rhino is not the fastest
JavaScript engine on the planet like you
can just plug in the naughty version and
then you use that what you lose is
portability so you have to really make
sure that like every developer has that
like I don't know not Eve kind of
compiler or native thing installed on
their desktops
yeah I mean I mean everything is kind of
a build on that idea but you can stream
data like the way you want like I mean
data streaming I mean this yeah I mean
so say I don't know I try to give you
like a somewhat realistic example so say
you have to read like a whole image into
your application you wanna upload that
image to s3 at the same time right so
the way you would do it like without
this kind of advanced I or handling
techniques that you would need to read
everything to memory and then just kind
of you know right it to s3 or like many
times what you do you actually write you
read everything to memory and then write
it to disk and upload it to s3 what you
can do with this advanced I handling
that you can actually send s3 daytime
chunks so the way you receive an image
you send it to s3 and then if s3 is slow
that you just wait a bit that you get
more data you send that without you
loading the hole in each to memory yeah
clever
yeah I mean so the kind of plug in thing
is one way to kind of create reusable
things but not because route rad files
can be stored in any sub-projects you
can create mini applications many
components that actually have the same
structure like a player that you can
even share mini play components as of 21
but otherwise it's just because we using
maven I be compatible dependency thing
the normal kind of situation or Malay of
sharing components applies which is to
just published like a jar and just you
know reference that jar in your beard
file but you can use sub sub components
and subplate projects nice dependencies
as well which is pretty powerful thing
okay thank you guys yes
yeah it's very general like so we have
like 10 plate tags that we should feed
the framework my users that's the other
way to kind of share kind of stuff that
you that I users who actually sharing
template tax the same way as in Django I
believe I mean it's been a while when I
work with jungle but yeah i mean the the
so essentially the in the lobby it works
that we just she play with a few helpers
so that foreign helper that you saw that
was double just an ordinary template tag
there was no special treatment that you
can just create your own and packages HR
and even though is just like html5 and
and just distributed within your team
right thank you guys and if any one of
you need speakers i have two stickers
and buttons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
