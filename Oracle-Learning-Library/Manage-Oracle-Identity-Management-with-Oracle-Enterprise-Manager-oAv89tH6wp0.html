Management leverages Oracle Enterprise
Managers broad set of capabilities in
configuration management performance
monitoring and diagnostics and service
level management to provide a
centralized systems management solution
for Oracle Identity Management starting
from the Enterprise Manager homepage
will select metal middleware from the
targets menu
now we will select identity and access
from the middleware features menu to
access the Identity and Access dashboard
from the Identity and Access dashboard
users can monitor the overall health of
the identity management environment the
component members summary region
provides a list of all the identity
management components along with
information about the status the host
the incidents raised as well as the
detected configuration changes if we
scroll down we will see the top five
components in terms of resource usage
including CPU utilization and memory
utilization
there are also custom regions for each
of the identity management target types
including ones for the Oracle directory
server Enterprise Edition and the Oracle
Identity Manager if we scroll up we will
see the services and systems regions an
Enterprise Manager you can create
systems and services based on the
end-to-end Identity Management
environment let's drill down into the
identity management 11g r-1 service now
let's go ahead and click on the topology
tab to take a look at a graphical view
of the end-to-end identity management
service we can see that in this service
topology that there are three oracle
homes one being used by oracle internet
directory or called virtual directory
and oracle identity federation the
second oracle home is being used by the
database that is storing the information
for Oracle Identity Manager and then the
third Oracle home is being used by
Oracle access manager and Oracle
Identity Manager all three Oracle homes
are installed on the same host now let's
click on information publisher reports
to look at a detailed services
monitoring dashboard
the services dashboard provides a
service-oriented view of the identity
management environment displaying a
summary of the availability performance
and service levels achieved for the
monitored identity management services
let's drill down into the oracle
directly server Enterprise Edition
service from the target menu we will
select service level agreement and
access the SLA dashboard we are now
looking at the service level agreement
dashboard that serves as a report on SLA
compliance we can see that two service
level objectives have been created one
based on performance and the other on
availability within each SLO key metrics
have been selected as service level
indicators and for the performance
service level objective we've selected
CPU utilization message search time
total LDAP operations and search
operations now let's navigate back to
the service home page we will now click
on system we're where we will be able to
see the components within the system
topology and now we will drill down into
the directory server Enterprise Edition
server we can now see an aggregated view
of key performance metrics for the
directory server metrics include average
operations per second and elapsed time
per operation for each of the LDAP
operation types including bind search
add delete and so on in this screen
watch we have seen how the management
pack plus for Identity Management
simplifies the health monitoring of
complex Identity Management environments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
