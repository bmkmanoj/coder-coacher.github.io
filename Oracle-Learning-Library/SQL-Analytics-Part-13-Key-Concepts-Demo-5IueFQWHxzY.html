our 12c demo environment and as you can
see if you've looked at the pattern
matching podcasts we're using the same
schema so we have a 12c database we have
a user called p.m. user and we're using
a table called ticker we're using three
columns symbol timestamp and price and
the data looks like this so you have us
three symbols globex Oscorp acne we have
data running from the first of April to
the twentieth of April for each symbol
and we have the price so now let's take
one of our business questions that we
had which was let's create a moving
average for a stock price so how would
we do that the first thing we need to do
is obviously select the symbol we need
to cite the timestamp the price and then
we want to compute the average price now
you'll notice here that we have some
additional keywords which is when we
start a sequel analytics processing so
we're going to over this average and
we're going to group our data by symbol
which means that for each symbol we will
only be interested in the price data for
that symbol because we're creating a
moving average we need to order the data
by the time stamp and in this case I've
got 20 days so I'm actually going to
reset at the end of twentieth of April
anyway so i'll take the current rate
plus 19 days preceding as the range
interval for my average and i'll rename
the column as m price and we'll select
that from our table tick
so let's just execute that as you can
see it comes back fairly quickly so
here's our first symbol Acme starts on
the first of April price 12 moving
average 12 and then as we start to
increase the number of razor moving
average 14.5 16 and so on until we get
to 20th of April final price is 22
moving average 19 point 15 then the next
row we start a new symbol globex first
of April prices three moving average
resets then we take second of april and
we keep going till we get to the 20th of
April where our final price is five and
our final moving averages 7.95 next is
Oscorp new symbol price 22 moving
average resets and starts computing a
new moving average for us and the final
moving average files called 13.95 so if
we head back to our presentation will
take this sequel statement apart and
look at it in a bit more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
