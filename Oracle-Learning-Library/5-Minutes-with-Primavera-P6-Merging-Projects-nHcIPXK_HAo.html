hi this is Jamie from Oracle primavera
today we'll see how to merge projects in
Primavera p6 in certain situations it
might be useful to combine two or more
projects that are related making it
easier to manage shared resources
relationships and activities all in one
place on the activities page I have two
projects that share certain WBS nodes
and have activity relationships between
projects as a project manager it might
be easier to combine these projects
organizing all of my activities and
resources under a unified heading first
navigate to the EPS page click the
Actions menu and select close all before
this video I exported the exterior and
interior projects if anything goes wrong
in the merging process I can simply re
import the original files to import
click actions and select XML project
import/export on the import tab click
browse I'm going to import the interior
project into the exterior project so
I'll select interior XML select update
existing project in the import action
section in the import to section select
the exterior project and click OK in the
baseline section select any project
baselines that you want to import click
the wrench icon next to choose template
here you can modify the selected
template if you merge projects often
you'll probably want to create an import
template that contains settings
appropriate for merging projects such as
updating your project calendars or
combining work breakdown structures in
the project data tab change WBS to keep
existing this will keep the existing
work breakdown structure and prevent any
duplicate WBS nodes from being imported
it will also maintain the sort order of
your WBS nodes once I change the
settings I'll click save as and name my
new import template merge projects
click import your interior project will
import to the exterior project once the
process completes open the exterior
project click activities on the
activities page I can see that the two
projects have been combined since I
chose to keep the existing work
breakdown structure activities with the
same WBS headings have been merged new
WBS headings have been imported on the
Gantt chart the connections between
related activities are visible and the
imported activities have maintained
their baselines since the projects have
merged I'll need to rename the top level
heading to reflect both interior and
exterior activities thank you for
watching five minutes with Primavera p6
