hefty SWAT and as I said bye bye bye
hands I'm running and I'm working in the
center of excellence in war so anemia
and primarily our background it's in
Fusion Middleware technologies but we
over the recent 10 years or 12 years now
we had a number of spatial and graph
projects and this is one of those which
I'd like to present to you today this is
a demonstrator and well maybe due to
explain this and to give a little bit
over overview how it all started because
it was kind of funny story so our
colleagues from from Australia and
actually few other customers shortly
after approaches I think 10 year if 10
10 10 months ago 9 months ago more or
less like that and I asked us if we
could help them to draft an architecture
for the social intelligence solution
what they meant by social intelligence
was they wanted to listen for the
internet communication public internet
communication social media and try to
inspect the traffic in a way to predict
some potentially very dangerous events
before they occur so obviously it
started like that and it starts with
with with several requirements that we
got from them obviously this is not very
popular types of solutions as you may
imagine but shortly after we received a
bunch of requirements from other
customers and it's all started to forget
some shape and we very soon agreed that
basically the purpose of this whole
project of this of the of this
demonstrator at that point in time now
in few weeks we are starting the pilot
project so the first phase of the fully
blown project so so this is something
more than this demonstrator and but we
very shortly agree that we want to have
a solution which is able to
automatically for to some extent
semi-automatically but some in a very
outset limited supervised dwai monitor
the internet traffic social media and
get the extract the information valuable
information out of the communication
internet communication
it helped us protect from ourselves and
protect and active between the Bourbon
falloon properly to the people who are
violating or acting kind against our
national interest as such so it all
started like that but very soon we found
out that it's not going to be that easy
so such a twit it's not going to happen
in reality so it's all started to be
really really complex and and we found
out that we need to really think a
little bit better on the on the solution
and how we want to inspect all the as
you can imagine now we have dozens if
not hundreds of social media networks
now we have dozens hundreds thousands
property of blogs which are posting
different potentially very dangerous
communication which are used by
terrorist organizations which are used
by different groups to act against our
national interest so we we we were a
little bit overwhelmed by number of data
and complexity of the project but we
decided okay so as we said we it all
started with a twit but it's much more
than that now so it all starts with a
tweet as in a single event as a piece of
communication exchange over the internet
but we very soon found out that it's
much more than that so first of all we
need to understand the profile of the
person who sent it with so basically who
who sent the prophet who send a message
what else that they said and was the
pattern for example of their
communication so is there something
specific is there something dangerous or
this is something that may be a synonym
maybe some sort of early alert or from a
red flag before something else would
happen so this is something we which
which was core and in the core of the
analysis but we soon found out that
obviously we need to put it in context
so we need to take the fur the infidel
for the the messages as they arrive to
the system and try to extract as many
entities by entities I mean all the
potentially very important data
which is hidden very often inside the
communication and here probably many of
you will immediately think about natural
process natural language processing her
firm Algar it's and since maybe not
augur is but modules to do an LP staff
so i will get back to this in a second
but that was very complex and and and
and very important to us to get as many
details from the messages so like places
like locations like coordinate
everything what could be of use for for
us for the for the later stages of of
the analysis and shortly after we found
out that obviously dealing with this
kind of information without showing and
and and and illustrating the
relationships between people and izing
the relationships between people won't
give us that much so so relationships
like the circle of the of or the
nine-year neighborhood of the other
particular potentially already
identified as a dangerous person it's
very important who is influencing this
person who is influenced by this person
what what may be even more important so
basically did those kind of analysis we
were we were trying to to put into the
requirements or at least we were trying
to and at that point in time for see in
the social okay so but now probably many
of us will start to wonder why but but i
think you hear especially in boston i
took this for purpose so you do have
much more than much more than probably
this a single statement of and this this
evidence to prove that it's important so
specifically for for the Boston Marathon
there was report which was published I
think shortly after which which which
clearly stated that there were
opportunities we were simply not
prepared to further further use and
efficiently share this information
properly for those who are with from
from from Europe from from from ania we
just recently had well not extremely
recently but it was some time ago but
it's a relatively fresh story that's one
person from recruited the others over
the over the social media channels
because the recruiting activity is very
popular there so obviously someone will
not set up a very complex terrorist
attack using the public posts on some
blogs but recruiting activities and
other activities to organize people to
set up some some some public events
riots or or or or potentially some some
some others not dangerous stuff this is
this is very frequent so this person
posted the move posted some some some
some messages then he he set up a bomb
killing four people in Stockholm shortly
after at that point time we were not
aware those those two cases are related
in a sort of way this person if the
other person are it also fatally shot
from two US soldiers in Frankfurt and as
they found out later on those two
incidents were connected very tightly
connected and again we we are
questioning how many of those are there
we don't know and so that's that's
that's why we are doing this but think
about social media wouldn't be if I
think it will be oversimplification of
of the matter because obviously of the
agency's intelligence agencies have
their own resources I can speak for some
of the customers I work with in the
recent several months and they all want
to use their own data sources and merge
the data made the results with the with
the results coming from the social
intelligence systems like this one so
this is not only about social media this
is not only about social networks this
is about using this knowledge in this
information and sharing the the
information from from
across the agencies to make sure that
everybody knows about the things they
should know but very soon we found out
once we started the design of the
demonstrator will found out that there
are few challenges we we need to face so
scalability obviously with one of them I
will get back to this in a moment
understanding so how we can understand
the the for the natural language
obviously if all those all these
different languages very often people
are using different acronyms different
synonyms for phone phone for for calling
different people different organizations
so this this all started to be very very
very complex but I'll get back to this
in a moment collaboration was another
change wanted to make sure that agencies
can collaborate but doing in the way
they would like to collaborate so not
sharing all the information but sharing
only the relevant for the others and and
setting the right rules and the
privilege is 4444 the agencies and
procedures to share the information and
knowledge between them security and
application diversity obviously deserve
the very very obvious and challenges
security so how we can share this
information how we can secure and for
this database and and all the technology
that Oracle provides gives us more than
enough capabilities to protect the
information in right way and application
diversity so again those agencies had
already some solutions some some tools
that we're using so we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
