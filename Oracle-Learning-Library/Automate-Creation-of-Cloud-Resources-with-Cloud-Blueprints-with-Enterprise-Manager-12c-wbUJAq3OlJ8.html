cloud blueprints if you use the Oracle
Enterprise Manager cloud management
capabilities then you already know how
easy it is to create and retire compute
resources like databases and Java
servers using the Enterprise Manager GUI
you can create managed cloud resources
like Oracle virtual machine servers
Oracle database servers either in the
form of a single database schema or full
database instance Oracle WebLogic
servers or testing servers all your
works such as creating new cloud
services can be done using the GUI so to
create a database instance I'd pick a
template that represents the kind of
database I want and then answer a few
other questions but sometimes you want
to automate the creation of such cloud
resources especially if you want to
create a set of interdependent resources
and especially if you'll need to do this
many times that's what cloud blueprints
are for for instance suppose you want to
create a set of interacting cloud
resources needed for an application and
the database that it accesses the
resources involved our web server and
application deployed into it a web
server data source and the database it
refers to with a GUI you'd need to
request creation of the Oracle WebLogic
server and oracle database both of those
can be created in parallel periodically
check the status of the creation
requests once the weblogic server is
created you can request application
deployment to it and once both the
weblogic server is created and there is
a database to refer to you can request
je data source creation this is fine if
you're doing it once and know what
you're doing but suppose you have a set
of QA engineers who each need to create
such
oops every few days Claude blueprints
let you automate process one person
authors the blueprint and everyone else
uses it whenever they need a new set of
instances this is the blueprint i'm
going to deploy blueprints are
declarative a blueprint isn't a script
rather it describes the desired result
in that way the blueprint processing can
orchestrate creating resources as
efficiently as possible it'll create
resources in parallel if it can and for
those that must be serialized it will
start creating dependent resources as
soon as the ones on which they depend
are finished another screencast demos
blueprint authoring this one shows how
to use it I'll do this from Windows but
you can do so from most any OS to deploy
a blueprint you just run the blueprint
processor and specify the blueprint file
you also have to enter the Enterprise
Manager URL depending on the blueprint
you may have to enter parameter values
to in this case the blueprint was
defined with two parameters blueprint
authors use parameters so that each user
can create blueprint to find resources
with variations supported by the
blueprint in our case we're asked to
specify the zone in which to create the
Oracle database and the password set for
the QA user I'll take the defaults set
by the blueprint author now blueprint
evaluation in resource creation begins
the processing is represented in a
vertical timeline our blueprint creates
for cloud resources so our timeline has
four columns each column represents a
resource in the state's it goes through
in the process of being created typical
creation steps or states are evaluating
the resource definition expressions
pending when evaluation can't be
completed until other resources are
reading issuing the create request and
waiting for completion and a final state
of success here we can see that the
blueprint processor determined it can
create the database and web server in
parallel deployment of the app and
creation of the data source can't begin
until the web server is fully created
after some time we see the web server
creation was successful so now creation
of the app deployment can proceed but
the data source is still blocked it
refers to the database resource and so
can't be created until the database and
references is ready
after a couple minutes application
employment is complete but the database
creation is still in progress a few
minutes later database creation
completes so creation of the data source
can start
once all resources are created the
blueprint processing wraps up summary
information includes the elapsed time
taken to create each resource and
overall CPU time there's also an option
to generate a report like this which
shows the blueprint structure including
the four resource definitions
interdependencies and dataflow the final
state of each resource is shown
highlighted in red or green clicking on
a resource like this application
deployment resource takes you to a
summary of all its attribute values at
the time of creation so that's an
overview of Oracle cloud blueprints and
how to deploy one for more information
