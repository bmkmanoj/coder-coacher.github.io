hi my name is Phoebe ha I am a creek on
developer at Oracle in this demo I will
show you what weapon rules can do and
how to create a simple web form rule the
travel request app application we will
use for this demo automates a simple
process for submitting and approving
travel expenses the employee submits a
travel request and approval rules
determines whether this request is menu
approval by the manager based on the
total travel request amount if the
manager rejects the request it goes back
to the employee otherwise it is approved
and the request is saved let's take a
look at how this application will look
to the end user assume you have deployed
the travel request application let's log
into the business process workspace as I
honey I employee from the application
view he selects travel request process
to kick off the process the travel
request form opens he has to fill in his
name the date trip details such as where
he is going and why and expense details
such as expected airfare and hotel
expenses you can recognize some basic
platform design elements here such as
text fields tabs drop-down menus and
radio buttons it's not obvious from
looking at the form but several fuse
have web forum rules making this a
dynamic web form let's explore this ruse
one by one for example there are rules
that dynamically populates the list of
the options in both the country and city
drop-down menus based on current values
in the database in fact the city fields
dynamically populate
the list of cities based on the value
you've chosen in the country field there
is another word for rule that displays
the customer name field if and only if
you choose customer visit so you can
enter the customer name and there is
also a firm rule that automatically
calculates total amount based on the sum
of the malls you enter on the expense
details tab in fact you cannot manually
input a value in the total amount field
that field is grayed out only the Rue
can write you that field these are just
a few examples of what web forum rules
can do in this demo you've seen that
work phone rules can dynamically
populate the list of options in a
drop-down menu display fuse when certain
options are selected and perform
calculations you can also use web forum
rules to pre-populate views in the forum
based on the current user clear old
views in a form with a single click and
much more now that you have a basic
understanding of what but firm rules can
do I'd like to show you how simple it is
to create a rule specifically the route
that displays the customer name field
when the user selects the customer visit
option in business process composer
assume you have created a travel request
form and add is a fuse shown here not is
that the default setting for the
customer name field has been said to not
visible this meant that but he fought it
will not be displayed recall that you
want this field to be visible if the
user selects customer visit to create
web form drew start by clicking the
rules button to open the rules editing
page click the plus sign to create a new
rule
name the rule and type a brief
description to remind you what this
route does
in the roof you'd enter the JavaScript
code to make the customer name field
visible if customer visit is selected
first check whether the customer visit
option has been selected in the purpose
of visit field if so set a visible
property of the customer name field to
chew otherwise set it to false to test
how the room works click the test button
in the purpose of visit field select
training the customer name field should
not show up now select customer visit
the customer name field appears your web
form brew works hopefully you not
understand what web firm rules can do
and how to create a simple web form room
and Phoebe her thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
