hi I'm Mike Williams and I'm a principal
curriculum developers for Oracle in this
demo I show you how to use the bookmark
feature of the Oracle Learning Library
the bookmarking feature of the Oracle
Learning Library allows you to save
links to learning content that you want
to refer back to the next time you visit
the site so shown here is the homepage
for the Oracle Learning Library at the
top of the page to see a toolbar in the
middle here we have the bookmarks button
that you can click on to access the
feature however you have to be logged in
to do that so currently i'm not so if i
click on the button i'm taken to a login
page so you can either set up an account
or login with the account you already
set up before is the requirement to use
the bookmark feature that you both have
an account and you're logged in
otherwise it won't work so make sure you
have you've created an account you're
logged in to use the bookmarking feature
okay now i'm logged in to the Oracle
Learning Library let's say I don't have
a lot of time and I want to search for
some stuff that I want to look at later
so I'm going to use the bookmark feature
so let's say I want Java content so if i
put java in the search bar and hit enter
then i get us do a search there are some
items that might be of interest though
this one looks good so I'm going to
click on that link and then here's the
information on that content looks like
it's a video and there's the title
description and it was here I can
bookmark it just by clicking on this
bookmark like so I click on that then I
get a little message here indicating
that that's been added so I'm going to
jump back to the search and let's say oh
I like this one too so I'm going to
click on that once again see the title
the description and I have a little
bookmark link there so I'm going to
choose that one too and then let's see
I'm going to go back to the homepage
those items were their individual pieces
of content these like these highlighted
options here with icons they're actually
series so if I click on this one you'll
notice that the individual content items
don't have a bookmark lake but at the
top of the page you'll see I can get the
whole series simply by clicking on the
bookmark link there so now that series
this bookmark so now if I click on the
bookmarks button here we are we've got
all everything that I clicked I've gotta
bookmark saved and so now anytime I come
in and log into Oracle Learning Library
I can access those pieces of content and
just jump right to it so that's how
bookmarks work on the Oracle Learning
Library
well that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
