welcome to the sequel developer demo
series this demonstration will be on
sequel developers database copy feature
and we'll be using it to copy the
contents of the HR schema to another
schema in my database
to get started you'll navigate to the
Tools menu and select database copy this
is a wizard driven interface we will be
asked to supply the location of where
the data is coming from and where we are
writing to the source connection can be
any account in the source database that
has the necessary select privileges on
the objects and data that we want to
copy and the destination schema needs to
be for the user or schema that we wish
to write to we have several options for
copying the data out we have objects
copy which allows me to pick and choose
across schemas schemas copy allows me to
choose entire schemas and Tunes
consolidate multiple schemas into a
single one in the destination or I can
copy at the tablespace level we also
have the ability to copy just the object
structure or just the object data or
both you'll notice the default is to
grab both so we'll just go to the next
screen and now we're going to tell
sequel developer what types of objects
we want to copy I want to copy just my
tables views indexes triggers aims
constraints you'll also notice at any
point we have the option of saying no
more options just jumping to the end of
the process and let me start the copy we
now need to tell sequel developer what
objects to copy if we skip the screen
that will by default grab everything in
the source connection schema I can enter
a search string here by default we
wild-card that with the % symbol so I
mean you no need to enter the block our
characters as it brings back objects you
can select those and bring them to the
right this will create
exclusive filtered list of objects for
the copy if you want to go outside the
current schema select the more button
choose your schema or object type or
both search bring the object over we're
going to bring everything over in my
copy so I can basically just leave this
screen blank what I do want to do
however is specify the data that I want
copied I don't want to copy all my
employee records just employees making
less than $10,000 so I will employ the
filter again to find an object to bring
it down to this dialog and now I'm going
to apply a wear condition clause against
the data and only copy employees your
salary is less than 10,000 I can hit the
Go button here to validate the query to
make sure that the data looks correct
notice that the where clause here does
not actually have the we're just
immediately type the predicate condition
and we're now ready to do the copy you
want to make sure that your options here
are set correctly so you don't
accidentally truncate or drop objects
that you're not one to and when I click
the next or the finish button here this
will start the script and when it's
finished we will get a log of everything
that happens so I can validate look for
any error messages that came back and
then we can open up our destination
schema refresh the table list drill into
my table and we can validate that the
right data was copied along with
everything else so I'll just do a quick
salary less than 10,000 that's a greater
than 10,000
there we go it's a null set and that's
database copy thank you for your time
today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
