rapidly automate business processes in
the cloud let's look at a simple process
that request approval and highlight some
basic features used to create this
business process application the
application menu lists all the
components you can add to a process
application one key component is the
process itself which defines the overall
tasks and events in a structured process
flow swimlanes visually display the role
responsible for performing each task in
the process click the role name to
easily change the default name in this
sample app the submitter starts the
process by filling out a form and then
sending the request for approval the
reviewer can approve or reject the
request if approved the request is
fulfilled and the process is completed
if rejected the request goes back to the
submitter who can add more details or
justification and then submit it again
to build and modify a process simply
drag and drop human tasks events and
gateways from the pallet to the process
rename activities add sequence flows
reposition elements and delete anything
that you don't need open the properties
pane to define the implementation
details for each activity in the process
the submit request activity requires a
form which collects input from the user
and starts the process you can search
for an existing form create a new one or
edit the form already attached to the
submit activity drag and drop form
controls from the palette to the canvas
select a control and use the properties
to define its behavior and style such as
setting the date format and changing the
display name gateways like this one
control the process flow based on
whether the request is approved or
denied you define the conditions that
determine which path the process will
follow
testing your application lets you play
the process by stepping through each
activity and seeing the results or try
it in test mode where you can test each
part of the process for each roll save
your changes publish the application and
then activate it for real-world users
after you activate the process
application use the administration
controls to assign the appropriate roles
such as reviewer or submitter to your
users before anyone can start the app
view details and get assigned to task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
