data database log writer and the impact
on OLTP response times and also the
impact it tends to happen on the affect
of a total system associated with going
through middleware layers and just show
you some examples of what can happen in
a real world system and we do see in
real world systems but are very rarely
correctly diagnosed and it's importantly
you do actually look at these things
because a lot of variability in your
response time maybe an impact of just
basically the log writer not being able
to perform correctly so let's think
about how the Oracle database is
structured and and what the log writer
does well the log writers role is to
basically write commit records and write
enough information to recover
transactions this is done too by the
redo log and there's just one process
that does this and it's called the log
writer and when a user process wants to
commit it posts the log writer to write
away the redo information associated
with the transaction and a commit record
with that in mind it means that the user
process is but often in a wait state
waiting for the log writer to do that
right
the log writer will do that right as
fast as possible and whilst that's going
on the user process is in a state and a
wait event known as a log file sync now
many people say that log file sync is
the most common weight event and they
try and fix the log file sync wait event
rather than looking at the root cause of
the problem and usually the problem is
one of two folds there's two reason why
they're in log file sync one is that the
Reiter is taking a long time to write
the log to disk and the second thing is
is if the log writer has to wake up a
lot of processes having done the log
right you may find that you're waking up
more processes than there are CPUs on
the system in which case we get into an
over subscriptions case which we've
demonstrated in other real world videos
so with that in mind I'd like you to
look at a system that has got some
pathological log logging problems and
this look at the demo screen that we
have here you'll notice that we've got
almost a square-shape wave and this is
not an accident we've manufactured this
for you and what's happening is we're
running a workload and Orient's of time
the workload is running just fine and
then at a point of time the workload
almost falls down to zero what you also
notice that in the application
performance when the response time gets
high is correlated with the time where
the throughput drops now what I really
wanted to show to you is what we can see
in the red the red is the database
response time increasing and that's as a
result of we're seeing high log file
sinks but what I'd like to show you you
see is is what's happening in the
application server we're getting this
multiplication or amplification effect
that a small increase in response time
at the database gets multiplied through
the app server so being at the bottom of
the stack like the log writer is if it
basically gets a slow IO right or
struggles to get scheduled there's a
fair chance that any response time
changes or degradation Zoar Delta's at
the bottom of the stack by the time
you've got out to the web browser this
will have been multiplied through and
this is because we have as just a series
of loosely coupled systems queuing
requests and all layers of the
application all waiting for something to
happen
now if the thing at the bottom is
delayed everybody gets delayed and so
this is why we get this amplification
effect and this is seen very often
in real-world systems where we have
shared storage where the storage is
being shared amongst multiple databases
in fact may be shared between database
applications it may be shared amongst
Microsoft Exchange servers it may be
other applications that are logging data
it may be a file system because today
the reality is that in many large
corporations storage is just seen as a
space to store things it is administered
by storage administrators who do their
allocations on the basis of space they
allocate space for a database or they
allocate space for log files and they're
allocating space they very rarely make
the decisions on the basis of
performance so let's have a look and see
what happens when the impact which is
when we share storage particularly when
we share the storage associated with our
redo log files
so in this workload will be getting this
square-shape workload you can see that
when there's a performance problem in
the CPM we're all stuck in log file sync
it also stitches is another important
lesson that if we actually start looking
at the log writer statistics that the
log file sync the time spent in log file
sync is usually the time spent on a log
far right times the number of users on
the system so here you can see we've a
millisecond we have approximately a
hundred or in fact 96 so 100 connections
just over a hundred connections to the
database and you can see that
approximately the log file sync is
approximately a hundred times that we
have on the log file right
in term times as we get into the
situation where the log file right
becomes more variable and in fact we've
got log rights that are taking more than
a second you can see that this gets
tends to get multiplied through however
the thing to also note about this system
that the log file right statistical
average is really good it's under a
millisecond but we know we still got a
system in trouble so the statistical
average time
for log file sync and write times are
very good and this is another thing to
be wary of if you read your aw our
reports that you may have a race
condition or something going on in that
hour of our report that the aw our
report were pertaining but it may be you
may have a statistical outlier that
happens for five minutes out of that
hour but that will all get rounded down
by the averaging process when you look
at an aw our report so it's important to
get them up on Enterprise Manager and
look at it ash reports and look at the
spikes now in this workload that we've
got here we've artificially made the log
writer slow by having another database
continually checkpoint and do a lot of
i/o to the same disks that we write redo
- as a result the log writes are getting
slower and slower and in fact some of
the log writes and you can see we've got
ten of them over a second so whilst I've
been running ten of the seconds the data
phase has been effectively stalled now
on a high-volume OLTP system this is
pretty much closer as close to an outage
as you're going to get now let's think
about what actually happens in
real-world systems on shared storage
basically the storage administrator will
have given the DBA a series of Lunz not
based on performance requirements but
based on disk space now those lumps may
be sharing disks with all sorts of other
applications now those applications may
checkpoint from time to time they may be
dumping writing a load of log files they
may be periodically so very often we see
on real-world systems at the top of the
hour when people are running reports or
checkpoints and things like that the log
writer slows down this is because
literally the log writer slows down
because the rights are slowed down and
we see higher log file sync at the top
of the hour because the writes have
slowed down and this is exactly what
we're seeing here this is not a really a
good way to run an OLTP system but it's
something what we see a lot of now to
actually solve this problem
there's multiple ways to solve it some
we would not recommend some are
inevitable two ways to solve the problem
one of the first ways we can actually
solve the problem and it's not something
we would recommend is to not actually
synchronize with your commit and do an
asynchronous commit we see a lot of
people doing this in benchmarks and PRCs
because they want to raise the
throughput level but when we start doing
asynchronous commits it means that we
tell the application we've committed but
there's no guarantee that we would have
actually committed the log so you've
noticed I've just put in asynchronous
committing and you can see that we can't
even trust log file sync or the log file
parallel right because it doesn't
actually mean anything to us at this
point in time because the user processes
are not weighted on log file sync
they're just going to write the commit
record into the redo buffer and then
just hope the log writer catches up and
as a result you can see on this trace
there are no log file sync weight events
because nobody's waiting on it we're
keeping the CPU busy now in a minute
what we're going to do is we're going to
see the i/o storm created by the other
database so it still actually starts to
slow the workload down but the reason it
starts to slow down now at this point in
time is that we're actually seeing the
redo log buffer filling up okay and so
we're backing up on the redo buffer log
buffer space okay so it's not exactly
solve the problem at this point in time
but it certainly made it less bad than
it was before but potentially we're
affecting the transactional integrity of
the application other solutions would be
to just put the redo logs on their own
dedicated disks now my experience when
asking this from storage i/o
administrators is usually one of
radicular out of the room you say you
want me to allocate specific disk drives
for you and they're not really very keen
on doing that in fact it's got so
ludacris within our industry in many
cases the DBAs can
pío to get dedicated storage for the
redo logs quicker than they can get the
storage administrators to give them
dedicated storage so in many cases we
find that the DBA teams are raising POS
for flash devices and solid-state
devices to put their redo logs on and
they say oh all our performance problems
went away because we got flash devices
and he goes no you didn't get it because
it was flash devices it's because it was
exclusively your device you never had to
share it okay
flash devices are fast but in many cases
they're not the reason why things went
on it was because they could get
predictable right performance from their
log writer and that was the key to the
performance and as you can see you know
asynchronous techniques are not working
here so let's turn off the asynchronous
commit and let's talk about other
options within Oracle to get fast load
times now one of the challenges and the
reasons why storage administrators don't
like to give exclusive storage to redo
logs is it is that they're very often
incentives about maximizing utilization
of all the disks and getting the space
filled optimally okay and because that
impacts their cost of storage and the
cost of operations we have the same
concept also within Exadata where people
are actually using the Exadata storage
for both logging and database files and
they're sharing and striping everything
across all the volumes and all the cells
and within Exadata we can actually
manifest this same problem but within
Exadata we've been able to innovate our
way around the problem because Exadata
storage has both disk drives but it also
has flash devices inside it so the way
Exadata solves a problem of erratic log
performance is to write to both the log
disk as well as the flash device at the
same time and take the write back from
the one
that comes back first so if we think
about that we basically get the best of
both worlds if the log right to disk is
fast we come back quickly
if however it's an outlier because the
disk is so busy the right to flash
memory it'll return suitably quickly as
well so let's put apply flash lodging to
this workload and see what the impact on
performance is you can see that we've
gone back and we're back in the erratic
state so let's turn flash logging on I'm
going to apply it now and turn that on
and what I'm also going to do is I'm
gonna clear I'm gonna clear down some
statistics so I can find them
yeah okay so I've now turned on flash
logging and we've now I've zeroed out
all the statistics that we had on the
right hand side here and what the first
thing to notice is we're not seeing when
the i/o storms come in we're not seeing
the outliers in the right times so let's
wait for the next i/o storm to come
along and see what happens
you'll notice that basically the log
right time is now in just over a quarter
of a millisecond and the log file sync
time is under a millisecond and we're
now approaching the point where the next
log storm is IO storm is going to hit us
from the other database but the thing to
notice is we're not generating many
outliers with their log times are either
in a quarter of second there's a few but
we're not seeing the ones at one second
as a result we're barely seeing a glitch
at all and in fact what we're starting
to see is transactions starting to
degrade because the reads are taking
longer so at this point we've started to
smooth out all the performance problems
associated with erratic log times and if
we actually look at the response time
when we had erratic log times you can
see we each iteration we're smoothing
these things out over and over again so
in a second we're going to come hit the
next Io storm and you'll notice it's
coming a lot smoother
and it's barely detectable at this point
the fact that there is an IO storm
taking place but it's not impacting the
system there you can just see a tiny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
