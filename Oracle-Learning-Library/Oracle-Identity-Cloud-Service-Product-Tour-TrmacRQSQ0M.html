both cloud and on-premises applications.
Employees, contractors, customers and
partners require user accounts for all
of these applications. These accounts
aren't usually synchronized, and a user
may have to authenticate multiple times
to access each application. Oracle
Identity Cloud Service is a
comprehensive security and identity
platform that allows you to integrate
both cloud and on-premises applications
with single sign-on, and adds a
sophisticated layer of security to the
authentication process. There are
multiple ways to configure Oracle
Identity Cloud Service so that users can
access their applications through single
sign-on. The app catalog allows you to
use Oracle Identity Cloud Service with
other cloud services and has templates
to simplify integrations with your
applications.
if you develop your own applications
then you can use the software
development kits that come packaged with
Oracle Identity Cloud Service to enable
your applications to authenticate with
it. These SDKs are available for common
programming languages. In addition to the
app catalog, you can use Oracle Identity
Cloud Service's applications feature to
add other applications such as mobile,
trusted, and SAML applications.
Trusted applications run on a protected
server, while mobile applications like
Android or iPhone applications, run on
environments outside of your control. Use
SAML applications when you want your
users to use single sign-on to access
their content. Another way to secure your
applications is with secure form fill
which stores and encrypts user
credentials so they can sign into their
applications automatically without
having to enter their credentials. Users
and groups are managed through the
identity cloud service console where you
can add and assign users and groups
manually, or you can import them. Each
user receives a welcome email which
allows them to activate their account
and provide a password according to the
criteria defined in the password policy.
If you prefer to manage users from an
external identity source, then Oracle
Identity Cloud Service provides
directory integrations. For example if
users are stored in a local
authoritative repository, such as
Microsoft Active Directory,
use the bridge. The bridge provides a
link between your enterprise directory
structure and Oracle Identity Cloud
Service. It can communicate with the
directory structure so that any new
updated or deleted user or group records
are transferred into Oracle Identity
Cloud Service. So if you assign users to
groups in Microsoft Active Directory, the
bridge will assign the users to the
appropriate groups in Oracle Identity
Cloud Service. Your users and groups will
be synchronized between them. By default, users can sign into Oracle Identity
Cloud Service with their usernames and
passwords. You can increase the security
of your Oracle Identity Cloud Service
environment by enabling some additional
security verifications during the
authentication process. Use multi-factor
authentication, or MFA, if you want your
users to provide something other than
their usernames and passwords to verify
their identity. This can include a
passcode that sent to the users mobile
phone or email address, or security
questions. You can also define criteria
that it uses to determine whether to
allow or deny user access. You can
prevent access for users who are in an
unsecured Network area, or you can grant
access only to single sign-on for those
in a secure area. In addition to allowing
users to sign into Oracle Identity Cloud
service with their local credentials, you
can enable your users to log in with
external credentials like your local
intranet repository. You enable the
sign-in page to contain the option to
log in using local intranet credentials.
As a result, your users can use these
credentials to access applications that
use the Oracle Identity Cloud Service
authentication mechanism. Oracle Identity
Cloud Service also allows users to log in
using credentials from common social
networks.
Finally, you can run reports that capture
data about Oracle Identity Cloud Service
users and applications. You can view
users who have logged into Oracle
Identity Cloud Service successfully as
well as users who didn't. You can also
see how many times users accessed Oracle
Identity Cloud Service and their
applications, as well as their privileges.
