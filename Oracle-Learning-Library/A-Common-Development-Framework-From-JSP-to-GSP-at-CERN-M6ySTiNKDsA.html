today to present you this verse of a
feather call a common development
framework from JSP to GSP at CERN how
many of you know what is turn or is here
and how many of you is here because he
wants to know more about certain just
that okay that's great we were
suspecting this okay so basically today
we are going to present you the world
will have been doing the last two years
in a protocol a 20 framework AS IS the
vast information see a system section
which W I belong so he and I we will
present due to different topics today
I'm basically this is an effort that we
have took a couple of years ago to
improve the service we provide to the
rest of the CERN so certain is the
European laboratory for nuclear research
and basically it's a physic laboratory
so from the IT point of view we
basically provide services and we
specifically administrative services so
as part of that this presentation is
only focusing on our board so there are
mass I mean there are many poets trend
that deals with Java technology and with
other technologies but here we will only
see the technologies we use and how we
use it in this technological framework
so the object is of the section how the
session are just to provide you just a
technical vision how we face this
problem a couple of years ago because
it's not like one day you wake up and
you think well I have to the framework
we had some problems in maintaining
applications and you know some problems
when organizing the things just because
it was not consistent at that point that
the the options that we took 20 years
ago to develop the software we have are
not anymore body that doesn't mean that
the application doesn't work I mean all
the applications work and they were fine
but we want updates ourselves to be able
to face the next 20 years so probably in
20 years we will be here again you know
talking about some other thing
is who knows so we will give you this
this overview of the Java technology we
use and in particular and the objective
to you see grace and GWT not many people
as far as we know as far as we are
concerned are using these two together
but well you will see that we use them
and we use them in an effectively way
and so far we are showing with you this
this work here and at the end if we have
time we would like to discuss with you
guys about the opportunities that are
offered on top of the GBM to work with
some other languages groovy which is the
core of grace but also closer and Scala
we have been doing prototypes and you
know try different things in order to
have something really stable and mature
to be able to put the applications in
production so far we have more than five
application using this framework and
well we are happy with it and this is
how we are going to do it this is
handmade rough we still like paper even
though we are in 2012 so basically as
you see on the top left we have certain
well for those of you that want to know
more debate will be given a little
introduction about what is the aim of
CERN what are they its goals and well
some specific data about the spear
immense and you know this big
accelerator and well maybe at the end if
you want to know we can answer you if we
are going to destroy the world not
principle we are not on and then he will
be giving you an overview on the
technology that we have 20 years ago
that we are still have and what were the
steps we took in order to come to this
three point here which is the framework
and here we giving you some you know
specific data information about what is
for us this framework what are the
artifacts that we providing it to make
it you know reliable and twist the
development processes in order to have a
consistent approach in all of our
applications at Indian FSA we can
discuss a bit what is your experience if
you have similar experiences with these
technologies for
some others in you know the issues we
found when we create this framework and
I'm sure you find the same ones you know
so where I'm Jose vobis I'm Spanish yes
you do you get it by the name and minus
or engineer and I work for sure now in
the project project planning and
resource management section that
basically provides the service to all
all the groups so like that they can
plan and you know know how much does it
cost to have 200 and 500 not 2500 staff
members that sell for example so we deal
with the planning applications and so
you will know more details with a bit
you hear me yeah okay good well as far
as i said i'm working with him in the
same section but I think already working
at seven for the last five years and
before this I was working more in
another frame were actually to do the
analysis of the LHC data and I'll give
you a rough introduction to sin so that
you actually know the scope of the
problems we have and i'm going to give
you an introduction of why we chose the
path that we're going to introduce and
baggage will give you the technical
details at the end so this is the first
part actually i do this introduction way
longer many times you can sign my guide
at Sam and I always like to ask one
question is how many of you know head of
send the first time because of the
angels and demons noble or horror film
not many that's good because I get a lot
of this okay that's good so basically
I'm going to go through three points
first I'm going to show you what it is
how big it is what we do and what sort
of technologies we use at all levels and
then I'll be a little bit more specific
on on the software and the computing
that we do and then i will show you
where we work and what are the sort of
things that we actually do on the daily
basis so first in 18 in Switzerland sin
is an international organization and
it's set up in it's based in Geneva and
actually in France
but now if it's not if it's easy to see
or not maybe I can point or something
yeah then point is there doesn't work
but you see the airport do you see the
circle is easy to see more or less
that's the LHC that you might have heard
of it the machine that wants to destroy
the world and all the stuff and this is
27 kilometres long of the diameter it's
about eight kilometers of the perimeter
I think and you see the small circles if
it's possible and those are the four
collision points those are the four main
experiments of the elite see there are
more and actually that's and we don't
know we don't only do the LHC we do a
lot more things but this is the most
famous one and you can get a rough
impression of how it is looking at the
size of the airport so send what is the
business of sin sin main business is
doing science and it's all about physics
fundamental research and basically what
we do mainly is accelerate particles so
we we accelerate them very very to a
very very high speed and we basically
give it a lot of energy and then we
collide these particles and do you know
the formula the famous formula for Mason
a while e equals MC squared that
basically means energy is the same as
mass so if you have to imagine two
protons in the case of VDC and you you
smash them and they have one big energy
another big energy the total sum is
what's going to generate Nima's so we're
going to have new particles that they
don't exist and for this what we do is
once they collide we take a picture like
with a camera and did we do it in the
detector can you guys see the guy in the
detector so you can imagine the size of
this of these machines okay and a
detector how it works is basically like
the camera than you that you have that
you take a picture of the thin and you
actually captured the energy in in the
cameras you have your caption light but
here you can capture radiation or you
can capture different things okay and I
mean looking at the size of the things
you can imagine that one Elias all the
data in these collisions you're going to
need a lot of power computer
power and this is one of the biggest
challenges one of the main challenges we
have which is the the analysis of these
two of these data I don't know if you
are aware but we already presented some
data some results like a few months ago
and yeah and the machine has been
running only for a couple of years two
years and a half I think so that's
pretty fast and what we have is
something that we call the grid which is
a huge infrastructure and we pass their
the data to analyze and it's going to
distribute over the world and then
resend the data and the results but
that's a rough introduction if you want
to know more I can always tell you if
you find me in the covered so one of the
things we do that we are very proud of
is that we actually try to push
technology to the limits and we do this
in several fields you can see here in
the we do it in for example in
cryogenics where you know you have to
keep the Machine 2 minus 271 Celsius
which is like 2.7 Kelvin I don't know if
you are aware because here you use the
Fahrenheit so well I'm a little bit lost
well yeah and then we try to simulate
the commission at the beginning of the
universe who is we need we need this
because we need to actually do the
superconductive and this is the only
place in the world where you can do this
and now you need to be very very cold
but also in software we do this degree
this one example okay so now a little
bit of the organization where we are sin
has an average number of people about
10,000 11,000 every moment a turn and
you have pics of 15,000 and this is only
the people who are working at ten on
that particular moment you we have a lot
of collaborations with different
institutions and universities and we
actually need to have a lot of
initiative data and this is the
department we are in is the GS
department which is General Services and
as we are an international organization
we actually don't even have if we have a
fire the firefighters of Geneva they
cannot come into San because they would
be violating the route so we actually
have our fire fighters I don't know
which one it is our firefighters there
that they cannot go into Geneva and the
Geneva ones cannot come in so we
actually just to give you an idea of the
sort of things that we have to provide
and in our group which is called AAS
it's called advanced information systems
and we provide services as Bobby said
before mainly in the administrative
field we have five sections and some of
them do deal with the HR department some
of them do finance and we do project
management and actually an experiment
support for example one of the
applications we have is done to actually
plan the way we are going to deal with
the technical stops of the elite see so
we say we're going to stop it for two
weeks and we need this lots of work this
is what we have to change these the
people who can go who has received this
radiation and I cannot stay for a long
time and so on so on and the most
difficult thing is actually the workflow
because there is a lot of people who
have to approve different things and
it's a lot of the coordination where we
actually try to help so and in the frame
of this group we as Bobby said before we
are it's a group that is 20 years old
one of the things the career things of
densities is that we have a lot of
people going in and out and we have
different projects and many technologies
that are now much that we use at the
same time so the things are getting a
little bit difficult to maintain and for
people who are coming newcomers it's
getting difficult for them to learn all
the new projects and especially we are
changing all the time it takes you time
to be productive so with a lot of the
people who are in this group we are
participating in what we call the AAAS
20 project which is a project that is
going to run over the next 2-3 years I
think and it's been running all ready
for two and we try to improve the
services that we do and one of the main
outputs is this framework that is going
to be not only a set of technologies
that we will use but also a methodology
and a process that we will follow so
that we can t quality and that we
guarantee that everyone does it the same
thing in the same manner ok so what
another thing we want to look at is if
the 20 years choices that we've been
doing are still valid and how we have to
deal with the future so now we'll go
more into the technology part it's only
three points and anger
show you what I said before the past
what we have decided to go from now on
and then how we will deal with the
processes so the first part is the past
as I said we had a lot of people coming
in and out and we actually try to let
people bring the experience they have
from outside and we want then we want to
motivate them to actually use new things
if as long as they are valid and the
problem is that if someone has take sats
10 for let's say five years and they
develop an application that is going to
be running for 10 years someone else
will have to maintain it and at some
point we have tools that are being
having running for the last 20 years so
we have really old technology that is
still there and the way we migrated this
is not always obvious so you can see
that for example we have I've eight I've
at ease and hibernate for the persistent
layer and we have different technologies
on the client and so on so on so we have
decided to move to only to a stack of
technologies one is Oracle application
Express and we have a lot of experts in
this field so we didn't want to throw
away this and we are using this software
to create applications that are not
going to be long term application so
they will be there for a few weeks a few
months maybe and we can be sure that
someone will be in charge of the whole
life of the application and for the rest
we will use a stack of technologies
based in Java that Bobby's will
introduce you to so the last part i want
to talk about is actually about the
process and the methodology we we want
to to use in in all the sections in our
group we want to use a scrum with the
daily meetings as you have might have
singing or there you know the talks we
plan our our sprint in in 2-3 weeks
depending on the availability of the
people and then we actually encourage a
lot of code reviews because again as I
said one of the main problems we have is
maintainability and learning so we think
this is the one of the best ways to do
it and we also have the continuous
integration that we do in bamboo I'm
doing a lot of free publicity of
atlassian know I always not a big deal
that we have it connected with the
clobber for code coverage and we also
connect all the software with sauna I
don't know if you're aware of genre but
you cannot
the different static code analysis one
of the most important ones is the check
style so that we guarantee that when you
change from one project to another you
more or less guess the same structure
and the same way of writing code and
then we also use PMD and find backs and
the last thing I want to mention is that
all the applications we have or at least
most of them are being analyzed
constantly and we do it with interscope
I don't know if you know winter scope
but it's basically you tell okay these
services they cannot last that much time
when they execute or we actually check
that the application is running and so
on so on and we are starting to
implement splunk which is a log analyzer
this is more or less the environment we
try to move forward it's almost there
but we still have to to implement it in
more places and now Bobby's will
continue with more technical details of
the framework thank you okay so we move
a little bit oh so a stab it says one of
the main artifacts producing this is 20
project is this framework and even
though is going to cover I will say 90
plus ninety five percent of the
applications we do this is still some
profit oracle applications that deals
with finance for example that we are not
going to substitute because well it has
been there for 20 years it works so
nobody wants to touch that you know and
it's working fine there's a company
behind so it's fine so here are
basically for the framework we decided
to go to a combination of technologies
that we think are the best to best fit
for what we have but i must say that we
have tried a lot of prototypes using
many other technologies so we'll give
you some requirements what we want to
the considerations to take into account
when you want to go in this process of
creating a framework and then we really
call the spring work from the
technological point of view which is
technologies plus the architecture and a
set of plugins that we have provide
inside this framework to help the
developers to create these applications
and then we will see some screenshots of
the application we often
we'll spend a bit what are they what is
the goal of them as one so basically
team of these policies to improve the
development process so when at the
global camps and wants to create a new
application from scratch he already have
he already has the basic components that
you are do you need let's talk let's say
the infrastructure components you will
you need in any way that we start when
we are talking about Java well in any
other terminology is the signal but this
particular applies to Java then the
second requirement was to improve the
quality i meant having maintainability
because I though it says people is
coming and going every three years or
five years depending on the contract
well there's some also some indefinite
contrast there but many people go go
after three or five years so the
documentation and the knowledge is
living with them so then you go and you
try to understand what it's been doing
there and you know we always have
problems like trying to too yeah
basically to understand what is in there
so we will also like to have the
commutation in the same place all the
documentation in the same place all the
way we do we deal with support I mean
everybody will do it the same way and
you know just try to serve this
consistency so what we did is basically
we create some reusable components that
are spreading this in this plugins and
we unify the processes and technologies
it has been applied to many sections
already but this is still some work
going on so the considerations for when
you think in a framework you should know
that it's not just I take a set of
patterns and we put them all together at
the seat this morning these guys talking
about auntie Pat Thursday they were
mentioning this you know like people
just say oh it's very good to have
pattern so let's put them all together
right so this is not how it works and
it's not just a collection of libraries
so this there is we believe that we
should do the things in the same way so
like what you see he's cold then I will
be able to understand it as possible
because sometimes we have to really
react to the needs of the laboratory so
we a couple
years ago we I did last year we were
asked to do a project to plan the the
launch suck down so is the the machine
the LSC is going to be shut down for a
year and a half and they didn't have a
tool really to plan all together you
know how the things were going to be
either were going to be allocation
problems I mean we have you know a
number of electricians and they cannot
be at the same time in the same place
you know so we we've been asked to
create a project and we did it in two
months with the with this and now it's
in production is working you know so in
the end we we were able to do it now so
apart from that we provide this platform
yeah that provides generate
functionality that's it and then here is
the technologies that we use and the
architecture so well as you see in the
picture basically we have been we have a
lot of Springs with Oracle and we're
happy with it in fact we will be
greatest as year to version 11 g and of
course on top of that we decided to go
for java for the Java Virtual Machine
because we have a lot of spirit isn't
that all the people which is part of the
group they know how to do it with it I
will say they have a good level of them
so it was no discussion on using some of
the technologies right because we also
have we have pearls perl scripts and you
know some little things are one but we
are trying to be great everything here
so this is time then for the server side
well based on this we wanted to keep you
know with language similar to java and
that's why we was not just a reason but
this is one of the main reasons why we
end up using rails how many of you know
grace or have try great ok that's very
good ok so you know that it's really a
framework that allows you to do a quick
web application and it's really powerful
and Ruby it's a powerful languages
language we have all the benefits from
haba from Java story when I say Java is
because haba which is how I his pain at
is Java so forget about that so is Java
so it also gives you the
dynamic capabilities and some functional
programming dolls and well no surprises
here this is what comes with girls so we
did what we did is to enhance this with
a set of plans and then for the client
side we choose GWT google web toolkit
how many of you know about this okay
less people that great but well
basically we believe that Google is
going to be there at least a couple of
years more so that they will maintain
this and they will not disappear and if
you don't know it what you do here is
you program java classes that in the end
everything will be compiled to
JavaScript and they will be sent to the
client side so then you can create a
rich Internet application released with
this and you can you know the bag and so
on is released filled with it at the
beginning can consume to be her it seems
to be hard to configure but once you
have it is really and everybody will be
doing java or groovy in the server side
so it's really what we want to have
something consistent and as unified as
possible then we also use from so which
is from this library which is called EXT
well this a jar scream person which is
called EXT so it basically provides you
with the set of pre-configure widgets
like trees and you know combo boxes and
so on so while we do this we did this
and we also put on top of that we have
some of these widgets and we create our
own for example we had a combo box but
we wanted to select a location an access
point to the LEC and there are more than
1000 access points in there so i will
show you later but we created what we
call the aes back so it's a kind of
combo box with some more features than a
normal one so this is what we have was
the main architecture and on top of that
we use these planes so everything is
started because this is a good thing to
know is that everything started as part
i mean once we choose the technology the
worst need to put it that even we had
prototypes we need to test it in a real
project
and I think that we mentioned this in
the beginning so we create a project
based on this which is called
intervention scheduling so when you as
Delhi TCS any other machine it needs to
be repaired from time to time and it
needs to be upgraded so we were asked
also to only for the LSC we were asked
to do you know kind of planning tool for
that what we did is to plan it was a
internal parade in our section in fact
we plan several sprints you know like
mixing the framework and the project so
in the end after i think it was four or
five months we end up with this
application and well it was used
successfully for for this period of time
but then i will show you another one
which is replacing this one because it
has been extended to to also take into
account the other facilities as soon as
the experiments and you know some some
of the facilities with the same purposes
as as you see here well now we have
emigrated the first version of the frame
or because when we started this we had
Grails 137 and authority it was the
version one makes something I don't
remember exactly but now we finish
migrating this to version two one grails
and DDOT 2x three weeks ago so we are
acting now the applications and so on
and so far i must say that this i mean
one you have the infrastructure that is
easy to be great and it's not taking too
much time so now what we have is three
core blinds to dto security tracking and
we also have this other forward we're
creating more I mean in grace is really
easy if you want to acknowledge some
things to your project you can do it
using the plugins mechanism and that's
what we did here so now we move it
forward so what is the dto so far you
still here with me yeah okay so we will
detail plugin well as you know Ruby
objects and java objects are not the
same so the
isn't it of transferring the information
or communicate one to another you can do
this in many ways you can see realize
how good you can send json strings I
mean you can do it in several ways but
as we choose GWT what we need is to
create this detail which stands for data
transfer objects and with a script
common which I praise your details and
what we get is from the domain objects
in grails we get DT object which is
which is a job object and with this we
send it to the lead electric line so
it's really we create this kind of
object with some metadata on top of it
that will help us with the visibility
with their worst of the fetching and we
use the city objects to communicate
between the server and the client side
so this book is the first problem that
you find when you try to join these two
technologies then we also have a plug-in
for security I mean security is very
important at CERN and we already have a
big infrastructure and a really solid
infrastructure in there and we don't
want you know in every parade to start
creating from scratch the security
aspects of that because it's risky and
and there's no need to invent anything
so what we need is to create a security
plugin basically adapting the Spree
security platinum which is available for
all of you in the grace library and
basically we did a thin layer of it that
allow us with submitting configuration I
mean this is a really an instruction on
that so with some little configuration
we can we can set what are the
authentication rules and what are the
translational strategies that we want in
there so this is a this is basically for
this cuticle in fact we're now moving to
the single sign-on because we have the
proprietary login system let's say
inside the group for our application so
now where we are going to move to the
single sign-on which is implemented all
around CERN and for us it's just going
to be we will have just to update the
plug-in and that's it this abstraction
is already there so all the applications
will
work just as that and then once you
communicate with the client I mean we
have the artifacts to send to the client
but we need the client to communicate
with the server also and you know in
grace you have the services and then you
have the controllers and the view and if
you get rid of the controllers because
to do this we wanted to use directly the
service so what we eat is to use the
dealership lying which is available also
for you and basically the idea of this
is to be able to make this communication
possible and yup so what we did do here
is we create I mean it comes with the
plugin but we danced it a bit so you DET
plugging the what it does is to create
the interface to be able to call the
service so with this plugin you are able
to call the normal great service as it
was from a controller engraved let's say
then with this plugin we also provide a
crowd service which is generic so you
can for free you can lead your your
modify or later your domain objects just
is telling this plugin then we also
implement a common pattern for the
conversation so you want to modify a
personal telephone number for example in
front the client side you press a button
you open the person but then there is a
conversation going on so we started
eating the object then we modify the
field then you can save it or rollback
and so on so we implement a common
pattern in there and what it works so
far and we also put in here the
internationalisation because we wanted
to serve the messages between the client
and the server side no need to replicate
this so this is also in here and well
here what we also put some widgets on
top of this and as you see this is the
one I was mentioned before so this is a
combo box but they were access point
more than 1000 so you type the name here
so then it will come here while you
select it and then it goes here so when
you have I mean sometimes when they want
to do an intervention there
want to go you know the five different
web pages so it's really important to
have all the information in a interview
you know so that's why we created this
with this I want to say that with this
pagan we are able to provide more
widgets on top of what's already GWT and
the xt that do twist you know the the
user experience somehow then apart from
this so we already have the
communication we have the objects to be
able to transmit it and we have the
security but a sin a sin any other pro
yet we also have logs and in this case
these are the web access log so if you
install this plugin here then you will
be monitoring all all the deed RPC and
in GWT RPC call to the server so you
know how much they take you know what at
what time the users are using your
application and so on so this is the
typical grass we have there and it's
really useful when you do you want to do
support and finally we have here the
track in plaque well for us I guess
probably break for every 1s here is
really really important to know what
happened to the domain objects sometimes
it's critical to know who was the one
that approve intervention in the tunnel
because you know there are some security
issues in there we have cryogenics we
have all three see we have many things
in here radiation and it's very
important to keep trace of all the audit
modifications that are being done to the
objects so for that we created this
packing so you just annotate the domain
objects as tracked and then as we all
use the same database we are able to
create the ddl the triggers then you
execute that and for free you will have
all the versions of the objects and the
graph of the object for doing the whole
life of this you know and then we have
some other plugins that are not needed
always but that are really useful
because as we already said we work in an
initiative
well we were for a minute if department
so including numerous sources finance
and you know and so on so what we have
here is this extra plug-in because these
people is really used war with excel so
they they create I mean we define a
standard format between them and us and
then they are able to send you know same
as the files we process it and so on the
day don't sometimes they don't need a
web interface for that or even did a
warning then we have also the deployment
plugin which allows us to configure what
we want to deploy and where we want to
deploy it because so far we don't deal
we don't manage how we're service there
is a net IT department at CERN the dust
is for us and we just have our own
plug-in just you type it from the common
nine and you are able to deploy this
application point you to the test
database in the production service
project that makes no sense but you can
do it and then we also have some
interesting plugins to deal with for
example the electronic document handling
mechanism that we have and which is
already working at CERN so every
document which is processing CERN is
going through this workflow on this
system which is call it eh and from
asking for some vacation days to buy a
mobile phone everything goes there so we
need to integrate this in the new
framework and we did through this place
so the conclusions here is that we will
be enhancing this framework in the short
term providing more widgets and you know
more ways to communicate because some
people now wants to use you know some of
our application so we are thinking about
creating some okay it's you know to just
post our services but in a secure manner
then it really provides a common way of
doing things so now i will show you but
just the visual part of the application
but behind they all have more or less
the same the same even bias the same
presenters the same views i mean you can
really understand quickly what is going
on he solves the common problem so among
the apps with these planes and and we
already use it and it simple
it can be also integrated partially in
the applications because because you
maybe don't want to to change the old
application that at once so we have some
examples also of some parts of an
application just using the framework
while the other is still using strats
and you know ultimately I say all but I
don't say it's not good I still like it
I will hear I just for application
examples and then we will be discussing
I guess if you're on outside to do it so
here is the impact project and basically
is is the tool we used to to deal with
the interventions in the time so as you
see is well some people call it the big
form in fact it is a base form all the
information is here in one page no other
pop apps are going to appear and so on
and that's why we created this a as bad
as I mentioned well you have the user
name and all this UI now is more or less
common in all the applications you have
the way to call for support the way to
check the help the menus on the left and
well more or less the look and feel of
the application is going to be the same
in all of them so here if you want to go
and change an existing cable you have to
go through here then you put the
information with who is going to
participate in it when it has to be done
what are the answers and the risk and
then if there is an approval process
then we can do it also through this tool
and this tool that is communicating to
the access system so based on this tool
the access system will let people enter
in a certain room just because this has
been approved by some that's why it's so
important to track you plug in here but
what this is an example and this is
working now and this
working well I will say and now we have
plan which is the tool that we will be
nice I mean this this bloglines I put
them okay because the information there
is completed toe is not like this huh
this is yet another tool also to plan
because in the other one we can plan but
we were not able to check the allocation
problems so here if you need a group
contribution I mean you can have your
plan but maybe you need from someone
else so here is where we do that and
again you see we have the same look and
feel the same menu lists the forms I
mean everything looks more or less the
same so once you try something and it
works well I'm sure we'll be both
because now we migrate to a new version
of GWT and XT and they provide more
widgets but basically this is what we
have and now there's no one which is ppt
you with responsible is here the weight
and well it deals with it's a time
control tool and basically it deals with
several projects sony's collaborating
with many universities and organizations
and sometimes they want to to input the
time they spend in some tasks and they
do it through this tool so here again
the security plugging comes into play
because we are opening this tool to the
to these organizations and it's we can
really see connect it to the ldap and
make it all work without you know having
to change the whole system and then fine
we know there is another one ok this is
the another another tool which has
partially integrated the technology the
framework but keeps working with the old
technology also and while it's just for
managing the resources in fact this
activity planning tool is managing all
the resources so with this tool we can
know how much does it cost to her 2500
staff a trend how much does it cost to
the LHC for example of how much does it
cost to create a new for example linear
accelerator which is going on now so
everything is happening here and part of
this tool is er I mean part of the
framework is in this tool sorry
and finally we are also playing with
html5 and canvas and so on because one
good thing about what we do in there is
that we have this room to to search and
to play with some technologies enable to
improve so we have created this trial
because well even if you don't see here
that you can this a tree on the left and
then there's a big Gantt chart we try to
live with what was provided by G TT and
EXT but it was really slow once you have
more than one thousand lines it really
gets stuck so well we have been playing
around a bit with this and and this is
also integrated in in some of the
projects already so now I hope you still
alive here we will let you two discuss a
bit if you have any question we are
happy to answer yep all right
so the question was whether we are you
hit me so the question was whether we
are using an open source tool to do this
integration right there is actually one
one plugin that is doing this but we did
it ourselves because we wanted to add
extra information in the indie details
that we pass which is basically to
connect to to connect to to the
graphical user interface we want to
actually give information about security
and we want to provide some the fold
classes that are generated automatically
so we do this on the way we pass the
objects back to the client anything else
have more questions no you sure here
I'll give you this because what are your
quiz plugins available locals open
source or full license or anything we
are actually thinking of winter but it's
still we are still our own discussion on
a few decisions that we have taken so i
guess in a few months we will do so but
I we don't have a date yet but that's
the idea at some point to that Somali
technologies that soon has been you know
me for free like the web for example so
I think there are opportunities to do
that but i don't really been yet decided
we are talking about have you had I've
had a lot of problems with large client
data on GWT and trying to walk through
it what kind of solutions do you have
that or have you really experienced it
so they really well one thing that we
need when we're dealing with this big
amount of data or data for example for
the least and so on when we send it I
mean to ewt we had the option to send
you know the whole object so you have
the dough may not get itself when I
mentioned the dto plugging remember so
we have the model we converted in the
detail and you can send the whole
l'objet itself but then this is too
heavy then if you want to do a list of
500 items it will work but i would say
it slowly this components that they
offer they are not really fast so what
we did is to have a registrati mechanism
so like that you if you want to present
just for fields in this object we just
send that part it's like if you have
Jason and you just decide to send some
part of it so we did this fetch in
strata and like that we are able to
present I think we have 500 in the
configuration I mean we don't allow you
to solve all the activities that rag
going on in the intervention but you can
see like reasonable amount of
information just sending the part that
you really need for example for the gun
for the trend that we so here we did it
with a canvas he was faster to paint it
than to produce is using the widget that
you have in GWT and GXT we had to do it
because of that so we remain this
performance issues ok guys thank you so
much they're putting a little bit of
edge thank you for your time but yeah
