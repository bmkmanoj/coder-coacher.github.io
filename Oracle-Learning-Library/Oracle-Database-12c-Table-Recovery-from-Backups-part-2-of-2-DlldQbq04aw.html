Oracle Database 12c new feature series
my name is Maria Billings I work for
Oracle server technologies curriculum in
this demonstration will show you
functionality new to Oracle Database 12c
we assume that you are familiar with the
tasks outlined in the table recovery
from the cups part 1 demonstration so in
this demonstration we show you in secret
+ how to insert new rows take note of
the SCN or it could also be that you
take note of the time factor we will use
that later as a point in time to recover
to in our mean then you perform a level
1 backup optionally you can list the
backups in the secret + we create the
need to recover a table by purging it so
we intentionally introduce a
quote-unquote disaster then in our mean
will recover the test table to the
previous point in time or the SCN that
you recorded and finally we confirm that
the recovery was successful in sequel
plus we insert another test row into our
test table 3 in committee we query the
Assyrian and noted for our little
recover command back in Amun we perform
a backup incremental level one database
+ archive log command optionally you can
again the list the backups in sequel
class we are about to create an issue by
dropping and purging our test table
assume that this table is not duplicated
or in the flashback logs or anywhere
else so you will need to recover it from
your back
for that we move tech to Armen before we
execute the table recovery command let's
take a look at what you can expect to
see
so we've fulfilled the prerequisites
then we will need to provide some input
with the table recover command and that
is the name of the object to reach time
or Sen it should be recovered and should
it be imported the default is yes then
Armen determines the Bekaa based on your
specifications it automatically creates
the auxiliary instance recovers your
tables or also table partitions up to
the point in time that you specified
then I mean creates a data pump export
file that contains the recovered object
objects and imports it into the target
database so this is just a rough
overview and you can also customize the
different steps details can be found in
the documentation
remember the Sen that you clear it after
you commit to the database we will be
now using it in an our main command we
are recovering the table until the
previously specified SCM and we are
providing an axillary destination if you
do not know the SCM you could also use
the entire time clause Armen creates
automatically in instants for you and
finds the appropriate data pieces and
loads them into the instance so it
restores and recover objects into the
auxiliary instance for that it uses an
in-memory script
then it creates a damn fighter with a
table to be recovered and of course the
appropriate metadata here you see the
exported damn file
I mean imports the recover table into
the target database and as you see it's
finished and we check in seek reply so
that the test table is accessible again
in this demonstration we showed you the
tasks shown on this slide the graphic
here shows you the tasks that are men
performs for you thanks for watching
