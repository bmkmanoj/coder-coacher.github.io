applications to make my job easier but I
couldn't get them to communicate with
each other
I needed oracle salescloud to connect
with Google sheets asana to generate an
email from Gmail an Oracle Service Cloud
to share a file in Dropbox I needed
these applications to connect and then I
found Oracle self-service integration
cloud service or SSI for short
it lets me automate my tasks so I can
easily share data between my cloud
applications and formats that they
understand when I use SSI in just a few
clicks the cloud apps share their data
it integrates Oracle cloud applications
and other popular cloud applications I
can choose from a large selection of
pre-built recipes or create one of my
own a recipe is started when the trigger
event it tracks in one application has
been detected and in turn it executes
one or more tasks in another application
let's say I'm planning a webinar I can
create an SSI recipe that connects
Eventbrite and Oracle sales cloud and
then let SSI do the rest
the next time a person registers from my
event my Oracle sales cloud contact list
will be automatically updated with the
new registrants information SSI is for
anyone who wants to be more efficient
and productive by easily keeping track
of contacts documents events
appointments and just about anything you
can think of SSI provides tools for an
administrator to develop instances of
cloud applications that aren't supported
out-of-the-box for writing even more
support for your users make your cloud
work for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
