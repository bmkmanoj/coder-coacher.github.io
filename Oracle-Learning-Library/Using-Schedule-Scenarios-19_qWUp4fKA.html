perform genuine what-if planning with
your project creates multiple scenarios
from the current scheduled experiments
with changes for example alter the
activity sequence or reduce durations
and then reschedule when you're
satisfied with a scenario make it the
current schedule the scenario feature
does not require you to merge projects
or change baselines just select the
scenario you like and make it the
current schedule let's create a scenario
on the activities page click the plus
sign type a name and click Add the
scenario is an exact copy of the current
schedule active scenarios that are being
used for planning have a status of
what-if in our example the project must
be shortened we've made changes to
several activity relationships and
rescheduled the project reducing project
duration by five days the project still
needs to be shortened more let's create
a second scenario to experiments with
allocating additional resources in this
scenario we've added resources to a
couple of activities in order to reduce
their durations after rescheduling
project duration has been shortened a
combination of modified relationships
and additional resources should
accomplish our objective
however instead of creating another
scenario from the current schedule let's
duplicate the first scenario so that we
can build on the changes already made
beginning with the modified
relationships we've added resources to
more activities and reduced their
durations we were also able to remove
one activity constraint after
rescheduling the project is shortened by
15 days let's go ahead and make scenario
3 the current schedule at the prompt
click set the current schedule now
displays a remaining duration of 66 days
click the manage scenarios icon when a
scenario is changed to the current
schedule the status of the scenario is
changed to retire the status of the
previous schedule is also changed to
retired notes that the retired scenario
and previous schedule are no longer
visible make either one visible again by
clicking the eye icon finally since we
no longer need scenarios one or two will
change their status to closed that will
hide them from view as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
