second of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle jet in this part we will learn
about the technical nuts and bolts for
setting up a jet application to be
deployed to mobile phones you'll learn
how to do hybrid mobile development with
Oracle jet hybrid mobile applications
are like any other apps you find on a
mobile phone they install on your device
and there can be found in the App Store
however they're not written in the
native language of the phone such as
Objective C for iOS or Java for Android
instead you write them in JavaScript CSS
and HTML and use a tool called Cordova
to compare them to the native language
of the type of mobile phone of your
choice
jet provides support for iOS Android and
Windows
as part of its command-line tooling you
can use the Cordova API directly to try
and compile to other platforms as well
however these are not officially
supported by jet let's start by setting
up our environment for doing hybrid
application development with Oracle jet
we're on the oracle jet or home page we
go to get started and instead of taking
step to a jet create project name and
then template and so on we go right to
the end and we see that we need to
install cordova npm - g for global
install cordova followed by the a jet
correct command
this time however make sure to include
the - - hybrid flag which sets up a
Cordova folder in your application
structure include as always the template
and nav drawer is a nice starting point
and then specify which of the platforms
iOS Android or Windows or multiple of
these you want to support this is the
starting point and this was set up your
first Oracle jet Cordova based in other
words hybrid application next there is a
very important link here to the
developer's guide for details on
developing for my
hybrid applications click on that link
and you arrive on this page and you see
start here and the link before you begin
and on that page you will find the
chapter of getting started with Oracle
jet application development and in that
chapter the section that is really
important for you is getting started
with Oracle jet hybrid mobile
application development the process
involves installing the mobile tooling
that relates to the platform's you want
to support creating a hybrid mobile
application via the command line as
you've seen a jet create and then using
a hybrid flag and then accessing the
mobile device services using Cordova
plugins for additional features the
starting point therefore is to install
all the mobile tooling you start off
with definitely installing Apache
Cordova that is not optional however
optional is the set of tooling that
applies to your specific mobile platform
that you want to provide support for so
the Android development tools and
setting up the emulator is described
here and the iOS development tools are
described here the tools for a Windows
Mobile developments are also described
and once you have worked through that
the next step is to scaffold your
application using one of the different
templates and we have already briefly
discussed this as yet create followed by
the hybrid flag and then there are a
number of options the template the
platform's notice here the names of the
platform separated by commas here are
descriptions on each of the different
options details on each of them and once
the application has been set up you will
see something that looks like this and
importantly you will see a folder called
hybrid with within the platform's
subfolder a folder for each of the
platforms that you want to provide
support for Android Windows iOS there
will be a folder for each of those the
next step is to carefully read through
this section and follow the instruction
that are set here are various tweaks if
you need to apply and finally a jet
build to build your apk file for Android
or iOS file depending on which mobile
phones you're providing support for
customization settings are discussed and
then a jet serve exactly as with web
development for mobile development
there's our jet serve you specify which
mobile platform you want to serve the
application to and then that is done and
then you can see your application on
your mobile device
there are various configurations and
variations or customizations that you
need to be aware of this how section is
very important when you are doing mobile
development using Cordova and Oracle jet
there are also a wide variety of plugins
for Cordova that you can make use of and
as always there are tips and tricks in
the developer guide describing how to
set everything up and how to use the
Cordova plugins in the context of your
Oracle jet application in short this
section of the Oracle JDeveloper guide
provides everything you will need in one
centralized place for working with
hybrid mobile development using Cordova
and jet in this part we've learned the
basics of getting started creating
hybrid mobile applications for your
homework for this part install and
configure a mobile environment on your
own machine you must have a Mac to do
iOS development you can setup and build
an Android application from any standard
operating system once you have the
environment set up use the Oracle jet
command-line interface to scaffold a new
mobile application and then build it for
Android development it is highly
recommended that you run the application
directly on the device by attaching the
device to your computer and using a USB
cable for iOS in general the emulator
will work just fine finally with the
knowledge you have now gained you should
have enough
information to configure a responsive
web application as well as a hybrid
mobile application with jet throughout
next week we will cover a range of
additional topics such as the composite
component architecture and how to
connect to Oracle cloud services by the
end of next week you will have a good
understanding of accessibility issues
testing packaging deployment security
and more finally thanks and
congratulations for completing the
second week of the course on Oracle jet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
