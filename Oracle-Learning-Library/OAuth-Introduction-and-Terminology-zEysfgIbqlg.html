of your api's and applications on the
cloud so other entities like third-party
applications can use them have you
thought about using an authorization
standard that uses an access token let
me show you how an access token works
think about your car keys your car
usually has a regular key and a valet
key the valet key has no access to the
glovebox trunk motor or gas tank this
keys mainly used to park your car while
you visit restaurants stores and other
businesses that offer a valet parking
service Oh auth 2.0 is an open standard
framework that can securely issue and
validate tokens for services on the
Internet ooofff essentially allows
access tokens to be issued to
third-party clients by an authorization
server with the approval of the user the
third-party then uses the access token
to access the protected resource is
hosted by the resource server the access
tokens will have some limitations like
the valet key so who are the
participants or roles involved in this
standard the resource owner or user who
owns the data the client application is
who wants to access or manipulate the
users data for example a web or mobile
app the authorization server issues
access tokens to the client app which
are used to request access to the users
data Google Facebook and LinkedIn are
some common examples the resource server
retrieves the users data if the owner
authorizes it examples include Dropbox
Google Drive or any social network
resource in many scenarios the
authorization server and the resource
server are part of the same trust domain
all of these participants interact
through flows like the two or three
legged flows the three-legged float
typically involves three legs or parties
the user or resource owner the client or
third party application and the
authorization server on the other hand
the two-legged flow describes a typical
client-server scenario
without any user involvement an example
is a local Facebook mobile application
accessing your Facebook account let's
review a scenario where all these
participants are involved here a user
wants to book a flight from the airline
website or client application he's able
to complete the reservation without
manually creating a user account within
the airline system because he uses a
trusted authorization server such as
Facebook or Twitter to log in it gives
us consent to use data from his social
account through OAuth when the user
tries to pay for his tickets using net
banking he's prompted to log into his
bank account which then authorizes the
payment just like this scenario there
are many others where mobile
applications and cloud services are
using OAuth for authorization without
the need to manually create an account
for the third party app let's take a
look at what happens when the user gives
us consent to the airline application
through Facebook first the users being
redirected to the Facebook ooofff
consent form the URL shows request
elements like app ID client ID response
type and scope among others in this case
the response type indicates that it
expects a token from the authorization
server the authorization scope
determines the resources to access from
the user's Facebook account like email
and user birthday after the user gives
consent to access his resources
the airline application receives an
access token which is used to access the
resources on behalf of the user an
access token represents an authorization
that a client application may have to do
something on behalf of the resource
owner or user it can only be used by a
specific client application and it has a
timeout there are other types of tokens
in ooofff
for example refresh tokens which allow
clients to obtain a fresh access token
without riobueno a ssin from the
resource owner
it's a long-lived token and it's useful
when the client application wants to
keep an authorization for a very long
time like days or even months some
authorization servers support the
Refresh token revocation prior to its
time-out for example when the user
removes the previously granted airline
application from his Facebook app
settings
besides the previous tokens the
authorization code works all
most like a token but it doesn't carry
out any authorization information or
scopes in it it's used in a very
specific situation we'll talk more about
this in a future video every token has
specific authorization scopes and
durations of access granted by the
resource owner and enforced by the
resource server and the authorization
server the scope is a parameter which is
included when a client app makes a
request to the authorization or token
endpoints
ooofff scopes provide a way to limit the
amount of access that's granted to an
access token for example an access token
issue to a social network application
might include post to my wall send
notification or read my age the client
application can trigger processes or
access users data through these tokens
an access token proves that the user has
given consent to access specific
information or resources o auth defines
a number of grant types or ways for a
client application to acquire an access
token they include authorization code
implicit resource owner password
credentials and client credentials each
grant type is used in a specific
scenario to learn more about oauth
grants when to use them and how they
work check out other videos in this
