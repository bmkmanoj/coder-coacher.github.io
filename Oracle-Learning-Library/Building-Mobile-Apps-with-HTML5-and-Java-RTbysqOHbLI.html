apps with html5 and Java my name is max
caste run developer relations for TIG z
which actually what i'm going to show
you today and so this is my information
in case you need any questions so this
is the only slide that I have alright
and then I'm actually going to spend the
rest of the time building a mobile app
for you and what's really cool you'll be
able to try the app as I build it
alright alright
anyhow so
so first anyone heard of tick Z before
one person two three awesome so you guys
in the right place but basically it's a
cloud mobile app platform alright where
you get development tools and also
runtime services for building mobile
apps right so there's a cloud builder
cloud ID running in the browser okay
it's number one the app that you get at
the end is pretty much html5 jQuery
Mobile you can also do phone gap app
right you guys familiar with PhoneGap
gives you access to device features you
can consume any REST API that's out
there of course including api's which
are based on Java all right there's also
back-end services where you can create
basically an instant a cloud database to
store up data let's say you're building
it a to-do app and you want to store
things to do so you can easily store
them in the cloud database right so all
these things give you a mobile app right
you got a builder you got rest services
cloud rest services and then you also
get a cloud database and some other
services all right as it basically it
I'll get one one slide I'm going to show
you the end what I'm going to do now is
I'm actually going to build an app for
you alright so let's do that
let's go here so it's a title running in
the cloud right so I'm going to create a
new app first so let's do Java one
mobile mobile app and I click create
am I still connected to the Internet
here we go now so again this is loading
the Builder as I said it's entirely
cloud which means it is nothing to
download nothing to install incredibly
easy to start also in just a second you
can see is going to say connecting to
collaboration server so what this means
is that there is a Google Docs basically
model I'm not editing documents but
building an app where you can invite
other developers or wherever to build
the app collaborate on the app at the
same time or different times all right
just a few more seconds and it will be
loaded here we go connecting
collaboration server alright so this is
a builder we got a phone right here
right this is your phone you can also do
tablet if you want and right here are
your jquery mobile components and also
html5 components right make sense kind
of ID in a browser so the first step now
we're going to use for for api's as the
first example we're going to use twitter
right and i was told the twitter uses
java in the backend for their services
all right so we're going to connect it
to research api and we'll be able to
search for anything alright so but the
first step is to build the UI so we take
components input component we're going
to make this a placeholder the actual
input we can get a button component and
let's make it search if I can spell here
we go
and let's change this to app right now
what's really nice is that for gold
first of all you start this is a html5
jQuery Mobile app which means you can
basically run in any browser right
that's the browser mobile browser oh
it's really awesome is that you can test
the app instantly so there is a big test
button
right and you actually get this is the
real thing now it doesn't do anything
yet it will but this is the real thing
what's also really cool is that as I
said you guys can share can pry the out
ways I build it so I'm going to make the
out public I'm going to create a shorter
URL so you guys can try it so let's do
public now obviously this URL is pretty
long I don't want you guys to type it so
what I'm going to do is let me launch it
and I'm going to go to tiny URL alright
and let's create a shortcut and let's
call this Java 1 2012 12 maybe someone
has it with em for mobile make tiny URL
awesome alright now if you guys go to
this URL right desktop or obviously be
sure to get is easy for mobile device
any phone you'll be able to access the
app so when you do raise your hand
sorry it's a tiny or lj1 12m I was just
afraid the Java one was probably taking
ready right so anyone can access it
oh you know sorry i oh you're going to
get the frame let me do it the other way
sorry guys um without the frame you
don't want to see the frame on on the
mobile device let me do this I'll have
to create a new one
so m1 and now sorry here we go
so again only on it on a desktop
computer you can do the first one on the
mobile device make sure you do this
otherwise you're going to get the frame
it doesn't transfer it doesn't redirect
you to an amiable non frame version yet
so anyone got it right very good
you guys want me to keep this open for a
little bit so get tinyurl Java 112 m1
right or if you guys want to try and
again it's sort of depends on how close
you are on you can scan this QR code but
I don't know it usually depends on the
phone and how far you alright there are
all good
so here this is for mobile and then
without the one is okay very good so
let's continue now we're going to
continue building the UI first I'm going
to get a great component and this is
useful for layout as two columns you can
do more columns more rows in the first
one I'm going to put an image component
which is the Twitter picture and now I
know ahead of time the size that were
sends me it's 48 by 48 and that's why
I'm going to resize it like this in the
second column I'm going to put two
labels the first label is the twitter
user name then it's going to be the
Twitter text right now there are a bunch
of jQuery Mobile themes this is just a
short list but we can do something like
this right and we can test and this way
you get right
what this is without the frame so again
if you okay make sense so if you guys
hit refresh you'll be able to get that
but let's actually open it inner frame
it looks nicer desktop
there we go
come on
almost there here we go right well
hopefully sort of get I mean you can
create multiple pages you can write
JavaScript you can navigate between the
pages
but basically you know if this all sort
of there was then I mean you can
basically build a UI for your app
correct but of course you want to be
able to get data one able to connect to
rest services
I'm going to make this app to be a real
app not just a kind of a dummy UI so for
that we're going to get connect to a
rest service and I'm going to go to
project and I'm going to create a new
service all right rest service is fine
going to click OK and so right here I'm
going to enter connect to twitter
twitter sir and then all right now so
I'm using Twitter because you can
imagine any rest out there anything you
guys have no line you can do here right
and I'm going to change the JSONP just a
minor unimportant now every service has
inputs and outputs right so we're going
to define inputs into our case it's the
only one is required to skew which
stands for query they're optional
primaries that whitter has but they're
optional so we're not going to worry
about it now what's really nice is that
once you do that you can actually test
the service also have you guys ever seen
um kind of if you go to company Dover's
api's and there's kind of a PG console
where you can test the rest service and
you haven't seen that no okay well it
looks does something like this basically
you can enter any input or we can do
maybe job on one can try click test and
you get the result all right so you get
a JSON from Twitter now the next step is
to create the service output and we
could do it by hand but as you can see
Twitter returns a lot of stuff back so
we don't want to do it by hand we can
click this button we can automatically
create the response clicking this button
right and what we get is everything we
get back from Twitter right so it can be
JSON it can also be XML right so we get
output we got input and we got the
actual service so let's save and it's
closed now we need to add the service to
the page so we can just basically just
drag and drop like this
this indicates the service is added to
the page next we need to bind this
service to the page or mapping between
the service and the UI and so we go to
data mapping let me just collapse it so
it's a little bit right this is the
service right here and this is the page
so this is the input component I'm going
to map the implement component to the
service all right now you can also write
JavaScript again you're starting with
the mobile app HTML mobile app so any
JavaScript anything that's out there or
you write goes right you know anything
the browser supports response mapping
okay to say you get from Twitter
now results this is the collection of
all the tweets so I'm going to do in a
NAPA to the grid itself now why to the
grid because I make multiple tweets it's
going to give me a looping feature
functionality where I'm going to just
you know loop over tweets texts this is
actual tweet so I'm going to map it to
the second label let's see from user is
right here right this is the username
and this is the picture right again you
can write you can write JavaScript here
on either side you can also save stuff
into local storage so again this is just
a browser so basically any API browser
has you can use here make sense now
we're going to go back to heat design
the last step we need to do is we need
to invoke the service and we're going to
click a button and we'll select the
button go to events click and then we
can there a number of actions there's
again run custom JavaScript so again you
can just write anything you want
and then the one we want to use invoke
service and select service right and we
well actually I need to save if you
click say will be state automatically
click test and all right so good a try
you guys have to refresh let me know
when you guys got it
anyone
right so but this is this is a real
mobile app I mean I can launch it
without without the frame so I mean I
think it's pretty awesome you guys think
yes and it's been a long day
all right so yeah this is again this is
a real real app that's talking to to to
to a service now how do you get the app
right sort of outside or well what's
really cool is that you can export the
app easily you can export as HTML just
keep it pure mobile and you can also do
source code so eclipse or Xcode windows
visual studio this is for Windows Phone
7 or you can get a binary ok and if you
guys want to try those of you with a
Android I can build and it's going to go
and build the for me I might be 10
seconds might be 20 seconds I don't know
and then we're going to get a QR code
and you can actually scan it well if you
want it later and you can get the app on
your phone installed right but anyhow
will I can come back to this
well let's see yeah ten more seconds
yeah see maybe now I think it was going
to ten more seconds yeah
so I think now we'll finish oh man I
think it doesn't like because it's I
guess Oracle so it's kind of building
slower here we go
40 seconds yeah so I guess you guys
don't have to scan it now but Union you
could come later and skin and you're
going to get the app on your device
right
of course iOS is a little bit more
complicated than an Android for obvious
reasons
alright so what do you guys think pretty
awesome I mean thank you so again this
is this is a really app I mean this is
not some kind of a hello world that you
know you know this is a real real mobile
app and you guys can I mean you're able
to actually try it
so in keep in mind that any any
resurfaced out there anything out there
you can easily easily get your fav time
at the end what I'm going to show you is
that I'm sure you've heard about their
box right conference the other Java
conference in Europe and they're pretty
cool API which is also Java based and I
think it's um Oh rest interface and this
is what they have so we can instantly
right get this also get any of the rest
or bases they have and be able to to get
the information to display and so on but
what I'm going to show you next is how
we can add back in services right so we
got there is MongoDB running in the
cloud right and what's cool about
MongoDB is that everything you do there
is explore the way we have a set up and
anything you do is instantly exposes
REST API s ok so let's do that
um let's go here
okay so I get a list of databases let's
create a new one so Java one DB click
create right and I get a database I get
collection so these are the collections
they're a user there's user management
file management but let's create a
collection so new let's do it to do
right what we're going to do tasks right
got a collection these are default
columns or fields we're going to add a
new column and we're going to call this
name click create and then we can enter
sample data so let's do a row I don't
know go to another session and then we
can do more see people are leaving
because they don't leave and then
finally I don't know get a beer I think
they left to get a beer all right now
what's really cool is that again
everything is exposed as rest and in
fact you get a little curl command you
guys don't know prepare another with
curl right so curl command now as I
mentioned anything that exposes rest you
can you can easily add to your app and
this is rest so we can do that so let's
go ahead and copy this and copy and
let's go back this is we are and we're
going to create a new service and this
is coldest to do get and we just need to
change the name here to do and the only
other thing we need is we need to get
this this key right it identifies our
database so and the last thing is this
actual value make it a header now is it
before test test right away we get the
three items again next step is to create
the service response I can do
automatically click here and it says
populated successfully and this is the
response I save I close and let's create
a page we'll create a news page and look
cool pull this to do and let's use it
another component so we use them
actually I need that we'll get a list
component so we're going to get a list
component and we're going to make this
round corners it looks better now
because I'm going to be iterating over
items I don't need all three so I
actually just need one one alright and
so we got the page and we are going to
add a surface to the page which is right
here okay and now we can close this
let's do data mapping is before so this
is the input portion right there's
nothing to set for the input because the
key just the key but on the response
we're going to map the list mapping it
to the list and the name to text
property list right so again we're going
to iterate we're almost done we now need
to add an event
now before we would invoke the service
on button click but now we want to
invoke the service on page load for
example in book service page look right
so the last thing we need to do is we
need to up make this to be the starting
page right because right now for launch
we're going to get the Twitter so let's
try and do that we're going to go to
settings and we're going to change the
start screen and click test
right instantly we got the app now if
you guess you're fresh you're probably
going to get the same Twitter because
there is a page there is a page name at
the end so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to the first page and let's
add a button just so you guys can
navigate easier so maybe put it right
here in the header and we'll add an
event click and navigate to page right
and so it changes to next right so if
you guys you're fresh you'll be able to
get to the to the list right and yes
working or you get to list all right
very good
now I mentioned so as before um I
mentioned it's it's a platform right and
now if the platform means that now
anywhere you are you should be aware
what app you have and what back in
services you have so what I just did you
can use any service out there right
anything you find you can basically use
the same approach you put the URL you
create the input you create the output
but they're actually even a simpler way
to do the same thing and call let me
just run mine okay so let's add a
capability to add new items and you guys
can add new items and you can say good
things about the session bad things I
want the recession on San Diego and I
get some not about me but just bad
things people were testing so but will
be able to refresh and see what you guys
are saying alright so again so what the
Builder is aware what databases have
created and so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create database services
and right here I got a list of all the
databases and the ones this is Java one
DB and immediately
I get all the collection so these are
login this is for user management and
this in my to do collection so I'm going
to do create I would like to create two
to generate the create service I'm going
to click here and instantly it creates a
service for me and what's really awesome
is that there is a URL there is all the
parameter is already set right and if I
want I can test this and I can say and I
can click test and this indicates that a
new value was entered close and we can
go back where is it
right here and this is the item right so
it works the only last thing you need to
do is I need to only close the tabs here
I need to modify the UI so let's do that
and so first we're going to get an input
component oh I put it right in the list
right and let's make this a placeholder
and we get a button component which goes
sorry about that here we go all right
and we'll call this ad and already got
the service so let's uh this is the
service right now I need to do mapping
and we can you can rename these are
their you know not just rest service one
and two and three let's go to mapping
for this and this is the name that we
enter so we take the input component and
we map it now for the output we don't
really care because we're not going to
do anything with it so we can just
ignore it
we're almost done the last well two
things we need to do we need to invoke
the service on button click as before
event click invoke service this is the
this one the only other thing is we're
going to update the listener database
now we need to refresh the list on in
the client so of course one way you can
just do it on the client you can just
add an item to a list but we're not
going to do it which
and refresh the database we're going to
make another request and just reload the
list all right so to request you add and
then now the only thing is we want to
update the list only once the create
successfully completes so for that I'm
going to select the service and I'm
going to run the get again only on the
success event and we're going to go to
in book service and this one all right
and let's try this
all right let's see
all right so you guys can try it now
just be careful all right
and of course let's oh okay it's really
click here alright well it's kind of
50/50 this is hopefully good stuff right
alright um well another still some time
left but let me give you one more
example and let's do this dev box let's
get the schedule so they have this I
hope you guys can see but basically it
gives the schedule for a day there are
five days Monday through Friday so we
can do and the days are pretty simple
first day is Monday and so on so let's
do that
copy and let's create a new service and
we're going to call this their box and
all right and we can do a test again oh
oh forgot the day see this is good so
testing is good all right I forgot to
enter a day and I get it in there right
here I can see that I didn't enter a day
so let's do on day three test still oh
now I need to event ID right okay I know
the event ID I remember is 7 7 try this
again test here we go right and again
basically automatically create a
response it's created and this is
everything I get back
alright let's save close let's do one
more page and then we'll be done
so we call this day box
and let's use a list component again we
get a list component and let's right and
let's telex adding it to the page now
again we do mapping nothing for input
but for output we're going to map the
collection of all the event well that's
all the presentations to the list and we
just need to find title which is right
here we're not going to worry about
other stuff alright and finally in the
voguing let's make this round corners
and finally invoking on page load we go
to load book service right we need to
change the starting page to their box
all right
done there's some there's some empty
ones because it has like breakfast and
coffee breaks they're not they have a
different type of a presentation so they
don't have a title so obviously you
would need to check you know if it's a
breakfast then quiche or something else
but anyhow this is just shows you how
fast and easy you can do this all right
guess there any questions yes
no fortunately no rest right out JSON or
XML sorry
so did you did you say anything bad in
them sessions um what do you mean
sessions yeah yeah
so again just what so what this is this
is sort of an ID basically ID in the
browser you're building a HTML mobile
app so you can do anything that
basically you can do with HTML you know
in JavaScript so sessions I mean it
again if you're referring to kind of
local storage or session storage yeah
you can easily use that I'm sorry how do
you
so for um the question was how do we
test any native features right so we've
got a special app for Android where you
basically you log into app and you can
see all your projects and you can launch
a project and it will download the app
the actual PhoneGap app into your phone
and you can test it so for F for Android
is very simple iOS we try to submit it
to the store but so far has been sort of
not accepted we do have we do well they
don't like the idea something they've
downloaded to the phone I think has
something to do with that but for
Android again it's an app you get a list
of projects you click on the project
downloaded and basically runs yeah iOS
that we've got the same tester app but
it's available so as open source you
have to build yourself and install it on
the phone yourself I mean we'll probably
try again but we obviously know no
guarantee that Apple oh good yeah yeah
yeah yeah so you can so instead of
installing each time you can just launch
it it will download automatically to
your phone yeah yeah of course
um you can just do it you can do it
right here export and then there is a
clips or eclipse project yeah and then
or akin to Xcode or for Windows Phone
you can do as a visual studio yeah
Stanley yes yes
licensing licensing yeah so the thing
there was a question in the little
database I know really
let's check Wow look at that
get ten pages no head Java what is that
well Wow
bad stuff now we can actually know
there's actually location information
being recorded so we can actually I can
actually hear yeah there's a built-in
feature where I can actually point well
no well license so again but on a more
serious note awesome thank you uh it's a
it's a you know it's running in the
cloud so there's nothing to download
right there's nothing to install so it
sort of it's a freemium model like
Salesforce for example there is free
there is in another pay plans the
difference is only number of apps you
can build right there is no difference
in features right so I totally
understand you guys I don't want to buy
stuff right
so but really we're talking about like
giving examples there's free obviously
free the next plan is just $15 per month
15 so it's not you know 15,000 it's 15
and just the amount of time you're going
to save I think it's enormous but what
I'm going to do and that's the last
slide that's that's a left there's one
more slide that I have if you use this
code right Java 112 you're going to get
three months Pro Plan so this is hundred
$50 value and if you guys really want
more shoot me an email I will give you
more we're going to get maybe six months
so yeah it's Java 112 so it's pretty
simple to remember but my email is right
it's pretty simple so the product is
called takes you but I work for a
company called Excel we are actually out
of East Bay here Concord so that's the
company behind thingsI that's why the
email so max at X at all right there and
again the code is just Java 112 over
case just number apps you get all the
features yes so it's one app three apps
50 apps but you get all the features
title this talk is building of html5 and
JavaScript is
well another 10 minutes you guys are
welcome to ask questions but other than
that I'm done hopefully you liked it
something kind of cool thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
