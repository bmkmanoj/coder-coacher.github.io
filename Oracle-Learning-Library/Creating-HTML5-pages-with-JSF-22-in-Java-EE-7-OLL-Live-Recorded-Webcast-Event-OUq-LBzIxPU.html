course about Java EE 7 creating html5
pages with J's have to point to my name
is adharma and child every boom
developer at Oracle I'll be guiding you
through these webcasts which consists of
upgrading a web-based application that
already uses html5 and WebSockets to use
JSF 2.0 for dynamic content with html5
friend America the goal is to
demonstrate the new features in gauges
that allow the creation of dynamic pages
using html5 first a disclaimer on this
is light we have our standard Oracle
safe harbor Norris basically it states
that this wave test does not require a
contract between us and what I am
demonstrating today should not be used
to make any purchasing decisions
so take full advantage of this webcast
you should have the following
prerequisites have some experience with
Java Enterprise Development it
specifically HTML Javascript and
JavaServer faces you don't have to
dominate them but at least have some
exposure good note that in order to
follow this tutorial you need to have
the following Oracle products NetBeans
IDE for Java version seven point three
point one and GlassFish server open
source edition version 4 which is a Java
EE 7 compliant server Java EE 7 is built
thinking in three main themes first
developer productivity this enable
developers to write applications faster
with easier configuration using
annotated objects reducing the
boilerplate code required for common
tasks and having a cohesive and
integrated platform to develop
applications
meaning the enterprise demands with API
such as bad batch for grading batch jobs
concurrency utilities and simplifying
existing IP ice-like Begay
API for internal messaging finally html5
support with inclusion of WebSockets
JSON improvements in the servlet API
more restful web services port and
finally main improvements engage that
making it the most flexible version to
write html5 pages this webcast will
focus on the under html5 part of the
Java EE 7 specifically JSF 2.0 so what
are the new features in JSF 2.0 it
includes a lot of new features such as
faces throws for creating so based a
navigation among we doing pages resource
library contracts for creating templates
and changing dynamically those two
blades a allowing some kind of asking
ability the view action pack which
allows you to create book America ball
URLs that a actually will reapply of
actions inside that will be trigger part
ESS and integrated cross-site request
forgery solution in JSF a final
component that was introduced as part of
the framework and html5 friendly markup
support which will be seen in the in the
demonstration I want to give a premiere
on the viewers should attack the view
option that allows case appears to call
action methods when a page is loaded if
users view parameters so to find the
request parameters when a patient's
loaded and this allows you to break book
America vol tierce a pages such as this
URL over here so in order to to show the
details of a person in this case in this
page a the Huskies ID what you do is
that you create a new action pass here
that will be triggered when whenever
there's a basis in symbol and
was buying the id2 beam here so divining
will occur first in reaction and then a
the base will load take note that
navigation rules SPO price so if you
have a navigation rule in your action
just as with any other theories of
action that navigation rule will be
triggered the application takes place as
normal this reaction will take place a
normal application a place oh yes F and
you can obviously change that face if
you desire of you to have the need for
it so now knowing that we have days
allowing you to walk more pages and
create a more consistent flows in your
insert pages just look at a HTML 5
parallels a JSF so here we have what I
call the great html5 API surface neither
a the idea here is to demonstrate you
the city this page using html5 your
syntax is if your syntax and then if
steps in between that we can achieve now
with JSF 2.0 so if actually this patient
snippet shows you a simple slider just
like he over here so you have the a
simple label your slider using the html5
arrange a type element and then a span
values so this actually will render
pieces later over here this is great for
web developers because they can actually
see what they are doing there in their
editors and whenever they want to
actually include some dynamic
functionality they would use in a rest
or WebSockets
with along with a lot of JavaScript code
so you can actually write a complete
application using html5 and happy typing
dynamical but the problem is that you
will need a lot of JavaScript and a lot
of interaction
server using other technologies so
what's on the other side of the slider
what if I do everything in JSF if I do
everything in a SS I am handling
components instead of page elements so I
have a simple a heating field that will
store the value of my a slider I have my
my grades that will represent a table
they label and finally the slider itself
this is using an external JSF component
library so we use components instead of
HTML markup and then we have all the
dynamic elements using JSF it means it
is handled on the server the server
actually does the conversion and the
aterna binding to our beans is done here
on the with using JSF the problem you
show this to a web developer and he will
say I don't know what you're talking
about a this these things are not HTML
it will be an HTML after of their basic
processes it but right now it doesn't
look like one
so if requires you to actually write
these pages Java developers you can
still use faces for the planning tool to
save a lot of repeated code so that's a
very good advantage for you but still a
web developers letting here but what
does this mean actually so JSF he is not
it is not restricted to to this kind of
syntax if you can is you have a
multidisciplinary team you can move this
later a little to the left then you can
write as much HTML as possible like here
you have tables you have a you have
plain labels and when never do need a
HTML a sorry components of components
and bindings
then you introduce your JSF components
so you have a sub components with some
HTML for layer so
people can actually see it is you have
dynamic elements using JSF and the pages
will require a collaboration between
Jewel and the web developer so he will
be attending all the dynamic components
and then they did assign a book handle
to layout favorites are still used for
the plating state B and this provides a
great advantage but still this part in
particular it's kind of hard for
therefore the web developer to figure
out how it will look like sure it has
some data there but still a poor design
is not that great and still in some in
some a designer a design tools it won't
appear correctly since neither and also
there's another thing there is an
element in html5 that actually those
days
so in yeah again yourself to point to
you can actually use the nativist input
type range from html5 and just to a
simple banging using a JSF attribute
here so as you can see this page is
almost entirely html5 they cause the
only thing that changes is here you have
an attribute that we actually find is
input pull up in value what happens here
is that DSM will translate this to a
component every one time but still you
can take full advantage of design that
you were developer can do and still or
just a little bit of JSF goals here to
make it dynamic so this actually bridges
the gap between where a web developers
do and what we do as Java developers so
the HTML values introduce this basf
attributes in finality
we have dynamic elements using JSF like
here and two pages are torn by a web dev
and Deverell can actually add this
these attributes even it's so simple
here even the web developer can
introduce these attributes to itself so
let's get on to the demo so to see how
this works in action I will share my
screen okay perfect so here we have the
application that we will be modifying in
the last WordPress writing a a web in
the real time applications with
WebSockets an html5 a Java EE 7 we build
this application here it's a speaker
book application you have visa stickers
from the left you have this kind of on
the right and you drag and drop the
stuff on here to here
and you see them on the screen you can
actually see this on multiple tabs or
windows so if you open this here you can
see they the same speakers on instead
and then I can write another and it will
be reflected on all the windows so this
is already working the solution that we
used here is just a pure HTML based page
so we went to have this list over here
on the left being adsf a dynamic
generated content so we want all these
speakers to come from the managed bean
and then we want to show them without
uttering too much over page and then we
will move the slider a little up to go
to the next next step which is a which
is actually showing a more days of code
on the HTML so let's go to it
so right now over applications looks
like this this is the the html5 the JSF
is neither that we have so right now it
looks like this we want to move it a
little forward a little bit so let's see
how our application looks like so here
we have the index.html file
it contains the basic styles that we
were going to use that you can see it
uses html5 syntax as a header it has a
navigation a element it has an aside
which is where is over speakers value
actually we have over content we have a
fan bus we have a footer and then we
have some other bits for debugging
purposes and also we have the style
actually keeps shape and to give a
script that actually goes all the magic
so we can modify this to make it a
little more a tea set like so the first
thing is that I want to save this
version of PHP mail for reference so I
will rename this HTML first I will
rename it to something like stickers
slash 1 is it my first version of the
specification so then I will create a
new HTML page I will create a new index
in this index what I plan to do is to
put the links to all the versions of the
of the page that I want to so actually
has so far I know that I want I want to
show you they they try their four steps
of the of the application the first step
is having html5 pure the second is
having just a little bit of CSS in there
then having components on the ASF with
some HTML 5 and finally having mostly
Darius's I want to note that all of
these are valuable solutions for your
application one is better than the other
you know it just depends on your
preference
KSS going to give you the flexibility to
use whatever you need in either html5
pure of which would include so much JSF
the sound is have the most to yourself
and to all DSS with just the required
things to make it a html5 compliant so
that's what I did here I base the these
things to these speakers a pigeon's
persons that i will create so right now
i will say be then let's see how it
looks like application I were running
again in a litany fallacious it's let us
continue so the idea is to have a
landing page where I can link to them to
the following pages accordingly so the
next thing that I want to do is to
create a dynamic content that I will use
on my own my dear self application so I
want some dynamic content generated in
DSM the thing that I really want is
these list of speakers over here I have
in the HTML type solution a lot of a
repeated a image in elements although
they are different images I really want
to generate is dynamically and it can be
done because it's here on the server I
have the older speakers over here and I
can all these older get all the speakers
and return just a relevant part which is
the name of this protest occurring image
this over here so here's the application
into the ferried load here we have the
links to all the all the pages we can
see that this these three doesn't work
because we haven't built in yet so here
we have the HTML version so let's create
this they Devine that I was talking
about that will generate the list of
this
these images so the first thing is to
create a new class I do this by
right-clicking selecting new it's like
Java class from the list and then this
cold is if the speaker so here we
have the the hit that will contain all
the speakers and and I were actually use
this beam to get all the images that I
have available so I would change the
package to make it a different looking
when I have a pairing WebSocket so now I
want to do some JSF and there we begin
from discuss JSF
since Java is six it's really simple to
to configure this in the in a managed
bean front a before mirror in previous
versions it was kind of difficult to
create a opinion that can be used on
debuts now is really simple you just
need to add a couple of annotations the
first is the names annotation the named
annotations comes from the garage index
package so this gives a baby in a name
that I can actually use on the on a map
on my JSF pages so I will give it a name
the next one is the scope that I went
for this bin as with ESF we have to give
it a simple scope so it actually knows
when to be applied in this case it's
just an application scope as you can see
there's a Eric's faces application scope
this is deprecated as of a day by 6:00
to come to use day one from derek
enterprise context so if they actually
do the same stuff so worried about the
other and I will just implement serial
disabled that so is good with these kind
of beans in the case they need to be
sent to different a to different
instances of our servers then
I will create a method that will
actually give me a list of speakers so
here I have the method that I want to
create so I will copy the code from from
us Tippett that I have over here and I
will go through the code you know really
fast just to show you what it is
supposed to do so here's the code that
actually pulls the resources the
speaker's folder for these contents it
get it from the servlet context object
so using the context
I pulled a the resource the resources
inside this this path and then I in this
part I just removed a tip as a there's a
bad element of a of the file name so I
will leave only detailing dot PNG
asteroid PNG as well PNG because here
this will return me the entire resource
particles that only resources as NASA
stickers - alien PNG well I just need
the alien PNG and the world being deep
so I with this I will actually
substitute that pairing and remove the
old a extra stuff that I don't want
actually that's the only thing that it
does or the piece I just cleaned a list
of of speakers it's actually those all
the trade-off of actually creating and
giving me the list of speakers so it's
really simple as you can see and can
we're done with a with a - mean for
there you so the next thing to create if
they is the actual gaze of you so to
create the gaze at view it just
right-click on my own on my provider
power anywhere I change I select new
it's read honor and here we can search
on the web a category database there is
the DA page and give it a name I know
that this is my second version a as you
remember moving my
a surface later elected I wanted to move
a little forward I want to move over
here so this is my second version of
there on my face so I believe in the
speaker's / school
David phase nets and then click finish
this will create the the jsf base but it
will also ask some configuration to our
a web.xml file or it will create it if
it doesn't exist so let's go to the
web.xml file first you can see here that
it added some stuff about a demo server
places to have the face a servlet that
will actually each of the mapping of
word or a sub a ending will run so
everything a prefix it by faces a slash
will be assembled by the face a servlet
in added some session configuration and
you think that I will delete a welcome
file list you can see that it will go
directly to the gage there's a index
page I don't want that I really want to
stay in my index.html which I have over
here
I don't wanted to go to a it is a first
so I can have they let my landing page
untold you can actually remove these
elements and it will do the same stop us
burning April index I will leave it
there so let's see my application so far
how it looks like hey let you reload it
and I entered here I can see that my
html5 version is in that I'm going to
enter here I can see that this page over
here says hello from facelets which is
actually what it says the speakers to
external page so we went now to convert
each version of the sticker page into
something using JSF with as most a html5
elements as possible
so how do I do it well it's actually
pretty simple I can actually copy
everything in this file paste it here
and I know nothing but that wasn't fair
right I mean boa Lateran guy couple
means oh yeah
remember we're dealing with with a with
HTML files so you have to close every
single element in your page so let's
close them see what happens and let's
search for another one because every
single that must be closed in order to
produce thing to work
oh let's see now it works you can see
that it feel worse what that's like
cheating I am NOT adding any any dynamic
elements here but let's do that deal by
little okay so let's go little by little
first I need to change this HTML
declaration a bit here because it
actually doesn't say anything about
namespaces and it specifically JSF
namespaces that I will need to use so I
need to add this namespace declarations
in order to have JSF components here so
I need a UI for iterating of stuff and
using face that's for complaining and I
need this guy over here
the JSF prefix which is a in this
namespace here it will actually allow me
to insert the years of attributes in my
in my HTML elements next I need to set
an ID for the hair and the body if this
is in order to actually insert the stuff
a specifically these scripts and these
things in here so how do I do that well
I just have to say a DSS ID important ID
will be really creative and just put
head up for the head
yes f i-b and put here a a deep body
yeah that sounds reasonable then here I
have this link and a script a elements
HTML element you refers to actually the
resources style.css and the storage a
JavaScript file that is under the
resources folder in case F everything on
the resources can be accessed and can be
referred directly so there's a basic way
to link to these pages to their
resources and to the styles what do I do
that well I just need to modify the link
element and trust people the path that I
have here for a DSS name a attribute and
the value of the attribute is the Earth
Day is directly the style of CSS a file
because it is inside of the resources
folder so it gives automatically say oh
it's a gates of resource so I have to be
referred like this and it will actually
give me the most efficient path to that
a resource instead of actually going
through all the case of India
translation it is the same thing with a
way with their script so I just say gay
except name and then the name of the
resource which is page crazy story based
at gads there's a special thing with the
script I don't want it to be on the head
now I in order to work correctly I want
it to be on the part of the body so I
can say be yourself target and then say
this part of the body it works for it
works great for it for designers or for
me I wanted to be part of the body
because that's the essentially works
better I mean so this would actually at
the discrete as part of this element
here or it can be declared in this head
so we don't mess with this
they want it to be then what about all
this stuff over here I want this to be
dynamic right and I actually have a beam
that gives me that endemic a name for
this or the all of these elements so I
won't believe every single one but one
this guy over here will leave it because
I need some kind of a reference so first
thing I want to iterate using this back
here a you I repeat will iterate over
over a collection so I know that I will
have a I will have a variable for each
iteration so I give it a name in this
case image name then I know that I need
to iterate a beam so it means that I am
going to iterate using this person
language see iterate the sticker sheet
got all speakers and I will close my UI
repeat just after this image element so
far what it did will do is it will
repeat this image element a for each a
speaker that I have so if I test my
application right now we look so cool
because I will have just aliens but now
I consider you city rating and I have so
many elements here and the name of the
element is in this variable so and I
actually do this like chain substituting
this alien PNG yes of course curiously
poodle image name and here as well mean
so let's reload and there you go you
have different speakers and now it still
works to get dynamic data using yourself
but you are using still the HTML image a
object well element look at this
here we have a another resource all the
speakers are inside the resources folder
so can I do a treat that I did here with
the JavaScript using the resources over
here the answer is yes I actually can't
so I can remove this part and substitute
the first by a period F name attribute
so let's see if this actually works
whoa there we go so we still have all
the functionality here we have the
bigger subversion that actually uses
some JavaScript
Sora from DSS he called inside and as
you can see I am drawing all the dynamic
elements from my case of a managed bean
and I actually using all the JSF a
capabilities I am using the resources I
am using any dynamic data and I can
actually continue with this a with with
binding is you can bind some inputs well
now let's move to a designer a little
forward so you can actually see what
happens if I want a or I have components
and I want a more html5 a compliant code
one thing is that a JSF is html5
compliant since a long long time ago
we were just missing some stuff but you
can actually use these tags before a
like the canvas and stuff so just won't
have any time a component parade but
let's see now how a case have solves the
problem
after using components so let's copy
this stickers to a file and it's pasted
it here so I have I create a copy and
let's call this stickers train
so in if you remember the SS or to have
been using it a you actually have is a
means basically eration let me open that
file his namespace declaration here
which is the HTML components for days
and one of them that is used a lot I
will substitute this image here it's big
graphic image graphic image component
actually just displays an image and to
keep the name of the resource in this
case canvas - and again into one below
and you just give it an ID like here and
I will just copy the style you just do
come all these in in standard cases and
I can remove this guy over here so let's
test this space string and there we go
to conceal exactly the same
functionality I have I cannot paint it
again correctly so this means that this
actually translates to an image what if
we try to do this here let's see what
happens so I have my graphic image just
as usual I remember these days of name
so I can actually copy this guy over
here
remove the years apart there we go do I
have a new style I think I do
so let's cut and let's paste here I
think this thing over here so we know
that what's left to beard clothes and
now he begins the problem do I have a
tractable a element a good no I don't
have that I I don't have either
entourage start I don't have that so and
I know this way I don't have the data
speaker that is from data start from
from html5
they're screwed so what do I do now this
this component does not have those a
attributes what I can do
in BSF 2.2 is adding these other
namespace declaration it's remix which
is they pass through parameters here so
what this allows me is to write a
attributes that will be passed through
and will be sent directly to the tag and
will be render directly they won't
suffer any transformation or special
treatment so I can actually talk pee on
drug start P data sticker there I go now
think about it for a minute
this allows you to extend all the all
the days have components that can air it
attacks to have any any attribute if you
just pass through them over so in theory
it will leave my eye page in fact and I
still have all the functionality that I
have so this is the other part further a
part of day of the story of having a
HTML 5 a coding your java in your JSF
pages here I have a component and I need
a specific stuff from from HTML side so
I can actually do that you will need to
do this in case you have a a set page
that actually has components and you
need this extra stuff it gives you more
flexibility than ever on your JSF pages
because now you are not restricted to
whatever they the year set the
specification tells you that attack as
you can see here I have a list of
attributes that I
on this that and you have all the
handlers but the new hunters like to
write and draw up or anything that has
to do with gestures you don't have them
yet so what you do instead is just use
the past repeaters and you just send
their attributes to the underlying task
and it gets rendered finally with this
this is just a kind of protocol he will
just add the final version of the of the
gears of a page there's a couple of more
changes that can be done a one of them
is of course changing everything buffer
to be more like they said I have the
cold over here so it will just a sit so
this is if you were doing yourself a the
gates of way you will have each head a
attributes elements you will have both
the style sheets like this you will have
audio elements but what about the new
stuff of html5 body by one headers what
if I want a navigations or a side
elements or footers well great news you
can still have them you just use them
justice to deal with some other HTML and
that's pretty much it I can feel replace
my unmarried Eve's for panel groups and
it will look nicer I think you can still
use a DX here with JSF 2.1 and the
problem bit will work and you can take
advantage of of day of all the days of
functionality inside an HTML page
so no more need to actually write
component a only pages to remember to
bridge this gap with these elements so
now this is either is more organic it's
not just here and then all the way here
either one or all or the other you can
actually move a little or a mortgage
safe or a little more to html5 as you
see they need to
and in case you have a pace that you
need a specific a html5 features you can
actually add them without modifying to
conform and for modifying or really new
components so that's I think that's a
great shame here so let's see the page a
how it's called a work we shouldn't see
any difference between all the versions
let's go to my index right here all the
list of all the patients all my html5
person so Pennington on your tab tell me
to chill them together this html5 you
can see it works and I can drag stuff
they give it with a little JSF gold I
saw that that thing is there we had
another one with more JSF code same
functionality and finally the ESF
component oriental one there are
difference of course between the source
studies generated a mean or differences
but still a you can you can actually see
it this a or probably when whenever to
judge a building page not a leader makes
much of a difference so once again
remember all of them are viable
solutions for your application it is not
that this is better than this or or vice
versa dude now you have the flexibility
to choose right your html5 page the for
a little JSF in there you have design a
friendly pages you know components keep
using them but you need something wrong
html5 paint your spanner past four
parameters and you're actually done with
it
well this concludes the tutorial as you
can see Jace after point will provide
some precedent flexibility while writing
dynamic web pages using gauge html5 and
ES 2.0
yeah 87 is more than just JSF 2.0
download the Java EE 7 SDK and begin
developing applications with IE 7 today
you can find the SDK as well as
