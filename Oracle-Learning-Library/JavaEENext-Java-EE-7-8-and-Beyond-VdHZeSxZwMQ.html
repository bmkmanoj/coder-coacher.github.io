we're here to see a smackdown no we
actually have a really good panel here
we've got four very distinguished
gentlemen this is a what's this panel
about Ian by the way yeah so you can be
discussing a kind of a feature of the
enterprise and standards and and even
maybe some some product ideas I don't
know but first of all let's to get
through our contestants a little bit
more can we start with Ian and work our
way down and maybe spend a minute and
just talk about yourself what you do why
are you here and what you'd like to
accomplish sure hi I'm Ann Robinson I'm
from IBM my job role at IBM is the I'm
the chief architect of the WebSphere
application server so I'm in the GE
business have been for a long time going
back before Jerry I've worked on a bunch
of distributive middleware architectures
koerber before Jerry have to say java ee
has never made me look back it's a hell
of a lot simpler than corporator was
although corpus still under pins at
least half of it lately so when you look
at the focus that we have in IBM apart
from the obvious focus is that everybody
has around cloud and mobile and social
and so on we've been spending a lot of
time trying to move the perception that
java ee is heavyweight in to a direction
where it's not perceived as being
everywhere i don't know how many people
were in the luminous session talking
about spring earlier on but all the
jokes about heavyweight were addressed
that the guys in purple like me so I'm
going to be talking a lot about
modularity this afternoon and then
lightweight Java runtimes
I'm mark littell I'm vp of engineering
jboss so basically everything that
happens in jboss reports into me in one
way or another a bit like in my
background dates back to way before Java
past Cobra as well I think all we did
some very good things did some very bad
things as well we're definitely focused
a lot on you know open source
application server e6 e7 mobile cloud so
are all things that probably everybody
in this room has used in one way or
another if not how is that I'm certain
some of our competitors one of the
things that were pushing a lot recently
is the fact that there's a lot of new
languages that are on the horizon or are
being used today on the JVM and some of
those communities are starting to
reinvent the wheel when you know we
think there's some perfectly good wheels
already out there they may be written in
Java but doesn't mean to say that you
can't access them through other
languages and we also think that a bit
like in that the heavyweight nature of e
is something that we should definitely
see the end of because it's it's
certainly not true you know you don't
have to implement an bloated application
server in ee 6 you can if you want to
but you don't have to and we didn't so
my name's Cameron pretty I work at
Oracle and when you were talking about
heavy weighted I just wanted to tease
you at the time and say well they
weren't talking about ee they were
talking about websphere but
but here's actually the problem with
that both websphere and jboss have done
major e architecture work in the latest
versions and liberté the liberty
profile on websphere for example that
was the french pronunciation yes and
fraternity a qualitative okay as a
french-canadian because but so actually
a tremendous amount of investment from
both you so i wear two hats at Oracle I
our Java platform so a lot of the work
in the community that we do and around
standards in which case these guys are
my best friends I also manage our
commercial and open-source application
servers which is why these guys are my
worst enemies so we we both cooperate in
fact I have calls fairly often with
quite a few different vendors and
projects in the space and we also
obviously have our own weblogic
application server which was formerly
from DEA and also glassfish our open
source application server which also
doubles to provide the reference
implementation for java ee itself and i
think that's enough intro next I'm Scott
Ferguson I'm the main developer for the
resident application server I've
implemented most of the specs in Java EE
several times over which has sometimes
been painful and sometimes been fun
mostly fun been doing this for what 15
years now since JSP was a 092 back in
that time when Java had a reputation for
being slow we did a bit of work and
started to prove to everybody that yes
in fact it was as good or better than
the sea based and we've been we like to
make things go fast so continue to
working on that trying to beat the sea
bass guys on the specs in java ee the
they weren't hopefully we'll talk more
about this in this presentation but been
really excited about the WebSocket spec
and some of the more
forward-looking directions in HTTP going
beyond what we've been working with for
the past several years and saying well
let's get like real messaging let's get
real communication let's get real
interactive applications going and my
hope is that the WebSockets spec which I
worked with the bid on the ITF will
enable us to write more and more
interesting applications I think they'll
be yet great thank you okay by the way
my name is mike kita I'm an architect at
Oracle or work in the Java EE
specifications and the platform so I'm
going to ask some questions and I'm
hoping that you guys are going to ask
some questions I don't have any prizes
to wait best question gets a video
multiplexer about that so maybe we can
start off with a a question from the
audience because I know you've got so
many of them burning inside of you I
don't see any microphones so you can
choose you can either come up here kick
me off and use this microphone or you
can just stand up where you are and yell
you're fast you get this just for your
hand I think you're in the wrong talk
actual that's next door right now sorry
Kara Kara you want to direct that
anybody specific or you wanted to ask
the panel all right I thought I saw it
burns in here somewhere in the front row
so we can't stand up on it
that model delivered
who here thinks it's a cleanser
so on top of that I mentioned so even
though he runs a lot of the work around
jsf and the community and specs and
things like that he's also one of the
biggest proponents at Oracle of what we
call the thin server architecture which
is what we're driving for in html5 which
is being able to push functionality that
used to be done on the server in terms
of generating what got displayed by the
browser being able to push that down and
make the client side richer in terms of
being able to work with the data model
and not just to be a renderer like an
old green screen except with HTML
anybody else nope that's it okay thank
you for the question next just well what
about platform as a service for java ee
8 you ask that's a good question who'd
like to answer it what do you mean by
platform as a service yeah you all throw
the question back in your court trick so
I think you know if you've seen the
recent announcements know in order to
hit the e7 deadline of April next year
we've moved a few things out and cloud
was the obvious one because you know we
still spread the fact that cloud and
platforms of service has been on the
height curve for a while and various
vendors have got e6 based past
implementations out there I still don't
think there's enough experience of you
know using it what are the pros and cons
sharing those experiences which is what
happens when you standardize things for
us to actually delay e7 or trying to a
botched job and get it in there
or April so I think moving cloud out was
a good thing but I do not think that we
can do that again so II eight is really
the last point at which path should
appear that we can't say we're going to
punt it and do Danny nine because we
have missed the boat by then oh sorry
well funny you should mention that yes
so could you also take 10 seconds and
tell us a little bit about what you guys
are doing to pass already not in a
standard putting your products uh well
yeah yeah thank you can I'll beat up on
you later yeah I owe you a drink so I
mean yeah we-we've for the past year
we've been running on openshift which is
our our platforms of service we were
running a s7 and then EAP 6 which is our
product eyes version of the community
and we've done the web profile on the
full profile pretty much on modify
unmodified at this point as in we
haven't had to change any of the specs
we've obviously had to you know code
around or give enhancements to the specs
which you want to feedback but since we
added Java and subsequently as7 and II
EAP 62 openshift we've seen the the
interest and the traffic go increase
fifty to one hundred percent you know
month on month and now jboss and
specifically a p6 drives more traffic to
open shift and pretty much anything else
so I think that shows there's a great
demand for e based platform as a service
which again I think we need to
standardize as soon as we can as soon as
it makes sense but not by April next
year anybody else must say yeah i'm
actually not clear whether the
pass most of the past capabilities
really belong at the Java EE level or if
they belong in something like the open
chip level I mean clearly need to be
defined management wise or rest wise at
the open shift level whether that
becomes something that exposed to the
developers is not clear to me at all
because the model of past is you develop
your application and it just mostly
works so do you need new api's do you
need new specs at this level I'm not
sure yet if we see a real need for it
that would be one thing but right now
it's more of a requirement without needs
and I think again waiting would be a
good thing and it might be that it just
doesn't belong in Java EE but does
belong in all of the app servers just at
a different level and I think what we'll
find over the next year is exactly what
that balance is because it chances are
we can solve eighty percent of the
problem with a very small number of
additions to Java EE and the question is
how much beyond eighty percent do we go
so you already see vendors other than
open the unfortunately named openshift
you'll never believe what we call it
internally all I would build a few times
myself but there's also let's see my old
boss at oracle stephen harris went to
cloudbees start up there doing paths
using java i think on ec2 for example
and IBM i believe has some some some
password as well products but you know i
think what we'll see is as you have 10
products emerge or 15 products emerge or
more likely on the products emerge will
look at them and it should become
obvious pretty quickly where the
trade-off is in terms of you know what
can we achieve without overburdening the
platform and remember java is about
write once run anywhere and in java ee
we actually have a surprising ability to
take applications and move them from
from platform to platform from
implementation implementation and we'd
like to accomplish the same thing from
cloud to cloud so
we'll just have to figure out where that
where that trade audience and the
question i think the skull is saying the
beginning there one of the questions is
we're moving from cloud to cloud how
important is it that the metadata that
you need to deploy an application into a
cloud itself needs to be portable
clearly the applications that run on the
Java EE infrastructure in the cloud you
want the apps to be portability the
approach we've taken to pass in IBM for
for websphere platforms is it is is to
enable java ee applications to be
deployed as absolutely bog standard
portable java ee applications but to
take away from the deployer the the need
to understand what the topology needs to
look like so this is we come up with
these metadata that we describe as
virtual application patterns which is
just extra metadata around your Java EE
application and that takes care of you
know how many low balance of VMs need to
be provisioned what is the elastic
scaling policy for this application of I
want this application to run with you
know not consuming more than fifty
percent CPU or not running more than 12
class there are instances what kind of a
caching layer does it need to interact
with what kind of databases does it need
to interact with provision those VMs in
the cloud and you know from so from a
from a division of responsibility
between you know d standardized has in
Java EE or not that depends on how
portable you warmth that sort of virtual
application patent metadata to be but
the apps need to be portable hey thank
you
I
dms is a very established dinner
maybe there is you see
container
system where you respect the
what we have
you can't really write my
sir
we see it as a pass responsible yeah you
can say that that's we see it's not the
absurd and the apps of may be able to
bind to them if they're present I
sure
well I think it sounds to me that that's
more of a driver issue I mean for
example if you're using jdbc in a sense
you've got the same problem you've got
different drivers are using oracle are
using my sequel are using post res well
the provider of the database is
providing that driver JMS is really the
same way i know we it's more invisible
than jdbc is but if you're using hornet
q if you're using activemq if you're
using RabbitMQ they have to provide a
JMS driver that we as app server vendors
just cook in so we're not I'm not going
to write a Hornet q driver for JMS but
if they provide one that's standard we
can hook that up with CD I or J and D I
so in the case of Amazon because you
mentioned that if there's not a JMS
driver someone could write 10 or someone
needs to write one well the my sequel I
mean just to take an example it's not it
should be but take the original my
sequel driver was written by someone who
wanted to use my secret from Java that
had no relation to anything and just
wrote one that if no one does that might
have to happen I think the other thing
to keep in mind is that a lot of the
services you see appearing within so you
know cloud is mostly vaporware right by
definition but a lot of the services as
they're appearing are are very
watered-down services so if you look at
the queuing on Amazon it's cheap in both
meanings of the term and so it is not
really a JMS equivalent what it is is
for Danny it's more of a notification
engine than it is a messaging engine and
so the real question is is is will they
over time you know improve the fidelity
of their services so that they could
actually sit behind something like a JMS
API or are they you know content that
that their messaging is
you know the messaging equivalent of PHP
or you know so it's a you know quick and
dirty and unreliable okay i'm gonna i'm
going to cut cut it off there i'm going
to actually see we can turn this a
little bit on a different path i think
we could probably speak all day and all
night about where the delineation point
is between javi specs on the cloud and
probably that will happen at some point
in the future there'll be many days
wasted on that but at this point i think
i'd like to get back to the java ee
specifications themselves and and what
we would like to see in the future and
so I'm going to ask a question all four
of these guys are very very technical
and so I'm comfortable asking this
question once your I guess the pain
point that you see in the Java EE
specification now that you think we need
to spend the most time on fixing what do
you see as a future candidate for
improvement in the coming releases I'd
like to make it easier for the platform
as a whole to be sliced and diced more
dynamically than it can be at the moment
so so we have it went when you look back
at how it's the platforms evolved over
the years ee 6 made a huge step forward
by defining the web profile that good
move so we should all pay ourselves on
the back for that but you know that's
one profile and it is a static profile
that this is a set of j srs that make up
the web profile i think when you know
when java ee is underpinning up as what
you what we really need to see in the
future is a much more dynamic subset of
technologies that make up a platform so
that it's not just on the one hand web
versus on the other hand full profile I
don't think we need to define 101
different profiles that you know combine
everything in a you know combinatorial
explosion of different ways of confining
jsr s I just think that the platform as
a whole needs to be more relaxed about
dynamic combinations of jss depending on
what the
applications that are being deployed to
the cloud actually require now today you
know you can it's very easy and we've
all built application servers that you
know can start up with less than the
full java ee profile that's easy what
isn't so easy to do is to take aspects
of individual J SRS and an identify
reasonable sensible subsets so to give a
concrete example if I wanted to build an
application that I deployed into my
cloud that essentially just used the web
profile and MD bees it isn't clear at
the moment from the ejb specification
whether that's allowable or not depends
on how you read it I think we need to be
more clear in the future that there are
subsets of j SRS that it does make sense
to be able to pull out without having to
implement the whole of the jsr and i
think probably the biggest technical
barrier to doing that at the moment is
the structure of the TC case which makes
it quite difficult to test subsets to
certification oh you still need
certification of the technologies that
you are implementing in order to support
port abilities we just need to do a
better job of slicing and dicing it well
we'll come back to that later probably
well I don't know if it's exactly the
kind of quick question you ask but i
would say that one of the things apart
from paths that we need to address is
well two things actually one I kind of
agree with within although i would say
that our pain point is more to
categorize the different types of
deployment environments that we actually
think that II should be deployed on to
its no longer well sending our view it's
no longer just laptops and desktops and
mainframes it's embedded devices it's
mobile devices whether they be
bones or you know pads and despite the
fact that we got you know the full web
profile running on a raspberry pi it
wasn't exactly the fastest kid on the
block there were some things that we
would like to have got rid of and doing
that maybe in a dynamic fashion would an
in a sub setting fashion like Ian
mentioned would be good but one of the
things I definitely would like us to see
over the over the next few years is
standardized on a jpa like approach for
no sequel and big data because whether
we like it or not that's a big area and
no I think quite a lot of its hype but
there is some good things in there and
you know we I think it's from a
standards perspective it's it's our duty
to standardize around that because at
the moment it's just another great great
way for vendors to have vendor lock-in
even in the same space whether you're
tuple space based or dock space based
there's no standard API so Mike finally
works on the jpa standard in the team
that he works for that Oracle
contributes to eclipse link which is the
reference implementation for jpa we've
actually prototyped just that so so it's
a good work we're in total agreement
review so you know sometimes I think
back to weird j2ee j2ee took off in the
first place right just does anyone
remember writing servlets I just was it
like if you go back you remember CGI and
you had to like put a executable
somewhere and then it would like run it
and you'd have to like parse standard in
to get the header and like and all of a
sudden we had a servlet now you can see
if you knew cgi you look at certainly
die I could do that right but you could
see that mapping and suddenly you were
less about you know managing the process
and more about managing their request
response right so who here actually
builds applications raise your hand
Beijing it who builds applications now
keep keep up wait wait keep em all up
now now keep them up now who here you
can drop your hand if it's okay for your
application to stop running and you know
its availability doesn't matter drop
your hand
and if if if you think for sure you'll
never need more than say one server to
run your app drop your hand alright you
notice something like ninety-nine
percent of people to raise their hand
need high availability and scalability
you can put your hands back you know so
just like we did with servlets back in
j2ee 10 if you will actually pre jtv 10
we need to do the same thing with
elasticity we need to do the same thing
with high availability and you know
those those things need to be baked into
the platform so that when we're creating
components think about what we did was
service we were creating components we
didn't have to write the server we just
drop the component on there and it took
15 seconds to start up that was a joke
I'd like to do the same thing I'd like
to create components and have them
automatically be highly available have
them automatically be scalable so how do
we bake those things in so that every
you know every framework doesn't have
its own way to do it and every developer
doesn't have its own way to do that how
do we how do we bake that into
everything we do by the way by raising
your hand you all agreed to purchase an
oracle database decide you i'm actually
to have a trouble with the the premise
of the question because maybe i just
suffered through too much in java j2ee
and the original ej bees but i'm pretty
happy with the direction that we're at
right now i'm looking at what we're
getting making available in java ee 7
y.o the cleanup of CDI the WebSocket
we're putting in the rest is becoming
part of the web profile we've got you
know Jason is becoming real and we're
not we used to have specs that had no
purpose except for a power point in some
marketing persons slide I don't see that
as much anymore all of the things I see
in the java ee spec I know what they're
for now that we dropped the cloud stuff
that I didn't understand what that was
for so I'm not going to complain I think
we're right now doing about as well as
we've done in all the time I've been
working on this 25 not 25 for 15 years
but this is the time to complain this is
the paddle plane of lousy one drop
horrible from we're listening you're
listening I might just get something for
Christmas I don't know okay now it's
your turn why not turn out so many horn
in the front yeah okay what is
interesting pressure is about other
technologies
if the managers coming to me saying you
know just feels like all these other
people who are productive in Java
developers how do we increase
change perception so that we're not
looking at
so just to repeat that question for
those of you in the back he's talked
about some of the other things have come
along and specifically languages and
dynamic languages and things that have
come and seen at least from the outside
to be more productive and how do we how
do we deal with the perspective that
people sometimes have that we are a
legacy language this is I guess more of
a Java thing than I ething but yeah I
guess you can translate to this at the
platform as well at the enterprise level
her headstone I'd say embrace and extend
what I mean by that is i don't think the
rubies and the closures and scholars and
whatever is going to go away i also
don't think java is going to go away I
think the JVM is definitely going to
outlive anyone language that runs on it
and to be perfectly honest think we
should seriously consider removing the J
from the JVM and just calling it you
know an nvm multi-language virtual
machine i don't know but yes i have
patented that okay yeah the polyglot
virtual machine here so i think we
should embrace I think there are good
reasons why some people might want to
use Ruby in conjunction with Java and I
think the JVM is a absolutely fantastic
platform to do that on that you know
when we made the decision in 2009-2010
to allow the JVM from more than just
Java it kind of put us in the in the
same area that Microsoft had been
talking about for over 10 years where
they were you know with with the whole
net framework he was saying you know the
CLI that you could you could write
objects in C in C sharp and you could
inherit them in visual basic and and in
C++ well we can do that now in the JVM
because you can have an application
that's running on the same jvm that's
written in Ruby calling java calling
closure calling scarlet calling whatever
you like I sure wish I sure wish on this
panel we had someone who wrote the
fastest PHP implicating 20
I if you're not aware we have PHP
implementations on the JVM and um like
nice guys that I did the bulk of the
work on so I can talk to you about
anything PHP you want to know including
sleep so just to sum weekend I mean let
me speak to the PHP obviously because I
can talk about that there are some nice
things about using language like PHP
there's some terrible things about
language like PHP now if you're looking
at a SE model view model for your
application well your view at some point
is going to be some kind of template
language I mean JSP is in a sense and
new language you can put Java in it but
it's got his tags it's XML why not move
that to PHP for the sorts of things that
change a lot that your graphic designers
you know this has to move here at custom
fair PHP for example or let me just I'll
be use PHP but could be any language
that works on the JVM you know fantastic
templating fantastic flexibility but if
you're writing a hard you know the
database layer the access layer the
messaging layer these stuff that needs
to be tested with your J unit and just
has to work you're not going to use PHP
for that where you should not be using
PHP for that so we have because the JVM
gives us the capability of putting
languages on it to use the right
language for the right task if your task
is something that needs to be really
flexible needs to be productive for
engineers who maybe find Java more
difficult that are more difficult to
that are easier to hire say PHP people
then partition your product into that
piece and leave the difficult stuff for
the Java people so I don't think we have
a problem as a platform I think
were in the best position of any to take
advantage of that and we're just going
to add that i would ask somebody to
define what they mean by productivity
because if they're going to go with the
new language and it's not based on the
JVM and they find their developers are
writing high-performance messaging
systems from scratch or transaction
systems from scratch or security
implementations from scratch that's not
increased productivity that's a waste of
time do it on the JVM put a veneer or
whatever language you've got you like
whether it's PHP whether it's Ruby
whether its closure and sit that veneer
on top of it doesn't have to be a
full-blown app server but there's you
know components of an app server now
you've made investments in JavaScript je
vais right yeah we've working we've got
dine je s is we got the one of the main
developers have dined it dine j/s works
for us we've hired the two key guys from
JRuby they work for us we've got a
project called ask jaz which is
basically a JavaScript based app server
if you like which sits on top of a s7
which hides all of the Java nurs you
don't need to know anything about Java
and of course an obvious advantage with
put in all of these different languages
or as many as we can into the JVM means
that you can take advantage of all of
the operational procedures that we've
all built up in our enterprises around
managing those VMs so as VMs evolved
over the years to support multi-tenancy
you know maybe multiple processes
running in a single shared vm you know
if all if we can if we can build VMs
that support multiple different
languages they will all benefit from
that so that's the direction that we
need to go in and also say you know as
you saw in Java EE 6 you know we've
dramatically improved protic
tivity in java ee you know previous to
EE 6 you know spring is probably the
biggest example really showed how on top
of a job java ee server you could have a
much better development experience and
we learned from that in the work that we
did in java ee 6 to the point now where
the comments i get is that it's easier
to build for java ee 6 than it is even
for something like spring so we
dramatically pushed that that goal line
forward but at the same time you know we
can't stop here i mean we have to think
about what the next you know set of
things are that we can we can simplify
and incorporate into the platform so but
we'll never be as simple as you know
right one file you know and it shows up
I mean that's it we can't be all things
to all people so while we should drive
consistently to push out complexity from
from the system we shouldn't pretend to
be you know just a simple you know
interpretive web server that does you
know that that my mom could throw up a
website in a weekend all right I have to
say my favorite sound bite was Mark
little thing we should embrace so those
of you who are tweeting extent we should
embrace not expand world peace okay
another question
it's regarding jax-rs that's part of
Java EE so you're allowed to ask it
well it sounds like a very specific
question but what the question you want
is what why why are we not standardizing
on waddle yeah have you read the rest
specification so don't rest does not
need an interface definition language
okay didn't see you then so you can
disagree rest does not need a interface
definition language okay sounds like
you're going very tightly coupled there
oh this is always
other
that's the definition change
home or the other
these things are local
of creating the client
high level
for generating
hope your service they can just
yeah I'll have a look at that but I know
that you know waddle didn't get mass
adoption if anything it was probably one
of the most divisive inputs to the whole
rest community for a long time and I
kind of reference what I said earlier
about standardizing too early which was
reference to the cloud stuff there is
more there are more examples of people
writing large-scale rest based services
that don't touch waddle then there are
that do use model and if experience
teaches us anything it's to go with what
works more often than what doesn't so I
would be worried about the standardizing
waddle in ECE 839 okay well maybe sorry
maybe you can talk about that yeah this
thing like that's a circle so did the
question did the question get answered
by the way yeah
so there's your house okay yeah totally
talk with him question at the back with
the highest hand is it Jax all rights
night here or what did I miss the memo
so security I think yeah you probably
have the right guy to talk to you about
there maybe you want to talk to him it's
not so much a platform as a
I could certainly envision that as well
yeah
and it's also fairly divisive topic
because a lot of people in the Resta
community it is known you know they look
at topics like security and like where
you're defeating the entire purpose of
rest litter box or transactions or and
it's the same conversation we had when
Web Services came out we're like okay
the giver guys are just getting jobs as
web services implementers now apparently
so so it's certainly an area of pretty
significant debate a lot of people think
that you start adding all those things
and you end up with web services again
and that's a that's a good discussion
for another panel I expect do we have
any other questions we do how about at
the very back
yes no we already have java ee 6 started
to drop stuff java ee 7 will drop more
stuff and we have a way of doing that
that's part of the standards process we
work with you know across the expert
groups and with the ja ve expert group
itself to determine what we can drop and
the nicest part of that is that you know
if you don't have hundreds of developers
to build an app server why would you
want to be maintaining this ejb 10 cmp
disaster for example right I love the
web profile just personally just be cut
well I'm just for the details for us
because before that we were asked to
implement stuff that none of our
customers needed so we were spending a
really small company and so our time
spent on stuff people don't need matters
this goes back to the modularity
question that was brought up if we can
define this is what people need then we
can as app server developers focus more
on what our customers are asking us to
spend time on so actually let me ask you
a detail about that question so as
cameron said ejb3 too does make remoting
optional but there are some things that
it chooses for reasons of backward
compatibility at this point in time not
to get rid of so container managed
persistence that becomes optional don't
have to implement it anymore what about
egb 2.1 interfaces though what about ejb
two point X metadata formats right now
the spec isn't making those optional
because if it did make those optional
then vendors would no longer have to
implement those things and applications
that use those old interfaces would
break would you like to see those gone
as well just just to qualify as well
that nothing ever gets
dropped in he right things become
optional so no one gets left behind yeah
and I'm not suggesting whether it would
be a good or a bad thing to get rid of
those things I'm just interested in in
your opinion should they go it's
difficult isn't it to decide where to
draw the line knows them all right all
right why don't we do that then so let's
have a show of hands in order to make
the egb specification more option I mean
more optional than it is at the moment
with people in this room be willing to
risk vendors moving more stuff out of
their implementation and risk making
applications less portable for exist for
example by getting rid of ejb 2.1
interfaces who would who would who would
vote to get window interfaces do you
mean to point o interfaces like the
remote homes yeah yeah two point O has
to phone I beg your pardon be happy to
see them go alright that's we're getting
on yeah who wouldn't okay so that's a
majority in favor of getting being more
radical yeah but I could go sorry do
they may be that there's a sample a
sample here that is skewed maybe all
those legacy guys can't get away from
their cobol desks but i but i can't
comment any other comments on that
question okay next question somebody is
over here we had a couple of questions
that okay no jar no jax-rs allowed okay
okay why don't we stirred Scott over
here right well I've been looking
forward to it I was hoping it was being
java ee 7 just personally as a way to
organize our own java SE 7 Jessie said
right so it was disappointed when it was
dropped you know I understand that you
know on the other hand a language
feature that's complicated if it gets
wrong can be really painful for like
decades Cheers I'm okay with generics
datetime however for poor stuff of the
string string options so I'd love to see
that I don't know what affects some of
those would have with the specs i know
for CD at CDI you could have an
interesting set of modularity models in
CDI that would be i played around with
that like a year or so ago with with
that it would be interesting it gets
complicated really fast modularity
because you have visibility and chain
visibility and so it's not crazy that
they put it off I would love to see them
do it right because I think it would
help make all of our code bases just
cleaner and nicer so if chicks'll makes
it into se9 then we could presumably be
looking forward to exploiting it in ie10
which i think would be about 20 so 80 90
so that might be 2017 I can't do the
maths anyway um I think meanwhile I
think you're the observation that's been
made earlier on is that we already have
lightweight java ee runtimes java ee
isn't every way anymore I don't believe
he needs project jigs or you can build
run times with subsets of j srs you can
build runtimes I think we've had at
least three of the folks up here we've
got runtimes that run on these you know
crazy little raspberry pi devices I mean
you couldn't imagine doing that with
Java
few years ago but today you can java is
already pretty modular when you look at
work that goes on outside of the JCP
there's been work going on in the osgi
alliance for example for a number of
years now in the enterprise expert group
working with the Java EE community to
specify metadata associated with Java EE
specs so that you can build modular
runtimes that have a service based
approach to transactions and persistence
and web applications you can deploy web
application bumbles in a completely
standard way that are you know that are
compliant we broke the Java EE JCP
defined specifications and contain
standardized by the osgi Alliance osgi
metadata in them as well so there are
already perfectly adequate working
solutions for building modular java ee
platforms the reason what the hell i'm
wearing my web special actually
Cameron's wearing his websphere sure as
well which is good to see me the reason
we were able to run websphere on small
constrained environments like the pie is
because we use osgi technology
internally under the covers to make our
run time modular there are different
ways you can do you don't have to use a
HR but my point is there are solutions
that exist already and I don't think he
needs jigsaw this is TM lewin oh I'm
sorry
you know the 400-pound I thought that's
the same as the ejb to one question
isn't it so in terms of jigsaw I mean I
think I think we're modularity comes in
that could be quite handy is is to
support some of the things we're talking
about but certainly it's not absolutely
essential it's something that will
simply make it nice I mean as you can
see with osgi and glass fish are our
open source application server is built
from the ground up on osgi and on a
microkernel architecture and I know that
several other app servers also use so as
GI in one way or another but you know
what will be nice is when we have less
you know less redundancy in terms of
packages less collisions in terms of
versioning all those things and jigsaw
should help with that and what project
Penrose is about is how we make jigsaw
how we build it in such a way that even
osgi can benefit from it because there's
a lot of complexity that osgi had to
take on because the JVM and the JDK
packages were not oh I don't know how to
say this nicely we're not intuitive from
a modular ization point of view in fact
one of the reasons that jigsaw is late
is because we have been refactoring
package after package after package
after package of java libraries to
decouple them from each other so that we
will be able to effectively modular eyes
java without breaking every application
out there key question at the back
yes next question so yeah clearly people
have done some work to make that happen
already in and it seems like that's the
general direction of some of the
standards though this there is
embeddable websphere correct there's an
embeddable jboss there's an embeddable
glassfish and you're you're you're
usually in bed boy yeah listen your tiny
tiny yeah any other questions okay we
have five more minutes
and
anybody want to take that the grid it's
a caching there are pretty significant
improvements that need to be made to
Java serialization to start with but yes
it is it is definitely a big problem I
think jigsaw is also part of that in
terms of solving some of the version
collision with in a running jbm so you
wouldn't have to restart JVMs and be
able to actually have as you can today
with osgi multiple versions of the same
class and having a better more portable
more virginal on the wire or or in
binary form format for data and the
specialized objects but also I think
give a precursor to solving that I don't
think that will be solved in one step I
think it's a multi-phase effort
the question was do you have a strategy
for java ee on a mobile environment like
if there's kind of related to the
question back there or you're well I
mean is this in terms of standards or
where as individual van vendors but both
oh well so you know we we've got work
going on and boarding our app server to
Android at least a little bit easier
than having to rewrite in objective-c
well
I
yeah and we also have the newly
announced java embedded with a job
embedded suite which i believe is an
oracle product not a standard yet but
that's uses of glassfish in an embedded
form that would fit on Android or Linux
some an arm or anything like that so you
start you're starting to see significant
work there but I think it's still very
early to suggest how that will impact
standardization obviously glassfish and
the merger of emmy and SE will not
classify meant sorry jigsaw too many too
many clothes words jigsaw and the merger
of Emmy and SE based on jigsaw will also
make it much more possible for us to
slim down the Java form factor but but
your question was I think you were
specifically talking about ee and you
know whilst obviously we can all put a
ee runtimes on a mobile phone on a
mobile phone for for fun but but but
right but a mobile profile I think would
be a profile of se rather than E and in
fact that's what's going on I mean that
it would be you know maybe not I mean
maybe oh maybe our customers a little
bit more adventurous well mo so mobile
applications are as good as interesting
as the enterprise data the enterprise
services that they connect to and I
think you know the where the real heavy
lifting is done is is not on the devices
it sits in the back end so but with that
said could you give an example because I
know I know the background a little bit
of what you're describing may be
described just one example customer
application where this we're putting
jboss onto android save them money or
time or something why would customers do
that um I can't go into specific details
about customer names and money about I
can give you a real world example of a
requirement that we we've seen
relatively recently it's not e based at
least not in terms of standard but it
it's it's relevant to enterprise Java so
we're seeing several customers who are
interested in having an ESB deployed on
to a mobile phone and they have their
apps that are developed by themselves or
related set of customers that when
they're deployed on to the phone or the
pad they bind to the ESB and then all
communication flows through the ESB and
out of the phone and onto the back end
device of the ESB does the routine as it
might do on the phone might do some data
translation and might even route between
apps on the same phone so it never you
know your your invocation never hits the
the network at all I see someone from
Qualcomm not in and nodding out in the
audience all right well that's all the
time we have let's they did a wonderful
job each and every one of them let's
give them all a hand and give ourselves
a hand
all your questions come back again next
