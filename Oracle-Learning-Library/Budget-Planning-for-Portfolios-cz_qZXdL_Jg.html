projects and initiatives are of greatest
value to the company what is the budget
which projects should be funded and
which projects should be deferred in
this video we will explore creating a
budget plan selecting projects using
what-if scenarios and then approving and
monitoring the health of the budget plan
to get started create a portfolio that
includes all the projects to be
considered next define the planning
horizon for the portfolio use the budget
planning page to view time phased costs
for all the projects in the portfolio
this allows you to evaluate cost
constraints for the planning period
select the planning period you want to
budget for enter a target budget and
distribute it for each time period
then view or add proposed budgets for
each project creates multiple what-if
scenarios against different project
attributes a really great attribute is
the project evaluation score this is
where project managers rank and score
their projects against organizational
priorities use this score to help select
the best projects for the planning
period the water lining view can help
you select projects set up a view with
all projects that total up to the target
budget then rank the projects by their
evaluation score
select projects above the waterline to
include them in the plan selection
analysis views provide another option
for selecting projects use a variety of
charts to display project data the
charts are interactive based on the
project selection in the grid ok you are
down to a couple of scenarios for the
budget plan now it's time to collaborate
with stakeholders and project managers
to choose one prime provides ready-made
workflows for this process or you can
customize your own when the budget plan
is approved and moves into the execution
phase use the spending page to track
actual costs against the current
approved budget for the budget plan
project costs are captured monthly
quarterly and yearly the financial
breakdown section allows you to analyze
detailed time-phased
cost data for example there may be a
time period when actuals exceed budget
view the time period to see which
projects are impacting the cost if an
approved budget plan needs changes
revise it to increase budget or put some
projects on hold the current plan will
remain in place until a new one is
approved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
