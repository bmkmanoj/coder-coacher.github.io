see all of you here today my name is
Alan Gregerson I'm one of the two
founders of civilian I'm going to
present dynamic class we loading in the
wild with davillon so I'm going to show
you some exciting stuff today and with
me today I have Ronnie an from a company
called submission in Austria and
question from from the NetBeans team
from Oracle and the way we'll do this
presentation is that i'll be presenting
the core capabilities of civilian and
show you some quick demos of a sample
java SE application and some java ee
stuff at the very end then Renee will
will actually talk about his usage of
civilian and he will present himself
more formally in the in his in his talk
so just to give you a brief background
information here is on what we were
actually talking about you do have some
limited form of hot swapping
capabilities and it build into the Java
language or the JVM called the hot swap
and you probably all know about this so
it's basically you have this class with
codes in it and you have your ID running
a debugging session that then the
developer changes some code and wants to
apply this code and he simply can apply
the hot swap and it will be right into
the running JVM the problem with this is
that it's really limited you can only
support changes to method parties and I
think that we really need to support
full class reloading in order to
preserve the code quality in your in
your production code because any
limitation that you put into a class
reloading system will actually in some
way affect your code quality because
those restrictions you will try to work
around them because you don't want to
restart your applications so if you have
some capabilities to actually reload
changes into your system you will
actually try to overcome these
workarounds all these restrictions build
in small workarounds that could actually
produce less quality code so what we
really do need is a full capable
or reloading system and that's exactly
where Jeff alien comes into the picture
so before I dig into the capabilities
and show the core features i'll actually
be showing you a demo of a space
invaders game built on the NetBeans
platform by an italian student about
just over a year ago so what we do have
here is a very boring space invaders
game and I wouldn't even call the game
this version so I have five provisions
of this game building some a local
repository and I'm going to apply
updates to the system while I'm playing
it so you can see the capabilities of
dynamic updating with your villain so
the first thing that I would like to add
is like some movement through the aliens
and to the red boxes right so let's just
switch to the next revision yeah and to
apply the update in netbeans you have to
just press reload and Tyga platform and
the update will be applied in the
running system so now I can actually
play you cannot shoot the barriers and
that's probably a bug so we need to fix
it and if I could just die that's really
hard in this game you would actually be
able to see that it just says owner they
got you try again press any key so
there's no scoring system so why don't
we just add that to the game it's also
got a pause feature now I'll just switch
and then unpause it again when we ready
yeah so so just one more packets coming
into the to the code here and i will
just unpause it again before we apply
the update and it doesn't look like much
have changed right but now you can
actually shoot these barriers and you
will see that we actually got a score
now so we have a small high score added
to the system what we need really to do
something about the graphics right
because users will not be very happy
about this graphics so let's add some
more advanced
stuff to the system and a lot of code is
coming in here in this revision so let's
just unpause so you can see that we're
actually applying the update while it's
being played and the graphic should
actually change now so now we can sort
of it's it's improved right it's still
not perfect so let's just add some more
real looking animated explosions and
while we added why don't we just add a
laser beaming spaceship mother spaceship
so let's do that it's the last update ok
I think I will just wait a minute to die
so you can actually see the update there
you go so now you can actually have much
nicer animated explosions you have this
really dangerous spaceship that is yeah
so you get the idea right so now we
actually have a fully functional space
invaders game so that was pretty cool so
let's switch back to the to the real
capabilities because this is not
actually a typical use usage scenario of
Couvillion this is applying real world
live updating right he really is also
very beneficial for development users so
you can just test small incremental
changes while you're coding and that's
really where the big benefits are in my
opinion so with your you could actually
if you have this class you can add some
some fields you can remove fields you
can add or change constructors methods
you can add new methods you can even
implement new interfaces at runtime and
you can actually also extend new classes
so change the superclass so those are
pretty unique features one of them so
basically you can simply change java
class at one time no restrictions and we
have some unique features we have the
automatic field initially
enough new fields that i'll show you in
just a minute it's a very convenient
feature as set we can replace super
classes and change the implement in it
faces and we have two different
operation modes you can either choose to
reload on file change or compiling or
you can trigger the the reload manually
for java SE and ii projects so let's
just show a small demo so here i have a
very very small application running you
can add some students to the system by
and you can get some information about
this student so now i have Ln edit so i
want to i want to perform some changes
to the student i want to add an ID feel
to two students so why don't we do that
and why we added we want to retrieve the
eid from some global place here is just
a static field like a student counter
and let's start the counter at 32 for
instance and I want to just increment
this guy so every time a new student is
created it will be incremented
automatically right and just let us
print out this new IDs thing so that's
your boy boy so I'm saving the file and
if i select ln here you can see the new
ID showing up and it's 32 so it's it's
automatically applied so i want i'm
thinking that you actually think how the
hell did that get initialized I mean the
object was already created and we just
added a new field and we're not like
rerunning the constructor right that
would be stupid because it would
actually overwrite the existing fields
so so how did we do that we actually
pick up class level initialization so
whatever you you right up here outside
the constructor it will be merged into
every constructor we were able to pick
up that piece of byte code to actually
initialize those specific fields that
are new to this object so that's a
pretty pretty convenient feature so why
don't we just create a new interface and
try and implement that let's add a
printable with just one method oops
print there we go and make the student
implement this if I can type
there you go and just implement the
method
return what do we return we can turn
print so you can see that actually
printed from here and we just delegate
it to a shrink for now so this will
actually not show up now so let's use it
from the main window here well we have a
list a peer of of students so the
students in it right whenever we select
something from the list as a student
expected to be there but now we actually
just need to know it's a printable right
and we save it and it should not print
something yet because we're just just
stringing it so we will just use the
print method now because it should be
printable right so now it just showed up
so we change the implemented interface
for this existing object and it just
simply worked right so we could do some
more advanced stuff like changing the
superclass if we would like to add like
other kinds of persons into the system
the first thing you would do actually
would be to create a super class and
then extract something from the subclass
the reusable pants right so let's add a
new person superclass and you would
wanna add the name or actually move the
name up into the superclass yeah and you
would also need to move the getter up
into the superclass you would need to
write a constructor initializing the
name field so now we actually have an
existing field value for this student
which is Ln here and we want to make
sure that it can actually
print the same stuff as expected so we
would like to actually preserve the
state of the subject even though we
actually move the field upwards into the
hierarchy so there we go I think that
should be enough right so there we go so
let's see if that's going to work so
still we have Ln and no problem in X and
retrieving that field even though we
just moved it upwards into the hierarchy
so that was it for that for their first
a bunch of demos so mmm who can actually
use civilian well you can use it for
java SE developers you can use it on the
NetBeans platform as we will see two
very good examples of right in a minute
and the new 30 release that actually
came out this week can actually also do
class we loading on Java EE and on
tomcat J&amp;amp;J pass we have some spring
model-view-controller bean validation
rescission and some more support for 4e
stuff that i will give you a small demo
of at the very end of the session so for
now I'll just switch to Rene and he will
present himself and give you some some
cool insights to what he's been doing
with your villain wow what a great
presentation yeah hello everyone my name
is Renee on and I will try to tell you
the power of Trillium from my point of
view is used and explicit customer and
but firstly let me introduce myself i'm
co-founder and currently head of
research of development at SF evasions
we are software company in austria we
develop product software products and
our focuses on the creation of custom
pack and software we also actively
develop and maintain the open source
application framework with the name
cherry x has anyone heard of it it's
really great one no well you should look
at it if you develop back and database
applications the goal of j VX is the
creation of back
data with database applications with
less source code in a shorter time we
use this product at it's open source
framework for all our products and all
customers that need a second application
but that's not all because we use the
framework it's the base of our product
with the language tags it's a modern
application builder with a mutual UI
designer automatic persistence handling
and much more and it enables you to
develop or create back end applications
without coding but you developer have
the full control over the source code
otherwise no developer would use this
tool I will use this tool for my demos a
little bit later so let's start with my
first question why dynamic class
reloading well for me my team it's very
important to develop fast and create
high-quality software and of course we
don't want to be code monkeys and of
course we have to to to meet our
deadlines and and to make a customers
happy but we also want to have fun and
have time for researching new projects
on the one side we develop a product
that helps other developers to save
valuable time and increase the
productivity on the other side we are
not as fast as a customers there's
something wrong isn't there may be too
safe development time and increase our
productivity sir me we brainstorm to
find out what we could improve we knew
that it was not possible to reduce the
complexity or safe development time for
complex problems for some business logic
or four algorithms but we found some
some points that we could improve our
first
and our first goal was to reduce
application restarts not only the
startup time but also the login process
open screens menu navigation and so on
if you if you modify only one specific
screen from an whole application why
should you restart the whole application
after rico change this is borrowing
isn't it our next idea we had was about
the reduction of manual UI tests imagine
you have a simple application screen
with one grid a detail form and some
buttons with the buttons you start a
workflow or create a report but for
example the report needs the selected
record from your grid now imagine you
were developing the you are developing
to report and must test the integration
with your screen isn't it annoying to
start the application to open the right
screen and to select the test track of
the church to check if a simple code
change works ok so going back to our
last codes we asked ourselves what does
a developer really want a developer
wants to be able to see all code changes
immediately in the application and the
same should be possible for Swiss files
and config file changes so
movement we try to find a library or
tool that fits our needs and and some
was laters I'm not kidding you received
an article by RSS a partial civilian on
aunty stone we thought it's what is
right why not of course we found some
some other tools but civilian interested
us more because it was a research
project from the University of Southern
Denmark which is always a good thing it
supports all relevant features like
replacing superclasses adding removing
fields adem removing implementing
implementing interfaces and moving
fields between super and subclasses and
it is easy to use because you have only
one jar file and absolutely no random
dependencies the integration in our
development process was straightforward
no complex configuration just copy and
paste another important thing for us was
that it works civilian works without IDE
plugins it has no user interface and
does not need user interaction and
another great plus was to create the
really great support from the
development team you don't know the
quality of the development team until
you need some help we found some small
problems and the support from the
development team was fast and consistent
they solved our problems and understood
all of them yeah now you know why we
love using civilian next questions how
do we use to reeling first we prefer
eclipse as our ID and so it was
important that turbulent works with it
we only use a simple java the turbulent
java file integrate it in our launch
configuration and that's it no claspers
changes in my company we have different
development teams for open source
customer projects and product
development every team uses civilian as
a rule we don't release civilian with
our products or projects we only use it
as development library and civilian
especially helps us for life layout and
live coding
normally in our development process
which are starting application make some
layer changes to an existing screen or
create a new one and make some changes
to business logic and all really all
changes are immediately available in the
application it's really really great the
only problem is that we are used to
close the application after a test some
of the biggest challenge for us was
don't close the application never press
X yeah after so much information I think
it's time for a short demonstration of
trillian I will show you the integration
of civilian into an existing application
the modification of an existing screen
and some business logic modifications
but before you can use trillian you must
download it from civilian dark it's
really a comp it's really simple you
receive a single zip archive with
civilian in it Antep the arch of
anywhere on your hard disk and remember
the directory I already did the download
or have downloaded it so I can come
continue with my configuration as I
totally before I prefer eclipse as my ID
but the configuration should be possible
with all other IDs or even the comment
line so now let's switch over to eclipse
good the first thing I want to show you
my existing application as we use it
before we used Eclipse civilian oh mama
not the application the configuration so
have different ones okay as you can see
I have a simple swing application a main
class some arguments this application
does not use a trillion and that's not
support life layering live coding now
i'm going to configure travillian it's
really simple I've configured it and the
only difference is the same main class
same arguments I added two additional
parameters to the virtual machine
elements the first is 2x at the boot
class pass it points to directory a
temporary directory anywhere on your
hard disk and the java agent and this
sets the civilian char the food
qualified and passed to it okay let's
run and modify some source code startup
ok this is vision x my company flagship
it has a menu bar on top of the frame
and nice-looking toolbar and a desktop
in the middle of the frame the desk up
shows all available applications we can
start applications we can create new
ones and have a lot of different options
in this application but now we won't
change source code or any of an existing
screen I use the user management it's a
simple screen it has a list of
application users on the left forum with
some details and a list of rules for
each select user our first modification
effects the user interface this one I'll
replace the header title user management
with another one another text and set a
new title a text for the email and
remove phone and fax from the user
interface ok let's do it
the moment back to my source code the
source code is more or less a simple
panel we use lay odds we use text fields
tables and and so on okay I have a
method to set the header title welcome
to travel one the next change is set the
email label the different value and now
remove phone and okay safe or not
yes and as you can see as you can see in
the application nothing happened
surprise no not really surprised
civilian already reloaded the classes
but nobody told my application that
something has changed we must reopen the
screen rani le to see the changes one
moment we open it and now it's up to
date a new email text new header and so
on this is not really as cool as it
should be but be patient it gets better
our next modification affects the
business logic I have a simple email
check when I removed the ad and press
finish I get an exception the email is
wrong but I don't like this text or the
Texas wrong so let's go to the source
code form a business logic anywhere my
business logic ever to check email
method and this method throws a simple
exception I will change the text go back
to the application breast finish and now
I have the new text why now immediately
because the user interface is not
affected in this case everything works
because it's not visible it's the
business logic okay this was our first
experiment but now I think it's time
to update the user interface immediately
because we won't reopen the whole screen
once and once again good to do this one
moment I must switch back to do this we
use another feature of civilian it's the
reload listener if you configure such a
reload listener you will receive an
event after every reload of civilian you
can use this event to update your user
interface or whatever our research
caches the reload listener is a simple
swing changeless interface because it's
available in any in any java virtual
machine and you don't have a dependency
to your application for civilian ok and
now let's I will show you the previous
example but with a reload listener get
back to eclipse i have pre-configured
the launcher and show you what happened
the only difference to the previous
launch configuration is that i now set
the system property civilian doctor
listener dot dot reload thoughtlessness
will dot listener to the implementation
of my listen at the full qualified class
let's run it
open the same screen again
okay and now let's revert the previous
UI changes at the phone and fax the old
label for the email and the old title so
and after saving the user interface
update immediately immediately that's
how it should work okay
the last feature the next feature i want
to mention or I before I continue I will
show you my listener implementation
because it's really simple to implement
your own listener for your applications
it's a simple Java class it implements
the swing change listener I detect the
application in the constructor and in
the implemented interface method they
changed I up didn't use my user
interface of course they opted user
interface contains a little bit more
sauce good for my application but it
always depends on your own application
what you do in my case I reopen all
existing screens that's it another
important feature for us and maybe for
you is the support of custom class
loaders in which next we use custom
class loaders to to load user-defined
libraries at runtime and to to load
dynamic dynamically compiled classes at
runtime for us it's very important that
Joe venience supports this custom class
loaders but i must say that custom
classes are not detected automatically
us developer must register and
unregister them but civilian offers sort
of a sort of API but it's a little bit
magic and Alan will explain the details
to you yep
yeah so we have this civilian API that's
not really an API because we had
different options to go with here as
Renee told you he don't like actually to
have a dependency on civilian so we came
up with this with this crazy idea that
okay shouldn't have a dependency on the
billion we would like typesafe API like
features so that he can actually hook
into our real API at one time if
civilian is enabled and if it's not
enabled it the code should do nothing ok
so that was the design criterias so we
now have a napi like structure where you
have no dependencies to davillon and
there's no difference between runtime
and development mode so and it supports
custom class or which station
registration so the simple idea is that
you simply paste this piece of code into
your into some package somewhere and it
just the only requirement is that it
needs to be called you a million reload
manager then you implement this
interface at the bottom classwork a
slaughter listener which should just
provide one new fresh class loader
instance when you need to reload the
classes within those calf lows so
basically you now have static global
static access to to the jamelia nay bi I
epi by invoking register and unregister
methods that will do nothing if
revealing is not enabled so we actually
hook in at load time and fill out the
blanks in those methods to actually
invoke directly into our intern
internally API yeah and I think that's
that explained see the basic idea and
Renee will just show you how they
actually implemented this stuff okay I
have two additional I have two
additional slides that shows my usage of
registration for civilian custom class
loaders the first one is the original
gas usage without support for civilian
it's relatively simple anywhere in our
source code we had an init method and we
created our cast
lastly with the name directly as Laura
edit the other set the parent class or
in the constructor and our class Laura
needed a connection to remote classes
remotely that's it now the support with
civilian the initialization is is nearby
the same it's moved to to the reload to
the class loader listener as Ellen
expect I told you and that if the two
main difference are that the listener is
created through the create module class
listen of method and the class loader is
registered together with the listener
and every time when civilian reloads it
tell listener method will be called yeah
ok and the last feature I want to
mention is or Ellen told you that
civilian has two modes automatic
reloading and manually reloading
automatically reloading everything works
but I should tell you that civilian
reloads when you change or automatically
reloads when you change a source file or
a class file but it does not reload when
you change a resource file like an image
or a properties file or a pinche if you
want to reload your application whenever
you change a resource file you must turn
off automatic reloading at the moment
maybe the condition for a feature
request to do this you can configure an
additional parameter it's the pot option
to cheel to the two billion launch arm
settings and when you do this two
billion completely disable automatic
reloading and to trigger reloads you
must you must use a web browser and send
a specific request to civilian it's HTTP
localhost port / reload with this event
Joe billion triggers reload but it's not
very very convenient to use a web
browser because we have modern IDs and I
thought okay let's let's create an
eclipse plugin for this and this plugin
really
civilian after you have changed a source
code a resource file or whatever yeah
the project is very new it's open source
we are looking looking for helping hands
and maybe contribute to this new project
yeah thank you very much honey so as he
said this this Eclipse plug-in has been
contributed by Renee and it's just great
that he picked this up and kind of
tailored what he needed and created a
small eclipse plugin and we'll be
picking up on this nickel plug in and
contribute to it is wrong so what about
Java EE can we do something about all
those application servers and web
frameworks that has a number of
different things that we need to take
care of when we are dealing with class
reloading so all of these web
application use a broad variety of
containers and different kinds of web
frameworks and many of them tend to use
a really aggressive caching for storing
class metadata and it sends to like when
you change the class add a new method
you will probably end up in a no such
method exception or a similar just
because it did not happen to be in that
cache so so we need to purge those
caches at one time and we need to
integrate like if you want to add a
spring bean or something like that we
need to actually inject it into the
spring framework while we're running so
we need to pick up on all those
annotations that web frameworks use and
actually reflect the changes accordingly
at runtime so the bad news is that all
of this actually needs quite deep and
specific integration for each of these
servers in each of these web frameworks
so we have started with tomcat six and
seven Jerry's seven and eight and jboss
seven at one which now provides class we
loading facilities then we have added
support for bean validation spring
model-view-controller CDI rest easy and
some other some other stuff as well but
we will be integrating with a lot of
different web
in works in the coming months so so stay
tuned if if your favorite thing is not
up here on this list so while I switched
to a demo I have a very simple
application running here it's something
I found on the Internet where you can
just add pets to sort of like a pet
store and you can add like a new
breakfast dog or whatever to chuck
norris and save it but you end up in a
legal value here caused by bean
validation constraints which was
probably wrong right so we need to it
should be okay to have pets that are 30
years old yeah perhaps you can have a
turtle that is like 100 years but let's
just say we add 1980 now we save the
file and whoops Wow and we go back into
the browser and try to save it and now
we were just able to pick up that bean
validation constraint first the cash and
so now it was actually picked up quite
nicely so now we also want to add
something more because now this request
mapping was actually not available in
the application so let's just try to do
something about that so I could just
uncomment this piece of code here and it
would actually work but that will not
really show it will show you that we
picked up request mappings but I'm
really want to show you a bit more here
so why don't we just add a new
controller to to the project
and and at the annotation there we go so
now we can actually copy the code from
from the other controller and just fix
the imports and stuff there we go
so for this to work we can see that
let's just fix the imports first oh that
wasn't it beans it's like control one
mm-hmm want to just use the UI I never
can remember when young Ned Braden's
user or eclipse you so you can never I
should just use one one style of of
shortcuts right so let's add the imports
there we go so now we just need a tail
variable which is all wired is it called
yet like that and add the annotation or
a wired so it will be automatically
injected into the running system and
save the file and go to the browser and
press refresh so now we actually have
that request mapping we injected the
controller we oughta wired this stuff
and it just worked ok so we can actually
do something about e applications now
with the with the new 30 release so now
I'm going to switch to an example from
Christian and I think he will have about
10 minutes to go for this demo
ok
okay hi everybody my name is Katie on
the context in which i use two billion
is in a piece platform which is an
application framework for creating a
large software on the Java desktop you
can see when I have here is NetBeans IDE
or I'm correcting the application and on
the right side of it i have a small
NetBeans platform application and
actually everything that you see here is
what you get out of the box properties
window output window this whole menu bar
the toolbar a window system a plugin
functionality and update mechanism many
features out of the box so what you see
here is basically what i have from the
beginning however i've added one menu
item and it's it's this menu item greet
and it says hello San Francisco so
what's quite common is that one will be
programming and making changes and what
typically happens is I've made a small
change like this and normally one needs
to completely redeploy the application
from scratch which can be really painful
especially since these kinds of
applications are typically very large
these are really not trivial
applications if you look at the at the
screenshots page you have applications
from NATO on Northrop Grumman zone
defense force in banking in really large
large industries where they create
really large applications so redeploying
an application especially in the case of
trivial changes like this it's really
painful and really slows down the
development process a lot so instead
thanks to Julian what can be done is
right click on any module where a
changes be made and choose reload entire
platform and then the module is reloaded
into the application and when i click on
grid and i'll see might have a world
message instead of hello San Francisco
the way this works is because part of
civilian is a plug-in for netbeans and
in fact unless I'm mistaken this is how
to even start
with with with netbeans support and I've
installed this into NetBeans IDE and so
just went to plugins and in the in the
in the update center of NetBeans you can
register online repositories of plugins
I have a long list of these online
repositories and one of these has 2
billion and if I choose edit so you can
see this is a URL to the online location
of the NetBeans plugin for civilian so
once this has been selected you can go
to once you actually set that up you can
reload and here check for updates and
you'll find civilian and then you can
install this in there and you'll find it
an instant a bunch of dancer then for
for lateness platform applications
anyway but also for for standard Java
applications what you have on the
application level in the properties
window is a diversion settings tab so
this project properties dialog is
extensible so the devonian plugin for
netbeans extends that that tab for
netbeans platform applications but also
for java standard java SE applications
and here you can configure exactly how
you want to do things and thus far I've
not actually needed to understand all of
these different options of just using
things exactly as they were and I've
been fine so I can't go into much detail
here because I just always take the
defaults and things are good what then
happens once you have enabled so
actually the only thing one needs to do
here is go in here and enable because
buddy for this is disabled so check the
checkbox and then when you deploy the
application one way you know that this
is all working is that the output window
will show a whole bunch of
civilian messages mature and find them
but there's messages during startup
telling you that there is that you value
in the starting up and anyway so once
it's once it's running and you want to
make any change then as I showed you
right click on the module and you choose
we load in target platform one thing I
would like and that's been suggested
recently is that this would behave in a
similar way to jerebo where you simply
need to save the file in order to
reloaded rather than explicitly needing
to get here but on the other hand what
could also be done by the user of the
plugin is to go to the to the options
window of NetBeans IDE and in the key
map and find that a reload reload into
other platform and here bind this to a
key combination so that you don't
physically have to go there and then it
essentially is the same thing you would
press your keyboard shortcut to reload
the module so what I've shown at this
point is this hello world mess is
changing but what's even more annoying
is when you're working with icons so you
can see I have here this red icon on my
menu item so now I think okay I don't
like this red icon let's try the blue
icon instead and just to explain this
the NetBeans platform has among many
other interesting standards and and
systems a number of systems like a
window system a module system it also
has an action system by means of which
you can take any action listeners a
plain old java standard java action
listener and register it into the file
system of the NetBeans platform
application so each nephew special
application has its own file system and
there is an XML format an XML file that
each module can provide inside of which
action listeners can be registered for
certain gooey features so here I can see
for example I have an action reference
menu file which means this action
listener will be read
in the file menu and an annotation
processor at compile time takes all of
these annotations and turns them into
XML entries and an XML file which is
contributed to the to the file system so
in that way porting action listeners to
the next platform is trivial because you
copy the classes in and then annotate
them so that's how that menu item or how
this action listener ended up in here
but one of the things you can define in
addition to its location in the menu bar
or in the toolbar or wherever is an icon
that can be displayed so normally you
specify an icon you don't like it you
make the change you redeploy the
application but thanks to Julian of
course we can make our change reload the
the module into the application and
there I have my blue icon so this makes
a massive massive difference in in the
speed of development and we often gives
NetBeans platform training courses and
one of the most painful things tends to
be one of the many things because
there's a lot of things to learn in the
beginning but one of the truly painful
things is the constant need to redeploy
the application and the waiting for that
process to be complete especially as the
application becomes larger so in in
student settings like at universities or
in companies where we give training
courses and we tend to use this because
it and increasingly sell because in
earlier versions things weren't
completely stable and for unexpected
reason things would fail so in earlier
versions of Julian at some point it it
wasn't used anymore because the results
are unreliable and it cause more
confusion than then it helped but the
latest release has really is really
excellent and you know this is this is
what we do in training courses and in
that sense the NetBeans plugin for
Julian is is the most valuable NetBeans
platform plugin
the most important plug-in to use
because everything else is provided in
netbeans ide in the as the SDK of the
platform out of the box so once the
students in the class have installed
this plug-in the course begins and they
and and and they just learn very quickly
about this ability to reload into the
target platform and so everyone that
I've encountered in the NetBeans
platform world especially with with the
last release has been very happy with it
thank you thanks for the kind words I
think I just grew a couple of inches sir
so let's just sum up and so so what is
the road ahead we want to add some some
development of core features we need
obviously more Java EE support more
framework supported and you can sort of
like help us prioritize this if you if
you contact us and give us a feature
request for say Google juice or
something like that and a lot of you
guys do that we will actually prioritize
what users actually need so you can help
us a bit and we need to add some
promoting support enabling the abelian
to actually push changes to a remote
server it gets more and more common to
actually use clouds to to to also
develop your web applications so we need
to support that and then we need to
transplant SS Hessian told you he it
would be kind of nice to have this save
and compile and reload built into the
NetBeans platform as well there are some
some hard things to do in this area
because civilians was originally
designed to actually hot-swap fully full
modules and that's also the main
benefits of using civilian for netbeans
platform because you can actually change
like module dependencies at runtime
setting up new class loader dependencies
stuff like that that you it wouldn't be
easy to do just to on the save and
compile of individual files and this is
also a reason why we wouldn't use
rebel because Julian is really that the
the net nice platform part of Julian is
really aimed at madness platform
specific things like reloading modules
dependencies of modules and reloading
contributions to the file system and all
these artifacts that are specific to the
nettings platform yeah but but I think
it will be possible to actually do this
it's going to take a bit of work but we
we will get there eventually I guess
also for now that the plug-in support is
is quite good and and a module reload is
not actually sure as slow as you saw
it's really quick so so I don't see a
big problem in this so yeah well thank
you for listening for showing up and I
want to also thank Sen an f4 for their
support throughout this process and yeah
thank you for listening so I think we
have like five or seven minutes for
questions if you have any yeah
too so you would like to have you have a
running application without your vision
and then you want to attach it that's
pretty hard to do I mean we hook into
the class loading process and actually
prepare classes for being hot swapped
and once they are loaded you cannot
really change this that's what you need
two billion for in the first place so so
no you cannot do that you need to start
up with you the civilian arguments so in
the back free form is currently not
supported by the plug-in you would need
to add those two lines to the to the
runtime parameters it's not hard to do
freeform projects are harder to well
actually in 732 if it if it supported
from the NetBeans team to actually hook
into this executor maybe we catchin
would know then then it actually should
be supported like maven base development
is supported it actually picks up when
you start then we add the runtime
arguments so you could try it I would
actually would like to know if freeform
projects are supported so I can't really
say whether they are not yeah we don't
have plugins for IntelliJ but we do have
like in our reference manual on the net
you will find very easy installation
it's like adding these two simple lines
to your arguments then when you run in
in debugging mode you would need to set
up some filters to not go into synthetic
methods because that's just annoying but
but that's pretty much all you need so
it's not like you would you can do it in
two minutes yep
freeze or only
it actually it actually reloads all the
cast is loaded by that class Laura but
it doesn't do that in one step we do
lazy class loading and lazy state
migration from one class to another and
all the objects will be all the classes
will be reloaded eventually yeah
one of those passions
you I mean you can't really have like
two different class versions running
that would be yeah you can but that's
not the purpose of civilian we would
like see we will actually perform
updates as if it was have had been
started from scratch right we cannot do
we do more fancy stuff we can only do
what Java can can do so so if you make a
change you cannot expect the program to
behave according to the new class file
and according to the to the old one and
you can't do that in Java then you need
to specifically build your application
application code to actually do that and
that's possible even without your vision
and it has pretty much nothing to do
with class reloading yep singleton sure
exactly yeah you have questions it
doesn't really so the thing is that our
model actually but it doesn't really
need deep integration and knowledge
about the debugger it actually if you
step through code in your debugger if
you actually reload the entire class as
we do and and and do not generate like
helper classes for new methods and stuff
like that it it's not as as hard to
actually make the debugger think that
okay this is just a new class and it
knows about this new class and the vm
would know that this class from the ide
you can hook in your breakpoints and it
will just simply work so we don't need
deep integration for the debugging sure
yeah as long as you remember to specify
the boot classpath that's the only
requirement yep I couldn't hear
maven sure there you can for at least
four maven base the NetBeans projects
but what you can use it for any any java
project and maven is no exception you
just need to to hook in those runtime
parameters or vm arguments and you're
ready to go yep it will if you use the
port setting the manual triggering then
it will be performing one transaction if
you use the operation mode where your
save files and it reloads automatically
then it will reload in the order in
which you compile files and that can
actually lead to some unresolved
compilation exceptions stuff like that
and that's why if you need to change
code in a complex way like say you have
a bunch of classes that actually changed
and you need to change them in one
transaction you can set up this port
argument and then you can trigger
readouts manually and you will make sure
that this will actually be picked up at
the time that you're triggering it yep
yeah
yeah yeah that could happen if you're
unlucky but if you trigger it manually
you can do that and and yeah no problem
yeah I guess yeah can you speak up
please google web toolkit it's not
supported at present but it's on our
radar yeah a couple of differences well
we have some key features like you can
implement new interfaces you can add new
super classes remove super classes and
then we have the field the automatic
field initialization for both instance
fields and static fields so we even pick
up if you add a new static field we will
not rerun the static initializer because
I think that's really dangerous to do
that so we will actually pick up only
the bytecode needed to to actually
initialize that particular new static
field without touching anything else so
yeah those are the most unique features
or the most differences okay I think we
can have like one or two questions yep
well I mean you saw Renee performing
some changes to a constructor or a code
that actually depends on being executed
only once so and and we cannot reacts
acute constructors right so doing like
like UI development if you add like drag
and drop like a text field into the UI
it will it will show up in the unit
components that's a pretty standard way
to do it and and you won't see that
change for the existing frame for that
you would have to do something special
and we do have some object transform us
that you can actually use for that but
in the NetBeans platform development we
do have specific support for windows
that will actually reacts acute some
some other constructor so that these UI
changes will actually take effect and
that's also very beneficial I know for
for profession and the students yeah
last question
it's really hard for me to hear you so I
yep
so if you add a new field to anything it
will be picked up
we do have some hibernate support yes I
think we need more support to support
any kinds of changes in hibernate but we
have initial support for hibernate yeah
yeah thank you guys good questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
