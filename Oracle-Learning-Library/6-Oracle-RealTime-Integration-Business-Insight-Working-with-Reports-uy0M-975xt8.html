previous videos in this series talk
about how to design and map models in
the insight designer and how to track
business performance through the insight
console in site also provides a
reporting feature for historical
analysis a suite of pre-configured
reports is available for evaluating the
detailed performance of your business
over time it's also possible to create
custom reports the track metrics
specific to your business use case after
the administrator configures the Oracle
business intelligence server to access
the insight metrics and enables insight
to access pre-configured report
definitions in the bi publisher instance
John the business owner can immediately
see the pre-configured reports on the
inside homepage john wants to understand
details of the instances in the help
desk example instances are actually
service requests first john wants to see
which service requests surpassed the
problem resolved milestone in the past
week but haven't passed any other
milestone since the most recent
milestone report can help him it counts
the service requests that most recently
passed each milestone John sets the
milestone field to problem resolved and
changes the date range to the last week
he sees the report right away the bar
chart displays the distribution of
service requests for each day in the
last week John can easily identify peak
times as well as days with a lower
number of service requests John can also
browse the service request details to
determine the milestone status service
requests start time and more the instant
summary report provides intuitive
insight on the status of each service
request and execution time it shows the
average service request duration from
beginning to end for each day within the
defined range John finds that more than
sixty percent of the 283 service
requests are completed ten percent of
them are still active and fourteen
percent have failed also about fourteen
percent of the service requests have no
terminal errors and can still be
recovered he needs to look into the
details for those service requests to
learn why they may have run into an
error the pre-configured reports also
show the performance of all milestones
over the lifetime of service requests
and
detailed information about errors and
stuck service requests in addition to
the pre-configured reports bi publisher
report developers can also create custom
reports for active insight models custom
reports placed in the appropriate public
context folder within bi publisher will
be automatically listed in insight under
the pre-configured reports for
information on how to configure insight
