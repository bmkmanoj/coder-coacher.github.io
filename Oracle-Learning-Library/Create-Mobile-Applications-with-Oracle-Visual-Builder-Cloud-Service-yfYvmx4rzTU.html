application using Oracle visual builder
cloud service this is going to be a
mobile expense application I choose a
template for the application from the
mobile optimized templates provided here
using this template I have a title to
fill out and two or more tabs that I can
name I choose to have a list tab and a
chart tab I create the application I'm
taken into the visual editor where I add
data to the application I choose the
layout of the list and then add data
from another application this is the
expense application that I created
earlier the list of objects that I can
use from that application is shown I
choose the expense object and then drag
and drop the fields I want to show in
the list I do a live preview of the
application data when I click finish I'm
taken back to the visual editor where I
select the chart tab I add a UI
component to the tab I drag and drop a
pie chart and then link it to data from
the expense object the chart will show
the cost for each expense name I can add
other pages to the application like a
create screen and a details screen to
design the detail screen I choose a
simple template and give it a title I
choose to show a form on the page I
navigate to the new page to fine-tune it
I add the specific fields I want to show
on the detail page I choose the same
business object and add the fields in
the order I want to show them the detail
screen will automatically use a query
based on the values coming from the list
of entries that I have I modify the
create expense page by removing some of
the fields that aren't mandatory then I
change the type of field used for
inserting the date instead of a text
field I choose a date/time component the
application is ready to be tested I use
the web emulator to see how the
application behaves there's a list of
expenses
I choose one and see the details i
navigate back and create a new expense
report i put in the name and the cost
and then choose a date using the date
component when I click Save the new
entry is inserted into the list of
values clicking on the entries shows
that the approval value has
automatically been set by the
applications business logic I can also
see a chart of expenses from the list
it's easy to create a mobile application
that will behave natively on both iOS
and Android with a native look and feel
whether you're in landscape or portrait
mode your application will behave
correctly the application can also be
tested directly on your mobile device
that's how simple it is to develop a
mobile application using Oracle visual
builder cloud service for more
