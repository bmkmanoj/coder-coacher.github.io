you to manage your enterprise scale
docker environment with an easy-to-use
interface and useful tools that support
the deployment and monitoring of
containerized services and application
sacks you can also use it to pull and
run oracle images available on the
docker store carry on watching to find
out how to pull an oracle weblogic
server image run it as a container and
then launch the WL SMN console sign into
the container console using the
credentials you've received from your
administrator go to the registries page
click new registry to create a new
registry definition for the docker store
specify index de correo slash store as a
URL of the docker store then specify
your doctor username and password that
Oracle container cloud service will use
to log into the Dockers door and give
the new registry definition of
meaningful description you can confirm
the connection details by clicking the
validate button save the new registry
definition now create a new service for
the ws image that you're going to pull
from the docker soror
go to the services page click new
service and give the service a name
other properties have intelligent
defaults so you don't have to change
them but you do need to know the docker
run command to use you can get that from
information about the WS image in the
darker store open a new browser tab and
go to store docker comm in the find box
search for Oracle WebLogic server and
select it on the WS page click the get
content button select the checkbox to
agree to the Terms of Service and click
to get content button again
the command to run the wls container is
shown in the description copy the one
that explicitly specifies the host port
as 7,001 go back to the container
console Service editor display the
docker run tab and paste into the run
command you just copied save the new
service to deploy the wls image as a
running container go to the services
page and click the deploy button beside
the services name accept the default
deployment options in the deploy dialog
and click deploy the deployments page
shows Oracle container cloud service
pulling the image from the docker store
and then deploying and running it as a
docker container WLS is now running to
log into the WL SM in console you need
to know the IP address of the VM it's
running on to find that out click on the
host name shown on the deployments page
on the host page copy the public IP
address open a new browser tab paste in
the IP address at 7001 as support number
and append slash console to the URL you
now see the WL SM in console login page
to login you need the username and
password that were specified when the
container is started you can find those
in the containers log file go back to
the container console on the host page
click the name of the WL s container to
display the containers page click the
view logs button to see the containers
log file in the log file you can see
that WebLogic was specified as the user
name and an alphanumeric string was
specified as a password for convenience
copied the password go back to the WL s
and min console in the user name field
type WebLogic paste the alphanumeric
string you copied into the password
field click login to display the W
awesome in console from which you can
administer the WS server processes
having successfully deployed WL s as a
docker container using oracle container
cloud service you can continue to manage
a monitor the containers deployment
using the container console</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
