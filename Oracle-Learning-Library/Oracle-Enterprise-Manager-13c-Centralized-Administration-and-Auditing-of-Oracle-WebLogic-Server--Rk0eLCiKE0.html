cloud control 13c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to use
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13c to perform administration operations
against Oracle WebLogic server as well
as how to view the audit records for
those operations
traditionally administrators were
required to use the Oracle WebLogic
server administration console or the
Oracle Enterprise Manager of Fusion
Middleware control console to administer
their domain however administration
operations are available directly from
the Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud
control 13c console and most of those
capabilities have been available for
several releases prior to release 13c
from the cloud control console
administrators can leverage change
center to lock a domain configuration
prior to making configuration changes
configure domain cluster server machine
as well as multi tenant settings manage
JDBC data sources access the system MB
browser to view invoke or edit and beans
and lastly administrators are able to
view the audit trail of these WebLogic
operations from the cloud control
console as well being able to audit
WebLogic operations from the cloud
control console was introduced with
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
13c release one and the Fusion
Middleware plugin released 13 1 1 0-0
having a single tool from monitoring
administering and viewing audit records
for Oracle WebLogic server not only
simplifies an administrators job and
increases productivity but also maintain
security of your middleware environment
to begin this demonstration let's
navigate to where we can manage JDBC
data sources for a particular domain
we'll right mouse click on the target
name to access its context-sensitive
menu and then we'll click on JDBC data
sources from this page we can see all
data sources configured for this domain
notice the informational message
indicating that the configuration
session has not been started yet in
order for us to perform administration
operations such as create a new JDBC
a source delete a data source or control
a data source we must first go to the
change center to lock and edit the
domain this ensures that no other
administrators can make their own
configuration changes while we are
making ours so now that the
configuration session has been started
we can manage our data source let's
drill down into an existing data source
in order to view its configuration here
we can see general information on the
JDBC datasource as well as access other
information on how its configured for
the purposes of this demonstration let's
modify the connection pool properties
for this data source we'll click on the
connection pool tab and change the
statement cache size at the pool from
the current 10 to 30 notice that while
the settings were updated successfully
the change has not yet been activated
we'll have to return to the change
center in order to activate the change
once the change has been activated we
receive a confirmation message informing
us of this and that our edit session has
been ended notice that while making and
activating our configuration change we
were never prompted to login to the
domain the reason for that is that
Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud control
stores domain credentials as preferred
credentials for the Enterprise Manager
administrator we are logged in as so
whenever we are logged in to cloud
control whether from the consoles user
interface or from its command line
interface Enterprise Manager uses the
preferred credentials that are saved for
this administrators account and
automatically logs into the domain when
necessary consequently once preferred
credentials are stored
we are never prompted to supply them
again now that we have activated our
WebLogic server configuration change
let's review that change and any other
changes made by other administrators
from the auditing data captured by
Enterprise Manager we will navigate to
the setup menu securities submenu and
then audit data here on the audit data
page is a listing of all the auditing
enabled operations that were performed
by Enterprise Manager administrators in
the past 24 hours notice that in the
search region we are able to change the
date range to
play the most recent audited data in
terms of minutes hours days or years we
could also view the audited data by a
specific time interval for purposes of
this demonstration we'll leave the date
range as last 24 hours but we'll filter
the audited data to only show operations
specific to WebLogic from the search
region will access the operation drop
down menu and deselect all operations
and then select only the WebLogic domain
log in operation WebLogic domain logout
operation and WebLogic domain update
invoke operation now that we have
filtered the audited data we see only
WebLogic specific operations that have
been performed within the last 24 hours
if we select a specific audit record
from the table additional details appear
below the table for this audit record we
gain general information such as when
the operation was performed the
Enterprise Manager administrator who
performed the operation whether the
operation succeeded or failed and the
message from the operation in this
example the message tells us that the
statement cache size attribute of an M
beam was updated clicking on the client
information tab we can see details such
as the ID of the Enterprise Manager
session during which this operation was
performed as well as the client's IP
address and hostname clicking on the OMS
information tab we can see details about
the OMS from which the operation was
performed clicking on the operation
specific information tab we can see
details such as the MB name used in the
operation the target name and target
type the operation was made against the
message from the operation again in this
example the message tells us that the
statement cache size attribute of an M
beam was updated this page also tells us
the amount of time the operation took to
process and lastly any input parameters
from the operation in this example the
input parameter tells us that the
statement cache size attribute of the M
beam was changed to a value of 30 having
a single tool to capture and track
auditing data across all WebLogic domain
crucial because it reduces the risk of
service disruption and poor management
of WebLogic environments it enables
monitoring participation activity for
instance if anyone is trying to log into
domains and failing because they do not
know the proper credentials and it
provides accountability of actions and
avoids repudiation so no one can deny
the actions that he or she has performed
with Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud
control so that concludes this
demonstration thanks for watching how to
use Oracle Enterprise Manager cloud
control 13c to perform administration
operations against Oracle WebLogic
server as well as how to view the audit
records for those operations
