Oracle flow builder is an automation
framework which makes creating
automation descript easy
let us see how to create a
procure-to-pay flow in procurement the
basic transactions are creating a
requisition or to creating it to a
purchase order create a purchase order
approve it create a receipt create an
invoice and make payment for the invoice
let's login into Oracle flow builder
enter a user name enter the password
click on login
navigate to the flows link navigate to
the release product family and product
where we want to create the flow right
click on the product select the option
create flow enter the relevant flow name
here we are creating a flow to
demonstrate a p2p flow so we will enter
the flow name as demo p2p flow create
requisition make payment I envy that is
invoice select the relevant flow type
here we will be selecting certification
enter the tag tags are used for
searching flows multiple tags can be
entered separated by comma here we will
enter to Dax demo comma P to P and / a
relevant description for the flow a flow
which demonstrates the complete p2p
cycle click on save now the flow is
created we can update the flow in two
ways select the flow here and click on
update flow structure button or navigate
to the flow tree right click on the flow
select the option create or update flow
structure here a default scenario is
created with the same name as the flow
name we can create a new scenario the
first scenario we are going to create is
for creating a requisition into the
scenario name click on yes the scenario
is created here we will add the
confidence related to creating a
requisition first we will add the prompt
URL and login and navigate components
all the components are made into a
competency and we can directly use the
component set we can search for the
component set highlight the release into
the component set name and click on
search this is the comprehensive which
we would require we can drag and drop it
into the flow tree it has three
components prompt URL login OEF and
navigate to AF next we would add the
components related to creating a
requisition we can search for the
component or we can drill down to the
release product family product and
feature to add the components we are
seeing the second approach here select
the scenario where the component needs
to be added navigate to the component
create rake header complete this
component is used to enter the
information for all the header fields in
a requisition form we can drag and drop
the component into the flow next we
would add a component for entering the
guthe line information for the
requisition add PR line Guth's common
next we would add a component to enter
the distribution information for the
goods light we can also add the
component by right click options if we
right click on the component we have
options like move our bow and move below
we can use them or we can directly drag
and drop into the flow
next we would add a component for
approving the recognition approved
requisition common now let's add is data
into the components for one component we
will add the testator using the
component is data screen right click on
the component and select entered his
data into the data for operating unit
vision operations type purchase
requisition enter the description for
the requisition
click on save click on close for the
next component we will add data using
the test data Excel right click on the
flow name select generate and download
flow test data Excel save the file to
the local drive open the file enter the
test data for the relevant fields in the
component we are going to add four add
the airline Goods foreman requisition
line number one type would be goods item
enter the item name cm triple 0 for 2
enter the description for the item 56k
more dip into the quantity required 10
into the price 10 need by date all the
dates are considered relative to the
system date hash this date + 5
represents 5 days to be added to the
current system date destination type
inventory requester green military
organisation vision operations
location v1 New York City sorcerer
player click on save close the file now
we will upload the file right click on
the flow select upload excellent Bob
played float is data select the file
which we have updated click on start now
the test data gets populated into the
components let us have a look here we
can see all the data which we have
entered in the test data Excel is
available here this is how we assemble a
flow in flow builder once the flow is
assembled we need to click on a symbol
now let us have a look at a flow which
is completely assembled with all the
scenarios and components demo p2p flow
in purchasing creator update flow
structure this flow has 5 scenarios the
5 transactions in a p2p flow approve
purchase order create receipt and create
invoice and make payment all the
components relevant for the flow are is
a build let's have a look at the test
data Excel we can see that all the
components have the data entered
this is for the complete flow
we will see the example of how to handle
variables let's take the example of auto
create component the requisition number
created in previous components need to
be passed here we need to check this
checkbox for adding variables this list
box gets populated with all the
variables present in the components
prior to this component in the flow this
is how a flow is SM build let us see how
to generate the oft scripts right click
on the flow select the option generate
oft scripts execution folder location
the location from where we would like to
execute this script into the
synchronization values normal weight and
page weight select the option returnable
if required and readin is enabled in any
of the component used in the flow select
the relevant rerun type for the flow
string numeric or alphanumeric if the
script is dependent on a time zone we
can select the relevant time zone and
click on download' suit the generated
file is a zip folder we need to unzip it
and export it to open script in order to
execute it let us see how to execute the
script this is the zip folder and this
is the main folder we can see a master
driver and five subscripts the scenarios
of the flow which we have created our
subscripts in the generated script let's
try to execute it open the master driver
this is the tree view and this is the
code view for the master driver let us
see a sub script create requisition this
is the tree view and this is the Java
code for the create requisition script
now let us execute it
you
we need to provide the URL of the
instance where we want to execute the
script giving the instance here we can
see that the script has started
executing logged in with the user which
we provided in the flow its navigating
to the form which is given in the
navigate component in our flow the first
transaction in our flow would be to
create a requisition that is what we are
going to see today the requisition form
is opened all the data which we have
given in the flow would be entered in
this form header information is entered
now the line information would get
entered distribution details and it is
saved this is how the script gets
executed
now let us see how to generate a test
plan right click on the flow select
generate and download test plan the
generated file is again a zip folder we
have two formats that get generated here
HTML and document format let's unzip it
we can see the two formats let's have a
look at the word document this is the
name of the flow that has been created
in the Oracle flow builder all the
scenarios and the flow are scenarios in
the dis plan create requisition and all
the components are test cases login of'
navigate wave all the data which we have
entered in the flow is also available in
the test plan we can see that all the
scenarios are present here
this is how we create a flow in Oracle
flow builder
