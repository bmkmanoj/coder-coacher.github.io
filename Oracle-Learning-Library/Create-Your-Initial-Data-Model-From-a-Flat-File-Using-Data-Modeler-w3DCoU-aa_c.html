model from a table that was created from
a flat file now you can with data
modeler I'll start by creating a model
models are made up of dimension and fact
tables and joints dimension tables
describe the data attributes such as
customer name or customer marital status
fact tables contain measures such as
revenue or build units and joins show me
the relationships between fact and
dimension tables in the data models next
I'll review the table I want to use as a
basis for the new model it looks like
the table contains over five thousand
rows because this table contains both
attributes and measures I select the add
as fact and dimension tables option I
rename the fact table and then preview a
column to see the contents I can add
other dimension tables too deleting a
column is easy I can right click the
column in a table and select remove to
add a column I drag and drop it from the
source table pane or click Add column
next I review the suggested dimension
tables I can change the table names and
combine tables but to create reports I
have to join each dimension table to a
fact table data modeler has recommended
the joins for me if I deselect the check
box in the dimension table the join is
removed from the dimension table and the
corresponding column is deleted from the
fact table I pick a new column for the
two table joint
it looks like data modeler will create
five views one fact table for dimension
tables and four joins from the source
table next I'll make a few enhancements
I'll start by updating the revenue table
and making all of the columns available
for editing I can use customer number to
count my customers but the customer
dimension is joined to the fact table on
this column it's preferable to create a
joint on columns that don't have
aggregation methods because business
requirements change over time and the
meaning of the original aggregation
method could become ambiguous to
eliminate the likelihood of this
ambiguity I can use the copy option to
create a new column for customer number
and then add the aggregation method to
the new column I continue with my
updates by renaming the columns to make
them more user-friendly and then add
aggregation rules for the measures six
measures are defined and count distinct
is selected as the aggregation method
for the new customer number column I can
also update the column names in the
dimension tables to suit the needs of my
business
next I review the model including
products and revenue and then validate
and publish it the tables are now ready
to use in reports finally I create a
visualization that uses the data model
first I pick a subject area as the data
source I use the ctrl key to pick
columns I want and then drag them on to
the canvas the system selects the best
visualization type for the set of data
elements that I want to add to the
canvas and intuitively picks the best
locations in which to place them in this
video I showed you how to create a data
model from a flat file that contains one
fact and several dimension tables ad
aggregation rules - the metrics rename
columns and then validate and publish
the model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
