Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c
demo series this demonstration shows you
how to create an incident view using
incident manager this demonstration
follows the incident management overview

manager click on enterprise then
monitoring and then incident manager

are going to create a view that shows
all incidents and problems raised
against a pre created group called prod
group in the search section let's keep
incidents and problems in the type field
you could filter by incident problems or
events we want to show a longer time
period though for example last 31 days
as for the target name let's put prod
dash group under target type let's
choose group in the include members
select the target and all members as for
the statues let's leave the default that
shows all open incidents that have not
been suppressed now click get results to
view the result of the search
you can scroll through the result able
to see if you get what you wanted now
that you are happy with the result you
want to create a view for that so click
create view let's give it a name and
click ok now you can see that this view
was added on the left so anytime you
want to look at incidents and problems
raised on your production group you can
simply look at this view this concludes
