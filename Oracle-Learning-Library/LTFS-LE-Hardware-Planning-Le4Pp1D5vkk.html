Linear Tape file system library edition
planning and installation in this video
we are going to cover the hardware
requirements for a typical LTFS le
installation these requirements can be
found in the storage tech Linear Tape
file system library edition planning and
installation guide a typical LTFS le
installation involves an LTFS le server
a partition on an SL 3000 library an acs
LS server and a means to connect the
drives in the library to your LTFS le
server in this case a fibre channel
switch in the installation guide there
is a planning checklist similar to this
that you can fill out for your
configuration with all the required
pieces that you'll need to install LTFS
le successfully we have some network
information for the LTF SLE server some
partition information on the SL 3000
library some AC SLS configuration
information and we have some fiber
channel stance which information in the
library there's a couple things you do
want to make sure of when you configure
your partition number one you want to
make sure that the interface is HLI you
want to make sure you have some storage
cells some drive bays and you want to
make sure you have an HL i cap and here
we have in this particular configuration
we do have one each of the three drive
types that we support Oracle storagetek
T 10,000 see minimum firmware of 15 7 30
8 HP lto-5 minimum firmware I 59 s and
IBM lto-5 minimum firmware CB x0 now the
AC SLS over the way we have it
configured is we do match the ACS to the
partition number on the library just
good a good best practice is to make
sure you match up when you configure acs
LS to match up acs to
partition you're controlling which makes
it easy on the AC sls server you also
want to make sure that you set the cat
priority to a nonzero value in this case
we're going to set it to five so I'm
going to take you over here to the SL
three thousand library via the SL
console you can see here that partition
three we do have an HL I partition we
have some storage cells we have some
drive bays we have an T 10,000 see our
HP lto-5 and are not and our IBM lto-5
we have an HL i cap and we have some
media so our library is configured and
ready to go if i go take a look at acs
LS i'm going to query all the drives i
can see here that I have my three drives
that are online and available our T
10,000 see HP lto-5 IBM ltl phi by query
all the volumes we have some bones in
here we have a couple of lto-5 volumes
and we have a tea 10,000 see volume and
see here on acs acs 3 is what we r is
what we're going to use for this LTFS le
install if i do a query on the cap or
cat ball just see we have we have cap 3
is set to a a nonzero value for the
priority in this case five so RAC sls
server is configured and ready to go we
go take a look at our Fibre Channel SAN
switch zone configuration we can see
here we have a zone set up we've got
some ports in the zone you can see here
that we've got some hardware plugged in
we've got our our server plugged in
looks like we have a qlogic HBA we've
got a tee 10,000 see our HP lto-5 and
IBM lto-5 the zone is active ready to go
ready for an install so at this point
all of our hardware is configured and
ready for an ltf SLE installation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
