hair have a great weekend Carlos Carlos
the release has been pulled in
we need the shopping API deployed to the
test instance by 6:00 a.m. tomorrow well
I guess jeez I was gonna go to the gym
get a haircut I've got dinner with
Jackie and dancing with the crew this
API will take all night
what am I gonna do Oh Carlos this is
make it or break it figure out how to
use the Oracle API platform and get it
done right the Oracle API platform it's
super easy I can get this done in no
time
look if you get it done you can take a
few days off next week on the company
yeah the Oracle API platform it's really
versatile and simple with the
cloud-based console I can configure the
endpoints and policies it'll be a snap
it's great the Oracle a lot server is
integrated with the API platform so I
don't need to do any gateway level
configurations and the on premise
gateway pulls down the API deployments
that I configure automatically so I can
just do it from my iPad
I remember having to VPN into our old
solution with the Oracle API platform
I'm able to just use a cloud management
portal regardless I need an update let's
see I'll add Olaf for user
authentication and authorization rate
limit the applications to a hundred
calls per second specify my interface
with resources and methods that's good
enough to get people going deploy and I
can publish the apiary swagger
documentation to the developer portal
next week when I'm back from my days off
done just in time who had me worried
Oracle API platform work smarter to
