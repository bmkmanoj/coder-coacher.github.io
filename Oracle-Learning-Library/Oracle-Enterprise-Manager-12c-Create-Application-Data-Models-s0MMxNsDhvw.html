Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series here we assume the necessary
packages and functions have already been
installed on your target database as
shown in a previous demonstration in
this demo we show you how to create an
application that a model used to quickly
identify the application relationships
for the HR noe symbol schemas we will
use that application data model to do a
data subsetting operation in another
demonstration in this example we will
not specify sensitive columns used for
data masking operations application data
model objects are the bases for
performing the rest of the test data
management operations okay so we now
need to create the application data
model so go to the enterprise menu
quality management and then select data
discovery and modeling so on this stage
you're going to create your application
data model one is already created let's
create a new one so here you need to
specify the name of the application data
model the description and you need to
specify or select a source database in
this case here we're going to select
this one
so click select and then you can click
continue once you've identified the
database you use a name credential to
identify the schema you want to look
after and here we're gonna select HR and
the OE schemas so you can click continue
and then submit the job so there you can
see it it is scheduled you can not edit
it while it's scheduling so refreshing
the page until it succeed and you can
see it here so you can select it now and
click Edit to look at what has been
discovered so first before you can look
at it you need to specify
named credential click continue here and
then there you are so 4-h all these
other tables which has been discovered
and for OAE here they are now let's have
a look at referential relationships so
for example let's expand the HR schema
and let's have a look at the department
table for example so these are the two
dependent tables employees in Java story
here we will not look at the sensitive
columns so just click save and return to
return to your data discovery and
modeling pages and that's basically the
end of the demonstration
