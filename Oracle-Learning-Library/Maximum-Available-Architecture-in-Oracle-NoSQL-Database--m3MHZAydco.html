want to express our gratitude for your
and your team's involvements and
assistance everybody welcome welcome to
this presentation of Oracle's no SQL
database maximum available architecture
maa let's present a team involved with
this concept welcome I'm still hungry
pop and I've been working with
relational databases for almost 25 years
hi
and then it's very good I've been
working with Java for the last 14 years
and will be Data technologies four or
five years and I'm Michael Ellison this
presentation is divided into four
sections the use case the project where
this concept was conceived
why maa why reliable data how it works
and a brief demo this solution came from
a real clients use case we generalized
it so others may see its benefits in
their own businesses this customer wants
to analyze their business activities in
real time anyone in the retail business
or the logistics sector can understand
this need especially with the holiday
shopping season upon us Cyber Monday
Black Friday you can understand the
benefits of analyzing your business
activities in real time during periods
of intense activities to achieve this
their remote offices and regional sites
must send their business activities in
real time these activities these
transactions are received by corporate
data dot a transaction receiving center
a store fast enough reliable enough to
handle vast amount of individual
transactions this data doc is Oracle no
SQL their real-time applications are
implemented with other Oracle middleware
products like coherence which requires a
persistent store again this is Oracle no
SQL
whenever you incorporate a new
technology into your data center you
obviously study its features and
functionalities you must also study its
compatibility to keep your business
continuity business continuity as your
infrastructure resilience to
disturbances so this new technology must
be consistent with your business
continuity and the investments made in
the data centers like high availability
and disaster recovery you cannot afford
to introduce a weak link that could
increase your system susceptibility to
altitudes or data loss
Oracle no SQL database has been
conceived with high availability and
disaster recovery in mind the maximum
availability architecture is a blueprint
of the best H a and D our practices
based on expert recommendations and
customers experiences in or demo you
will see an applications resilience to
switch over maintenance outages and a
secondary data center failure on a
primary data center failure that
requires a manual intervention much
similar to a data guard failover we
claim H a with no data loss we will
explain it improvement ask the
representatives of other no SQL products
if they can make the same statement to
understand no secure array one must
understand the functionality of the
product itself
here are some basic concerns the zone is
a grouping of machines with good network
connectivity let's draw two each in
different sites these zones can be
either primary or secondary your
replication factor of a zone is the
number of copies kept 3 is a typical
number used to ensure replication and to
ensure quorum both producers of majority
a primary zone will host the master copy
of a piece of data and maintains a
quorum to enforce consistent operations
the secondary zones only contain data
which can only serve as replicas for
rates the switchover is the
interchanging of zone roles in a fully
operative system for example like we
have currently drawn
the secondary zone failure does not have
major impacts for the reason stated
earlier for example if this side fails
the system continues to operate if the
primary is on phase we must perform a
failover which tell the surviving zones
to remove a quorum and to them grade the
failed primary to secondary this is the
foundation of no secure maa
Dennis will discuss the concept of
durability which will tie everything
together and now Michael rich change
this topology be a small conceptual
change let's provide an OS Carroll
administrator with controls and options
to resolve issues is only the logical
consequence aggregate physical elements
let's split these URLs with RF so 3 into
3 zones of RF so once all this is done
by dividing logical constructs let's
make one more change
let's move one primary zone having a
primary zone in each of the two sides is
very important in maa obviously the
administrator now has more maneuver room
one last point we need to redefine the
standard concept of primary site you see
both sides have primary zones but the
primary site is that which has a simple
majority of primary zones while the
secondary site does not the durability
of north QL can be compared to
committing a transaction in an Oracle
database by writing into the grid blocks
the application does not receive a mark
knowledge from the Cavey store until the
decided to the ability is achieved there
are three levels of durability Zinn
terminologies let's see with our example
when we have a radical factor of 3
without all replicas acknowledged
durability all through replicas must
acknowledge the receive the data with
simple majority at least two replicas
must ignore
to meet this condition and lastly with
no actual replicas only masters
participate but we don't include this in
the maximum availability architecture
let's compare no SQL Duda will give with
data guards protection modes maximum
protection is like a replica technology
it guarantees the secondary site has
committed transactions and we block
application and the discords maximum
performance is like simple majority the
secondary site may not have the latest
committed transactions but the
applications are not blocked by
secondary site failures which leads us
to maximum reliability the native no SQL
driver does not support this and may
require a change but we have prototype
this change ensure no data loss for the
secondary site is active and we don't
block application with the secondary
fails just like with data guard to
choose your level of protection okay
let's have a look at all four topologies
in the name of each topology the capital
letter represents the primary site as
defined earlier by Michael the lowercase
letter indicates that the secondary site
contains a primary zone these are the
standard topologies for business as
usual and these are the topologies for
planned or unplanned outages these photo
colleges are created in the KB store but
only one is active at a given time the
default active topology is top a B now
let's explain a seed switchover we plan
a notice on site a therefore we execute
the switchover from top a B to top B the
animation shows how some zones are
switching their type and once we are
done with the maintenance tasks we
switch back to top a big topology which
is our normal operations topology note
that the steps we have just explained
will be similar in case of an unplanned
outage but the federal our command would
perform additional actions to ensure :
consistency and now Mike let's introduce
the demo
this demo is based on a natural
deployment of two big data appliance
turtle racks each in separate sites six
nodes in each four networks in total to
infinity bands and to Ethernet this demo
simulates two sites for networks but
only half the nodes six
we shall fast-forward the videos to best
utilize our time additionally to
facilitate the maintenance of a KD store
we have an SQL CTL a proof-of-concept
utility here's a quick overview with a
minimal amount of setup you can create
start/stop remove Switzer worked it over
with the single command the entire kv
store cluster the network and host
sections will configure the et Cie host
files in the entire cluster ensuring
proper traffic in each of the network's
this topology set is created with each
of the KB stores the prime topology
defines the structures and the zone
types while the additional topology only
reconfigures is on types these are the
four topologies mentioned by Stefan here
we have three kv stores generalizing the
same hardware each with default values
with the exception of ports and disks
here's an example of a cave East or
administrative started stopping removing
and creating a store no SQL connects to
each of the nodes and performs the
appropriate action
information concerning n SQL CTL this
prototype utility please contact a ship
let's say you have a planned outage on
your primary site for the weekend
you will want to reconfigure your
topology online
we will switch over to top B for the
weekend and then back to top a B all the
time keeping the application running
to save time we will fast forward the
video notice how the VirtualBox machines
are shut down and restarted
notice how no secure is always running
now let's verify the walls processed by
the application and compare it to the
rows in the cable store we query the kV
Stovall number from both sites and
compare the results with the number of
walls inserted by the application they
match we have just reconfigured the
topology twice online and that was
transparent to the application no
downtime no they tell us in order to
easily compare the counts we will stop
the kV store remove it and recreate it
let's assume your site B has failed and
expectedly
you will notice how the application
drops from maximum protection to maximum
performance
because this could last several hours of
days will want to return all three
primary sounds to side a we will call
this a site level failover no SQL
control will launch all the appropriate
comments now we see all the primary
sounds are inside a notice that the
application returns to maximum
protection when site B gets online again
we'll want to return to our standard
configuration
first we must fail back and we
incorporate the fail it sounds
note that all the sounds are active
again now we switch over to site a
nothing to get in the zone status
let's compare counts once more
no that allows no application outage and
we are back in business as usual we
thought you enjoyed this presentation we
will explain work on slow SQL maximum
available architecture and demonstrative
we grouped then Stefan gave any closing
remarks oracle provides no security
solution that complements your oracle
database data resolution with no
deterrence who provides transparent no
data loss and no service log features in
its noise dosage as we have demonstrated
can anyone know SQL brothers make the
same thing or on our SQL database it
spinning
it's fast it's reliable it's worthy to
be in your portfolio and you can cross
it in your data center enjoy the rest of
your visit here at Oracle OpenWorld 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
