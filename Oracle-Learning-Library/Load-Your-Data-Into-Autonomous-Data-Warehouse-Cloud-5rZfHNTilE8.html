autonomous data warehouse cloud if you
have small volumes of data to load you
can load data by sequel net but if you
have large volumes of data the preferred
technique is to load from files stored
in a cloud-based object store such as
Oracle object storage where a.m. is on
AWS s3 let's find out how to upload data
to Oracle object storage and then copy
this stage data into the database tables
an autonomous data warehouse cloud
start with uploading the datum sign into
Oracle cloud interface select object
storage from the storage menu create a
bucket in a compartment of Oracle object
storage
click upload object to begin selection
of the data files you want to upload to
the bucket
navigate to the location of the data
files on your local computer
drag and drop each file or click upload
object to upload each file here the data
files of the sales history tables from
an Oracle sample schema uploaded you can
also use curl commands to upload large
numbers of files
the data files are uploaded to the
bucket these files stage to the cloud
are ready to be copied into the tables
of your autonomous data warehouse cloud
database to load data from an Oracle
cloud infrastructure object storage
objects store you will need to create a
swift password for your object store
account the communication between your
autonomous data warehouse cloud database
and the object store relies on the Swift
protocol and username password
authentication click user settings under
your user name on the object storage
console
click swift passwords under resources on
the left of the console click generate
password a pop-up dialog appears set the
swift password by performing the
following steps in the pop-up dialog
enter a description click the generate
password button copy the generated
password to a text file it will not be
shown again click close next store the
credentials of the object store in the
target schema of your autonomous data
warehouse cloud database open sequel
developer and connect to your autonomous
data warehouse cloud database as your
target user
in a sequel developer worksheet use the
create credential procedure of the DBMS
cloud package to store the object store
credentials in your target user schema
create a credential name you will
reference this credential name in the
copy data procedure in the next step
specify the credentials for your Oracle
data infrastructure object storage
service the object storage username and
swift password generated in the previous
step after you run this script your
object stores credentials will be stored
in your autonomous data warehouse cloud
user schema in a sequel developer
worksheet use the copy data procedure of
the DBMS cloud package to copy the data
staged in your object store to your
autonomous data warehouse cloud user
tables for credential name specify the
name of the credential you defined for
file URI list
specify the URL that points to the
location of the file staged in your
object store the URL is structured as
follows where you specify the region
name tenant name bucket name and file
name
the data has been copied from the object
store to the tables in your autonomous
data warehouse cloud database all data
load operations done using the PL sequel
package DBMS cloud are logged in to
tables the DBA load operations table
shows all load operations the user load
operations table shows the load
operations in your schema
this is a query on the user load
operations table it shows that five rows
were loaded into the channels table with
no failures the log and bad files are
accessible as tables for detailed steps
on performing the example shown in this
video go to the Oracle Learning Library
and open the tutorial named loading your
data find out more at cloud oracle.com
