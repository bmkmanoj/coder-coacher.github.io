manager 12c demo on pluggable database
as a service before we get into
pluggable database as a service let's
first spend a few moments defining what
pluggable database is pluggable database
is a new consolidation model available
with Database 12c multi-tenant option it
provides an excellent way of
consolidating databases multiple
databases potentially hosting different
applications into a single container
database thereby maintaining isolation
and security it also offers means of
provisioning and deep provisioning using
agile plug and unplug mechanisms thereby
resulting in significant cost and effort
savings for using pluggable database as
a service we have to first log into
enterprise managers self-service console
as we know Enterprise Manager 12c comes
with an out of box self-service console
that provides
infrastructure-as-a-service database as
a service middleware platform as a
service and testing as a service in this
console we can see notifications on the
databases that are due to expire or into
some retirement policy the service
templates that have been recently
published I can monitor my usage of
databases schema as a service and
pluggable databases against the coder
that has been assigned by the
administrator I can review my instances
that i have already provisioned and i
can also look at my requests that are
either in progress or have succeeded or
failed in the past so as a social
service user i'm going to request a
pluggable database it provides me
various options we are a Service Catalog
it provides me options for deploying
small medium and large pluggable
databases it also provides a facility
for migrating free 12c databases into
Klauss II we don't see that option in
the Service Catalog because it hasn't
need configured by the administrator but
it is a feature that supported in
enterprise manager 12c so
in this case I am going to select a plug
of empty pluggable database just to
create a shell pluggable database and
then deploy my applications into it it
provides me and interview a single page
interview with minimal sets of inputs
right I need to provide where to
provision this is what we call a zone in
the enterprise manager 12c cloud
management parlance zone in this case is
nothing but a collection of container
databases I need to provide a database
service name prefix to be able to
identify my database and I can choose
from different workloads assigned by the
administrator so that it can place the
pluggable database within the right
container database without creating
fragmentation I need to provide the
administrator name for the pluggable
database and click Submit that's all my
pluggable database is now going to be
deployed within the zone and the entire
operation is completely transparent to
me as a cell service even I can see my
request is in progress while this is
going on let's look at one of the
pluggable databases that have already
been deployed so it takes me to a
monitoring home page where i can monitor
some of the matrix of pluggable
databases i can also get to control the
pluggable database shut down or start it
up i can choose to backup or restore a
pluggable database and i also have the
connection details so that i can connect
from an external application the
self-service portal also provides
facility to look at my chargeback
information enterprise manager 12c cloud
management provides a way for
administrators to define charge plans so
that they can actually meter the usage
of the database as a service by various
cell service users so as a self-service
user I can get to see my own chargeback
information how much
usage I have incurred anything that's
available in the cell service console is
also available via restful api is so
that i can choose to integrate it with
external third-party applications or my
homegrown total in this particular demo
i am not covering the administrator side
of things but for pluggable database as
a service it is very important to also
understand and appreciate that means
very features that are available with
12c first of all Enterprise Manager 12c
provides excellent performance
management and lifecycle management for
pluggable databases when we look at
pluggable database as a service there
are a few things that we need to keep in
mind such as Prague v it provides
various facilities such as inventory
tracking searching topology viewer
reporting to control the sprawl of
pluggable databases for a complete set
of features available for pluggable
database management and pluggable
database as a service visit odeon oracle
