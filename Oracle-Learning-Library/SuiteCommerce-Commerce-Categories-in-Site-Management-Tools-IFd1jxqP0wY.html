sub-categories to organize the items
available on the site and this makes it
easy for visitors to browse items based
on their category assignments site
management tools makes it quite simple
to create categories and subcategories
and to assign items to those categories
during this video I'm going to show you
how to create categories and
subcategories in site management tools
and how to assign items to those
categories we'll also take a look at the
SCA category navigation menu that is
based on the category structure and
we'll take a quick look at the
configuration options for the category
menu before I get started there are a
couple of things to keep in mind when
managing Commerce categories you can
manage categories only while editing the
live site so this means that the
category and the item assignments are
available immediately on your site
however you can set a category to not
display in the website
this lets you spend your time with the
category assigning subcategories and
items and then when you're ready you can
change it to display in the site to set
a category to not display the site you
edit the Commerce category record in
NetSuite
so let's have a category I met the home
page of my site and to add a category I
first go to overview mode notice that an
overview mode I see the message that
categories cannot be managed in the
unpublished version of the site so I
need to click the Edit live site button
to put me in editing live site mode and
I see the warning message that I'm
editing the live site I have two options
in a review mode categories and landing
pages and as you can probably guess
selecting categories lets me manage
categories and selecting landing pages
lets me manage landing pages this is the
category list and you see I already have
some category set up on my site notice
the men and women categories have an
arrow at the beginning this lets me know
that those are parent level categories
that have subcategory assignments I
click the arrow to expand a category and
see the subcategories my current
category hierarchy has only two levels
but a category hierarchy can have many
different levels and I click the arrow
again to collapse it to another new
category I click the new category button
this displays the category settings in
the side panel there are three different
tabs for entering category information
these are general metadata and advanced
I want to create a new category named
outdoor so I start on the general tab
and in our outdoor in the name field
notice that site management rules
automatically sets the URL to outdoor I
can change this if I want I'm going to
leave it as outdoor I'll also set the
heading to outdoor and notice on the
page preview' the heading is displayed
right here
next I go to the metadata tab this is
where I set the FEL related properties
for my category page please include the
title the meta description and the meta
keywords the value I enter for the title
populates the HTML title tag setting it
as the page title the value I enter for
the meta description populates the
content attribute for the meta
description HTML element and remember
this description is often used as a
summary for a page on search engine
results pages any value I enter for the
meta keywords populates the content
attribute for the meta keywords HTML
element although many search engines
ignore the meta keywords these days so
I'm going to leave the keywords blank
the third tab is the Advanced tab and
here you can enter any HTML code or
JavaScript to add to the head area of
the page I have none so I'll leave this
empty and say my category page
now I want to create two more categories
temps and backpacks and these category
pages will be assigned to subcategories
to the outdoor category and for
brevity's sake I'm going to speed things
up here
now that I have my two additional
categories I need to move them to a
subcategory position under the outdoor
category to do this I click the context
menu for the backpacks category and
select move then drag it to a
subordinate position under the outdoor
category and click Save and now I'll
repeat that process for the tents
category
now that I have my categories in the
position that I want I need to add
products I start with the backpacks
category I'll click the category and
then click Add items and next I'll enter
a search term I enter backpacks as my
search term and press ENTER and this
gives me a list of items that match the
search criteria
now I thought the items I want to assign
to the category and after they're all
selected I drag them here and finally
I'll click the Save button
this initiates a partial search free
index of the selected items and it can
take five to seven minutes for those
items to show up on the category page
and then I'll use the same procedure to
add tens to the ten category
now let's take a look at the site the
first thing I see as in the new category
and when I point to the outdoor menu at
the top I see menu options for my
subcategories I can jump directly to a
subcategory if I want or I can click the
parent level category this is the parent
level category page for my outdoor
category and notice that I don't have a
banner image for parent category or
thumbnail images for the subcategories
these images are set on the commerce
categories record in NetSuite so be sure
and watch the related video that shows
you how to set category banner in
thumbnail images notice that when I'm on
a category or subcategory page I also
have a category menu in the sidebar and
that shows me the parent level category
and the associated subcategories when I
click a category and scroll to the
bottom of the page I see the items that
I assigned to this category you can
change certain properties of the
category menu such as the sort order and
the number of levels displayed in the
suite commerce configuration that was
set up if a commerce advanced
configuration select your website in
your domain and then go to the
integration sub tab in the category sub
tab I'm not going to review all of these
now but you can learn more about the
ministry commerce configuration
