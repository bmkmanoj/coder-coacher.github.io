demonstration my name is Maria Billings
I work for Oracle server technologies
curriculum in this demonstration we show
you how to recover a broken database by
using an encrypted backup so we first
used the data recovery advisor to
analyze what is wrong and then we use it
to repair the database backup note the
slide also shows you the functionality
that we assume is in place and which are
shown in previous prerequisite demos
that is there is a key store and the
data have been backed up encrypted next
you encounter a broken database use the
data recovery advisor in stressful
moments connected to an idle instance
means of course the database is down so
attempt to start it you see the error
messages that it cannot find the data
file for su shocks in the ASM this is
one that we had previously deleted in
the background to produce an issue so
now let's connect to our mean and begin
recovery locked into our mean you begin
analyzing your errors with the data
recovery advisor which is a cool friend
to have when things are wrong so execute
the list failure command the failure has
a high priority and it is open that
means it's currently affecting your
system execute the advice failure
command and read the responses that the
data recovery advisable for you so here
you see that it suggests a manual option
you could restore the Swiss aux file if
that if you intentionally removed it or
unintentionally as we but that is not
what I want to show so we will
demonstrate the second
part-2 automatically restore and recover
the data file if you wish to see the
commands that are mean will execute on
your behalf
then enter the repair failure preview
command next we execute the repair
failure command but this will produce an
error and you might be guessing it
already that the error occurred because
the database went down it has not been
restarted and the keystore is not
configured with auto log-in so you have
to explicitly open the key store or
formerly known as wallet to be able to
use the encrypted backup
we walked into sequel + SS km or sis DBA
we opened the key store and it's done
back in Armen execute the repair failure
command and you see that our Armen reads
the encrypted backup piece here you see
that
Armen starts media recovery with you
encrypted backup piece and then it asks
you if you wish to open the database to
which we respond with yes
so the database is now opened and
optionally if you wish to confirm that
there are no further failures you can
execute the list failure command again
so this was the third video in a
mini-series on using TDE for backing up
and restoring data in the first video we
had shown you how to create a key store
with master key and open it in the
second how to backup the database with
transparent data encryption and here we
just completed how to restore a data
file the slide also has some general
answers to the question what is TD
