control console is a rich interface that
provides you with the customizable
feature Laden single pane of glass for
monitoring and managing a wide variety
of targets within your enterprise when
you log on for the first time you are
presented with the choice of different
types of pages you can use as your
default home page for your future logins
you can choose your summary overview
incidents overview databases overview
and middleware overview
click in the middle of any of these
pages to preview what the pages would
look like the summary overview gives you
a summary of the targets health
another area of interest is navigation
Enterprise Manager supports what we call
global menus that are accessible from
wherever you are in the interface let's
start with the Enterprise menu this menu
gives you access to the key
functionalities within Enterprise
Manager
the targets menu allows you to look at
your targets by types groups systems and
services
the favorites menu is basically
equivalent of bookmarks in a browser you
can mark an Enterprise Manager page as a
favorite the summary page is currently
your home page the history menu shows
you the last 10 targets that you visited
use the setup Global menu to specify
your preferences which dictate how you
access various areas from Enterprise
Manager like targets passwords email
addresses and your home page you can
also add targets manage your agents and
set up your security next let's move to
the help menu this is where you access
Oracle resources like online help
documentation user forums and OTN
another interesting feature is global
search use this feature to search by
target name
on the left panel there are additional
search facets to further filter the
search such as displaying only the
targets that are up and available or by
a particular software version
once you are done clear all your filters
and at any point in time save your
searches if you plan to reuse them on a
frequent basis
now let's drill down to a host target
homepage
the targets homepage gives you an
overview of the targets health with
information like its status and
performance
each targets home page displays the
targets name and current status at the
top
there's an information icon you can
click to give you quick access to
important information about that
particular target every target also has
a contextual target menu this menu is
target specific for example you can go
to monitoring and then CPU details at
any point in time you can go back to the
targets homepage
because you'll access this page on a
regular basis let's make it a favorite
once added you can see it in your
favorites menu
you can make any page your home page for
example you are an administrator working
on incidents and you want to make the
incident manager your home page
you
you can verify that this page is your
home page by looking at your favorites
menu
