of an iam user account for the source
AWS account configured in Kross account
logging with the target account more
information on cross account logging can
be found in other videos in this series
at this point in the configuration
you should have enabled cross account
logging created at the cross account
role in the target account modified the
policy on the target s3 bucket to allow
the source account cloud trail to write
logs to it and optionally configured an
iam user to be used as a dedicated
service account by Oracle cos B to
monitor the target account
first login to your source AWS account
to create the dedicated service account
create an I am user account and assign a
specific policy to it to do this select
services and then under security
identity in compliance select I am
select users to create the account
when you add this new user you need to
provide a username this user will never
need to log into the AWS management
console but you will need the access
keys so select programmatic access and
navigate to the permissions screen
here you're going to assign this user an
existing policy you can register your
AWS account into Oracle Casbah cloud
service in one of two modes read-only
and readwrite in both modes you'll
baseline your AWS security controls in
Oracle Caspi cloud service any
subsequent changes to the security
controls in AWS will generate an alert
in Oracle Casspi cloud service in read
write mode Oracle Casspi cloud service
can revert those changes back to the
baseline settings keeping your AWS
instance in compliance however in this
mode AWS requires Oracle Casbah cloud
service to have administrator access to
make these changes directly back into or
AWS account read-only mode requires the
read-only access policy enter read-only
access in the search filter
scroll to the bottom and select the
policy
then navigate to the review screen
verify the name of the I am user that
the AWS access type is set to
programmatic access with an access key
that the correct policy is attached to
the I am user and then create the user
now download the CSV file to view the
access keys
this is the only time you'll be able to
do this if you lose these access keys
you'll have to regenerate a new set in I
am an update oracle Caspi cloud service
with them in order for oracle Casspi
cloud service to monitor your AWS
account best practice is to rotate your
iam user Keys every 90 days so you'll
become familiar with this process if you
aren't already
if you chose read-only access you will
need to add one more policy statement to
the user to allow it to use Amazon
simple token service to assume the
cross' account role this allows it to
read the s3 bucket and provide the
metadata to Oracle Casbah cloud service
select the user you just created and
select add inline policy
choose a custom policy and click select
name the policy and copy and paste the
policy statement from the help
documentation you will notice that the
action to STS is to assume role and the
user is a variable finally apply the
policy this is called a dedicated
service account because it should be
dedicated to the Oracle Caspi cloud
service to monitor your AWS account no
human nor any other application should
use this account to log into your AWS
accounts once you have downloaded your
access keys navigate back to the iam
dashboard where you can view the user
that you just created with cloud trail
enabled an s3 bucket collecting cloud
trail log data and the dedicated service
account you are ready to register your
AWS account into Oracle Caspi cloud
service
congratulations you created a dedicated
service account for a source AWS account
configured in cross account logging
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
