Java developer for a financial exchange
in london this is the world finance and
technology where there really are not
that many women and so the very first
thing that someone who she says to me oh
you're a girl thanks for that I didn't
know that so I do presentations about
java programming and concurrency in Java
and finance and all these kind of
technical in and blow key type of
subjects apparently and I got asked to
do a presentation here about women in
technology and I very nearly said no
because I don't want to be the
mouthpiece for women in technology I am
a girl I am a developer but I can't say
what all of you are thinking I don't
know what what's the right thing for you
guys so when people ask me what what do
women want in technology why aren't
there enough women in technology then my
answer is how should I know I'm here I'm
a developer I don't know the answer to
your problems so I'm going to give you
the answer to your problems anyway I'm
you know I don't know I'm going to do a
techie to best we're going to go through
the problem the problem of women in
technology we are going to dissect it in
a properly technical way probably
although none of you guys have beer in
your hand so you're not doing at the
London way at all we're going to dissect
the problem in in a properly technical
way we are going to go through some
ideas do a bit of brainstorming this is
going to be interactive and i am going
to force you to speak and then we're
going to hopefully come up with some
take-home points so that we can all go
away and make our lives a better place
that's the theory and so yeah just to
set those flight you know not really too
ambitious targets and the problem is
there are not enough women in technology
apparently this is a problem for me this
is not a problem because I am a woman in
technology and my CV stands out amongst
all the other guys I get asked to speak
at conferences and it's very easy to to
be noticed as a woman in technology I
don't really see
this is an issue for me but for
technology as a whole then it is a good
idea we need more developers we need
more techies we need more people doing
what we do we need to broaden the scope
of our appeal and attract more people to
come and work with us and for us and
since we're actually losing you know
we've got anecdotally from the london
java community i've ran a poll and said
how many how many techies you work with
women and they came up with sort of ten
to twenty percent so I've ten to twenty
percent of your workforce or women then
there's a huge pool of resources there
that you're not using not using and we
need more technical people we need more
technical people and we can visibly see
that there are no women and that seems
like a good pool of people to try and
attract it also hints to me this is a
lot of swimming all full of personal
opinion here by the way you I've got a
mic friend I'm standing in front of you
lot and I'm talking about subject I feel
passionately about I feel sorry for you
lot you're going to be in trouble so to
me the fact that there are not very many
women in technology is a sign of a smell
like a code smell is design of a smell
that we are not attracting other people
that are not as visible okay so we can
tell the women in the men it's really
obvious you know there are very few
women and and and loads and loads of
guys and so clearly we're putting off
women in actual fact my opinion is that
where there's a whole bunch of people
that we're putting off okay there's a
you know there's I'm going to try and do
something really probably bad out here
that I mean there's an awful lot of
white people in here let's be honest you
know there's a few beige people but you
know we're very white and and we don't
really talk a lot about but about the
right side of things and we don't talk a
lot about the spread of you know how
many homosexuals do we have versus
heterosexuals we do talk a lot about the
women in ninety thing if we can solve
the problem of why we're not appealing
to women in technology we might be able
to address some of the other issues as
well that's so this is the problem we
appeal to a small subset of people i
think is there another part of a problem
yes and the other thing is that we've
been i think as an industry we started
off with lots of women all right we
started off
in Lexington Park and in London and
crating computers and pretty much
everyone there was a woman because all
the men were off at war and up through
the 60s those loads of women so in
actual fact the problems got worse over
over the decades and over the noughties
and the 90s the number of women in
technology actually decreased so this is
also a sign of a smell this is also part
of the problem so not only is the
problem not only does it exist it looks
like it's getting worse so we are going
to our explain that stuff already we're
going to take a bit of technical
approach that i set the problem and
lower belly up and we're going to use
some of some agile ideas as well to
bring this out so i'm going to invite
George up on stage to do the
requirements of this of this particular
exercise as a good technical person
should do and I should have got that
much fun time to look do you want to use
can we turn that on great thank you
thank you I think it's all right I'll
stand back here is that are we good now
can you this is gonna freaky yesterday I
had the opposite thing because i had a
lavalier mic but it wasn't actually
turned up so i had to hold it like
basically in my mouth for people to hear
so now i'm just going to try to find the
right bounce um so um I actually don't
have a lot of nice oh I do have nice
notes look at that oh I was going to
travel a type you're getting blind with
each other alright I gotta hear okay no
way good don't get so close oh I'm just
waiting for the feedback to happen um do
it descend over here I'm standing here
about me but promise that's right
not to tip me off with a thing you know
here's what's gonna now what's going to
happen it I don't know if you can see
there's a cable down here and it's all
wound around like this and my foot is in
the middle of it so when she runs a
little bit further you can see me kind
of pulled along behind me yo well no no
this is uh the other way around i'm
going to be the one who's dragged under
the wheels so and then maybe a woman who
can come along and replace me so I start
talking talking about requirements well
this is easy right I mean when I think
about you know the requirements of what
I need what I need what we look for when
we try to find people to hire there's
sort of one part there is hiring there's
making people productive and there's
being able to sort of keep people around
for a long period of time and so these
are all part of the things that you know
as a vice president of software
development you know that I think about
right this keeps keeps me awake I want
to be able to find the best people i
want to find people who are intelligent
who have experience and are driven I
want to find people who are able to
cooperate and work with other people
around them and there's absolutely
nothing in that description that says
that has to be you know a particular
category it's not you know there's
nothing male about that there's nothing
female about that and it's tradition
point out there there are a lot of other
you know ways of sort of breaking down
human populations that actually have
nothing to do with that so that for me
is is sort of those are the things that
are our requirements that's what I look
for the second piece of this which is
how do you make a workplace one that is
welcoming and that actually makes it so
that everyone who is there is able to
take part and be productive and you know
this one is a little bit a little bit
more of a head-scratcher right because I
think that what tends to happen is you
know people sort of naturally do the
things that come naturally to them they
do the things they like and not everyone
likes the same things and not everyone
always realizes that the things that
they like may actually be off-putting
for other people or
you know if they if you're a group that
has that does not have a lot of
diversity and somebody's coming you know
you have one maybe 10 people from one
kind of background and one person from
another one there may be things that
feel very you know natural to the nine
people that the other person just feels
like okay I'm completely excluded from
this and in fact you know you might
wonder well I'm not exactly beige I'm i
tend towards beige but you know so what
do I know about this and I actually
would like to say that I have quite a
bit of experience with this I have
experience in being part of the sort of
majority and seeing people in in the
group who have you know a different
thing a different perspective but i also
have it a little bit from the other way
around and there are some people here
who have worked with me at a group in
Sweden and I know you'll be shocked by
this but I actually don't look a whole
lot like most people in Sweden now I'm
generalizing but it's true and when I
first moved there I didn't really speak
the language all that well so I was kind
of this weird guy that was sort of
different and you know what I found was
that my feeling was like coming in with
something like that different it's very
easy to feel excluded and it's not
necessarily something that people are
doing this conscious you know people
didn't go around going hey let's exclude
the American guy you know it was more
that you would come in and people who
talk about things and you know they
would talk about you know just to give
an example hockey or something else and
I'm like okay all right I can deal with
that and you know once or twice it's
kind of it's a little annoying but it's
not that bad but if you feel like this
happens all the time every day and
everything you do it kind of wears you
down and so that for me is is another
requirement this is not a requirement of
people I hire this require meant that I
put on the people who work for me that
we create an environment is welcoming
that we create an environment that's
conscious
of trying to make it so that everyone
who's there can actually do what they
need to do which is get the work that we
need to get done done and then the final
part is this thing of you know a
sustainable sort of long-term
perspective and what I'd say here is
that you know I mentioned that when I
look for people to hire I want people
that have knowledge and background and
experience it doesn't mean that you know
everyone that I hire has been you know
an engineer for 20 years some of them
are but you know they're also people who
come directly from school and what I
would say is that whether they've been
working in the field for 20 years or
whether they come from school I want
them to come and I want to invest in
them right I want to them to become
better I want them to continue to learn
and grow and having done that right
having made that investment I won't
return on investment and I can't get
return on investment if people leave and
I can't get investment if they leave you
know whatever the reason may be so you
know I take the sort of trying to retain
people as something very serious for me
this is a requirement that you know
we're not sort of constantly investing
in people and then creating an
environment that that makes them want to
go somewhere else and that is sort of
multiple things it's not only the
environment that we have every day it's
also the long-term engagement in a
person and you know anyone who's been
working for some period of time and you
know app knows that I know things happen
in people's lives right and this is
something that you know I think well I
feel it particularly because I had the
distinct pleasure of being in Sweden
when my daughter was born and you know I
don't want to turn this into a political
debate but what I would say is that the
sort of policies there made it possible
for me as a man to do things that I
could never do here and that turned out
to be something that actually you know
was quite interesting because you know
you sort of look at it as oh they're
great you know there are great parental
benefits that must be wonderful for the
women well it's wonderful for men too
but people you know don't necessarily
immediately realize that so anyway I've
probably gone way over the three minute
I supposed to do I'm going to turn it
over but keep those things in mind it's
finding and attracting the best talent
it's being able to create an environment
where that talent can be productive and
it's having a commitment to keeping
those people around through everything
that happens in in their lives thank you
very much thank you great so I'm thank
you to steven is no disappeared all
right now have a whiteboard but she's
got some more flipchart going deaf in
one ear here what we're going to do is
where is anyone here working in agile
environment oh great that's awesome does
anyone here not even know what I mean
when I say agile it's okay don't be
afraid and we're going to do a
retrospective because my organization l
max is very very agile and
retrospectives are a great way to get
feedback from people and I'm going to
kill myself I really am and I'm a bit I
don't know if everyone can see this and
the pillars in this room make it kind of
hard and this is kind of small so this
is experimental if it doesn't work I do
have a back-up plan in a retrospective
we are going to go over the good points
the bad points the questions we have and
the ideas that we have which always ends
up with a very odd-looking light bulb
which is not very energy efficient so
what I want to do is go through the
approach so far that we've taken trying
to attract women into IT the advantages
and disadvantages of being of working an
IT full stop especially from the women
who are here but everyone i want to know
everyone's opinions of what's great and
what's bad about working in IT the sorts
things we can change and you know any
questions we have I don't even really
know what sorts of questions they might
be and any ideas we have for the future
we're definitely going to cover this but
we might have more of a chance to do
that
as the next step so does anyone want to
give me I'm going to start with the
negatives oh I'm gonna put the rules up
as well the rules are no moaning okay we
just don't have all day and blogs are
where you moan that's where you put your
bad things okay no moaning we can have a
negative point and that's fine but we're
not going to go on and on about the
really bad things because like really
want to be positive and come up with
something useful for the future no
unconstructive criticism the
constructive criticism and rule 3 was
something which I'll probably tell you
when someone breaks it Trish is right
okay yes so a lot of FATA Pam brilliant
thank you I'm assuming there for that
people can't really see that at the back
I'll try and read it out and if it
doesn't work horribly will try and put
it on the screen or something I am going
to try and capture as much as this as
possible and put it on a blog post
afterwards because like I only do these
sessions as fodder for my blog come on
saw where you'll do it for so negative
points about working in IT and or about
the approach we've taken so far about
trying to attract women into IT the
hours is a bad thing yeah we can put it
on both sides that's fine all right I'm
going to put on the positives as well
okay my time booth babes they were a bad
thing I'm just check-in yes
sorry Philip salary discrepancies
overall yeah if you work for a bank yet
salary I've been programmers yeah I hate
those guys there's like this kind of
knew each other now how new is this is
new ish movement to be all laddish about
programming and get their cakes and be
all like frat boy ish around it it just
so doesn't fit in my mind my vision of
programmers generally the whole frat boy
things like it's not it's not a good fit
at all but there is this whole movement
of programmers and it's just it's just
horrible yes the what education
education pipeline is a bad thing right
but you're right the free education
pipeline so the stats I have a sound got
loads of numbers in my head the stats I
have for the UK is that at GCSE level so
the exams we take it sixteen forty four
percent of ICT so what's that
information computing technology
forty-four percent of them are women at
18 it becomes a 25-percent it's twelve
percent for computer science at 18 and
then at university level it's well below
twelve percent and then when we get to
the workplace who knows what happens so
yeah education pipeline
yes yes so being seen as a woman first
in a technologist second I'm going to
run out of space here yes oh sorry he
was first micromanagement yes you can't
see any of these but any sound making a
note of it no we're trying to go over
all points yes quotas so there's
something around and questioning how you
got your role how you got the job
specifically as a woman but it's not
just for women as well
not honest oh yes drugs thank you oh
yeah sorry okay do you want to unload
and the questions because you said I
don't know what you saw come out cuz my
CIO is a woman mmm where is that sorry
this is not going to work if I keep
coffee through it yes so the cost of
learning so that's frustrating this
quite as a time drain to keep current or
to get up-to-date
oh my goodness more and more work I'm
sorry you had your hand up earlier okay
so positive is a woman brings a
different perspective
can all three if he'd at the same time
time okay we're going to put yeah like a
mentoring so mentoring / rumbles yes I
see so the East increasing number of
senior women yeah I like it I'm going to
come on to that so I'm really pleased
you said that so I'm going to put
stereotypes generally but yeah the the
the programmer stereotype isn't helping
anyone yes oh that's i'm putting that on
negative right I got quotas no it's
never a positive sorry while I'm up here
with a microphone I'm just going to say
quotas or evil I'm sorry they just saw
yes okay so balanced teams are more
productive
so I just kind of let me help uh yes
okay yep yeah so I'm supposed to be
repeating this to microphone there's as
a woman is there is a pressure to be
visible not just as a woman actually
have any sort of diverse type person
there's a pressure to be visible yes
okay so there's lots of jobs in RT
what's a positive and yes so yo javab
ages ago
okay so that thing was two points that
one is gross generalization nit they're
quite accepting your people of
differences I you saying so I say okay
so it there's flexibility and a
meritocracy because are actually of the
fact that you have to stay current and
you have to keep up to date and you're
always learning on the job Martin okay I
do see what you mean and I'm definitely
not going to put that under the negative
women are exceptional thanks my time
okay it is it is a selection bias
because it's so much hot so much more
difficult and so much less likely for
women to go inside see that generally
speaking the ones who even try let alone
the ones who make it are a you know
above the normal line yes were you just
saying hi
the being different makes you stand out
as a positive thing
or
it's good question
so the question is is there a
correlation between gamers and
professional programmers oh and gender
yes sorry I i made the rash assumption
that gamers were boys well the thing is
actually I want to address that a little
bit from anecdotal evidence in my
company financial exchange in london we
have about 25 developers we I've been
there for years and we've just hired our
second woman both of us are gamers and
none of the boys against so that I think
there is a correlation between gaming
and programming and I think that when we
were growing up in their 80s and
generally tended that programmers so
gamers generally tends to be boys and I
think that's changing now I'm going to
move it along a little bit unless
anyone's got something really
desperately yeah
so are the shifting trends in technology
going to help women get more involved if
ya so is new technology more not more
girl friendly but you know the place
books and so forth wider availability it
ok so I'm going to say wider
availability of Technology EG facebook
and as a wider wider appeal you can't
read my writing at all but i'll be able
to tell you fine yes that's a very good
question i like that question is there a
way to think other things we can do as
parents to help our kids get into maybe
right been praying that negative right
pink it and shrink it yes
so is the image of programmers and
technology is is it changing over the
years
okay I think I don't know what time it
is alright so based on that I think
we've got so many good stuff there I
know we have kind of covered a lot of
the specific stuff around women but I
don't think any of it is particularly
female focus necessarily so actually
let's take booth babes booth babes is a
negative it does put women off not only
does it put women off because they're
not attracted to the booth babes it also
puts tiles off because people assume if
you're a woman at the conference then
maybe your booth babe I don't know maybe
I'm not attractive enough but whatever
and it's bad for women everyone else is
bad for women it's also bad for guys
because it assumes that the marketing
people are being extremely lazy and they
assume you guys are going to be
attracted to a booth because there's
some nineteen-year-old wearing no
clothes and and it's a little bit
demeaning on you guys frankly it's it's
not it's a bit rude you know it
basically is Kate's catering for the
lowest common denominator and you guys
in technology are not the lowest common
denominator you know you're a smart guys
so booth babes are bad for everyone it's
not just girls and similarly things like
the hours and the hours are good for
boys and girls the god lack of mentors
and role models that affects everyone
you know all of these things actually I
put something a woman's perspective on
the team having a well-rounded team
woman's perspective all the rest that
stuff it's not just women be great to
get people who speak different languages
have grown up in different countries who
have different I've been exposed to
different products
it's reggae yeah so the point is around
you know it that gay guys who are
especially the ones who are visibly gay
feel I'm not obviously go we're going to
find it more difficult to get work I
can't find I really wanted to find some
stats on that because I really I think
that's part of the same problem that you
can't find anything about that and there
are there isn't like em or not in London
there isn't a kind of you know there
isn't an organization you can go to and
find that out yeah yeah exactly and and
I think that one of the things that I'm
I'll talk about now because i'm here and
i've got a microphone i'm one of the
things that annoys me about the women
and i love the women in our team
movements as specifically and this is my
own personal bug their stuff aimed at
women and only for well it means it
totally misses that sort of problem it
misses the problems of other types of
minorities who need who need the same
sort help i need role models and mentors
and they need networks and they need the
recipe sort of thing yes yes
yes I completely agree Virginia so sorry
that the point the put I want to repeat
that point sorry and the point was that
traditionally lots of women and IT
groups talk about part time working
child care you know flexible working
what you know the fact they're doing all
the parental stuff at home you know and
that's why we can't get on in IT but you
know I don't have any how many women
here don't have kids that's like loads
how many guys here have kids Louis if
you hear right and and and how many
women have kids there's at least if
there's at least as many mothers as
there are fathers here so it's totally
cool it learned in technical terms as a
conflation of concerns right we're
talking about women IT and confusing
with parenting and that's we've got the
domain modeling long bear and so you had
your hand up ages ago
yeah exactly so yeah so there's two
there's two things I wish which are
exactly the things I get really
passionate about one is talking about
women and just women means that we are
not able to address some of the other
areas that might need other minorities
that may or may not get discriminated
against and talk about women and
assuming that they want to have kids
means that we're not addressing the fact
that they're plenty of guys these days
especially in this day and age we want
to spend plenty of time looking after
their kids and taking time out for their
kids um where was I going I said I
wanted loads of interaction and then I
said you've got to shut up because it's
my turn now I home so okay great we've
had loads of really good comments there
and I'm pleased to say that most of you
agree with me so that's awesome and
let's get on with some actions because
otherwise we're all going to have a nice
old moan and then and then nothing will
get done so what sorts of actions can we
do to help improve everyone's situation
and you know not just necessarily women
yes
creative things okay so let's let's oh
look in non-traditional places for
technical talent or talent that could be
technical for example arts and crafts
hobbies
you can't read this at all 7so Women's
Institute as a possibility as a possible
place to reach out to i'm going to write
WI on here and I'll completely forget
what that was yes yep so no network so
networking is absolutely as a particular
and actually that's what these women's
groups are supposed to do their supposed
to open up networks and they tend to
open up networks between women's that's
cool because these people will never
necessarily have met each other but it
doesn't necessarily address women's
networks doesn't address the problems we
were talking about earlier about other
minorities that might not might not get
involved so I will have a plug right now
I'm I say you should join your local
Java user group you're supposed to make
more noise than that guys who here is a
member of a job user group as a few who
here knows what a Java user group is who
here doesn't know what a javanese group
is that's ok put your hands up what's ok
don't be afraid it's our job to tell you
all right so um oh I um actually I
didn't get any of my job start Java user
group but basically I'm speaking here
today because I'll up because of the
London Java user group I did meet my
boyfriend through the London Java user
group so yes definitely join your London
join your local Java user group during
the London wanaque on sale be fine yes
yep so get them young and yeah and they
need to be like I still like the
education pipeline thing I mean they
start to drop off round about yeah 15
you've got to get them really quite
young yes yes yeah exactly
so the point here is around girls in
particular but there are guys to the do
this as well girls in particular in
their teenage years will tell you I
don't want to be a programmer I don't
like technology i'm not good at it or
something like that an actual fact
they're much more technically competent
than than perhaps even the guys they
work with what with good school with or
whatever and there's definitely
something around stereotyping there and
the thing is that the image of what what
it means to be a technologist i think
still needs work definitely sorry John
your Jana beta
yep so go into schools talk to schools
get involved with extracurricular
activities like Cub Scouts Girl Scouts
whatever I don't know who was first okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah so the point is
around the fact that many people in i.t
enjoy their jobs they're basically doing
their hobby getting paid for it and they
love it and and that's something that's
a really important message to give to
kids and that's something I actually
wanted to to really stress in this
session is that normally when we talk
about women and IT we talk about things
like child care rubbish part-time work
is difficult and women don't like
science and it's all very negative and
you know women get attacked at
conferences and you have to be you know
you're seen as a woman first if we see
it we say all these negative things and
none of those are untrue but I think
it's really important as an industry to
start stressing the really cool stuff
because is there anyone here really
hates their job half a person mm-hmm but
I'm sure not everyone here probably
really loves their job but most the time
you like your jobs right right and i was
asking on twitter because i love Twitter
and it's an easy way to write
presentation I was asking them what they
love about their jobs and the techies
love their jobs they have bad days but
they love them and we need to start
broadcasting that evangelizing the fact
that we do this because it's amazing and
we do it because we
we do things which when you talk about
gender stereotypes that you often fall
under the women's bucket which is I've
got the chance to impact users I've got
the chance to make a difference in
people's lives I have the chance to to
work with people you know all of these
them pathak and then pathetic like
fluffy things that supposed to be
women's things that's that's what we all
love about our job not all of us but you
know there's that there's lots of that
in what we do yes yeah so it Bala doing
the team over think he has had on many
things and one thing is I brother gives
me to see their faces ready years from
now to realize that they think oh there
I think that's for truth for us as well
with you also means if they are
satisfied years from I see where
everything goes I think your models that
the way to do go and on all time yeah
this is all attributes like gender a
skin color and for the invisible
attributes then all yes so diversity of
role models is really really important
for the kids and and for us we most of
my role models have been white males
because there's a lot of those guys you
don't I don't need a female role model
but i do know as well there are plenty
of people who playing plenty of guys
will be inspired by women and people
different skin colors so diverse role
models is fundamental to getting more
diversity into the workplace yes yeah
it's good is computer science bar be a
step in the right direction can I throw
that out the audience
that was a good question it's a very
good question do people think that
computer science barbie is a good thing
does anyone think it's a really bad
thing so computer science barbie is a
bad thing because she's got a pink
laptop and if we're a girl program I was
blond hair then we look like Barbies I
mean I think my personal opinion on that
is computer science Barbie the sentiment
was right it was supposed to try and
make these things accessible to women
but they just did Pinker and shrink it
again you know they didn't you know that
the best way to make computer science
sexy and cool is to make a movie or TV
series outfit right and how many people
have been applying to forensic science
at university since CSI came out numbers
have gone through the roof it's crazy
you want it we just want Hollywood to
make it cool and sexy you don't want
sorry its brain CSI does anyone not know
what CSI is okay crime scene
investigation it's it's a it's a
forensic thing so basically people on
telly go around solving forensic things
really quickly in a very sexy fashion we
have a point
yeah so that the point is that that
having a sexy computer scientists a que
barbecued scientist is not necessarily a
bad thing I'm really on the bench about
it personally because I think that I'm I
think it it just almost denigrates what
we do because it's pink and girly but on
the other hand it is yeah it's better
than it was a wide range of Bobby so
Bobby is an avatar for you as a grown-up
and therefore we should allow things
like that into the Barbie world ok yep
yes
but more flexible so the point is that
as a teenager you don't really know what
you want to do when you grow up and I
would argue that there's someone in my
30s I don't really know what I want to
do when I grow up and that you know and
if we're talking about the agile way of
doing stuff you want to be able to make
mistakes fast and undo those mistakes
quickly so spending three years or four
years or five years at college and
studying a degree in hairdressing I
don't know but a degree in whatever and
it's very difficult to undo that and
when you like I know people who went to
become lawyers and it's been a lot of
time becoming orders they spent several
years working in law and then they
became something completely different
because it was horrible and they hated
it so we need to be perhaps we need to
be thinking about things like work
experience for her kids so they can try
it out and see what it's like early on
or or more flexible education system so
you can do bits and pieces and go back
later that's sorry it's two things
number jump and so I want to start
talking while I write this song yep
it's a slightly slightly more mature
women students than male male mature
students so you say Center choice yeah
and there was a yes the computer science
is about failure so basically you're
talking about managing expectations of
of a career yeah yeah so and actually
CSI probably is a good example of false
expectations because they do those kind
of montages and it takes like a minute
and half to get fingerprints instead of
it coming back like a six weeks time by
the time the murderers fled the country
so yeah you're right probably more
realistic expectations than a Hollywood
movie probably better they kind of those
just putting it with a brush but they
still apply and they still get there and
then I guess you're still getting people
they are getting more people than we're
getting and there was a point of it yes
I think I'm modern I've done about the
systems outside the UK but my parents
are teachers and the system in the UK it
generally is geared towards learn this
and pass the exam and yet it's not about
asking questions or being innovative or
exploring or making mistakes yeah I
agree with that yep that's what I got so
bye-bye easy entry technology for your
kitties so raspberry PI's and things
like I reckon I think we had a bit of a
problem in the 90s because I think
programming on things like windows and
by NPCs it was expensive high barrier to
entry I think now most people have got
laptops and phones and pcs and whatever
and we've got things like Facebook apps
and iPhone apps and I think the barrier
to entry is a lot lower so yet so buy it
by your kidneys technology and make them
use it and what I'm writing yes or were
you first sorry
cool I'm glad you said that because I
was going to oh yes so the argument is
that yeah it's difficult to tinker when
we had our BBC micros you know you as
faced with a blinking cursor and that
you've got to learn how to use it and
these days you get a laptop and you open
it up and it's all there and then you
don't have to tinker my personal counter
to that but are you going to counter
that or if you got another point all
right coming back I will be back in a
minute I don't know and I think that yes
that's true but some of the little of
platforms are actually making it I think
that with things like iphone apps and so
forth and some of these easier platforms
means that you can as long as you've got
the right software you can kind of get
in there quite easier than it would have
been 10 years ago 15 years ago but it's
not the same as being forced to tinker
I'll agree with that yes yeah do we know
it does require yes
doesn't have career prospects yet so
that the point is that there certainly
was a perception I don't know what it's
like right now where there was a
perception that software being developer
is not a safe career path because it's
being out sourced and offshored and your
job will go away I think you're right i
think it seems particularly an attitude
in America I think we need to be really
vocal about telling people what we do
and over here to stay and our jobs have
been offshored and then brought back on
again because it doesn't work yeah so we
want we want passionate people going out
to schools or to even to other education
versus or to wherever and telling people
why we're passionate about what we do
and and I would adds that if we all do
that and in our diverse backgrounds then
we will attracts a diverse number of
people i think we're probably running
out of time yet can I give you my three
final points on sorry I'm really pleased
about the interaction me up from people
I didn't get a chance to talk as much as
I wanted to and so hopefully this should
follow on from some other points that
were made just do it just go out there
particularly room but all of us and
we're at least the people who come to
conferences so where it is the people
who are getting out there and doing
something different even if we're just
watching the talks get out there talk to
people meet people do the conference's
doing presentations join your user group
and just do it and particularly for I'm
going to make some gross generalizations
which I hate and particularly for the
women and the less confident amongst the
men which might be all of you you you
are going to make mistakes you are going
to fail we do that in programming all
the time it's okay to do in front of
one else as well because people are
really fine about it it's not really a
problem it's not as scary as it looks it
really isn't that the first time I spoke
was this time last year at javaone that
was a very first time I spoke I haven't
been doing this for like 25 years or
anything like that um to this is this is
kinda for the boys but it's also sort of
for the girls i guess i really want to
stop talking about gender i really want
I would like it boys if you would not
mention site men if you would not
mention to a woman within the first five
minutes of meeting her and you're a
woman isn't that lovely I mean I know
you mean well and I know that everyone
who says that to me they're like that
this you know I'm really glad to see a
woman developer I think it's really
awesome I'm really they're very positive
about it but I really don't need to hear
that the first five minutes of you
meeting me you know I'd rather you said
it's amazing what you did with the
disruptor a tell max I think it's great
um being in turkey rocks go and tell
everyone everyone
