some experience with generator
development that you have some
experience with HTML and JavaScript and
we will be using the following tools we
will be using NetBeans IDE for Java EE
version seven point three point one and
GlassFish server open source edition 4.0
yes specifically what we assume that you
know about Enterprise Edition by this
time is that you know how to create web
applications and how to deploy them to
get GlassFish server we're not going to
touch any servlet or JSP forgives us for
that matter that's why we are asking for
basic HTML and give a script in move it
Java Enterprise seven is compromised of
of three primer seems where it was has
been developed on the focus was for the
Verdes release on developer productivity
html5 support and meeting enterprise
demands if the developer productivity
we made Java EE 7 easier and faster tool
to develop on there's more an updated
for use for configuration then we'll the
brake code more cohesive and integrated
platform this allows developers to
increase the productivity and the html5
we introduced WebSockets gates and
support the servlet 3.1 non-blocking i/o
and rest a restful science and server
for the web a platform and finally
meeting the enterprising man from Java
EE 7 was introduced using a introducing
the batch a application API concurrency
APs and we simplified a lot of the game
s code and others so building Java EE 7
for next generation applications
introduces two new concepts and two new
technologies a WebSockets and JSON web
sockets it is part of the html5
initiative and gaze on is a
representation a notation for audience
that is widely used on JavaScript this
technology has been increasingly popular
so right now it's part of Java EE 7
WebSockets is a new initiative so it has
been incorporated as well the idea
behind this is to reduce the response
time for low latency paradise change
using WebSockets
simplified data parsing for portable
applications with standard JSON support
and we also added for the html5 part a a
synchronous scalable high performance
restful services so what is WebSockets
exactly well socket as I said is
parallel to html5 Initiative they are
used for real-time full duplex
communication you use just one a channel
of communication to compete to exchange
data between the server and your browser
or device it for this servers more
support WebSockets connections and
clients must provide WebSockets support
but socket it's a brand new protocol
allows you to exchange data in real time
from the server to the client at the
from the client to the server so they
both must support them in order to work
the good news is that most modern web
browsers already support WebSockets as
well as many of your devices that you
have already support WebSockets
WebSockets can be used for mostly game
development
notification communication means chat
multimedia streaming and server box
replacing what has been known as a non
polling and comment this is a more
elegant solution to any server pushes in
area that's why you always when told to
use WebSockets if possible
with any further explanation let's go to
the demo I will be showcasing your an
application that was a showcase first in
the general medicine for this edition a
maiden edition so let me show you this
is the application we will be developing
today it's a sticker book application to
have a stickers on your left to have a
canvas to your right and you can try to
see stickers so they tend us and then
they stay there they are drawn whenever
you drop a sticker and what certain
message is sent to the server the server
receives it and it is propagated to all
your browser's so as you can see it's a
collaborative a sticker book if I take
this astronaut over here and I drag it
here you can see that it is render on
the other browser so all that if
communication is made using WebSockets
it messages sent from the browser to the
server is a achieved using a JSON so
instead of sending messages or or
anywhere representation of the objects
you'll just sent a JSON representation
and and yeah that gets propagated okay
so no objects a are sent back to the two
kinds also from the WebSocket so all
that exchange is using gauge before we
dive into this I want to show you two
book useful web pages that you can use
in order to note if you cannot use
WebSockets or not
the first one is WebSocket dot-org and
you can see it here is an echo test
inside they decide where you can
actually test the web browser a
WebSocket capabilities so you can see
here if it works for a more detailed a
chart there's this side can I use come
to its last WebSockets as you can see
the versions of the they all the
browsers that I already or what sockets
and which one doesn't this one key part
if you are going to use WebSockets to
keep in mind that it is
not entirely supported they on all of
the browsers that you're going to target
so you should always mention that you
will require a specific browser version
at least with time this won't be
required I hope since everyone will able
to be supporting what's up and so let's
begin so the first thing you have to do
is up internet means a turn mappings a
IDE so let me both this over here and
then we are going to create any project
I'm going to create a java web
application so I select this for the
calories from Prairie facility where
application then I have to name this
application sticker story it's call it
that way so let's move to next I am
going to target my GlassFish server and
I am going to target a Java EE 7 person
in order to have these options you have
to already configured your GlassFish
server and finally I am NOT going to use
any framework at all in my front end
will be HTML
my back-end will be a WebSocket so I
don't need any
and then I am presented with this simple
web application created using NetBeans
just includes the index.html file and if
you consider there are no Java files
included anything that's kind we have
the goethe cape 1.7 which will be using
the GlassFish server
yes you'll see bulk of URIs on files
since pcs yeah you seven you can see
that us with v6 there's no web.xml file
just a beans to enable a CDI in digital
what there's really nothing else created
so let's begin by creating our web
socket class so the first thing we have
to do is create a new Java class this
class we will be calling it the
WebSocket so it Sam let me see Safari
web sockets call it that way and let's
give it our package that makes sense or
thought sticker but web socket let's
click finish and as you can see I have a
simple class web socket in a 7-hour
simple classes configure using
annotations and it's really simple just
incorporate them in your in your
applications so to create this a to make
a web socket out of this class you have
to just add this server endpoint
annotation endpoint that's why as you
can see I get included my java to a
socket server server inputting the
notation here and these acquires on the
property which is the path that will be
mapped to this server input
so let me copy that here this will be
the path that I will be using and these
are chicken figures this class for being
a WebSocket we have to add that now they
methods that will be handled by this
WebSocket so I know I have a annotations
for that I need to set a to create a
method and annotate it in order to use
to tell the December that is going to be
a WebSocket method so I have lifecycle
methods for this so I have a method
whenever someone connects let's call it
on open whenever someone connects I
receive the session used for it here
I fix many imports notice something
important I need to WebSocket one so the
session from WebSockets I went a metal
whenever I received a message on message
and the message and I want a metal
whenever the user disconnects Stan
decision that just is connected so as I
said you can have any number of methods
but you have to configure them using
annotations right now they described us
and know exactly which one to call on
this a events so I have to tell it use
it annotations annotations I am using
here is an open for whenever someone
connects or massage whenever someone's
and for myself and on close whenever
someone close to the collection so this
is actually the simplest web socket you
will ever see whenever you have a
whenever someone connects a this method
will be called in an open method
whenever someone sends a message this
network will be called a own message and
finally whenever someone close the
connection they on close method will be
called so a right now you see that I
have here they receive a strings as they
pass the message this is a part of the
web socket a purple you can only send
two types of messages in the web sockets
you can even send the strings or send
Boehner binary data jason is a 3d
representation of an object so it makes
sense to have strings here but it will
be far more elegant to receive an object
directly so I make the conversion from
the Jason a somewhere else and here and
handle that opiate directly that object
I wanted to call it a sticker state so I
will receive stickers and I will be
sending a stickers so I receive a
sticker that has been converted and I
will actually handle this message here
and send the stickers back so let's
create our sticker class the sticker
class
a should contain the properties that a
sticker hath so I know that I went I
hate the coordinates where that is
thicker line so whenever someone drops a
sticker on the screen I know where it
has been dropped and I went as well the
actual sticker and has been a trash over
so here I have it the coordinates and
the sticker so let's use the auto
contribution feature of NetBeans to
create the Gators and setters and that's
it a simple class with getters and
setters so right now I am receiving that
a sticker object which has been paired
somewhere else we will we will have to
person later and then I want to send
this sticker of it to all the connected
users as you remember whenever I drag a
sticker for canvas that a sticker is
sent to all the connected users so I
want these sessions to be stored
somewhere so one way to do it really
simple we and if you wait to do it is to
add this either
a collection of sessions in this case a
set where I will store all the sessions
that are connected to this WebSocket I
make it a static because I don't know
the life cycle of this WebSocket object
a the server may reuse it or may create
new instances whenever you circulate so
instead of using CDI or any other
complicated a features I will just
create a simple plain and static final
variable that will be shared among all
the instances of discuss now whenever
someone connects I will do just a
sessions but add session and whenever
someone disconnects I will do a session
but remove sessions not remove session
and this actually goes the trick
whenever someone connects it decided to
these sessions a set
whenever someone disconnects it is
removed from it now we want to send this
a speaker to everyone so we have to
iterate the fashion set so for every
session sessions for sake of not a
confusing bit of anymore I will add here
the open session or connected session
any will do and I will send now they
just occur open session dot get basic
remote not send object then I will send
this ticker rocket fist Rosanna section
I will use they autocomplete to just
surround everything with a try/catch
this looks a little a little overly
complicated so I will use Java 7 syntax
simplify to catch close this way it
looks a little nicer although it's still
not brilliant nice book
works so right now I am sending the
object that I received to all the
connected sessions and this on it will
be and all the connected sessions will
be added whenever they connect and
remove whenever they disconnect yeah I
mentioned that we have to to sterilize
this a sticker of it and you serialize
it somewhere because right now the
application doesn't know that he is
going to receive a sticker of dip that
is going to be a JSON representation so
we have to add that for that we will use
another feature of web sockets which is
called the encoders and decoders
encoders encode the objects into a
string or a binary / binary data
whenever just send the object an a
decoder decodes the binary data or the
text data into your objects that you
receive so for that we have to change
the declaration of our server endpoint a
annotation why because we need to
specify that we are going to use a
decoder and encoder so it changed to
something ladies we've specified into
static link holders and decoders we are
going to use in this web socket so here
I have a speaker encoder and sticker the
color class being padded I don't have
those green haven't created those yet so
I can't this it is a completion error so
that's what I will do right now create
encoders and decoders so let's create
encoder I just right click create a girl
class and create a sticker and colder
and I will create a decoder of where
here sticker decoder so I have both of
right now having both is enough yet
because they have to implement certain
interfaces in order to work so let's
implement those interfaces
the interfaces to come to implement is
the encoder dot texas frame and say that
you're going to use speaker objects port
encoder to have to implement this
interface I've sold my imports and then
I just implement the missing methods
there below so now I have an encoder and
as you can see a well whenever these
refreshes here this error has been has
gone away so I'll do the same here I
will implement or the decoder class
inside the vehicle coders dot text frame
and I will say that it called cystic
URLs so I'm going to import and then I
will implement a love-struck methods now
my errors will be gone perfect
this means that it is configured
correctly but still we need to work on
the encoder and decoder logic for this
we will focus only on the on the JSON
API so let's begin with the encoder
think older will encode a speaker
objects into their string
representations we know that we are
going to send a string because we are
using the Texas string a encoder we were
going to send binary we will use the
binary string like here so we will
remove all the code that has been
created for us because we don't want to
throw anything encoders have any neat
and useful methods that you can use to
configure your encoded in case you'd
need it also to reinitialize resources
and destroy those resources if you also
need it but there is real power of the
speaker encoder a class system code
method
so you receive the speaker and the
writer we're going to write to just
running them make them simpler so I want
to write a speaker of this a using my
JSON API so one way to do it is using
the JSON a a JSON representation of the
of the object to do so I went on yes an
object we created so I have big JSON
object Tuesday apparently the deviation
representation of the speaker so I
create that so the imports and I'm going
to create this JSON object using page
JSON API from Java EE 7 to do so ank's
have to create an object builder the
JSON API in es 7 uses to builder a
pattern a lot so you have to create a
builder from your case on a utility
class you can also use jazel provider
for this and then you have to add the
properties and finally build the object
so let's add a property and yet let me
fix the input because then we have a
property we will add something arbitrary
it's at an action so took a lot
properties to these JSON representation
so let's say that that I add this
property which is actually never betray
property just to show you how to our
issues to just our properties to this
object so I just properly the action
that has been executed mr. speaker and I
say ok by default is just an ass and
it's not some other properties that
actually comes from the sticker of it
over here what if I same first the
coordinates I will send the x-coordinate
speaker
get X and then I will pass why I
coordinate with the speaker got it why
finally you remember we add a we have
also the name of the speaker the actual
image that has been added so I want that
as well I will call that a statistical
property inside of the speaker update
and let's see what's the name get image
of course and finally I want to build
this of it so I built and this item
returns to the integration of you that I
want so you can see right now I don't
have any compilation errors anything
that kind it has been created with his
properties now these days are obviously
gaze on the presentation of what the
speaker is I want to send that as text
using the writer so to do so we have to
create a gate some writer
so that's great I gave some writer which
is which is there now to close the whole
class by the way so you can take
advantage of the Java 7 syntax
it was json dot great writer and i give
it a honor line writer because it works
much the same as any other ru class no
it does two adjacent writer dot right
object a some sticker dad actually does
it it will encode the speaker of it into
a JSON object and then right at you some
of it as a string on the writer that has
been provided by veggies on by the
websocket api of encoders so this way
you solve the problem of sending from
the WebSocket class sending
the Speaker of it now we need the other
part of the puzzle which is receiving
the speaker objects let's create a
decoder for that we have heared the
decoder that I previously created and I
just have to fill in the blanks so you
have to remove this they need useful
metal okay so we can see that here we'll
have to return a speaker so let's create
a sticker of it first thicker ones new
sticker and let's just return this from
the sticker so here I receive the reader
that I have to use to read whatever the
client sent to me in the a in the web
socket so the web socket I'm to receive
text so we have that text inside here so
and I know that that text is a JSON
object so actually I need to decode it
and I will do that using the JSON API ID
so I will now create a gaze on reader
using over Java u7 syntax I can actually
use that it's on reader equals json dot
create reader and you can see that I can
receive their reader from the parameter
and this way I have a nice JSON reader
included here now using this reader I
can read an object so I use JSON reader
but with and you can see here I can read
the object I know this object is the
gaze on the speaker so I will create I
will assign it so okay if some sticker
and now from this is on a sticker object
I can actually with properties and set
them into my sticker of it so they will
those thicker dot set X
and I will get the x-coordinate from the
dais on the sticker off it so I will get
hint and the property went to that is
the x-coordinate I will do the same for
a y-coordinate and finally I want to set
the actual image set image is on a
sticker but it's string then I know the
image is actually named as a speaker in
the given class
this is done on purpose it don't really
show you that your JSON representation
of the object doesn't need to be named
exactly as your properties in your in
your geology they can be ridden at any
time so here in this case I do the
paying Paris operation that I did on the
corner and that's it practically a jewel
created a sticker object that you will
return and you return that sticker of it
to Europe but socket
these aren't you completes your server
side part of this a tutorial we will
focus now on the on the client side
which is a html5 a page that includes
needle of a JavaScript code behind all
the actions that are executing the HTML
page as you can see they integrate a
WebSocket you just have to create a to
appropriate a class annotated using the
server endpoint annotation at your
methods annotate them to making a rare
tool to events on your web socket
your logic and if you are going to
receive something that is not a string
or a binary data you have to add a
decoder and encoders and implement those
in order to receive any kind of data
so let's move on to the to the to the
HTML side of the a of this application
so a if you see the HTML it's just a
plain HTML 5 it doesn't have anything a
special or out of the ordinary
you have a tax HTML tags and that's the
way we're going to keep it we're not
going to add any Java code here just
plain JavaScript and HTML so for this
tutorial we have also a resources folder
that I have outside and that we provide
as well which contains all the all their
resources that we are going to be using
the application a meaning primarily
style sheets here images here here you
can either come to your background
images and all the speakers that you
just saw we're not going to create over
here they're already provided and also
to get a starting your script code that
contains a most of the things that you
need to actually draw the the canvas on
and making bread and drops which is kind
of out of scope here because drag and
drop is more of a JavaScript string and
Nigella thing or WebSocket think so we
are just going to focus on the on the
contents of the HTML file and the
JavaScript that is required to use
WebSockets so firstly we have to give a
little shade to this html5 so first
things first it's this of the his stuff
here which contains the Tyrell and I
will link the resources a story based
JavaScript and they spell CSS so I have
my stylesheet on my
demo script file added here a using
html5 syntax I will create a web page so
I will add a header yeah okay
well Heather pack with some feathers
here I will create a enough a element
which I will be using for navigation I
will be using it for some instructions
so I create my map element the
ever-increasing aside element as well
which will be my sidebar which I know I
have here yeah
to save our with the with the speakers
so I want a sidebar so I just great on a
site element I will put h2 stickers and
then they will just add a div ask my
sticker container so I can actually have
my stickers inside now what's a speaker
you may ask a how did I made them
draggable and all that stuff well it is
not a science as they say it's just a
simple image element if you have to edit
the source so I know the source already
which is the resources folder I know
that they are stickers and then I will
just say be adding so with this if I run
the application that will have just a
plain funny sticker on the left let me
draw it there so she must be not open
here this is what I get
you can see the day of taking a little
shape right now so that's the idea you
see the layer flowing and I will add the
content so the content I know I want a
canvas that I cover your stool so until
you throw something never remove
disabilities later to connect receipt
just the canvas itself and the
background image that I ain't going to
use for the canvas I don't want to draw
this because it's going to be drawn
using theirs
so I just explained on I wanted to
reload it and I went to one sleep slow
that to use it to paint this thing
finally the footer and a debugging this
which is really cool we'll see it in
fashion
so all this code is just a simple folder
element and Deve containing a log
element so if I go back to my if I run
again my application and I see the
results we'll see actually what happens
now I have the sticker I have a the
canvas here and I have this note bottom
which actually opens the lock which I
will be using for debugging purposes but
I cannot write this guy yet
I have to add the JavaScript required
for that that's that is really simple
actually
so to add to add a track of abilities to
your to your page you have to put your
elements you have to add a couple of
properties
the first one is writable you have to
say that is writable the same the second
one is a couple of a events of
JavaScript events so the first one is on
drag start what I'm going to do whenever
the trial starts well it will call the
track a jet right definition on
JavaScript so I would say okay just call
that thing and whenever a and an are
well that's pretty much it actually you
soon allow me to drag the object so
let's go here let's refresh it
and they should be able to try this am
able to track but i am not able to drop
that fracture correct but now I can
drive the T of it but that doesn't mean
I can drop it because there's nowhere to
be drawn where I can drop this object I
got to add some a JavaScript callback
well functions here events on the canvas
so the first event I want on the canvas
since this will be sending a two drops
and the Rovers I want a brought over
event
this tells a crystal say the browser
that this this element may accept a
drops or may not and he custom validate
them and finally be on drop
whenever someone naturally dropped
something on this element we want to
call this function so let's see how it
looks like right now
hey let's run it again and then let's
see how it first you can see that now I
can try I have the a icon that allows me
to drop and then if I drop the we
actually get something in the lock which
means that actually we're going right
there's some kind of action going down
here in in gathering html5 we can also
set a arbitrary data properties to your
to your tags attributes so we can set
data attributes that contains a some
data that we want to get in our
JavaScript code in this case I want to
say hotel the demo script code what what
is the name of the actual
drive a image that I have to file name
just this part over here so I just added
our speaker to it so the team right now
if I run it again you will see that
actually nothing really much change but
if you open the lock you will notice
that now it says that you'll have tried
the speaker Aileen dot PNG why because
we are providing that right now but this
everything is done on the on the
JavaScript side so we have the brass ll
drop and they throw up a functions these
three are the ones that are handing to
Brandon drops
in JavaScript so let's go to that a dell
script file here you will find that we
have implemented already drag to drop
and yellow drop this will actually allow
the prop this was to handle daily logic
behind the drop itself and this will
kind of they take creation of the of the
only task has been tracked you can find
more information on this on on any
JavaScript tutorial both dragon drops
what we really want here is to actually
send this object a to over WebSocket so
right now I prepared it we with this
socket variable here but it is not
initialized ever any word actually if
you look you just search for usages you
won't find it that it is being used
anywhere so let's initialize that socket
so I initialize it in in JavaScript
using they the WebSocket object provided
so then you just copy from here faster
that way so web socket is created you
see the new WebSocket a object and I
have to give it an absolute URL to the
web socket that I am connecting to this
is really important in in JavaScript if
you have to use the absolute URL why
because you change the protocol so
instead of using HTTP do using W us or
WS s or secure socket layer a WebSockets
and then a to say they host the context
pass and then finally they they they
WebSocket but so we have T host the
context path and then WebSocket path so
you have a complete URL the absolute URL
so this creates a WebSocket so now I
know that that will be created let's see
it's refresh here there's not a one this
is the one yes
so as you can see a we have here
deprecation nothing really changed and
if you open your debug tools it
there should be no errors since now it's
connecting but there is no actual
problems or anything it just connected
to this web socket and only if they what
soak it open so it will be open since a
for all the times that I have that
browser open if I close the browser the
WebSocket connection will be closed
so how do I send objects using the web
socket then have to add some code
somewhere right yeah I know
whenever someone dropped something on
the canvas whenever I do this drop the
canvas in bulk stay on drop method so
let's go to that one drop here now
whenever you drop as you can see we
already create a JavaScript object with
everything with the action with the
x-coordinate and y-coordinate the
speaker and we just log it that we are
going to send it but we do not actually
send that so to send it we actually do
the socket not sent we use the socket we
created up here and we call the send
method with a with a string
representation of the object so I used
the same case on a string if I and this
actually sends a piece object using the
web socket just a simple that if i
refresh a track you can see gnarls
and it is being received by the web
socket now
what happens on the other side what
happens if I this is the WebSocket send
something to this client well we have
two other callback using the using table
so come on a event syntax from program
script so I know that there's a among
users a event so whenever there's a long
as a message received I call a function
javascript function so I find that
jurisdiction to be the handler of their
own message event now I have to create
that function so it's very simple it's
created on socket message and I know I
receive an event and then let's just
write the contents of that function so
first things first I know that I
received a speaker series sticker and I
will use JSON thought bars you've been
taught data so whenever I received a
WebSocket message from the server
they've message itself it's inside the
data attribute in my event object so
with this I received the raziel the
sticker gets parsed then I will ask is
cold over here to actually draw it so I
create an image i assigned
non-load a callback function to that
image and finally I assigned a source
from the receiver speaker this might
look a lot of code but is mostly related
to drawing animation your canvas you
have to get the canvas you have to get
the 2d context for that canvas and then
roll the image in a in the ax and y
position received from your received a
speaker JSON object and finally you have
to sign the game image that you want to
load so let's now test the application
it should be working right now
everything let's refresh it back and
forth and see now it's there what
happens is not that I swap it and it
gets wrong it what happens is I drop it
I send the message and then the silver
census message back to me and then I
draw because I do not draw until I know
that my my speaker was received from the
server and I know it has been received
because a I received an unknown list
message so let's see if now it works on
Windows try it here well shouldn't have
dragged it here did you see here I have
it update this actually finishes this
part of the tutorial and demo as you can
see there's a lot of JavaScript code
involved and a lot of a Java code behind
but there's no there's really not much
complication everything is separated you
have decoders encoders they were sucking
out their speaker I'll get that Juergen
sent and the HTML part is still plain
HTML it doesn't have any anywhere Java
code inside here this allows you to
utilize really scalable applications
with us yeah your web sockets are
agnostic but really what they do you
were using
so let's move back to the / Schneider
you can download the Java 87 SDK from
Oracle's of comma slash data ie the
reference a permutation for for glance
creation well for Java EE 7 right now is
glassfish 4.0 for the full platform web
profile development you can find that on
GlassFish or please get involved in the
process of making the future Java Java
EE 7 is an effort a from jewel and for
you it is graded by the community and
the community a symbol is highly
involved in the development process of
this platform it ensures that we have
platform completeness for the
modernization liberation that we focus
on the developer productivity and we
have an openness of current evolution I
do community involvement but insecurity
just go to your local dev a user group
and ask them into when I just do not
care you sir and you can be part of the
process of grading 10x Jemma 8 or
detective and 9 whatever I highly
recommend you to go there and get really
involved in this because you can make
the difference if you see that there's a
feature lacking or that you want
something there you can actually do that
so get involved in this process you can
find other resources about a Java EE
saving on the Oracle Learning Library
site we offer free demonstrations and
tutorials on most of the topics that you
have seen here actually it is a this
demo itself it's part of the of no be an
hour ago by example a material in the
Oracle Learning Library site you can
find it if you search for WebSocket sir
and you will see the entire tutorial
describing old but I've just shown you
here
well from my part I think that's all
either on to you know
thank you and well oh so we're just
about out of time and I would like to
mention that if you're interested in
playing back this webcast or accessing
other free learning content go to the
Oracle Learning Library this concludes
our webcast thank you all for attending
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
