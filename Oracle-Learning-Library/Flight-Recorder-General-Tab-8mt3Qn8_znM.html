going to open up and look at a flight
recording so here I've got I'm going to
start Mission Control and if you do a
recording like a timed recording
typically if you already have if you
start at the Mission Control opening
that automatically but if you've had one
you've got one saved I wanted to show
you where they're saved by default on
windows so I'm going to go ahead and
open that file and I'm going to click on
Oracle that's my yute the user name for
this virtual machine so I'm users Oracle
that's the home directory and you'll see
in that home directory adopt JMC
directory and then the version that
you're using a Mission Control and then
here is the flight recording so I'm
going to go ahead and open that up you
can see it will take a second to load if
there's a lot of data in it especially
so I'm not going to close i'm going to
leave that opens you can see how long it
takes and there we go and here we get
the general tab group I've got my JVM
browser over here still and this event
type tab will actually see that one of
the demos that follows so what we've got
here is now once again this is not
Mission Control this is Mission Control
but this is not the the console so this
is not live data this is data we've
recorded this is a five-minute recording
you can see that here with the interval
and we have various stuff here to look
at we've got a cpus cpu usage graph for
the whole recording there you can see
for the five minutes and i also have a
tab here for heap usage with that shows
the heap usage throughout that recording
so you can see a pretty pretty nice
normal garbage collection pattern there
and then we have some general
information here and since this is a tab
group notice that I have a number of
different tabs here so the JVM
information tab that just shows me some
information about the JVM
again some information about what the
command line parameters are then here I
have the system properties and once
again that's just the properties for the
that JVM once again it's searchable you
can go in here and do a Java star for
example and get just those keys that
begin with Java and then finally we have
the recording tab which tells you what
settings you had for the recordings this
can be pretty valuable if you weren't
sure if somebody else did the reporting
or something like that you can see what
was turned on and what was turned off so
I'm going to go back to the overview tab
and I want to show you one more thing
here before before and this demo and
that's we have a we can change the
interval here that we're showing for our
recording so by default I'm showing
everything but notice I've got little
handles here that I can dry again and
then I can change the amount of time i'm
showing so there I've got down to like a
two-minute interval and then I can drag
this around right so i can see i want to
look at that time frame or that time
frame or whatever so that's pretty cool
and notice here I've got a synchronized
selection you know for the time interval
if I turn that on then when I go to
another tab say the memory tab then
we're going to use the same interval for
that tab so that's very useful and I do
use that a lot so when I look at
recordings so I typically leave that on
and you can um if you double-click this
it'll jump back to its original size
notice here that we have buttons for
zooming in and zooming out so if I click
on this it'll zoom in so I can go down
there since 11 minute 14 seconds and
then I've got this button will do the
same as a double click zoom all the way
out and then this will increase it
predetermined interval and then these
buttons can be used to move forward and
backward just like when I Drive with my
mouth
so there's the time interval and
synchronization for that interval
between the various tab groups so that's
the general tab group for flight
recorder and how to open a flight
recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
