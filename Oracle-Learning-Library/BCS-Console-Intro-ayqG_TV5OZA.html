now it could easily be addressed with
Oracle blockchain cloud service to
increase traceability of vehicle parts
for more efficient recall process a
major automaker recently integrated
blockchain with their ERP software for
dealerships recently became participant
to this network each integrating their
own erp software enabling them to share
information on the blocking let's think
about how we would model this using
Oracle blockchain cloud service the
instance we will run uses segregated
channels hyppolit your fabric concept
with which to ensure only privileged
users or companies gain access to data
as you can see the vehicle manufacturer
has four independent channels - for
dealers manufacture can see the data
from all channels while dealers can see
data within their own channel thus
enabling privacy this is the Oracle
blockchain cloud service console here in
a dashboard you get to see high-level
details about the blockchain network you
have configured in this particular setup
where five organizations connected to
the blockchain network we have founded
as you will see organisations can either
be founders of a new network or
participants in existing networks we
have two independent peers that
separately maintain a copy of a ledger
we have one ordering service that
marshals the ordering of transactions
into the ledger we have five channels
that help us maintain transaction
privacy or petitioning and one install
chain called a smart contract we also
get to see general blockchain health
information here we have a hundred
percent of our nodes operating correctly
transaction execution details and later
summary information on a network tab we
have a network summary at the top where
explains again where we have five
organizations one being a founder and
four been participants the founder being
Detroit Auto who is our auto maker and
we have four participating car
dealerships tab at the top we get a
summary that explains we have five nodes
configured for the vehicle manufacturer
of which two of these nodes are peers
one being an ordering service one being
a certificate
authority and then finally we have
arrest proxy Oracle blockchain cloud
service enables you to interact directly
with the ledger or block your network by
rest now that should make for a very
familiar development experience for
those who know to write directly to
arrest proxy on a channels tab we get to
see that the vehicle manufacturer is
connected to five existing channels if
we take a look directly at John supply
chain channel we get to see the
transactions that are occurring or that
have occurred and the blocks have been
committed for that particular channel we
also get to see chain code that have
been installed on that channel
particularly and finally we get to see
the piers that are connected locally to
that channel on a nodes tab you also get
to see the network topology here we can
find that our two peers are each
connected to separate supply chain
channels of with each of the vehicle
dealerships so we actually have two
piers for redundancy the piers are
responsible for updating Ledger's in
addition to actually signing off on
transaction proposals this is a
dashboard as seen by John's car
dealership a participating organization
in the network founded by the vehicle
manufacturer it is one organization with
two peers one channel shared with the
vehicle manufacturer and one installed
smart contractor chain code as we can
see John's car dealership is a
participant in a network founded by the
vehicle manufacturer John's car
dealership has two nodes or two peers
that are directly connected to John
supply chain which is a channel shared
with the vehicle manufacturer so the erp
software of John's car dealership and
also the vehicle manufacturer are
connected directly by the blockchain and
they're using rest and rest api is to
essentially share information
the channel is created by the vehicle
manufacturer it's called gem supply
chain so only the vehicle manufacturer
and the car dealership Jones car
dealership can see the information on
the ledger if we go back to the
dashboard of the vehicle manufacturer
and we go to the supply chain network
created by the vehicle manufacturer will
see that the ledger information directly
correlates with what Jones car
dealership is seeing so here what we
want to do is actually start executing
some transactions so we're using a curl
command to initiate the restful call
directly to the channel owned by Detroit
autos which is our vehicle manufacturer
so we're creating a vehicle part with a
serial number one two three four and
selling it to Detroit autos as the owner
in addition via the channel that belongs
directly between Detroit autos and
Steve's dealership so we got a
transaction ID and a success so what we
can do is go to rudimentary user
interface has been set up purely to
allow us to curry the transactions so
this this Dashwood allows us to see the
transactions executed and visible to
detroit autos and also stevens
dealership so if we type in a serial
number in the query we find that there's
a transaction belonging to detroit altos
has been created in addition if we prove
that transaction on stevens dealership
we find also the same transaction exists
as they're sharing the same channel okay
so if we then take this too
sounds delicious
this transaction doesn't exist because
Sam does not have access to that same
channel so what we might want to do now
is transfer that asset over to Stephens
dealership so we see that we have access
to Stephen supply chain Sam supply chain
John's supply chain and hewed supply
chain we want to actually send it
through Stephens supply chain we get a
success and also transaction ID
corresponding to that as well if we run
the query again we find we now have two
transactions the initial transaction to
create the asset and the second
transaction that actually transferred
over to Stephens division we can run the
same query again on Stephens dealership
and again we have two transactions one
that creates the asset and secondly one
that transfers it over to Stephens
dealership Sam's dealership and Detroit
auto as a vehicle manufacturer also have
a shared ledger via a private channel
between themselves one of the assets on
that ledger has a serial number ABG one
two three nine I will see this asset
initially was owned by Detroit autos and
then subsequently transferred to Sam's
car dealership we can run exactly the
same query at the Toyotas dashboard and
find that this asset is visible at the
Toyotas so we have an asset from Steve's
dealership from the last query and also
the new asset we just queried from Sam's
dealership if we try to run the same
query at Stephens dealership we find
that that asset is not visible to
Stephens dealership simply because it
doesn't share a ledger between itself
and Sam Steele issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
