of the three weekly lessons about Oracle
Church in this part we continue where we
left off in part 4 in part 4 we
introduced knock out knock out as a free
and open source library that lets you
declaratory define bindings between
business logic expressed in JavaScript
and views expressed in html5 like other
libraries and technologies jet supports
the concepts of components which is the
focus of this part of the course
generically components are a powerful
clean way of organizing your UI code
into self-contained reusable chunks
components provide a development pattern
that is beneficial for large
applications because the simplified
development through clear organization
and encapsulation components help to
improve runtime performance by letting
you incrementally load your application
code together with related templates and
resources as needed in the previous part
you were introduced to knockout
observables by using knockout
observables you enable knock-out to keep
track of changes that you make to
properties such as in this case the name
property any change made to the name
property will result in knockout updates
in all references to that property you
can see that in a previous example we
had three different references to the
name property when the input element was
used to change the name property all the
references to that name property in the
two span elements were updated
automatically by knockout for us in this
part where we introduced oracle jet
components we are going to use an
observable array instead in the previous
part we use an observable in this part
we use an observable array the
observable array keeps track of a set of
data that you can see presented here
that data is hard-coded inside of our
module in this case but could come from
some rest endpoint or some WebSockets or
any external data source
are we going to use this observable
array together with an Oracle jet
component when we were talking about the
view in the previous part we make use of
a construct called a data bind this data
bind is an HTML attribute and it comes
from knockout via the data bind
attributes were able to connect the name
property defined in our view model to a
reference to it inside of our view and
you can see that we were using data bind
in three different places to ensure that
three different done elements were
connected to that same name property
Oracle jet provides an extensive
component library based on this same
syntax here for example we see a chart
and here we see another chart both
charts make use of that same observable
that we have defined in our view model
here we see the observable array named
datasource
and we can see that same observable
array being used in two different places
again we see the data bind attribute and
what you should see here is that the
data bind is set to a J component
instead of as in a previous example to
text input or to text text is an
attribute of the span element text input
is a special attribute that knockout
provides and a J component is a special
attribute that Oracle Jet provides on
these elements so we have a dead element
we have a data bind attribute and we are
saying that we are binding the LJ chart
component so this is one of the Oracle
yet components to the LJ component
attribute that Oracle jet provides for
div elements each Oracle jet component
comes with a set of properties and
events and here you see the simplest
possible implementation of the
properties of an Oracle
a chart LJ chart has the property type
and series in the first case we set type
to bar in the second case we set type to
PI and in both cases the data that will
be displayed in the chart is that same
observable array that is defined in the
incidence J s file so in the view model
of this Oracle jet module when we look
in the browser we will see two different
charts displaying the same data but in
different ways one is a bar chart and
one as a pie chart here we are in the
browser we see the bar chart and we see
the pie chart an important detail
enabling all of this to work is that we
see a reference to a Jade chart in the
define block of this view model in
addition to the default references Oh
Jake or knockout and jQuery we now also
have LJ chart by loading a Jade chart in
this way in the define block we ensure
that the chart is loaded enabling this
reference to succeed in summary the
three steps you need to take whenever
you make use of an oracle jet component
is to load the relevant component in the
define block of the module where you
want to use that component secondly in
the view model of your oracle jet module
make sure to reference all the data and
other properties and events that you
want to reference inside of the oracle
jet component declaration in your view
step 1 reference the component you want
to use step to provide your data in your
properties in javascript in the view
model and step 3 declare your Oracle
Jet's component and refer to the
properties events and data that you have
set up in your view model a final point
to make on this topic is that in the
latest releases of Oracle yet a new
syntax has been introduced here
can see the new syntax for declaring an
Oracle yet charts notice that it is much
simpler and more concise than the data
bind oriented knockout mechanism for
declaring Oracle Jeff charts notice also
that here we're not using a div element
anymore
instead we're using the custom element
LJ charts for each oracle Jett component
a custom element exists enabling you to
declare Oracle Jett components in a
concise and natural HTML manner please
be aware that there you may come across
the outer data bind based syntax for jet
components in older applications that
make use of jet this approach should be
avoided in fact it will be deprecated
and removed over time and you should use
only the custom elements syntax which is
also used throughout the documentation
and related materials provided by Oracle
jet in this part you have been
introduced to components and how they
are expressed in jet and as always we
thank you for taking part in the course
on jet and look forward to having you
again in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
