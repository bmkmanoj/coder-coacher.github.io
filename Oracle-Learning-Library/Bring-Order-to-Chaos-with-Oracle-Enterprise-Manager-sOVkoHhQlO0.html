administrator can efficiently manage the
dynamic environment in an enterprise
cloud using enterprise manager 12c here
we see the enterprise manager has
automatically compiled information about
the software inventory running in my
cloud I can see all the different
operating systems and where they are
deployed I can also see target
properties which are essentially cmdb
properties telling you whether the
environment is in test or in production
I can see ownership information such as
the line of business the department and
similar i can get similar kinds of
information for any layer in my stack so
for example here I can see it for
database I could also do multi
dimensional analysis on my database for
example looking by version or by line of
business if I go to the alt target page
I can see that enterprise manager has
automatically discovered every entity
running inside my enterprise I can see
applications I can see databases I can
see middleware and if I wanted to drill
down and just look at the database I
could do that here we can see additional
dimension so for example if I wanted to
see only 11 20 two databases I could see
that as well we then model this
information into what we call a system
so if I clear this all away and drill
into a database system and I'll pick one
and look at the topology you can see
that what we are looking at here is a
disaster recovery setup I have a primary
database which is running on rack and I
have a logical standby which is being
managed for replication and I have a
physical standby which is also rack all
of these are automatically discovered
now I'm going to drill farther into the
primary I can see additional
associations like which ASM instance it
is talking to to which Oracle home it
belongs and which listener it is talking
to so thanks to all the discovery
aggregation and modeling Enterprise
Manager is done all of this information
is on my fingertip now the next
challenge for me is to ensure that
everything that is provisioned in my
cloud is automatically monitored
typically I would go and assign a
monitoring template to our target but
clearly in a dynamic environment where
I'm not the one who is provisioning
those targets this is not a viable
approach to address that Enterprise
Manager 12c has a new functionality
called administration groups
administration groups allow me to define
rules for dynamic grouping of targets
and associate monitoring templates with
those groups as a result when new
targets are provisioned they'll
automatically join the group inherit the
monitoring templates and I won't have to
worry about a thing we're going to go
ahead and define an administrative group
hierarchy the first thing I care about
is the life cycle stage of targets
because production targets need to be
managed differently than test and
development targets
enterprise manager gives me a very
granular view of the life cycle status
however I'm going to merge development
staging and test into a single group I'm
also going to merge mission-critical and
production into a single group next I
want to add line of business to my
hierarchy this second level of hierarchy
will allow me to monitor targets
belonging to different lines of business
differently I could continue building
this hierarchy but for now I'm happy
with it so I'm going to click create the
next step is to associate monitoring
templates with these as you can see this
is a set of templates belonging to
different target types we also have a
set of compliance policies and standards
now I'm going to go ahead and associate
the templates beginning with my
development administration group there
it is and now I'm going to do the same
for production children will
automatically inherent settings from the
parent group however I have the ability
to go in and override some of those
settings flow for example my finance
users may be more sensitive to
performance issues and i want to set
more aggressive thresholds for them
to do that I'll assign an overriding
monitoring template now my environment
is fully set up and I don't need to do
any ongoing maintenance as new targets
are provisioned they will automatically
be monitored now I want to look at the
overall health of my enterprise and
cloud I'm going to look at the new
incident console page introduced an
enterprise manager 12c here i see a
unified view of everything that is
happening in my enterprise and i can see
all sorts of health issues one that has
caught my attention is that we have a
compliance score below eighty-seven
percent I'm sure a lot of people will
empathize with this issue here I can see
all the general information about this
incident I can manage the lifecycle of
this incident I can even look at the
knowledge articles published on my
Oracle support in case I don't know what
to do in this case we can see in the
guided resolution that enterprise
manager has suggested that we view the
compliance results and the compliance
results have detected that there are
critical patches missing to remedy that
I simply launch enterprise managers
patch automation wizard and this will
help me remedy the problem we just saw
how enterprise manager provides unified
visibility across the entire cloud how
it automatically detects problems and
how it helps fix problems thank you for
