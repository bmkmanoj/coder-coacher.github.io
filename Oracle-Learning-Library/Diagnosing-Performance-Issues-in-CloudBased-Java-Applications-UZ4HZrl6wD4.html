pretty much most of the time it is very
cloudy but this year it is very sunny
because the cloud is inside moscow nina
sky inside hilton because all the
vendors have taken the clouds and put
inside the conference's so it's sunny so
you guys prolly enjoying this one here
in san francisco so i'll try to make it
a little lighter because stores the end
of the day and and it's a buff not a
formal presentation so how many of you
guys are using cloud like cloud-based
applications like have you guys I see
phew so are you deploying this in your
private cloud or really in a public
cloud environment public-private okay so
does anyone need any introduction to
cloud beside it rains okay so I'm not
going to spend a lot of time on just
introducing cloud because everybody a
probably knows cloud by now because
there is a lot of hype going on around
around everyone and I'm looking for the
cloud that rains money like every would
like all of you guys so as you know like
three flavors of the cloud or avatars
you can say the infrastructure of the
service platform as a service and and
the software isn't service so most of
the developers eight if you are not
developing SAS then you hate sauce
because most of the developers think
this sauce is going to take away your
job but all the developers pretty much
love I am infrastructure of a service
because they dip they always think that
they want it somewhere a VMware if they
can play around and learn about new
product and technology so how did he we
came into this pretty much about 30
years back we were in mainframe
technology I haven't seen that age
probably some of you guys have played
around with mainframe
and mainframe had a lot of concept of a
virtualization and all these things
which were borrowed and and then they
came to the mini terminal mini mini
computer and the dumb terminal and
that's the time I I started my journey
with computers like that then you're
doing tell netting from your PC and most
of the time the Dom termina didn't work
the keyboard or like you get this green
screen if you remember the deck 200 or
VT 220 terminals and then we came to the
client-server architecture where you
have started building application with
oracle forms visual basic and all this
and we had in the middle the database
and and then we came to the multi-tier
and so application where so i came to
solve the world hunger and haven't
solved it yet but the grand promise with
having solving all the while longer from
that list the enterprise wall and then
now we are in the cloud computing where
the buzzword is like everybody loves
cloud computing because it is going to
reduce costs for most of the
organizations and and give a lot of
flexibility in deploying application so
why why do you why performance to the
cloud-based application is critical so
you see many failure in different places
different cloud vendors or your your own
application so most of the cloud-based
applications really affect your end user
that's what either your money come from
and now people are moving to private
cloud where you're you affect your
internal users but when you really talk
about cloud the public cloud you deploy
your application to the end user and if
it fails or has some performance issues
then you really impact your end user and
some some of your computer competitor is
taking away that customer from you so
what are the differences left
to install just this is the meat we have
that that most of the people think that
cloud-based applications are always
deployed in the cloud or in the internet
but as you some of the guys have
deployed right deploying the your
cloud-based application in your private
cloud and another thing like your custom
applications are always customer facing
external customer facing but many of the
customers many of the people have
started deploying their applications
which have internal bound application
which is and the no one to invest on lot
of on hardware and like for example some
people who have started deploying bug
tracking system in the cloud instead of
spending a lot of hardware in there and
it's the internal application for the
developers and then and in all this type
of big data like if you go everybody
talks about Big Data Hadoop and all but
not all applications are are are that
require all this technology and not all
applications are suitable for cloud if
you remember like about 10 12 years back
when the Java EE came in everybody
thought this is this going to solve the
world hunger and ejb is going to solve
all the problem everybody started
building their applications using ejb
and remoting and all this thing although
and most of the developers loved it
because they wanted to riorca tech their
applications to suit whatever they are
learning on so they do not care about
like as a developer we do not care about
what the business needs are most of the
time we care about how this application
is going to be guru are good architect
Adam and on the modern architecture and
all so you have to think about it it's
like re architecting all the
supplications and deploying the clock
cloud is not going to solve all the
problems so think about your application
whether it makes sense for your cloud
and then it go on
let me see ok back ok now it's a little
rig yeah so you know when you have your
applications in the cloud and the
internet fails you're you're just doing
nothing ok so so it's like that so
slight flick flick is going to create a
lot of problem or to your customer state
so then a lot of it's great for startups
because they do not have to have any
kind of initial investment so if you
look at the dot-com boom most of the
curve like son was making a lot of money
because they're trying to sell a lot of
hardware and to the startup because all
solar rays was very polo we are the
dotnet in your net.com your dot in your
dot com you might remember that but
these days if you are starting a
start-up you do not buy any hardware you
build your application in a cloud
environment like Amazon ec2 or Telemark
whatever you think is appropriate and
then lot of enterprises are trying out
small customer-facing applications and
and many of the enterprises are trying
cloud primarily for their testing
environment like for example if you have
applications and you do not have
appropriate hardware you just reserve
some 50 VMs in ec2 and test out your
applications that's what most of the
larger size of enterprises are using and
and then out of this infrastructure
service and the platform a service
infrastructure services is quite popular
and the Java paths are still emerging
and the private cloud is getting lot of
popularity with the large enterprises
where they have lot of different
hardware by different by different
departments and then they're trying to
consolidate together and making a poo
out of that and I'm kind of providing a
private cloud infrastructure to them and
what they are do is instead of putting
in a large like HP superdome machine
they're using a lot of small small VMs
and leveraging that even for third-party
applications or three tier applications
so this is the enterprise of all head up
and like
well if you have an application and if
it does involve the support guy will say
someone will fix it the developer sir is
it's a problem in the DV other DBAs the
DBS are in moscone so you can we can
give as much hard thing for them ok and
then these deviations no it's just a
problem your application you guys don't
right know how to write sequel and you
are not using the right word clause and
all this kind of thing problem happens
but when we go to cloud the problem is
could be in the in the network itself it
could be problem if you are using
content delivery network it could be in
the content delivery network it could be
in in Amazon or wherever the
infrastructure where our service you are
using that could be there so who will
win Blin if you do not have proper
monitoring and diagnosing products in
and in place so the challenge is for
most of the cloud-based applications are
in the highly distributed systems
because you are trying to use a lot of
services like resemble if you are
building a completely new application so
you like to think about your building an
application in a mature man and you want
to go to use everything on Amazon so you
want to go use the relational database
service for storing your data you're
storing large object you are going to
use the s3 service and if you are going
to use / you're sending in lot up into
the cloud vendors they do not have even
ability to send emails to use a email
service provider like imagine for
example a simple email service so you
use a lot of service if you are it's a
real real application and say there is a
lot of tears there and you have no
control over hardware there could be
never a problem it could be in not
properly tuned application tier and you
have no visibility and which users are
getting impacted what kind of error they
are running into where the problem is so
what kind of problems you may see if it
is a real application problem there
could be a Java memory leak issues
bed coding in finite loop does it sound
ring now there is ringing your brain
sometimes you use that we do not do
proper exception handling sequel query
could be a big problem because most of
the time or were you see is that
application slows down because you do
not have rights equal or missing indexes
you're doing a full table scan on that
kind of problem it could be deadlock
could be improperly tuned application
server Oh even if there is a nope there
is no problem in the application there
is no problem the database but many of
the application slows down because the
database connection pool is not tuned
properly in the application server level
so or there is a connectivity issue
between the from the App mid-tier to the
to the data based here if you are using
those in your other in a drop and this
is a problem both for the enterprise
applications as well as for cloud
applications so like if you if it is a
really cloud-based application and your
users are end users so what do you care
about is that whether your vm is slowing
down or or if that does not matter what
it cares about is whether your users are
impacted or not if you have for example
let's say the set the right elasticity
policy in your replication and and if
one slows down and or or you see these
application is slowing down and any fork
and another vm that is doing down but
how do you see which users are impacted
and what is the real problem is because
you may be spinning spinning or spawning
more more booby ends but still you may
have the problem so we have to find out
which function or which transaction are
filling up because it's maybe login
function basically what about trying
somebody is trying to log into your
application that means be slowing down
and why it is slowing down where the
problem is and or else if you have if
you are using a lot of objects and if
you are using a CD
n lie like Akamai and is the Akamai
where the problem might be the content
delivery network or it could be your
line of the code so how do you diagnose
this problem where it is so this is
there are some of the symptoms for
applications like for example it's like
it's maybe slowing down very slowly it's
like over time or under load it could be
a memory leak but it even could be like
for example initially like I was working
with an insurance company a couple of
years back that they did their
application for the first six months
it's worked great and slowly slowing
down and Anna and I finally figured out
and then then from from five seconds it
started taking two minutes for some of
the lake insurance rating function and
it was primarily full table scans going
on the table and they were using for
example hibernate and and then and
there's basically the developer had no
idea about what sequel are being
executed underneath and and there was no
index on that specific table because
they had not worked with the dbas and
finally we figured out okay it is
nothing is happening in the mid tier
database is tuned properly what is it
what is the problem so we look to add
the sequel statement and there were some
of the zipcode statement they had some
million rows and they're still doing
doing proper ample food tables cancer so
there are several symptoms about I do
not have to go through one by one I this
slides are going to be available for you
guys to look at it but they are there
some of the symptoms for for the
application problems but how do you
diagnose this there are several
approaches we use either the log files
other you look at the monitoring metrics
for your application server or you try
to read on that physically so try to
take that and read on in your test
environment see like some user will
complain for example my insurance rating
is is taking is slow but you try to read
on
that in test environment is not what
happened because you'll not have that
much data or in your in your environment
so I think this little bit slow a little
bit and then there are several
application performance management tool
that he can use to diagnose the problem
wanna do so there are challenges in each
approach so let's talk about the
challenges so they're like variable if
you're logging if you do a lot of
logging in your application it is going
to slow down your application because
you know apache commons or even the jdk
logging or take a lot of resources so it
cannot do a lot of logging and if you
are a kind of a multi-tier applications
like even the couple of tears or and
when the problem is happening it's very
difficult to to diagnose the problem
because correlating the log is not that
easy so there are like tools like splunk
as a as a protocol storm for example
that is helping to people do log
analysis of correlation the cloud
environment similarly lay for example if
you are using a pass platform for ample
like and then you are trying to
correlate your log it's not that easy
because the logs are owned by them so
there are an electronic like paper trail
they help you analyze the log management
in a production environment but this is
this primarily for historical analysis
it's not you cannot do this in a
real-time environment it's not that easy
and as I said it is very difficult to
reproduce the exact scenario in a in a
test environment because when you have
this that you probably have lost the
actual context so when you use the
application performance management tool
there are two approaches are the server
centric approach or the use your
transaction based approach for resolving
or finding the problem the service and
Rick approaches
been there for four long long time were
you used basically you monitor your
application server you're the different
resources usage like jdbc connection
pool JMS connection pool thread pool and
all this kind of thing and and you get
proactively not've notification of this
but the problem in this approach is most
of these tools whatever built for young
people think about oracle enterprise
manager or see a wily all these products
whenever they're built they would build
some 10 years or 15 years back so
virtualization didn't exist them so
these tools do not work that well in a
virtualized environment and and if you
have because those tools were primarily
for ample if you look at the
instrumentation the tools also use they
were pretty dated like 10 years back to
so there is a lot of overhead under your
applications if you are trying to do the
real code analysis what are the tools
which have been privileged and you may
be using that in your environment at
this moment but even you move to
virtualization you have to do a lot of
work and if you are trying to do in a
cloud environment it may not work I
don't but the tools you can use the
server centric tool for example made
available by the cloud vendors if you
are using a pass like so the pass
vendors they allow do provide this kind
of monitoring metrics like for example
cloudbees this is a example from cloud
wees where they provide the resource
metrics resources our number of requests
what is the memory and sessions but this
is what are the limited metrics they
provide and it's not easy that easy to
diagnose arm just looking at this
metrics this is another example example
of server centric monitoring from an
endpoint correlation
so then and there gives me basically
tools for end user transaction driven
diagnostic so where you can diagnose
from an end-user perspective because
that's what you care about because when
when you are deploying your applications
in the cloud you want to be proactive
before the users complain you that there
is I'm not getting the performance or my
transactions is failing you probably
want to know which you just are impacted
what kind of problem they are having and
how do you diagnose your problem so
there are tools in the modern the modern
tools which can help you diagnose from
an end user experience point of view and
then help you drill down from end user
for example a user has a failed
transaction and then whenever that
filled he probably got in the 404 from
his perspective but it generated an
exceptions in the back end let's say it
called called out of memory exceptions
or maybe a jdbc exception in the back
end so how do you tie this two together
there are tools which help you do this
and that's what I'm going to discuss
next so how there are end user
experience management tools which
proactively monitor your end user
performance it could be based on other
passive Network tapping in your cloud or
could be like some of the tools use
JavaScript injection into into the
application and tell Jake basically
gather in more information about the
applications and and then then they have
backed and tools that the agent runs
inside the application server and the
agent are built for the modern age
applications and then they use like kind
of something called phone home
capability so what phone home is like
instead of you telling in instead of
going to Oracle Enterprise Manager for
example or Wiley and telling okay this
is where my weblogic server is and the
hostname port number and the user ID and
password and you give them
and then then you discover the different
instances for example in weblogic over
sphere or whatever so these tools for
the way it works is you set the agent as
the as a parameter in the application
server and you start your and you tell
that tool and okay this is where my
monitoring product is like where those
name port number are just do that and as
soon as you start the application server
that will the agent will wake up and
contact the controller or the
application server problem that the the
monitoring product and tell ok I am
awake and this is I am and the the
product will automatically discover the
application server it will automatically
discover the different transactions
flowing through the applications and
start monitoring the transactions and
and and these tools can be deployed
either in the cloud or on-premise and
and many of the past vendors also
support these tools so like I wanted to
just so like this is like for example
these tools example from our our product
here so where you can tell ok where the
users are coming from like this is most
of the user sergeant from North America
in here and and if you look at here you
see the red dots were basically what the
user is having problem what the users
are having problem and then you can
drill down to specific users and until
which user has impacted where the
problem is and then bring down to the
code code level and we are the tools
which continuously monitor your real
user so these are real loser transaction
not synthetic user like a robotic
invoker transactions it is the tools
monitor real users and and proactively
collect deep diagnostic data like for
example the way it works is they do
bytecode instrumentation but here they
do not require the modern tools they do
not require you to instrument by
yourself they automatically detect with
different classes
though she has implemented g two
interfaces and only instrument those and
instead of it doesn't require any kind
of developer a intervention for
detecting the framework or detecting the
classes and an automatically start
monitoring the transactions and then
collect data about that and and whenever
there is a problem you get the capture
the Diagnostics instances and they
correlate the end user from the end user
to the back end and then tell you ok
where where the problem is so like
forever I'll quickly do some demo
towards an but the benefits of these
tools are there is like you understand
the impact of users and they do not have
any kind of node or configuration
changes in your application these tools
work out of a box and then and some of
the examples are like for example a BMC
my Prada replica I have to put a
marketing blog because I am here BMC
application Diagnostics New Relic
applicant f dynamics of the new tools
and and then these tools they have
pretty much support for either Java
or.net if you're using Jordan and after
our new relic has support for example
even Ruby on Rails and other technology
and they work on on the cloud
environment and and then these tools
programmable he'll help you monitor from
from from an end user to to the back end
but this these two cells all have also
limitations like you they will
automatically detect the transaction but
there is some performance penalty like
one to two percent of performance
penalty on the application and if you
want more data then you have to do more
instrumentation out of the box or
whatever you have they have that should
suffice your requirement but if you want
more data by people's like for example I
have been working with some of the
developers some of the organizations you
say okay want to see the parameters we
want to see more two more level of
of classes and how much time is the more
and more instrumentation you add your
more slow your application is going to
become so you have to be careful when
using this kind of tools too so let me
do a quick demo of the Houthis tools
work so this is a demo of my product but
pretty much most of the product work in
similar way maybe change in here and
there hopefully i still have my sessions
here so like for example here I want to
show you this this is our application
performance management console where are
you seeing nope
magic okay so this is the or application
performance management console where we
have dashboard for ample forum we give
you the view from end-user perspective
where the problems are can look at more
details for for for specific state or
like you can customize this this
primarily you works great whenever you
have global users but you can customize
this to 4am public state or whatever you
want to do but when we want to like
monitor a specific transactions for
example here I have transactions for my
store that's running in our cloud demo
cloud I want to diagnose those so I can
click on here and and drill down to the
sessions the user sessions which are
having problems and and then and in in
this this will tell me okay the other
different users which are having
sessions prob in the in my system right
now and they are having some problem in
let's let me drill down to this specific
user you see that this user tried to log
in the search and search add to cart and
all this different and then most of the
time this application is slowing down in
the application tier like here this is
basically the problem which tier has it
how much time is spent in each of the
tier like the direction or host or
network or or SSL so most of the time is
spent in the host here or in the in the
application so if I want for example see
why this login or or search is slowing
down i click in there and that will me
take you back to the diagnostics for the
code level diagnostics for this
application and then help me diagnose
this problem so here like for example I
found several other traces of the
problem at the same time so I want to
create click and look at the specific
transactions and see where the problem
is so like as I said basically
automatically all these tools diagnose
whether they do what kind of tea or it
is like where business law
you can so is most of the time is being
spent in the web tier and it kind of
provides baseline comparing with like
hourly weekly daily basis so you can
find out what the problem is and when
this problem happened the CPU did it go
let me click one more time okay so if
you look at here the CPU was possibly
was a culprit there it was taking
seventy-six percent of the time and and
if you want to look at like how this
application fluid through so it came
from an i eat went to this jetty server
and then it makes them request to the
Apache Derby database it has a JMS or
based on activemq send some it made a
remote component called yr mi and if you
want to look at the actual application
code you can you can look at the
application code and and and then drill
down and find out where the problem is
like when ample you can look at the
sequel statement and all the different
thing whatever you want to do like for
example it is trying to delete some but
this is the way you can drill down from
an end user point of view to to the back
end and it's these tools are a bit for
the cloud or if you can want to use in a
enterprise environment that works too
good and good too but the primary thing
is that these tools are built to
diagnose from end-user fun of you to the
back end sorry sorry sorry sorry
I mean I expect to hear when you tell me
how you gravitate the test points where
you collect the data how you can a can
for the deltas in degradation because of
your performance too I mean your
performance too is a software to leave a
big cost how much is that cause I want
to know yeah it depends upon basically
what are you it's obviously I'm not
selling my tool here so there are
several tools here there are several
tools yeah but the reason we trying to
be cautious well as an architect yeah I
became a test for easing tools is
because they themselves through dynamic
system yeah so that's all that's what
yeah that's it the access database yeah
me what's the purpose is helping you
identify the problem here is a database
sequel statement for example if the data
we are sorry sorry yeah yeah so these
tools for example have have some kind of
you can say thermostat so if you want to
set okay I do my like for example if you
want my tool do not should not have more
than lecture two or three or four
percent of the performance overhead then
they will start basically not collecting
a lot of data so if you see like the if
there is a lot of problem let's say
there are thousands of requests are
slowing down these tools are built in
such a way that they do sampling so they
do not capture all the requests so if
the overeating is slowing down if you
capture for example if the only a sample
that is going to help you solve the
problem
decorating the system to the point where
yeah do it so what I'm saying is a
variable there is a self governor in the
stools in the most of the new generation
tools have a self governor okay so if
they see they have basically something
called automatic baselining okay and
based on that they decide to collect
more or less so if they see there is a
lot of transactions are slowing down so
and then if let's say you set this
sampling frequency as less a hundred
percent it is till you have that it is
not going to collect all the data is
going to throw out all the data because
it will see that transaction is already
slowing down and most of the
transactions are already slow so it not
capture all the data will kept sample
out so this thing yes it's basically so
it
yeah yeah so that's what I'm trying to
see you if you have like programmable
things are slowing down then all the
next for example if all the thousand
like if you have thousands request for a
second okay if all the thousand requests
are slowing down it is it do not capture
all the thousand requests it is going to
sample out probably 990 request out of
that because if you determine okay this
is this all the requests are slowing
down so if i am going to collect more
data i am going to put more load on this
applications itself so i'm going to
sample out most of the data so these
tools have have been built in such a way
that is not going to put a lot of
overhead and then if you want only one
portion of the data to be collected you
can do that too but it's based on its
it's like these tools are built in such
a way that they do not put a lot of
overhead out of the box
really solving
solve a typical
yeah yeah so that's what it is like for
example these tools do not instrument
all the classes if you instrument all
the classes then then it is going to
slow down so this new generation of the
tools what they do is they instrument
dynamically so look at so instead of
like for example instrumenting your
custom classes they will instrument only
the j two interfaces the classes we have
been doing basically implemented j two
interfaces in that way like it will be
only one person or two percent of your
class the actual application which is
going to be instrumented and whenever
that is slow down they may instrument
more or are based on what about the
policy you have given so that's the only
way to maintain the overhead on the
application yeah yeah
more less the same kind of
it's kind of the same methodology but
like we have some patented technology
how to do is a smart move so that we do
not overload the applications
yeah we do basically so we would smart
way we cannot filter out most of the
classes like what is whatever things to
instrument the example that's what the
new relic or for example or dynamics
like do they do is a variable F dynamics
is monitoring some 1,500 application
servers in in netflix and their
production environment and and they do
not slow down any of this so the way
these tools have been build is that it
do not put a lot of overhead so they
have self put some cell governor there
but if there is always you can do
overkill your system by changing their
out of the board default policies and
federal instrument more figure Yahoo
Yahoo
we have the technology also but what you
do not get to the classes you do not
have you do not have the classes cannot
get all the class information by using
network sniffing yeah the 80 at the end
users experience product for example
whatever I have is completely based on
the network sniffing it doesn't use
judges bytecode instrumentation so from
the yeah not in here yeah yeah but if
you want to really the code level data
what are the parameters is being sent
and everything then then you need to do
instrumentation but if you want just
look at like what about this JSP
spending how much time how much time you
spend in network versus you can get
those kind of data by passive traffic
yeah then yeah but then you have to do
that again manually so that is there so
you you have to deter mined fast and
then do manually and whenever you do
that this could be a one-off problem or
like maybe happening intermittently how
do you do that without doing real bite
area code instrumentation what kind of
cables running they're slowing time yeah
you can you can do that from from the
network perspective a my point is per
example you can do that from from net
worth snipping but you want to look at
for your bull okay which this java class
n n n n n n and this this was the
parameters send for this java class you
cannot get those kind of data from
network sniffing and that's what
whenever I had as yes yeah yeah sure
sure sure
yeah so like for example there are
transaction pressing tools like we are
also transaction tracing tubes so I'm
not going to sell in the product here so
yeah there are transaction tracing tool
that can help you diagnose preamble okay
with the load balance so how much time
is spending the load balancer which load
balancer did we use and then like for
example if you are using apache or the
web server and you can link that cold
transactions where it worth the spend
even like remember our tool can help you
go up to the mainframe if you are using
main frame or mq series or CICS there on
there are tools there so yeah so this
some of the some of the time they do
injections like for example either at
the sum of the products of injection at
the at the operating system level and
some of the true like for example do
HTTP header level for example and then
flow through the transactions per
example our product does HTTP injections
and flow through and if you are using a
poor example gmas at the background then
it will be a payload putting a payload
in the GMs header so it's based on
whatever the it is a combination of
technology what you whenever using what
technology are using
yeah so all these tools have their lip
area by their own diagnostic server they
have a own database where all this gets
aggregated and that's out there this so
because every transaction will have this
unique transaction ID elect them and
then they will stitch all this together
and let which applications are what is
spend and and then like forever these
tools like they do not like and like
variable if you do not need it in the
agent in the database to see you how
much sequel I'm spent because they do on
an exit point like for example they
whenever the JDBC is being called look
at the exit point and see how much time
is spent 44 for the s equal to respond
and based on that I can tell ok this is
the sequel statement that is causing
most of the time but if you want to do
further analysis for example why this
sequel is slow then then you have to use
some technology Previn expand plant for
for ample that's equal to find out what
the problem is ok so summary is is the
cloud-based application or more complex
and there are several ways to diagnose
but each and every approach has issues
and you can use traditional tools or
loss monitoring but that can consume a
lot of time in diagnosing issues or you
can use a end user base transaction tool
to identify the bottlenecks in the
application the end user piece could be
from from a passive Network capturing
perspective but if you want to read
visibility into the real application
then that that uses an agent based
technology that uses byte code injection
to identify what the problem is thank
you very much if you have any questions
then shoot me an email or I'll make this
presentation available and in like the
content builder and it can be able to
download all there thank you very much
and have a great time in Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
