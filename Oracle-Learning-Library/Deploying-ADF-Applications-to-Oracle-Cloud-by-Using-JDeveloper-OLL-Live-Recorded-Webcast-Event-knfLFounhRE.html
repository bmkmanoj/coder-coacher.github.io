here are the answers to the puzzle but
if you you did quite quite well with the
poll well today we're going to do the
first of an Oracle Learning Library Oh L
L live presentation my name is Tom again
and I'll be presenting this webinar to
familiarize you with the capabilities
and features of using Oracle cloud with
JDeveloper so first of all the standard
disclaimer notice here this doesn't say
much more than this webinar does not
commit Oracle to what I'm demonstrating
or presenting today to get the most out
of this webinar I am assuming that you
have some experience with Oracle
JDeveloper and ADF these are Oracle
technologies and that ideally you have
some experience as well with Java
Enterprise Edition development if you
don't have experience with either of
these two technologies don't worry
really what this webinar is about is to
give you some idea how to use JDeveloper
with local cloud now I'm going to use a
lot of Oracle tools in this presentation
including JDeveloper 11g Oracle Express
11g release that's a database and I have
an account on Oracle cloud which is
provisioned with two services Oracle
database cloud service and Oracle Java
cloud service so by the way all of the
software that I'm using today is free
for use under a developer license which
means that either developer you can
download and use these Oracle products
for free so let's talk a little bit
about Oracle cloud this is the offering
that I'm going to be working with today
is Oracle's public cloud offering and
the Oracle cloud is a platform
as-a-service paas system which means
that it provides specific application
platform services including database
platforms application server platforms
continuous integration tools storage and
messaging service services to name a few
in this tutorial we're going to focus on
two of these platform services a
database platform service and Java
service these services provide
capability to support database
applications ATF applications rests and
other types of web services as well as
general Java EE applications and with
these two services you can create any
number of applications that can be
deployed to web web servers to web
application deploy as web applications
can be deployed applications consumed by
other cloud applications like mobile
devices and so forth Oracle Java cloud
service to the instance of WebLogic
server 11g and their port is capable of
running applications that use a variety
of Java EE technologies so enterprise
javabeans JavaServer faces Java server
pages web services both both jax-ws and
restful Web Services checks RS and Java
cloud service comes with automatically a
database cloud service and using
standard technology such as Java
persistence API or JDBC you can
communicate with
that database instance because it's a
fully functioning WebLogic server 11g
instance you can also take advantage of
ADF so idiot faces have business
components and web services the
application that I'm going to be demoing
today is a typical ADF application in
fact I built this application using one
of the tutorials available through Olo
through the online learning library
Oracle Learning Library this is a
typical application that uses the sample
HR database that comes with every
instance of Oracle database and it's
simply providing a view into that HR
system through the department's so each
department has a number of employees
those employees will be viewed in a
tabular the table on the top will be
able to edit the employees down here and
then push the results you know back to
the database so to make this a cloud
application there's two parts that we
have to do first we have to get the
database the local sample HR database we
need to get that onto the Oracle
database cloud service and the way we're
going to do that is we're actually going
to use a feature that's built into
JDeveloper called the database cart to
copy both the schema the setup of the
tables and all the data associated with
the tables we're going to copy it from
the local instance to the cloud instance
the second part is to get the
application itself over to the cloud and
again through JDeveloper we'll use one
the tool in JDeveloper to actually
deploy that's what we're doing here
sorry to write with a big fat pen we
write smaller we're going to deploy this
application on to the cloud
so let's see that in action let's go to
a demo so let me share my desktop
okay so here's the database sorry here's
the Oracle JDeveloper I already have a
local instance a WebLogic server running
this one of the nice features of
JDeveloper is out of the box because a
really feature complete integrated
development environment so this
particular into the JDeveloper that I
have up are already has my HR
application running in it
sorry already has my HR application
built I've already developed it we have
a number of different components for
example I have a component here
departments this is a where I'm going to
display the departments plus I have some
buttons to allow me to move through the
different records every time I update
the department's record I send a message
to this table panel to allow me to show
the employees that work for that
department I also want to be able to
edit those employees so I have a set of
fields down here that allow me to push
data back into the database so let's go
ahead and run this application locally
first again I'm I'm sort of following
the typical model as I see it for a
database sorry for an application
developer using the cloud you will
probably most likely download tools to
your desktop or your laptop environment
during the development locally with
local instances of databases test it and
then when you're ready deploy the
finished application to the cloud you
can use the cloud as your both your
tests and your development environment
but I think most likely people will
become more comfortable using local
resources and then pushing those
resources up to the cloud so that's what
we're going to do so let's go ahead and
run this application
okay and currently it's running locally
so it's deploying down here you can see
the messages hopefully coming across in
my log it's deployed the application or
it's in the process to playing the
application and here's the application
running in a Firefox browser okay so
this is my HR application again designed
engine developer now running in my
Firefox browser right now department 10
the administration department says it
has one employee if I move to the next
record and the next department two
employees let's move a little further
we'll go to the third one okay so this
department has six employees if I'm
counting them properly and because this
is a ATF application that has a
significant number of features that I'd
like to show you first of all one of the
things you can do is you can work with
the data as it's presented this is a
live application and it can has a number
of features that are kind of built into
AF so for example right now I have a lot
of columns so I may not need all these
columns so let's sort of let's take care
of these columns by looks like turning
some of them off for example I'm not
really sure that I care about the
Commission percentage and as your ID is
already showing so let's not show that
one either and the department ID again
that's sort of obvious from the
left-hand side there so let's move those
out make those hidden so now I have a
much smaller number of columns but I may
also want to change the order of these
columns they may want the columns to
appear differently would be nice to be
able to have employee ID last name for
example so let's grab this column and
just move it in front of
the first name called again that's a
feature of ADF that is a significant
amount of code if you were to try to
write that yourself in JSF or something
else but it's provided by default with
Oracle 3 developer and 80 of tables we
can also do some sorting for example
suppose I want to sort on the last name
now these names are sorted
alphabetically from top to bottom again
I wanted this application to be live so
I cannot apply the data associated with
this individual is selected so right now
it's Shelly bata who's selected so let's
change something in Shelly Vedas let's
try to change your email something else
note that this data is says a star let
me take that
so the starve so this is a required
field if I leave that field blank I get
this nice error message that's exactly
what you'd expect from an application
with a good UI to do so I'll just put
the data back in and I don't need to
change that really and instead let's
increase our salary let's make it 3,000
a week rather than 2,900 submit that to
the database and that records been
updated there's some other nice features
about JDeveloper and atf in particular
something that you get for free as well
for example suppose i want to chart the
values of the salary tell you i've done
that in a separate component and i get
this nice animation as it flies in and
shows me all of the salaries of the
employees in this department and i can
hide that back
and so forth okay so now that I've sort
of demonstrated for you what the
application is meant to do locally we'll
go through the process of getting it up
to the cloud so first of all it's I want
to talk a little bit about services in
the cloud to do that let me login to my
cloud instance as I mentioned earlier I
have a trial version of a public cloud
instance I'm going to go ahead and sign
into my cloud instance sign in with my
email address put in the password now
this particular trial version is is
actually a shared account I'm sharing
this account with other people in this
particular instance has actually two
database instances and two job instances
a trial version that you can request
would have just one of each of these
this particular one is actually owned by
the PM for the product so this one adds
a little bit more capability in terms of
the number of services but it's the same
look and feel that you get when you get
a trial version yourself so let's take a
look first of all at the database
instance just show you a couple of
things so for example this is a trial is
the day to the trial the service name
that's important when I'm communicating
with this database that's the data
source name that I want to use it's
called database if I'm going to access
the database from a IDE
I need a post URL in order to perform
any functions with the database I need
to be able to indicate some of the
secure FTP information I need a system
TP host
port number and a user name and in fact
true identity I would give that user
name a particular password so it can
access that data the job of services
same sorts of things there's a name for
the Java service one of the things we're
going to look at a little bit later is
we're actually going to look at the
service console this is how you can
interact with the applications that are
deployed to your Java cloud service so
there's some applications already
deploying here I can get some
information about them because of you
log messages well we'll take a look at
this once we deploy our HR application
alright so going back to JDeveloper then
going back to J developer then the first
thing I want to do as I mention is I
need to get the database schema and all
of the data associated with that
database over to the clock so within my
IDE I can do it all within the IDE
one a nice features is JDeveloper again
I'm going to open up the database first
let me open up the database navigator
because I want to show you that these
that I have a local connection to the my
Oracle XE instance and here's where the
sample data is inside of these tables so
for example here's the employee's table
if I click on that you know you can see
the the table itself the schema and all
the data associated with that table so
what I want to be able to do is to
actually move this data both the schema
and the data to my cloud instance okay
here's my cloud connection right now I
have some tables in the cloud these are
tables that came with the cloud itself
but these are the tables that I need for
my application so I'm going to move
these tables over so let's open up the
database cart again this is a tool
within the IDE that allows me to copy
both the database and the schema from
one place to another
so it's also going to need that
investigator to come back bring that
over here
apologize for moving these all around
makes sense just fit it so for my HR
application I really only need
departments and employees but I may want
to keep I want to may want to bring over
more of the data now so that I can use
the data and other ways later on with
other applications so I'm going to
select
countries and departments employees I
don't really need job history but I'll
take jobs and locations and regions and
I'll Drive this over to my database cart
by default the schema is copied that's
the data definition language for these
tables but I also want the data to be
copied so now I've selected both the
schema to create these tables and the
data that's contained in these tables
and I'm going to copy it to a place I'm
going to copy it to the cloud this
little cloud icon is connected to my
cloud connection so I simply give this
deploy action a name called HR dB
transfer for example I put in my SFTP
password I'm going to replace objects in
the destination I don't actually have
these objects yet over there but I think
it's probably a good practice since what
I really want is for this data to come
over if there's any existing data this
would move it I mean this would replace
that data
let's click apply I'm going to override
my zip file which will do the transfer
and now I'm transferring the data from
my local HR database instance over to
the cloud and this won't take very long
you can see that it's copying the data
over row by row table by table okay
so now let's take a look and see whether
or not that data went over to the cloud
so first of all I'm going to open up my
cloud connections close this level of
your room at the bottom there's a neat
feature there's a deployments okay well
let's look at the tables let's select
these tables refresh oh here we go now
it took a little while to catch up so
let's click on this is my transfer
action okay I need to move this kind of
out of the way so I can see them okay
because the cart so here's my transfer
action right now the status of my
transaction is approved I'm means that
the transfer is actually completed now
there are two sort of status phases here
the first status is processed indicating
that the zip file was transferred
successfully and the second status is
approved so at this point I know that my
data has been moved successfully to the
cloud so let's reopen the tables and
refresh the results there and now we can
see that countries is their departments
employees in fact I can double click
this look at the data it's the same data
that was in my than my local copy but
now I've copied both the schema and all
of its data to the club again through
through eid so the second part of what i
need to do now is to actually
you deploy this application to the cloud
but before I can do that I need to
change the way that the application will
access the database in the cloud right
now and let's go look at that right now
the application is accessing the data
locally using a JDBC URL what I really
wanted to do is to use a data source and
in fact I need it to use a specific data
source I needed to use the data source
name database so I'm going to change
that in my application let's change the
connection type from a URL gtb/c URL to
our gtb/c data source and the data
source name is database as I showed you
when we logged in once that's changed
I can now deploy this application
directly to the cloud and run it in my
cloud instance so to do that we'll click
on application come down here to deploy
and we'll select the application itself
HR system application one I'm doing it
through the wizard so you can see it you
can notice maybe when I pop that up that
there was an option to actually deploy
to the cloud because I've done this
before but I wanted to show you you know
how to use the wizard to go through that
process so we're going to deploy an
application service we're going to
choose my cloud service as the target
and click finish down here we can see in
the deployment log it's going to the
process of creating the file the ear
file to send to the cloud and now it's
writing the air file directly to my
cloud server and when that's done it'll
actually give me a success
message this takes a little while
chain
still going
oh well that's coming over why don't I
go back to the Java cloud services
control console we'll do a refresh here
you can see that the HR system
application is on its way over let me
scroll down a little bit you can see
that it's giving me a status actually it
now so that it's complete okay so let's
go back to JDeveloper and there it is
okay it is complete alright so from the
cloud services control or even from the
log you'll notice that one of the things
that's in the log is a URL that allows
me to run this application but I'm going
to show you how to do that from the Java
cloud services control console so let's
select this application okay and there's
the URL I clicked on the test
application I'm going to click that link
we'll go ahead and open that link if I
was not already logged in to into the
cloud I would go through the process of
actually logging in again in this case
because I have an active session an
active single sign-on SSO session we're
going to go straight into the
application and it looks just like the
one that we ran locally only before I
made the modifications so we can page
through the results now we can open up
the the cocoon pie chart on the salaries
you know we continue to go through we
can even change someone's salary let's
change den Raffy Elly's salary boy he's
making a lot but we'll give them a
little bit more so now Dan's making more
money anyway the point is that you can
see that this application
she's connected to the data that we sent
down work is running on the cloud it
looks exactly like the local instance I
have it is secure it's a Maranatha so
sign on I guess it's one thing that I
did not get a chance to show you but it
would be secured under esta so the same
as all the applications that are running
on this cloud instance so some next
steps for all of you let me go back here
to my slides so next steps for all of
you request your own trial service of
Oracle cloud you can try out the
tutorials that I showed you today in
fact we have some resources that you
ought to check out certainly you should
take a look at the Oracle Learning
Library ll where we have a number of
tutorials including the ones I showed
today there is a third part actually to
this tutorial series by the way that
includes information on how to change
the security from SSO to a security
through the application to use
credentials to do both authorization and
authentication through the application
itself
we also offer tutorials on using
NetBeans IDE and Eclipse IDE with clouds
as well
so some Christ I lion can take some
questions here the best way to answer
ask questions by the way please is
through the chat window does anyone have
any questions at this time
you
okay I don't see any questions in the
chat so thank you all for attending and
we'll be doing more of these so we'll
let you know when we have more a lot of
live presentations to give thank you
very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
