Linear Tape file system library edition
signing and installation
in this video we are going to cover the
operating system install for Oracle LTFS
le these instructions along with the
hardware requirements can be found in
the storage tag Linear Tape file system
library edition planning and
installation guide oracle LTFS le
supports oracle enterprise linux 5.5 x86
64 you can obtain this software from the
oracle energy delivery linux website so
once in the oracle a delivery linux
website what you're going to want to do
is do a media pack search on oracle
linux x86 64 bit platform from the
results page here you're going to want
to scroll down to the oracle linux
release 5 update 5 media pack for x86 64
from the media pack page you're going
you can either download 5 to 5 CDs or
the DVD in our case we're our install
we're gonna go ahead and download this
DVD zip file once you get that zip file
downloaded you unzip it there'll be an
image file in there and you'll burn that
to a DVD with whatever CD or image
burning software you have you'll take
that DVD you'll put it in your system
set your system up to boot from DVD
reboot your system and you can begin the
install
go ahead and hit enter when you get to
the boot page here now one thing you
want to keep in mind and you'll see this
in the install guide is that any hard
drives that you have in your system
and/or raids that you create cannot
exceed two terabytes
that's an Oracle Enterprise Linux 5.5
limitation
but the drivers load up here
all right so once once you get ready to
do the install you'll want to choose the
English language of course and what I
found is that you want to use the tab
and alt tab to go through these screens
however they're a little sticky got to
give them a few seconds try them again
see I got it there okay
keyboard type we want to go us okay
local cd-rom we want to do that and of
course if this is your first time
installing from the in this case our DVD
we do want to probably check this just
to make sure it's a good a good burn so
I would go ahead and say okay here
however for this particular disc we've
already checked it so I'm going to go
ahead and skip check in the DVD
and it should launch the Installer
all right so once you come up with the
installer you want to go ahead and hit
the next button you want to go ahead and
do the install Enterprise Linux click
Next so here we got our hard drives in
this particular system we've got one
hard drive it's selected we want to go
ahead and I like to remove all
partitions just make sure we get
everything out of there it's a fresh
install so I'll remove all partitions
leave everything else the defaults it's
going to ask if you want to remove all
partitions and all data on that drive go
ahead and say yes now here we're going
to want to put in our network
information for our Ethernet card that
should be plugged into the network now
in the installation guide there's a
checklist and you'll want to probably
fill that out prior to doing your
install help you at this page I'll show
you where this is in this particular
case we've got our LTFS le server we're
going to give it a name an IP subnet
mask default gateway DNS server and an
alternate DNS server so we've got that
information we're going to plug it into
this screen right here so on this system
are our e0 port is plugged into the
network we don't want to use DHCP we
want to we want to give it a static IP
so we're going to go ahead and edit it
go to manual configuration put in the IP
of our server we want to give it put in
this subnet mask
make sure I put a zero in there okay we
can go ahead and leave enable ipv6
support checkbox but we're gonna go
ahead and leave it alone we're not gonna
do anything there for the hostname we're
gonna go ahead and put in our fully
qualified hostname including the domain
in this case our host name is Bohemia
don't donate a domain is dot u.s.
oracle.com we want to go ahead and put
in our gateway our primary DNS
I'm gonna make sure you do this
correctly because if not it could mess
up your Etsy host file and your resolve
dot-com file and we'll go over that
after the install you can fix it there
it's just be nice if you get it if you
get it right here you don't have to
worry about it later so what I'd like to
do is just make sure that I got
everything in there correctly I know
this is my host name fully qualified
there's my IP address again if you
wanted to you could certainly go back in
here
this is looking good here our gateway
our primary DNS secondary DNS or in our
case from the checklist it's alternate
DNS for secondary go ahead hit next you
want to go ahead and select your
location in this case we're gonna select
Denver or region mountain time now here
we want to give it the root password
whatever you want to give it
now at this page it's important that you
do not select any software development
no webserver no clustering no storage
clustering options we're going to run a
script after the end after the OS
install that's going to install some
some of these packages but they're
specific for LTFS le so at this point we
don't want to we want to do a default
installation or a a basic installation
of the OS so at this page just leave the
customize later button or option button
selected and click Next
so at this point the Installer has all
the information it needs to do an
installation go ahead and select next
here first thing you'll do is it'll form
at any of the disks that you told it to
from the hardware pay or the hard drive
page in this case we had one disk it's
gonna format that one hard drive and
then it should start installing all the
software for the operating system on
that disk
now if you do have multiple hard drives
in your system you'll have to refer to
our best practices on how how best to
set up your environment there are
several directories that will help LTFS
le perform faster if you put them on
their own disks again that's in the best
practices guide so you can take a look
at that for your particular system
all right so it looks like it's getting
ready to transfer the image to the hard
drive or the OS files and
all right so it looks like Oracle
Enterprise Linux installation is
complete what you're gonna want to do
now is it should have kicked out your
your DVD and you'll want to remove that
and then you're going to want to go
ahead and reboot the system the system
is going to reboot it's going to come
back in here it's going to take us to
the first time configuration screens and
we'll go ahead and run through that
right after reboot here
all right so once we get we come to the
welcome screen which is basically the
first time configuration screen we're
going to want to go ahead and run
through this list set it up hit the
forward button go ahead and accept the
license agreement at the firewall what
we're gonna do here for this particular
installation is we're gonna go ahead and
disable this for a basic LT of SLE
install now if you do want to enable the
firewall you're definitely going to want
to add port 7001 tcp/ip and then you'll
have to have to add some other ports and
you're also going to have to configure
your ACS LS server for firewall
connectivity for both the ACS LS server
and the client and in this case the
client would be the LTFS le server here
so please refer to the ACS LS
administrator's guide for information on
how you would configure both ACS LS
server and your LTFS le server for use
with a firewall again for this in
particular installation we're not gonna
we're gonna go ahead disable it go ahead
and click yes to say yes I'm sure I want
to do this you can go ahead and leave SC
Linux as enforcing that's okay go ahead
and hit forward on k-dub unless you want
to enable that date and time we'll go
ahead and set that up in this case I'm
close enough for for this for this
install at the correct user screen we're
gonna go ahead and have you click
forward go ahead and hit continue we're
going to go ahead we're gonna create a
user but we're gonna do it from the
command line after the OS is installed
we're gonna go ahead and add a group and
user to that group so what we'll do with
that from the command-line
soundcard certainly if you if you have
one you can certainly install that as
well here we don't have one so we're
gonna go ahead and click forward no need
to install any additional CDs go ahead
and click finish so now at this time
you're gonna it's going to ask you or
go ahead and reboot the system for those
changes to take effect once that comes
up you're gonna come to the login page
go ahead and login with your root
username and password that you created
during install and you'll see here got
the desktop to come up now from the
installation guide they want you to do a
few things they're gonna want you to
verify your release you can do that by
going catting the etsy Enterprise
release file it should say Enterprise
Linux Enterprise Linux server release
5.5 Carthage in parentheses you want to
go ahead and verify it at the kernel is
at a certain level I'll show you that
you want your kernel to be at 2.6 won
8-1 94 al 5 now from the previous video
when setting up the hardware the storage
hardware we have a a Fiber Channel SAN
switch that's zoned up that connects the
drives in the partition library to the
LTFS le server and we've already got
that set up and what we want to do is
verify that we can indeed see those tape
drives so I'm gonna do a cat on /proc
scuzzy scuzzy and you'll see here that I
see my my 3 tape drives I've got my T
10,000 see my HP LTO 5 and my IBM LTO 5
so the OS has configured as T drivers
for all three of my drives and we are
now ready to install LTFS le on this
server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
