Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series Oracle Enterprise Manager
12c automates upgrading of Oracle
databases across major versions in this
demo you will see an automated upgrade
of Oracle database from version 10 2 or
4 to 11 2 or to using deployment
procedures manually there are several
steps involved in upgrading of a
database like running of all
prerequisite checks installation of the
software taking backups running DB
upgrade assistant and executing
verifications post upgrade the
deployment procedure automates all of
the standard steps including
prerequisite checks and verification it
also supports upgrade of multiple
systems at the same time
from the menu select provision onion
patching and then choose database
provisioning
the page lists the various procedures
available select the upgrade article
database procedure and launch it this
procedure has five simple interview
steps step one selection of the
databases to upgrade the procedure
prepopulates the available databases in
the environment across various platforms
and versions for this exercise we will
select a database of 10 204 version and
upgraded to 11 202 version note as in
ran new versions of databases are
released they will be certified and
added to the available upgrade path list
step two involves selection of upgrade
options and specifying path details user
can either upgrade the database instance
along with the software or can choose to
upgrade just the database instance alone
if the required version of Oracle
software is available on the server this
allows flexibility and also helps in
phasing the whole upgrade process in
this exercise we will select the option
to upgrade both database instances along
with the software next we choose the
software for the 11 202 version it can
be picked up from the list of available
growth images from the software library
the Enterprise Manager software library
is a file system based storage for
software and patches I delete the Oracle
home can be pre patched to the latest
recommended patch levels before creating
the code image out of it the procedure
defaults the user groups to the Oracle
recommended values however you can
modify based on their environment the
procedure also pre-populates a software
location for the new Oracle home we will
go ahead with the default values for the
exercise in the step 3 of the interview
you could specify listener and other
configuration details
the procedure lists if any suitable
listeners are already available in the
server in this exercise we will specify
details for a new listener that will be
created in the eleven 202 Oracle home as
part of the process
you
as as a part of the process you can also
configure the backup and restore options
if you have already taken a backup you
can opt to ignore or else can select
backup option applicable to the database
being upgraded the procedure defaults
the upgrade options as per article
recommendations like recompiling invalid
objects upgrading the timezone
information step four of the process
involves providing credentials for
execution the procedure requires three
different credentials one for the
operating system user another for the
operating system user with the privilege
to run route commands and the third one
is the credential of the database user
in this exercise we will select pre
created named credentials for the OS
user and since there are none available
for the database we will create one
you
as a part of creating the new
credentials it can be tested and saved
for future usage
Step five of the interview is for
specifying schedule for the job
execution here you can go over the
default option to schedule the procedure
for immediate execution our choose to
schedule it during a maintenance window
additionally as a part of the step you
can create a pause in the execution of
the procedure called said breakpoint the
procedure would pause when at this stage
and the DBA can check and can continue
to proceed further the breakpoint can be
set to all steps are to a specific phase
of the procedure execution in this
exercise we will select the breakpoint
just before upgrading the database
instance after of all required
installation and upgrade checks
additionally for rollouts you can turn
on the notification so the DBA can get
notified on the scheduled procedure
executions without actually attending to
it thus making the entire process
completely unattended now let's review
all of our inputs for the upgrade
procedure you can see the execution in
real-time you can also drill down into
any step to see log level details the
procedure takes just over 30 minutes to
complete the orchestration of upgrading
database to version 11 - atchoo this is
the end of the demonstration thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
