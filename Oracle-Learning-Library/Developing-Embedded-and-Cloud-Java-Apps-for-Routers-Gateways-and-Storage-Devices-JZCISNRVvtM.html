program director of smart networks at
Netgear and smart networks is basically
our development platform for all of our
devices that we're gonna be supporting
I'll tell you a little bit about kind of
the background of what is a network app
what is a smart network we'll talk a
little bit about some of our partner
experiences and we'll also go through or
Dennis auld over our engineering manager
we'll go through some of the
architecture of our development kits and
actually step through some coding
examples and then lastly we'll talk a
little bit about how to monetize a
networked app just to get started a
little bit of background on Netgear
itself
we are the no burn number one global
brand and distributor for network
devices that includes routers DSL
gateways network attached storage device
like that today we have approximately 80
or 85 million devices in the field as an
install base at the moment and these are
probably over the last three four years
and we obviously ship to worldwide most
of our market share of courses in North
America Europe and Asia so I want to
talk today a little bit about what a
network application is and what a mobile
app and what how does it differ from a
mobile application first of all you guys
are all familiar with mobile
applications and some of the drawbacks
you have here are they are peripheral to
the network they can be moved out of the
home or out of them out of the business
and they don't have direct access to
other devices in other words these are
these are actually mobile devices right
so if you have an application that
always needs to be in contact with other
things inside the home for example these
these types of applications can't really
run on a mobile device whereas with a
network application on say a router you
actually have the ability to actually
sit there on a device that's always
turned on always connected to the
network and able to control and monitor
the traffic throwing flowing through
that network
in addition you have the ability to look
at the data in the network and
potentially manage the data and control
the data and where that data goes so
these are some of the key differences in
between mobile devices and devices that
Netgear ships such as routers and DSL
gateways and network attached storage
devices so what we decided we need to do
is open up these platforms to
third-party developers and let them
develop applications that require these
types of functionality is this always on
always in the home type of functionality
so we built out a a development platform
on these on these devices and I think
probably some of you have come by our
booth earlier in the week and got a
little bit of a feel for that but today
I'd like to go through some of the
detail architecture on that as well so
what can you do as a network application
so we have these we have these
differences between mobile and network
applications what can you actually do
with that that's one of the the biggest
questions we've gotten on the show floor
in the past couple of days is what can
you actually do well there's actually
quite a lot first of all there's some of
the obvious things like network security
you know the use cases like monitoring
your internet usage and notifying you if
something improper is happening
there's connected home type of
applications as well if you go upstairs
to some of the the demos they have
upstairs on the embedded suite they're
talking a little bit about managing your
energy and home control and things like
that these are these are types of
applications that really need to be
inside the home running at all times on
some sort of embedded platform and with
our with our platform this enables us
the start of application to be built so
for example you can monitor your your
grandmother or
a sick elder inside their home so they
can stay in their home instead of going
to a nursing home you can turn your
router into a voiced PBX system and put
that into a small business and then on
the media side there's a lot of
potential applications as well you can
actually control and move your data
around and quite a lot of varieties and
will actually talk to where I'll
actually have a video later in the
presentation of one of our partners
who's built an application based on just
this idea we also have the ability to do
a lot of social network media sharing
and things like that which are kind of
some really interesting ideas around how
you can actually keep control over your
data as opposed to posting it on on a
site like Facebook for example where
potentially lose some control over it
again these are all dependent on three
main features first of all that device
that they're running on has to always be
on and always in the same location you
have to have reliable access to it from
the internet or from local and you have
to be able to control and and store data
potentially large amounts of data and
the platform that we're talking about
that we're talking about today actually
provides all of these so on a router on
a DSL gateway or on an as again I'll go
through those device you'll hear those
device names a lot of times today but
they are they are the types of devices
that are sitting in the home or sitting
in the small business that are always
providing these kind of capabilities so
if you look at what we've actually built
on top of these devices we have three
main pieces one is what we call our
control point and this is the the
software that's running inside the
device inside the home or business and
this is a Java based platform running in
OSGi Felix stack on top of it that
enables third-party developers to write
applications and deploy them on to that
device so it opens up these devices that
previously had been kind of sealed
devices with a firmware that doesn't
change on them now they're opened up so
that developers can write applications
push those applications onto the devices
and and kind of monetize their their
efforts gets you so that the other piece
that's really interesting here is the
user interface now with our technology
we actually have an XML API so you can
use really any technology you want to on
the user interface side so you can use
an iPhone application or you can use a
browser-based application even PC if you
want to and then the third piece that
ties it all together is our cloud
services so this includes our
marketplace itself so once you create an
app you can actually put it in the
marketplace and get access to all those
those users out there you have the
developer portal we can actually create
an account get our SDK interact with
other developers talk to people within
neck here on our on our blogs and forums
and so on and then lastly we have the
customer portal and the customer portal
is really important because it actually
provides access to all these
applications once they're installed so
if you want to for example as an end
user you want to see your network where
you want to see your applications on
your network this is where you would go
to actually interact with those
applications and this provides that
ability to launch you know your
third-party applications or your neck
your applications so these three pieces
comprise the the overall smart network
ecosystem and they in the basis for our
developer platform so when all these
come together the the basic idea is no
matter where you are anywhere in the
world you have access to your devices
and that doesn't matter it doesn't
matter if your devices are in your home
or in your business you know if you have
a distributive business model for
example where you have let's say I know
convenience stores for example maybe you
have a headquarters that has some
monitoring systems on you have a remote
location where you actually can can turn
the lights on security on and off and
things like that and then you have an
off-site backup in this example this
platform with the with the neck your
platform and an application built to
support these these different use cases
can actually tie all these together one
simple one simple interface that enables
you to get access to all these different
homes and/or business location
and access all the different devices
with them access to data within them and
in control basically all these things in
one place I know I'm going kind of quick
so if anybody has questions feel free to
raise your hand at any time I know we'll
go into a little bit more technical
detail later but even if we're going
through this feel free to interrupt me
if with questions so next I'd like to
actually talk about one of our partner
experiences Qualcomm has has created an
application actually I'll let him talk
about it we've created an application
called the Skip the engine which turns
our net gear ready NAS device or a smart
router into the locus of control for
media management and playback within the
connected home so it really makes it
easy for consumers to be able to take
all their music photos and videos and
essentially liberate them from the
storage device and be able to stream
them in full quality on televisions and
stereos one of the key things around
development of this gift the engine was
that we chose the Java platform as the
best approach to deliver the software
because of its extensibility and the
opportunities that it afforded device
manufacturers to be able to more easily
distribute and update software and the
net gear smart network with its Java and
OSGi back-end really fit nicely with our
product strategy a few of the big things
that we looked at with the smart network
and assessing you know the viability and
how this would match our current
software strategy was how extensible the
platform was both in terms of ease of
use as well as the feature set and we
found everything from the early-stage
development tools up to e-commerce and
having the ability to create flexible
pricing and distribution models and then
the follow-on analytics to really
understand how well sales and
performance of the application actually
wet when we found that entire suite as
an end-to-end solution to be top-notch
the NIC year platform actually gives us
an opportunity to reach a category of
consumers that sir ditional II have not
been able to be reached by other means
and we're able to tailor our offering
specific to those customers so you find
you
find yourself in a position as a
developer to be able to minimize your
customer acquisition cost really dial
into what that consumer is looking for
and as a network the smart network is
one that we see is at the forefront of
what other companies maybe in this space
or may be looking at but Netgear is
actually pushing the way towards this
way of extending the life and value of
connected hardware so again these three
pieces built together along with the
third-party applications enable you to
reach quite a wide a large install base
of customers you know in the 80 to 100
million user range so these three pieces
build up our smart network and to go
into more detail actually have got us
all Dover who is our engineering manager
and talked a little bit about the
architecture and actually go through a
coding example Dennis good morning
everyone feel free to interrupt me if
you have any questions if I go too fast
with Rachel and slow me down I see that
I pointed out no we have a complete
solution which allows you to create your
application using your favorite
front-end technology to create your user
interface applications and we also
provide libraries to develop your java
based or native code application that
runs on the control point and like peter
said there are three points the three
main components were smart networking
ecosystem and in the code review that
I'll be doing in a bit I'll show you the
basics for creating the dis components
on the control point but we have there
is an OS GI based bundles services are
running gets downloaded from from the
cloud by a user on the device and on the
remote side a user interface but I'll be
showing you as a GWT based at UI
application and we use is the beavers
XML based on messaging protocol that
goes through the cloud to your device
and I'll be going to the into details as
well
all right so here I'd like to start
first showing about the control point
architecture basically what we did is
take the the Linux OS and we put a Java
VM and on top of that we we put in a
noise GI framework we use Apache Felix
4.0 to distribution and then we added
our libraries our api's to make make it
easier for developers provide helper
classes to to get access to the cloud
and if you go to our marketplace right
now we have an application guest network
that uses such a PS I'm also have Wi-Fi
settings application in there and we
also support your application for user
third-party libraries you can bundle up
into OSGi application and you know you
can call your your third-party drivers
throughout J's and I also what we have
on the on the cloud now is our dashboard
it's these are user facing a web
application in theirs we provide a
helper classes for your figure young for
your UI applications to communicate to
the cloud we have you can create widget
type application or those little small
gadgets and a full screen application
communicate through our jsni interface
and I'll be showing you that in a bit
and you use that to basically do some
async communication between your UI
component and your osei base africaine
just running on the device and also on
the portal for for if you have like
clients that don't want to be hosted by
our the our user facing dashboard we
have also remote API to do this kind of
asynchronous communication
all right but you know how this the UI
component talk to your poetry I
component and it all happens because of
F CML this is the XML based message
protocol that we use in our system to
let you identify where the message came
from and where you want it to go it's
basically a message routing protocol and
over here I don't have a pointer but as
you can see it's an analogy here it's
like a snail mail right there's an
envelope and in an envelope is the
sender and a destination where it's
going to and inside them the envelope is
your message so basically as you see
there the light one is your object that
you want to use and set is the method
that you want to do and basically the
state and brightness or attributes that
you want to happen for that specific
object and in this case you want to turn
it on and set the brightness to 100%
here's another example and this is more
about the interaction between a UI
application and and the control point
itself basically your UI application is
is giving the client ID by our portal UI
23 this one and it you're sending this
message to your to the light control
application that is all in the control
point which is ID by the system as CP 1
4 5 8 and again we're using the same FCM
message on the other side on the
previous slide and we're setting the
brightness to only precision and turning
it on on the on the light controller
application that's on the control point
side when it receives the message it
performs a function of turning the
Delilah and and setting the brightness
20% it then it then confirms that it
received that message by responding back
with a with its object the object that
that acted on that message and with a
dot is method and it's basically
broadcasting it's like the asynchronous
message messaging that I talked about it
tell us everybody
in within the system within that account
that hey I'm here and somebody changed
my my settings to hundred percent and
I'm now on so if you have other clients
within the the ecosystem they'll be able
to to determine this change and notified
of this change any questions alright so
I'm okay so I'm just gonna go briefly
into a Acco review and on what's how do
you do a noise GI based application and
how we would do a UI first thing is this
is of this code is available on our
developer portal so I'm gonna briefly go
over through and review some of the key
components the first thing that I'd like
to show you is is the hello world
service so this is the the key thing for
for being able to communicate to our
portal basically you develop your java
application and extend this plugin core
client and then you give your
application a name service just
basically you this service name is is
what identifies your name in this case
it's called negative hello world and
basically in it when you override to run
you just call the start receiving and
and once your bundle get started by by
the OSGi framework it will start
receiving messages from from the system
um and then then you implement this FCM
I'll executors you extend it from this
club based class and over here basically
you you invoke this process method on
the base class and that by calling that
all your override methods for handling
the different messages like handle is
the is the light is method that that the
we saw earlier and and also the the set
right but calling that process method
the the system calls your your handle
set override method here basically but
what this is what's what's doing here
it's going through the this fluid object
node we just basically a parse XML
object walks through it identifies if
it's something that you're interested in
if this is your object and basically
looks at the attribute and then you can
act on on this specific changes that you
want figure out for your object many
questions
okay so that's basically the the two
critical parts of being able to
communicate using XML in our system
right you you created a plugin core
client and then you implement this FCM
executor and then you all right all this
method than the FS ml executor so you
can act on the messages that you'll send
or what the system will send you and
then the other piece is how do you
create the UI component um yeah but you
know there's this asynchronous to
communication that we're doing so
basically in this apply selecting your
spine
you're basically generating the the
message XML payload and sending it back
to the system
yes oh yeah let me go in here this one
yes I get the controller here
yeah we use some yeah open GD se but we
stripped off some of the UI classes
let's make it a little smaller
one six yes
all right so for the UI side now how
would you do a simple UI application
loads in our dashboard here we have a
gadget application using GWT we provided
some helper classes to to make it easier
for developers here what we have here is
a components jar basically some common
UI helper classes you know to get the
status of the device you know how do you
get a standard so device um basically
let me go through so here what we have
here is a set of classes that we have
implemented so you can communicate to
the basic services that we opened up on
the control point if if you're if you're
developing an application for for the
router let's say there's this net router
service that's running on the troll
point you'll be able to access these
objects like what's the wireless
settings what ports are blocked or
accessible you can manage manipulate
those objects foot for that service and
what I want to show you here is how how
what what you need to do on the UI to
make this all work after creating a new
TT project you basically import all
those classes into your library and and
you implement on the onload you
implement this FCM Elliott call right
basically this is the first step that
you need to do before you can
communicate our dashboard it's sort
oflike and when you when you go to the
developer website and apply for the
submitting application you need to get
an application ID and in here you
authorize your application but by
calling this FC mailing it you're
basically telling the framework a yet
I'm here I'm a UI application here's my
application ID and I want to start
communicating right and this tells our
system what what methods you can send
and what what objects you can access and
you here this goes through all the jsni
that was sorry yes
the JavaScript native interface here in
our library the comment you dove we have
a post message Jess
so basically just using post message
between you know your application and
our dashboard to communicate so when you
when you send a message it goes through
post message when you receive it calls
your own listeners through uh through
these days tonight alright so this lets
take a look at an example on this one
service controller so that that service
that we saw earlier basically we had a
hello world application service that's
running on the on the control point and
we had a hello world object right so
what I'm what I'm doing here is I'm
creating a query using our client query
helper class and and basically you're
sending a message to that nil Netgear
hello world service that's on the device
sending it to the portal and before
you're doing that you set up your
listener and when you call execute
basically hours it sends it through the
case online through our dashboard which
sends it to a portal and portal routes
it to the control point using the
control point ID which is you specify
here right and then when the control
point responds back to the UI the
dashboard and routes it to your
application and calls your listener and
you get it on this on resolve then it's
your duty to you know parse through the
objects we basically wrap the parsley
the XML message for you put in in or a
fluid objects then you go through it one
by one and see if this this object is
you're interested in and then you act on
on the methods or state changes or
actually changes that that you get from
the control point service so you take
this this UI application and the control
point service you package it all up in a
zip file we have it's about how you do
that is available on the developer I
don't have yeah on the veldt website
and basically submitted through our
submission process in there and and and
that's this about it any questions
sure yeah we have one router the 3500
lv2 and and to NASA's dual v2 and NV +
b2 is to Beto so the 3500 is I think
it's around 60 to 70 dollars so it's a
mid-range router the NAS devices I think
are between two and four hundred dollars
depending on the configuration so how
much like how much hardware you or how
much space you have
on top of services you're exposed to
exactly yeah now now the router side of
things provides that gateway still the
NASA side is really divided it's a
device that's designed to be a storage
device so Dennis mentioned that the
Dennis mentioned the net router clients
earlier in this example and that
actually provides api's to talk to the
router itself so you can get information
like what devices are connected and get
your IP addresses and and things like
that
you also have the ability to to listen
to you PMP for example so you can
actually find UPnP devices like cameras
and interact with them that way so
depending on what level of of
interaction you need you can basically
look at either the connected device or
actually go to a upp or deal and they or
some other protocol to actually find the
devices within them within the system
what's interesting though is with this
FC ml communication we actually enable
you to write an application that for
example talks with you PNP and exposes
vfc mouth to other applications those
devices so you can actually write an
application that talks with cameras for
example and exposes the camera
functionality to other applications
so instead of just having you know I
can't Romana terrine application you
have a key an application that supports
camera monitoring but also you know
maybe something to integrate with motion
sensor in to turn your lights on so
we've actually put together prototypes
of z-wave and ZigBee type of
applications so we definitely can you do
that using this platform we're not
providing an application that controls
lights or anything like that but we
definitely have the platform that
enables someone to create an application
that does that
so there's also efforts yes it is
similar there's also efforts under so
for example the OSGi Alliance has
efforts under you know to to standardize
some of these device interaction
protocols we we are monitoring those we
are monitoring that we're not actually
involved in it but we are monitoring
that I get emails on everything that
comes across yeah exactly so we're
keeping track of it and we're making
sure that our stuff is compatible but
we're not actively going out there and
making contributions to those you have
to be very careful cuz uh especially on
the router side right right now and you
know there's there's it's fairly limited
you know the memory it's I think what we
have no it's about but 64 megabytes to
work with most most Ovi application that
we've seen there are you know make use
of a small memory so and those are
pretty efficient but on the very nice
side there's there's plenty plenty on
that the storage and end for memory you
know there's there's a lot more than the
individual point another hour there's a
Ram site yes a most of the routers have
have a USB ports so you can in people
attach their their uh USB sticks or USB
drives and if you see it available you
can your your application can get access
to that and you have more space for
storing application we have right now in
the
twenty-eight megabytes of flash now of
course some of that is taken up by the
firmware in the platform as well
typically we we allocated maybe 64
megabytes for applications from that
space so they're not designed to be huge
applications we want to keep them as
small as we as we possibly can make sure
they're efficient yeah in addition we
want to be able to have more than one
application on the on the device right
so we definitely want to keep those as
small as we can
sure yes yes yeah so we'll go through a
little bit of that in a little bit we
have some more slides to go through but
yes there's it's very similar to like
the Apple development agreement and you
know basically it's a $99 subscription
once a year 70/30 split between the
between Netcare and the application
developer and so on yes there are
definitely some differences between what
they do when we do of course all right
thank you all right so so Dennis kind of
went through the the architecture and
examples but from a a business
perspective I'd like to hear a little
bit more from another one of our
partners a company called sim form who's
built an application based on the
readiness devices and I'll let you hear
directly from from them
sym form has a cloud data backup service
and we've created a way to easily
download our application from the smart
network so that Netgear customers can
backup all of the data in their nas
devices to the cloud for that second
tier backup and data protection we are
actually a distributed or crowd-sourced
solution so everyone that uses the
application is contributing to the
service or contributing to the network
so what makes it great about working
with Netgear customers is they really
understand this very quickly and they
understand that they can contribute to
the network some excess local drive
space and in exchange they get that
layer of data protection and cloud
backup within the network what was great
about working with Netgear is the market
reach that we will also get immediately
we have access to tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands of Netgear
customers this is easy for really any
developer or any type of application
we're a SAS application or cloud-based
application and really all we needed to
do was to create that Java based package
for application to make it relevant and
easily downloaded from the marketplace
the cost of doing that was was low for
us but the time to market was very quick
the sim form application is available
now on the genie plus marketplace for
already nas and nas products so we're
very excited to launch this with Netgear
so a little bit more about her her
application so the sim form application
is is a Java package that's downloaded
to the ready now's but it actually
communicates with their back-end service
as well
and that's kind of controlled within
their application space so once that
application is on the device Netgear
steps out of the equation we're not
processing the data we're not sending it
through our servers or anything it's
handled exclusively by that application
provider so we enable you to basically
take control of that of that application
and basically implement however you need
to implements within your space so to
answer your your question earlier about
how do you become a developer basically
you got to go to our developer website
and create an account there it takes you
five minutes or so to do that
and start downloading the SDK and
looking through the tutorials and so on
developing your application is is fairly
simple like Dennis described basically
you you write the user interface and
whatever technology you want you can use
our our libraries to build it or you can
use an iPhone interface or iPad
interface or or even a native PC based
interface if you want to and then you
package all these things together and
you put them into the into our developer
website you have a we have an upload
functionality there you upload the app
we go through some some validation to
make sure it doesn't do nasty things to
our devices and we approve it and then
you can basically go ahead and set your
prices and start selling them as far as
submitting the application every
application has a unique identifier that
differentiates it from other
applications so you have to request an
application ID from neck here before you
before you really get started now you
can write your own code and all that
with it with a temporary ID and test it
but before you have to before you submit
anything you have to have a neck you're
issued ID and that basically enables us
to provide services to your application
so when when when a user sees your
application they actually get notified
of what services you are requesting and
based them on the security level they
could actually choose to install or not
install that so if for example you want
to get access to all their network data
everything that flows through the
through the earth through the router
they have to be aware of that and
approve it and so we need that
application ID to course ones that so
once you have that application ID you
can actually go ahead and create your
OSGi service component and your user
interface and so on and like I said
earlier submit the app into our
developer website once it's approved you
set your price you decide where you want
to sell it if you want to sell it
worldwide that's simple easy to do if
you want to sell it in select countries
that's also easy to easy to do right now
at the moment we are selling strictly in
the US only we have plans to launch in
Europe and Asia by the end of this year
as well
so kind of in summary this basically
really is a true end-to-end system it
provides all the development environment
it provides the hardware devices to run
on it provides access to the customers
through our our marketplace that
provides an interface for those
customers to actually see your
applications in and start running them
through our dashboard and you know it's
based on revenue sharing so we are not
successful on this unless you guys are
successful as developers as well so
we're really trying to do our best to
make sure that we help these these third
parties such as yourselves create these
applications that make them successful
we don't see this marketplace as being
you know the the order of magnitude of
say Android or or iTunes we're not
looking at five hundred thousand
applications we would be happy if we had
five hundred applications so your
application is not not going to be lost
in this huge mass of other applications
that people have to search through and
find and things like that it's really
dedicated to more of a a select valuable
set of applications that actually
provide real value to the end users and
enhance their life at the moment so we
just launched this three weeks ago so at
the moment we have I believe there's
about 300,000 ready NAS devices out
there and on the router side I believe
it's about 150 thousand we're launching
two new routers before the end of this
month and that'll expand the reach by
about double and then we're looking at
doing that basically every couple of
months and expanding onto more of our
products so initially it's you know
fairly limited but by the end of the
year we're looking at probably close to
half a million by the end of next year
should be about 20 million yes we do see
it as limited but remember these are end
users right these are not these are
people right if this is not devices
necessary that you you don't think of it
as devices you think of this as people
who are actually using the devices right
it they court they in many cases they
correspond one-to-one but you're getting
right directly in front of those and
users right here
so the question is on backward
compatibility of readiness devices and
the two devices we have for ready now is
that are supported right now are the
reading as duo and the reading as nv+
those are the only two that are backward
compatible right now you can get a
firmware upgrade for those two anything
older than that is not supported at this
time again we're going through our
product line and adding this two
additional devices as we go so it's
potential other devices will that are
already out there may be upgraded to
that as well the question is whether
applications can have basically open
access to the Internet and the answer is
yes the user has to be notified when
they download the application that
they're that this that the app does it
yes so they have to agree to that
initially when they buy it but beyond
that we don't really control that now
when we do our approval cycle we will
monitor that and make sure you're not
you know taking something that that you
shouldn't be that restricts our
permission you know their research the
security concerns around that but yes
you do have the ability to open up an
internet connection in fact the the
example we had earlier with SIM form
that's exactly what they're doing they
actually have a connection back to their
server side doesn't go through any any
neck here site it goes directly back to
their server and transmits data back and
forth
this is actually an a real se version
this is not even the embedded version so
this is we're actually running at the
moment open JDK se6 version six question
is whether they we only support one-time
fees or subscriptions and the answer is
we support both so you can create an
application that does a monthly
recurring fee or an annual recurring fee
you can set up to do it every two months
if you want to so it's fairly flexible
on that in respect sure
which Nagar fully embracing OSGi the
since then once you have firmware on the
devices in a do is check framework are
you is your router software
functionality written in OSGi
you may have changed to the GUI or
something you read to boil that as a new
collector
at this point the router user interface
sorry let me repeat the question the
question is how deeply is OSGi embedded
in the router firmware itself are we
using it internally the answer is at
this point in time it's not being used
by our internal user interface the plan
is to move in that direction you know we
we have to do this in steps but the plan
is to move all the functionality that's
not you know embedded in the router
itself you know the basic routing
functionality anything additional to
that will be moved towards these
applications and they may be default
applications that are always installed
but they'll still be OSGi applications
now to clarify a little bit more the
Java and OSGi stack is embedded in the
firmware so when you get it from the
factory it will have that on there
question is on jigsaw and Java SE
modularity at this point we haven't
really been considering that down the
road that's probably going to be a
pretty strong consideration but at this
point we haven't really evaluating them
so other jvm languages and how we could
put that into the device itself now that
is possible you're talking about
something like Ruby or J Ruby exactly
that would be definitely be possible as
long as you can package that within your
application exactly then that can be
done
we don't have restrictions on what you
can compile into your class files in
fact as Dennis mentioned you actually
have the ability to run native code as
well on this on this device at the Linux
level so you can actually package C and
C++ code in there and have a jsni or
start a j'ni interface to communicate
with that C code as well
so the question is what some of our
competition has announced you're talking
about the app enabled routers in the
cloud stuff from d-link and in Cisco the
answer is they have basically created an
API in the cloud that enables mobile
applications iPhone iPad Android and so
on to communicate with the device to
configure it so basically their
applications are basically configuration
applications or whatever's built into
their firmware they don't actually allow
you to download applications on to the
router itself there's a big difference
so they basically put applications in
the in the Apple Store in the Android
store we actually have a marketplace
that has application to get downloaded
to the devices there's a key difference
there any other questions okay thanks um
so these are the two important URLs the
first one is the marketplace itself so
you can look at that unless you have a
device you can't actually download
applications or anything like that but
you can certainly see what the context
looks like see what the applications
look like see what's out there and then
the developer website where you can
actually go and sign up and get the SDK
and and get started actually developing
the question the applications so any
other questions yes so the question is
whether you can get access to the SDK
and everything without paying the
subscription the answer is yes you can
so you just go in there you still have
to create the account you can start
using the SDK and everything you can't
submit an application so you've
subscribed but you can certainly develop
your application so it's okay
go ahead
question is whether you can run it on
your local machine yes absolutely the
SDK basically tutorial step you through
exactly how to create your application
and install it on your local router so
you can actually do testing and things
like that absolutely without having to
submit is this mic on can can you guys
hear him in the back okay yeah I just
wanted to add that in the developed
website you can only also find out how
you can use our simulator basically we
just running the Felix distribution that
we have on the device and test your
application on on your desktop your
laptop as you install java and then you
run you know run felix and basically you
in our bundle all our core bundles will
be available for download as well and
you trigger the the script to start the
application and basically it's
functioning as if your own advice except
you don't have access to the hardware
functionalities so the base platform
itself is actually an OS GI application
as well so as long as you have a Java VM
and OSGi there you can actually install
all of our what we call the control
point onto that OSGi platform and
basically run that as a simulated
environment on your PC or whatever Linux
dice you have did you have another
question that was any it's fairly
independent of the IDE we have a bunch
of libraries and things like that all
the tutorials we have out there use
Eclipse as an example there's nothing to
say you can't use NetBeans or some other
IDE if you'd like to
but we don't have you know environment
setup and things like that in the
tutorials yeah basically that is the
main reason it's you know more
standardized it's also a little bit
smaller in some respects for the pieces
that way you're using so it's a little
simpler to actually get everything up
and running and it's a little more
compact now to be clear we're only using
standard OSGi so if you make use of any
OSGi services within your applications
if you go outside of those standards you
need to make sure that your application
includes them in your packaging any
other questions
all right well thank you all for coming
Steve Lipinski who's our marketing
manager is also here he's actually
handing out a USB sticks with the
presentation on it so feel free to to
look through those as well
and thank you all for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
