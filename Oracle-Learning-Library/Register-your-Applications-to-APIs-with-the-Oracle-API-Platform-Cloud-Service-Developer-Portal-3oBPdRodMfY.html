api's that he builds applications with
every time James starts to build an
application he spends a lot of time
finding the right API to use this slows
him down he wants to manage his API
catalog and have a way to easily and
quickly use his api's Oracle API
platform cloud service can help the
Oracle API platform cloud service
developer portal provides discovery
Learning and registration for AP is here
James can view all the api's he's
authorized to view a short description
introduces the purpose of each API he
can click an API to view a more detailed
overview and documentation on how to use
it once he finds an API to use James can
register an application to it with the
application registration feature each
application is assigned a key that
identifies requests from his
applications James wants to create an
application and register the energy API
this will allow him to get an
application key and start using the API
first he logs into the developer portal
and finds the energy API he wants to use
James has been issued grants allowing
him to see the API in the portal and to
request registration to it an API
manager approves the registration after
clicking register James creates a new
application to utilize this API he
specifies the application details and
registers the API the application is
created and the registration status is
pending after the registration request
is approved by an API manager in the
management portal the status of the
energy app changes to active users with
a register grant don't need to go
through the approval process the
application will be active right after
creation now James can you
this API to build his application he can
also easily unregister an API and delete
applications in the developer portal to
learn more visit us online at cloud warm
calm and thanks for watching
