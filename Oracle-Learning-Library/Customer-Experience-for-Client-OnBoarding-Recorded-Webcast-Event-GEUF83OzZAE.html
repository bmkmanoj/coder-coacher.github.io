joining this webcasts this morning today
we're going to be talking about custom
experience for client onboarding most
businesses and organizations will do
some sort of onboarding vid customer
merchant trading partners or even
employees so it's a very common source
of different eyes of business and
different organizations before we start
here's a safe harbor statement that I'd
like you to read
so the agenda for today we'll be looking
at from the business challenges
associated with customer onboarding or
client onboarding and then I'm going to
show you a typical man onboarding
process and some of the issues
associated and then we'll move on to an
example climb on board solution that we
have put together and as a
representation or someone we can
alternate and kind of look at some of
the issues that has been resolved in
this automated solution and then we'll
finish off with some Q&amp;amp;A so why do we
need customer onboarding or why do
customers do or organizations and
businesses one good customer onboarding
strategies ultimately it leads to faster
revenues and profits and enhances your
brand and reputation you know how many
times have we had a choice between
somebody we know and contrast will give
us a good experience or a good service
versus somebody else who might be
slightly cheaper but we might actually
go with them and go with the football
the formal arm latter purely because we
want a decent or good customer
experience and client onboarding is no
different some of the challenges
associated with onboarding is that most
customers now expect a world-class
experience let me give you an example of
Amazon you know they have this prime
delivery service where if you order by a
certain time you will get your goods the
following morning on because they are
consistently delivering on this they
have a world-class experience and a
brand a reputation to go with this at
home we also shop with next directory
and they have this amazing service where
if you if you order something by 10pm
that I'd for they'll have your goods
delivered in the morning so these are
the kind of services and experiences
that most consumers are used to the
other problem that most organizations
have is they want to increase customer
loyalty and retention it's very easy now
to swap and change between service
providers for example the new
legislation that came in from the
banking on the banking side where you
should be able to switch you
count from one provider to America while
within seven days and make it all
seamless as possible so it's very easy
to lose customers now accomplished and
pliant again is a constant thing that
most corporate boards have to worry
about governance is very very important
kyc check which is ignore your customer
and an time ongoing compliance
regulations have to be added you too and
a lot of organizations now have a
pressure where every 6 to 12 months they
have to recheck every single customer
they have with KY c and e inteligentes
ultimately what customers are looking
for organizations are looking for they
want to they want to be the competition
when it comes to service provision so
these are some of the challenges
associated with customer onboarding
let's think about your own experience
imagine if you had filled out an
application form for a car loan or a
mortgage and then the company that you
apply to rings you up and says you're
going to have to come into the office
tomorrow or to their branch to fill out
more paperwork now we're not used to
doing these clinics so that usually
leads to a negative experience or
sentiment towards that organization on
the other hand if you applied for say a
credit card and it unacceptable web
application then if you apply by 3pm
would have your account open by tomorrow
then chances are we're going to go with
something of that sort another important
thing that customers are looking for is
at every stage of the application
process they want to know what the
status is so some application processes
for example mortgage application might
have various different stages that you
have to go through on the initial
application to underwriter approving my
Mead multiple parties involving that
mortgage application from the end users
perspective and each one of these people
might need their credit ratings check
etc but customers require constant
updates on the stakes of news and issues
we might also want to be able to provide
partial
account capabilities because the
customer has has already gone past the
credit rating achil I've seen in the NL
checks and now is the case of just
working out what are the products or
services we can offer them and give them
the flexibility and the ability to
actually have partial service before the
entire process is completed and again if
these are the kind of experiences that
you and I would have had you know we
will constantly be going back to the
same company over and over again so why
is it that a lot of organizations
struggle and to provide a world-class
customer experience well there's
different reasons for that firstly it's
about people a lot of organizations and
businesses now have outsourced functions
so for example a high street bank that I
was recently working with they've
outsourced their anti kyc and en el
cheque to an offshore near shore
reasonable function and this particular
function that they are using is
providing the KYC in AML check for all
of their global offices so the priority
is not there for example for the UK
customers and it sometimes needs to
three or four weeks before they get
responses back mergers and acquisitions
lots of customers over the years have
merged with other organizations and now
the process is partially split between
different people from from the existing
organizations and the acquired
organization process is also a lot of
these processes have been around for the
last 20 years and they haven't been
modernized there's lots of manual
processes in place there's lack of
visibility and insight there's lack of
approvals or interesting system of rules
and are happening within organizations
so the key thing is how can you support
the entire method
is mama tools techniques and methods
differ austin teams it's just not going
to be possible to provide that great
customer experience for client
onboarding i was working with a partner
recently and an orrible apartment and
they were working for an end at customer
which happens to be a hedge fund and
they captured this manual process that
this hedge fund was actually performing
when they unbore did one of their
clients as you can see from this this
numerous different people involved
bottled in process there's lots of
manual steps that are taking place so
for example for the credit checks they
would fill out a form and post it to the
third party provider now even if they
you know sent this form on a Monday the
chances i want a light warmer to mix and
proceed what a goal from the entire
manual process because it's not been
automated again there's different
deadlines that are set so depending on
the type of customer onboarding you know
they've got different essays but a lot
of this information is in the is in the
minds of knowledge workers or in Excel
spreadsheets so ultimately what was
happening was this particular
organization was taking six months to
onboard a customer now in the Amazon
days and the next in the room days you
know this is not something we were like
we will you know agree that is feasible
for the going future so some of the
requirements around customer onboarding
first and foremost is around reducing
cycle times four months two weeks and
days you know we want instant responses
we get promoted to be applied for credit
card you know we want to know almost
straight away whether we've been
successful normally wants to wait around
from an organization perspective and
want to delist the customer engagement
to meet our kyc AML and other compliance
and regulatory requirements we want to
provide a proficient and professional
efficient onboarding process
we also want to autumn it's possible so
for example generating the right kind of
data depending on the request or the
stage of the process so whether it's a
credit agreement or additional
documentation for example a passport
request or a utility bill quest
sanctions and watchlist screening is
very important lots of providers
including oracle provide applications
off the shelf which which will give you
the watch list and sanction list
screening capability but the process
needs to be able to integrate and
interface with this and then we want
visibility and transparency of the
onboarding process another example
another custom example and I've worked
with in the last six months provide the
ATM machines as well as in the retail
shops provided card machines so they do
something called merchant on boarding
now when they are loading these
merchants you know from a merchant's
perspective they want this card device
as quickly as possible so they're
constantly ringing up and asking you
know where's my order has it been
shipped you know etc etc because they
want to start taking credit cards and
debit cards as part in their
transactions so they you need to give us
a provider with visibility and some
transparency of that onboarding process
and then finally we want to we want to
have rules based policies so depending
on the type of customer the demographic
we might provide a separate or
scientific on all the process because
the product and service we're offering
might be different so these are just
some of the requirements around
onboarding so let's look at it from an
Oracle perspective we have this
fantastic modeling tool which will take
your manual processes which has spread
across different cycles different lines
of business geographically spread as
well and turn them into intelligent
processes we provide a very very rich
capability based on standards we provide
things like rules engine policy or
permission real-time decision
integration content management etc
it's a very very easy modeling tool that
the business community together with a
business analyst to model an end-to-end
process and later on I'll give you I'll
show you an example of a typical process
that we can build here this is the this
is the BPM process that you we saw
earlier which was manual and now has
been converted into a very high-level
automated VPN process so what we can see
here is on the left hand side and a
number of different swim lengths and
these different swim lanes represent
different actors or participants of that
process so at the top we have the client
and then we have a shared services
function so this is basically things on
your enterprise service bus that is
available to consume across the
enterprise and then we have the actual
onboarding process itself where a
request comes in and then we've got
exception management this is just very
simple examples and normally in a client
onboarding process you have a lot more
furthermore swim lanes and a lot more
actors depending on the type of
onboarding do well we've got things like
exception handling as well on top of
that you know we have things like where
the knowledge worker will see the kind
of activities they work on a day-to-day
basis and particularly around onboarding
where they need to approve or reject a
particular application we've got
integration capabilities for example to
your backing or banking applications and
then the ability to generate
documentation which unreason integrate
with pretty much any document generation
tool including the Oracle content
management store as well we again
there's lots of capabilities and for the
purposes of this webcast I've only took
as just a very small number and here we
have an example of something called
guide workspace so imagine you have a
call center where you've got a number of
people who are working on on parts of
the process
this particular guiding workspace we've
been the ability to say how much of that
application has been already completed
you know how long they're up there part
of the application process mistake in
terms of sna and what's coming in the
pipeline in terms of the next stages so
they have a complete view for in terms
of you know where this applications bin
and the audit trail their particular
part of the process and then what's
going to happen next and the idea behind
it is like as a single you I where the
knowledge worker has all the information
they need to be able to carry out their
function rather than switching from
screen to screen which is quite common
nowadays in call centers and these kind
of functions multi-channel omni-channel
is actually quite key you know it's very
easy for an individual to start an
application on a smart device like of
like a samsung s4 or ninth one or even
more on ipad and then resurrect that
particular application because they are
partially completed it on a web channel
and so we need to be able to provide a
seamless and consistent experience
across all the different channels which
is quite key to customer experience
again knowledge management is key with
most onboarding processes there will be
some sort of documentation associated
with that will be instant messaging
conversations that I've taken place
internally within the organization which
you want to capture against that
particular application and if you've
created a case for example against that
case you want to be able to attach
emails if there's been conversations
that have been hard between the end
customer and the organization itself so
you sure you've got every single bit of
that information captured and then
available to the noise water so when the
customer calls in they have complete
view of all the interactions with our
end customer on top of that supervisors
and team leaders they want to be able to
see you know if they're hitting their
essays you know how long a process is
take to complete from a business
perspective we want to see how many
applications we are receiving and where
they're coming from the demographics
the values of these applications so we
can make decisions based on this insight
and be agile at the same time so the
first of the session was just talking
about client onboarding the reason why
customers want to do client onboarding
and provide a great experience in terms
of customer retention loyalty and profit
and then I then I talked about some of
the challenges associated with providing
a custom experience that people are
looking for nowadays we now I'm going to
move you on to a very quick demo where
we are showing you certain an experience
from a customer's perspective and the
different interactions across different
channels and then talk about how oracle
brings additional value to the customer
experience process
you
so the in this particular case we have a
fish's company called a linear they are
financial services organization and they
provide various different products but
we also have a fictitious user called
John Smith John is looking for a
particular savings account product so
typically like most users he was going
to Google and he will tighten as a
search request or inciting agreeing best
savings account and then when once he
hits the search button he'll get a list
of results and one of the results would
inform alamia which is which provides
this particular product so what we do is
we take the search query itself in this
case the savings account and when we are
when the customers or john smith is
redirected to the anime portal we make
sure we provide the right landing page
and direct me to the product that this
particular person was looking for in
terms of their savings account rather
than taking them from you know us very
first standard very standard page and
so here what we're doing is John Smith
basically is looking for a product and
typically like most people who are on or
on the social platforms either want to
share with their friends make
recommendations or actually asked for
recommendations from their friends and
followers in this case what's happened
is John Smith has gone on to Twitter and
putting a treat to his friends and
asking if anybody had any experience
with a linear financial services or any
other product they can recommend now
behind the scenes alamia have a social
listening tool from oracle called Oracle
social relationship management and this
particular tool is looking or listening
from all the different social channels
so Facebook LinkedIn Twitter etc etc and
it's looking for certain keywords to
understand sentiment you know whether
it's positive or negative so here behind
the scenes what I'm showing you here is
an end of a person from alamia we're
listening on the social channels just
trying to understand what people are
saying or organization was saying anania
so we're looking for things like
advertising and loyalty and general
sentiment and what people are saying
about other competitors of ours as well
so not only are we monitoring what
people are saying about allomere but in
this case we're also looking at what
people's in barca Standard Chartered
because we want to understand where our
competition is basically heading in
terms of central analysis so what
happens is we pick up that to eat for
John Smith and he's looking for a
particular product and somebody from the
bank will now respond to John and
provide him with additional information
would regard to that particular product
that he's looking for so again from a
customer experience perspective the
first thing we did was we made sure that
a landing page on the website correctly
took John Smith to the appropriate
product page he
wasn't satisfied so he went to the
social platform and started tweeting so
we captured that tweet and we responded
and made a recommendation to him at the
same time so John is satisfied now and
he clicks on the particular product is
looking for he starts filling in the
details of his application that the
first of all that the enemy requires
clicks on the usual things like he
agrees to the terminal condition and
messages from Avon now what happened in
this stage is that the BPM process has
now been kicked off this bgm process is
the one that I showed you very quickly
in charge take back to
which is this one here
you
so here we can see that the person has
actually moved from the application
process itself and now is moved across
these different activities and now we're
waiting on the customer to give us some
more information
so what will happen is once that submit
button has been pressed a notification
will be sent to a John Smith to say we
received your application we now require
additional information can you please
applaud your passport and intelligible
so John Smith has also been given a
username and password he will login to
the actual allomere website and then he
will applaud his documentation that has
been requested as potent onboarding
process so we have the capability here
to take documentation rather than send
the post and just upload it directly
onto the website what's happening is the
VPN process is now waiting for this as
soon as these documentation have been
received that VPN process will continue
on to the next stages of the process
so the neck
processes we have a knowledge worker
called Jane Austen Jane Austen's did
their function is looking at onboarding
of customers for a particular product in
this case the best savings account and
she's going to try and resolve any
issues and if there's any documentation
that has been requested from customers
she will basically do the full before to
eyeball check and then either approve it
or rejected so now let's take a quick
look at what she does so she logs in to
her back office application
and then he or she gets a front end or
an hour basically a portal page where
she's got different budgets she sees in
the inbox that there is a request from
John Smith and it's the passport on
utility check so she clicks on the
actual information and she
cross-references it with the actual
application itself at this point you can
look at the history and she decides to
approve that particular process now
what's happened is James completed hub
or a part of the process the next stages
we have a relationship manager and
because the process has identified that
this is a high binding customer and a
relationship manager needs to be
assigned this potential opportunities
here to cross-sell and upsell so the
process started from John Smith we
requested some information from John
jane austen then verify that information
and now the relationship manager will
see the application from John Smith now
typically in him in his inbox he might
be servicing 30 or 40 different clients
so he can see you again from from this
London from this portal people from his
team any documentation associated and in
this case you can see that there's a
verified account type for this customer
and the reason for that is because he's
a high by custom on the relationship
manager is now going to call John Smith
and then capture that conversation in a
comment and provide ask John if he's
interested in another type of product in
this case is so made a product of gold
silver platinum a bronze so the
conversation is captured here if there
was CGI telephony integration will be
able to catch up a conversation and
associate it with this particular
application itself as well so we've got
every interaction without customer
captured so anybody wants to go back at
any time it's available to them so John
basically receives an email to say we've
approved your application here's a terms
and condition form that we like to sign
this could have been very easily
something that we could have done online
where we can just destroy him the terms
and conditions and then you can sign in
same density but in this particular
scenario we decided to just upload the
document so what happen now is John as
applauded the document is signed the tax
commission and then the process
continued and the process then generated
the documentation in the in this case
the Welcome tagged the account number
integrated with the backend core banking
application and and sent all the
relevant information to jump so that's
the first second and third part of the
journey where we have John jane austen
and james cooper the relationship ones
are now at the same time the business
ones that understand because we want to
increase loyalty one increase profits
and we want to make sure that we're
providing a world-class service we want
to complete visibility of the onboarding
process so here what I've done is I've
put together an Endeca information
discovery onboarding dashboard
specifically we focused around the
onboarding process so here we can see
different things that that's happening
that we're capturing real time into this
process or we've got things like
demographic information so rare these
customers are coming from the number of
new clients the number of people who
reported issues that in this case is a
dollar value we've got other things like
social conversations that are going on
that people are talking about now we're
taking from the monitoring service live
conversation chats between for example
the call center agent and john smith on
the actual website but also internal
conversations so it's it's a very very
deep and comprehensive their information
that the business and other client
owners or the business owners of this
process use to determine whether we're
being successful in our onboarding
process a lot so as you can see this
dashboards there's KPIs there's drill
downs and again very feature-rich and
the idea behind it is is simple is the
gift that the business as much
information as possible
so that's the end of our client
onboarding process fudges
I could be moved back to our
process the chest just like to point out
what we saw earlier so here we see that
the process started here we then sent
some documentation for a customer to
then respond to and then we had that all
called a real-time decision call out to
your aid another application to give the
relationship manager what are the
products we can cross them an upset
finally sent welcome back out and
integrating the back in application so
if I just move this back to where we
were so I've just completed the demo and
and any questions on my equal
opportunity now to take okay so we have
one question here somebody is asking the
manual process that I showed earlier on
Borgore partner how long did it take for
them to implement the automated BTM
process very good question in this
particular case actually the hedge fund
was was very small outfit and
nevertheless it took six months to
actually implement it train the staff
connect to third parties do all the
training etc etc so from from from
beginning to end the actual process for
six months the build effort was probably
no more than two months but then there
was lots of other things from
documentation etc etc
another question here is around mobile
how would this process interact with
mobile device from a mobile application
perspective again a very good question
and Oracle provides a very good mobile
capability whereby in this particular
scenario what we would do is we would
provide a single interface to all up to
that BPM process exposed wire the Oracle
Service bus and then we can provide
virtualized services to any consumer and
that could be a mobile device which is
calling out to a rest service which is
then calling out to the BBM process if
it's a web channel it could be a stroke
or HTTP sub call for example basically
we provide a very rich in ability
configuration perspective so we can
provide the omni-channel multi-channel
capability that you're looking for and
because our process provides end-to-end
visibility across all of the different
interaction points manual or from people
related to applications the person or
the knowledge worker can see every
single thing that's going on
any more questions
so normal questions and they have a mini
couple more seconds
okay no more questions so like to thank
everyone today for their time and I hope
it was useful this particular video will
be recorded and it will upload to our
YouTube channel thank you very much and
