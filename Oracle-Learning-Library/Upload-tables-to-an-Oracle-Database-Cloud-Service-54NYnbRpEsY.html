tables from an on-premise database to an
Oracle database cloud service okay so
from sequel developer what you want to
do is add a cloud connection you can do
that with this cloud connections right
hand click new cloud connection so you
can see here's some details we're going
to need to add to make that connection
to your Oracle database cloud service so
let's return to the database service
there's details here we need click on
that database details link what we need
to know is the SFTP details and the URL
for the service ok so let's go back to
sequel developer real quick so user name
I'm gonna use here it's gonna be my
username for logging into the Oracle
database cloud service so I have a test
username here URL I need it's going to
be for the service itself which is right
here okay so remember this is your
details the overview tab for your
database service this is the hostname so
I'm going to go ahead and copy that go
back to sequel developer enter that here
and then the next thing I need is SFTP
user name and house names which we can
also get from the overview tab right
here service SFTP details okay so here's
the host name I'll go ahead and copy
that enter that here
and then use her name copy that
I said here and if you didn't notice the
port number was 22 in this instance I'll
go ahead and change that to 22 and then
when you're ready click OK to establish
that connection okay and when you first
click on that connection it's gonna
prompt you for your credentials so go
ahead and enter those here just like you
would connect to your service you can
see it's loading there you go
so here's gonna be various tables from
my database service listed right here so
you can always disconnect or delete from
there what I want to point out to you
next is so let's say you have an
on-premise database that you want to
upload tables from to your cloud service
so you can do that using data upload
cart so we can get to that from right
here a view menu cart that opens this up
and then what would you do is you
establish connection to your database
and once you've established connection
to your database alright go ahead and
click on that enter the details for your
database and connect ok and I'm going to
take the project's table and a few
others and drag that to my cart once I
have my tables in the cart I will click
on deploy cloud provide a title and
click apply and give it some time to
deploy to the cloud
and just like that my tables from my on
premise database are now deployed to my
Oracle cloud database service you can
now go back to your Oracle cloud
database service and verify that your
tables are uploaded and available that
concludes this demo on how to upload
database tables from your on-premise
database to your Oracle database cloud
service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
