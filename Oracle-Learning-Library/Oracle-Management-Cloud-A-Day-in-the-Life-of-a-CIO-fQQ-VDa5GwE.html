international consumer product
manufacturing company with over 100,000
employees she woke up at 6 a.m. with an
alert about missing data from overnight
batches
then she got a call about wholesaler
discounts being applied incorrectly and
then learned that the website is having
a major performance issue her crack
triage team has already assembled in the
war room feverishly trying to gather the
relevant information from the 20
different monitoring tools they use
across the stack but no one seems to
know what's going on
she already needs more coffee and won't
have enough time to prepare for the
infrastructure purchases budget meeting
at 10:00 sound familiar the sherrif's
company is Sarah's biggest competitor
and his day is going very differently
this morning Sharif didn't have any
early morning alerts when a company
experienced a massive web performance
degradation because their management
system was able to identify a failed
configuration change it automatically
rolled back taking care of the
performance issue and he got an email
explaining why there was a problem and
what was done to prevent an emergency
the quarterly financial reporting used
to be full of problems but now Charice
analyst allocate enough capacity by
analyzing the previous quarters
financial reporting runs and rebalancing
resources to eliminate contention they
used to see every quarter he finally
gets an alert on his mobile about the
missing inventory data from some stores
a quick look at the logs showed that
some store managers failed to run their
nightly reports no panic he arranges for
those store managers to run the
necessary reports since Sharif didn't
have to spend time convening and
reconvening war rooms he has plenty of
time to prepare for his quarterly budget
review he made sure to include the chart
to demonstrate some monthly cadence of
the financial and store inventory
application to justify the need for more
batch processing capacity with his extra
time he goes and gets a cappuccino how
is it possible that Sharif's day went so
differently from Sarah's it's because
he's using Oracle Management Cloud or
LMC for short a suite of next-generation
integrated monitoring management and
analytics solution delivered as a
service on Oracle cloud ONC leverages
machine learning and big data techniques
across the entire operational data set
with ONC Sharif's team has access to all
the data they need when they need
eliminating war room fire drills and
since OMC automatically flagged
anomalies that Shree steam might not
have known about potential problems can
be corrected before they ever happen
when to increase IT stability prevent
outages and encourage agile devops
discover the power of operational data
