adoption rate of your mobile apps Oracle
mobile cloud service analytics and
reporting tools can help you see how
well your apps are doing in the
marketplace as a mobile program manager
how do you know if your mobile strategy
is working how do you capitalize on
patterns of success or find out what's
failing with Oracle mobile cloud service
all the right data is at your fingertips
to ensure your mobile strategy succeeds
Oracle mobile cloud service provides all
the services your mobile app needs
including storage push notifications and
custom code services and ap is all
protected by enterprise grade security
making mobile app development quicker
and easier suppose you work for an
appliance repair company called fix it
fast your mobile developers created an
app using Oracle mobile cloud service so
your customers can report problems and
schedule in-home repair appointments and
get their issues fixed fast now that
you've rolled out the new app how you
know it's working as expected let's look
at the apps live analytics you'll want
to know the adoption rate for new users
new user signups have increased
dramatically in the last week and active
users are steadily increasing during
this period as well but you'll want to
make sure the added users won't slow
down the system the API response time is
well within acceptable limits the system
is scaling as anticipated they loaded
the app but are they really using it
looks like the session count went up
proportionally to the number of new
users it's safe to conclude that they're
using the app once they downloaded it
now when they have the app opened you'll
want to know how long they stay engaged
session duration numbers reveal they've
spent a healthy amount of time using the
app an important event to track is when
the customer makes a repair request the
incident reports business event shows
customers are indeed using the app to
report problems and
call for help business events
automatically include properties like
operating system and device manufacturer
as well as any custom properties you use
to capture details about an event
occurrence your app was launched on the
iOS platform a little later than on
Android let's see whether that makes any
difference in the incident reports the
results for both platforms look similar
it appears both versions of the app are
being properly utilized fix it fast
recently started operations in several
new states you can use the group
function to view data at different
locations looks like California has more
incidents than any other states wonder
why let's investigate by drilling down
using filters to see which models are
repaired most often air conditioners it
must be the recent hot weather in
California the app offers access to a
knowledge base for users to research
problems want to know if it will convert
readers into customers the funnel shows
a high conversion rate of users who
access the knowledge base and eventually
called the repair service a number of
useful reports let you see how long your
users are spending with your app what
services they're using and how they're
performing this information is
invaluable for understanding the
effectiveness of your mobile apps and
for refining your mobile strategy Oracle
mobile cloud service analytics gathers
and displays up-to-date information
about your mobile apps you can find
additional information in the Oracle
health application Oracle Learning
