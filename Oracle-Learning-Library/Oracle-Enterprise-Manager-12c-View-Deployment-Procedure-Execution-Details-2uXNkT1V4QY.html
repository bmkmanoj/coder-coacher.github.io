all deployment procedures that are
scheduled executing or completed can be
tracked from the procedure activity page
to access this page go to the menu
Enterprise provisioning and patching
procedure activity to view details of a
procedure click on the procedure from
the procedure activity page in this case
we'll choose a deployment procedure with
the failed status this is the new and
improved procedure execution tracking
page there are five key regions on this
page first the breadcrumb and the name
second view data third the procedure
summary fourth procedure steps and fifth
step details the breadcrumb allows you
to go back to the procedure activity
page so you can access a different
procedure and view its details the name
of the procedure is displayed next to
the procedure activity label the view
data region allows you to refresh this
page manually or select an interval for
auto refresh the procedure summary
region is collapsed by default it shows
the the amount of time it takes to
complete the procedure and also the
various actions that are available for a
user to take the list of actions that
are enabled depends upon the current
state of the procedure expand the
procedure summary region to view
additional details like the name of the
procedure the name of the run owner
status execution ID etc
the procedure steps region displays all
the steps that are executed to complete
the deployment procedure to select a
step check one of the check boxes from
under the Select column by default the
step name its type and the status of the
step is displayed to view all the steps
go to the View menu and select expand
all the region on the right hand side
labeled step details provides a stacked
view of all steps
let us select a couple of steps from
this region as seen based on the order
of the steps on the left hand side the
step details are visible on the right
and they are stacked one over the other
you can scroll through this region to
look at all the details to close a
region click on the close button the
region for every step provides some
basic details like the type of the step
the time it takes to complete them start
and complete a date and the actions
taken by the step by default no output
is displayed for successful steps to
view the complete output click on the
step output button this opens up a
region that displays all the output that
was captured as part of this step the
Actions menu provides all the actions
that are applicable to this step again
the list of actions available on the
step depend on the status of the step in
this case since the step was
successfully executed no options are
available most users manage by exception
this means their primary interest is to
view failed steps to do this you can
either scroll through the list of all
the steps and select the failed step or
you can go to the view
new select filters and fail status to
only view the failed steps right click
and choose expand all below this will
show all the steps that have the status
field select the step that interests you
on the right-hand side all details of
the step are displayed again we see the
type and the elapsed time and also the
various actions that are taken as part
of this step since this is a directive
step there are multiple sub steps that
are performed you will notice that since
this is a fail step interesting bits of
the output are recorded here for viewing
you can easily detect that for this step
there was an issue with this space and
hence there was a failure to see the
complete log again click on the step
output here you will see all the output
that was logged for this step and you
can scroll through it for more details
if we open the Actions menu multiple
options are now available since this is
a disk space issue we can always fix the
problem and retry the step we can also
update and retry update and retry will
show you all the inputs that have been
provided for this step this dialog will
allow you to modify some of these
parameters if required and reacts acute
this step another option is to download
the log this is interesting if you need
to send the log to Oracle support or one
of your colleagues for further triage
click on the download button to either
save this file to your desktop or to
open it in your favorite text reader
click OK to view the file details
finally for issues related with
Enterprise Manager 12c all the
deployment procedure itself
trigger an incident to trigger an
incident go to the procedure Actions
menu and select incident an incident
once triggers generates multiple logs
these logs can then be packaged as part
of the package creation workflow from
the support workbench an incident
package is typically uploaded with the
SR or is handed over to Oracle support
directly this concludes the demo on
viewing the details for a deployment
procedure execution thank you for
