provides an agent feature that allows
SAS applications to integrate with
on-premises applications such as Oracle
e-business suite Oracle database and s
AP with the agent you don't need to open
up inbound ports on the firewall and
expose private soap based Web Services
this eliminates common security and
complexity issues associated with
integrating on-premises applications
from outside the firewall the agent
framework primarily consists of a SAS
agent that runs an Oracle ICS and the
on-premises connectivity agent that runs
behind the firewall within the customers
data center where the on-premises
applications reside the SAS agent is a
built-in component in ICS however you
are responsible for downloading and
installing the on-premises connectivity
agent in your on-premises environment
let's take a look at how to install and
use an on-premises agent for outbound
integration with on-premises
applications before installing the
on-premises agent I need to create an
agent group think of an agent group as a
cluster of agents that can work as a
group to process messages every agent
needs to be associated with an agent
group identifier when creating a new
agent group I provide a meaningful name
and accept the default values for
identifiers an agent type note that the
default identifier value is the agent
group name I entered but in uppercase
the identifier value can be changed but
the agent type cannot be changed
agent groups that contain multiple
agents provide load distribution and
high availability you can have multiple
agent groups for functional
categorization
once the agent group is created I need
to download the connectivity agent
installer and install it in the same
subnet as the on-premises applications
on the machine where the binary agent
was downloaded I unzipped the installer
file and changed the file permissions to
be executable one thing I want to
mention here before running the agent
installer
is that I need to have JRE version 1.7
or higher pre-installed on the
on-premises host machine and included in
the path now I execute the installer
file with these properties - age
specifies the ICS hostname and port - u
specifies the ICS username - P specifies
the password and - ad specifies the
agent group identifier that was
generated when I created the agent group
besides these required properties there
are some optional ones for example if
your on-premises host includes a proxy
server you can use - pH to specify the
outbound proxy hostname and - PP for the
proxy host port during installation
Oracle WebLogic server is installed the
on-premises agent is deployed and all on
premises adapters are registered once
installation is complete an agent
instance is created for interacting with
the Oracle integration cloud service I
verify that the agent instance was
created by going to the agent groups
page and I can see here that the agent
count was increased by one on the ICS
instance I create a connection to access
my on-premises applications with this
newly created agent group the process of
doing this is very similar to creating a
regular connection the difference is
that I need to select the agent group
for accessing on-premises applications
in addition to specifying the wisdom you
are l and security policy and
credentials here I provide connectivity
and security details as I do when
creating a regular connection using
agents I can easily and quickly
integrate SAS applications with
on-premises applications without
introducing any security concerns
