to show you how to scale an Oracle Java
cloud service instance
from the topology page I can scale out
an instance by adding a node which is a
virtual machine running a managed server
in a cluster
it might take a few moments for the new
node to appear in the cluster topology
so I'll refresh the screen until it does
the status field on the line item
indicates the current stage of the scale
out process and on the topology tile the
note count is increased by one if I want
I can drill down to monitor the scale
out process in more detail
here I can view the scale out stages as
they occur
you
when the scale out is complete the
status field disappears from the line
item replaced by information about
storage allocated to the new note also
the elapsed time for the scale out
attempt appears in the scaling activity
section of the console this information
tells me that I successfully scaled out
the instance now I'm going to remove the
node or scale in the instance nodes
removed by using the topology page
before attempting to scale in be aware
that I can only remove manage servers I
cannot remove the administration server
or load balancer
you
selecting remove node causes a graceful
scale in process the preferred method of
removing a node I would select force
remove only if the vm or managed server
were not responsive in that case I would
need to shut them down as soon as
possible but I don't need to do that now
this launches the scale in process
we can refresh the screen until a new
line item indicating that a scale in is
in progress appears in the scaling
activity section
it will take a few moments for the node
to disappear from the cluster topology
when the node disappears the topology
tile indicates that the number of nodes
is decreased by one I have successfully
scaled in the instance in this video I
showed you how to scale an Oracle Java
cloud service instance you can find more
information about this subject and all
other aspects of Oracle Java cloud
service at the following sites thank you
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
