for Oracle server technologies in this
video we'll take a look at auditing
Oracle database vault of C in unified
mode and we'll go through the steps
outlined on this slide Oracle Database
12c introduces the unified audit trail
in which the various Oracle database
audit trails such as the standard one
the fine-grained and so on they are all
consolidated into one audit trail having
the various audit trails in one location
you have a centralized view of them in a
consistent and uniform format which
makes your life easier
it makes it easier for you to run
analysis reports for the database world
audit records you have a choice you see
here by the sequel banner and this
database options that unified auditing
is enabled and of course that the
database is up and running if you choose
to use unified auditing then Oracle
database vault records are stored in a
table in the odd system not in the
database vault audit underscore trailer
table as in previous versions
by default the Otsu schema is not
protected by Ariana rearm is not really
necessary because the information is
internal and cannot be viewed the same
way that you can view other database
objects but to protect the unified audit
trail you can create a rearm around the
audit admin and audit viewer roles this
way you can control who can grant these
roles in the background we executed some
configuration commands confirm that you
understand the result so in the first
row here the sec admin user deleted an
object called each a mandatory rearm and
then second rearm was deleted and then
he in the third row you see that the
rearm was created again and then an OP
Jek edit to the rihanna you see in the
last column that the return code is
always zero so that means all actions
were successful let's attempt to create
a rearm as a user who is not authorized
for this activity you see here that you
get the insufficient privilege error if
you execute the same query you see no
changes in the result this is because
the diva dollar configuration audit view
provides rules for successful
configuration changes that emitter
realms rules rule set factors and other
Oracle database world policy
configuration activities but can the
unsuccessful event be seen elsewhere
when you clear with the diva dollar
enforcement audit view you do not see
this attempt this view provides
information about enforcement related
audits for example when users violate
database world policies let's create and
an evil an audit policy and then we
create a violation the HR schema user is
attempting to select from a table in a
mandatory realm without being included
in that rearm and receives correctly the
insufficient privileges error to
summarize the violations are only
recorded if an enabled audit policy
audits the Oracle database fault
component in this example the component
is the DV rearm violation when you're
curious which policies are enabled then
you can execute a command like this one
and see the one that we just created as
well as a predefined one if you wish to
drop an audit policy you first need to
disable it with no audit command and
then it can be dropped here you see a
statement which determines the length of
the audit trail if you get a count of
zero rows but you know that there are
audit records in the unified trail then
you can use the flash unified or the
trial procedure to write them from
memory to disk
it is best practice to periodically
archive and purge your auditor trail
with our test data here we just purge it
this procedure is the same as in earlier
releases but there is a new audit trail
unified type this slide summarizes the
steps of this video and for more details
you can see the Oracle product
documentation or attend training courses
