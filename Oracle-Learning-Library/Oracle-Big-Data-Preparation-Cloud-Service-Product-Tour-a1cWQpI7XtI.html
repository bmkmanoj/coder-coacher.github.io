service provides an easy to use and
convenient user interface the home page
gives me a summary of the number of jobs
running in the service with their
current status the number of sources
created and their usage and the total
number of rows and transformations
processed by the service these
statistics can be viewed by a day week

displays a report showing the complete
details about all jobs I can filter the
