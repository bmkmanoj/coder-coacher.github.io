JSON data in Oracle no sequel database
to will server-side application Angela
would need to model and date data and
design an optimized queries over the
sample or test data stored an Oracle no
sequel database to meet the requirements
we saw previously to do that firstly she
identified sample data for three dummy
candidates namely John Smith
artha Krishnan and Jerry Simmons apart
from the usual information such as the
first name last name and date of birth
and few other fields which are common
across all candidates John Smith has
three degrees with detailed information
such as start date end date degree name
and activities whereas Arthur Krishnan
has two degrees with same details and
Jerry Simmons has only one further John
Smith has around 16 skills with
endorsement details
whereas Artie has only three skill sets
and jerry simmons has eight in this kind
of a scenario you see that Angela does
not have a set schema and has user
records with varying data therefore
modeling this kind of data in a
conventional approach is very cumbersome
and is hard to maintain
so Angela chooses to store the user
profile data in Oracle no sequel
database using the JSON data type using
JSON format not only helps Angela to
model the complex user profile easily
but will also further help her evolve
the data model for future needs with the
JSON data type she creates a table
called candidates table which has two
columns DUID
and the kandi Jason calm the UID is the
primary key used uniquely to identify a
record and the candidate Jason column
holds all professional details related
to the candidate within a single Jason
column let us look at how John Smith's
data is modeled in the candid Jason
column we see the general information of
John Smith is recorded under profile
where as educational details are stored
in another nested jason of
named education employment details such
as the company for which his work the
tenure of work short description of his
job profile are recorded under profile
along with the skills acquired and the
years of experience with each skill
listed under skills likewise angela has
modeled arti Krishnan and Gerry Simmons
data though arti has only three skill
sets when compared to John her data is
modeled in same manner as that of Jones
now let's look at the Candide JSON the
Java file this is a program that angela
has put in place to create the tables
and insert country data in this file you
see that the program will connect to the
Oracle nodes equal database cluster
named KB store using the default host
5000 and then the program creates the
kind dates table using these lines of
code as discussed previously the
candidates table has only two columns
UID and candidate Jason if we scroll
down we see that after creating the
table the program creates the necessary
indexes within the JSON data to speed up
data retrieval for certain queries at
the end the program lost the data into
the Oracle no sequel database by calling
the load table method Angela executes
this Java program to create an lured
candidate details to the Oracle no
sequel database
you
after running the Java program she
verifies the table and the indexes are
successfully created
now angela has modeled the sample data
created the necessary indexes and has
loaded the data into the Oracle no
sequel database the setup is ready for
Angela to design queries as a candidate
and as a recruiter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
