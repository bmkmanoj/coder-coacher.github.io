cloud service I can use the monitoring
dashboard to find errors and track
predefined payload fields
the dashboard shows the following
information about how my running
integrations are processing messages how
many messages have been processed how
many errors have occurred the success
rate and how long the messages are
taking to process the monitoring
dashboard also shows me the Activity
Stream of my running integrations
including details about successful
responses received from the target
application successful responses sent to
the source application and target
application invocations from the
dashboard I can drill down to get more
detailed information about errors and
performance I can view errors by
integration or by connection and I can
drill down further to see more detailed
information
I can also use business identifiers to
track the status of predefined payload
fields when I designed my integration I
defined a business identifier for this
field to track it the requests that
failed is shown in red and I can
conveniently view the text of the error
message I can also view an audit trail
of activity that led up to the error
condition and I can cancel a message and
market aborted this allows me to change
the execution environment and then see
if the problem persists
lastly I can display the list of
business identifiers that I defined for
this integration in this case there is
only one but I can define up to three
business identifiers as when I create an
integration
