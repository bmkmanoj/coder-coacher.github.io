you how to compare guidelines using the
oracle document editor this is part of
the oracle solar suite for healthcare
integration solution here we're on the
start page of the document editor we're
going to use the migrator to compare a
guide line we created earlier to a
standard guide line so let's open the
migrator first we'll select the standard
guideline we'll leave the default of
from the database checked we want to
compare an hl7 guideline and we'll
navigate down to the transaction
standard we'll expand this one and
select this standard and now we'll go to
the next page now we'll select our
guideline that we earlier created with
the document editor so we'll select from
a guide line file and here's our guide
line note that the migrator only
supports dot ECS files go to the next
page will leave comparison options at
the default to ignore whitespace to
always show the differences between
nodes and to compare nearly all
properties except for notes and on to
the next page we'll also leave the
defaults for migration options and match
options now we're ready to run the
comparison so let's finish and here we
can view the differences between the
standard guide line on the left and our
guide line on the right
these red icons indicate where the
differences are so let's take a look at
a couple of these here we can see this
we're segment has been excluded in our
guideline and also if we expand this
patient result and follow the red icons
down we can see these new zlr segments
that were added
so the migrator shows differences
between guidelines in this visual way so
you can decide what if any of the
differences should be applied
now let's produce a report of our
comparison and you can see all the
different publishing options in this
case we'll choose HTML let's give it a
name
and we'll finish now let's open the
report and here you can see a summary of
the changes made in our guideline so
that's it for comparing guidelines in
the oracle document editor for more
