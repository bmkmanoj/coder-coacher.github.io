incorporated wants to automate their
employee profile creation process this
means they need to integrate employee
information with their on-premise Oracle
e-business suite through a rest call
they chose an Oracle integration cloud
service or ICS as their strategic
platform with the connectivity agent ICS
enables the integration to the
on-premise application without punching
a hole in your firewall now let's take a
look at how you can build this
integration using ICS quickly and
without any coding there are four steps
to complete this integration first
create connections for rest and EBS
second create an integration between
these two connections third configure
data mappings for this integration last
after activating the integration monitor
transactions through the dashboard let's
get started with the connections first
create the connection for the rest call
specify a name for the connection
configure the rest URL in the connection
properties field and set up the
credentials we're done next create the
EBS connection using a similar approach
let's move on to the integration choose
the map my data integration style to
send the requested data from the rest
call to e-business suite on the right is
a list of SAS and on-premise connections
we've created previously
since the employee information is sent
from rest to e-business suite drag and
drop the rest connection to the source
section of the integration labelled drag
and drop a trigger for the rest endpoint
to find both the request and the
response in JSON format next configure
the target of this integration ebusiness
suite for the web service configuration
set product family to Human Resources
suite select the human resource product
enter employee in the API field
and select the HR employee API then
select the create employee method of the
HR employee API is the operation and
finish the configuration the next step
is to create the data mappings between
these two endpoints the mappings for
this example are very straightforward
and that the JSON was derived from the
EBS input and output parameters to
ensure end-to-end visibility let's
configure the tracking identifier for
this integration flow why do this if a
profile creation failed or if EBS was
down for maintenance the operation
manager may want to search the
transactions based on the employees last
name or the hiring date to identify
which transactions aren't processed you
can also use this identifier to search
for transactions on the monitoring
dashboard the integration is complete we
haven't written a line of code or worked
on an XML schema XSLT or other artifact
activate the flow in one click the
application is ready for testing from
the information tab find the endpoint
URL open a rest test client provide all
the necessary details from the endpoint
URL and test the application login to
the EBS console as the HR user and
search for your demo user Joseph by the
last name demo the result is consistent
with the request also this instance
appears on the tracking page of the
monitoring section in ICS immediately
for more details and step-by-step
instruction on how to configure this
integration check out the round trip
