purchase orders leaving my attention I'm
going to quickly review those I select

are the purchase orders that were
mentioned in my staff meeting the other
day I can simply review each purchase
order that requires my attention and
whether they should be approved or
rejected I'll select the first purchase

the items being procured I tap on the
line to view the requested date the
total amount and the supplier I can
expand on the order number to view more
detailed supplier information as well as
the ship to location from here I can
scroll through all the purchase order
detail lines to ensure that the items
that are being purchased are correct as
I scroll through I can review quantities
and the order price for each item that
is awaiting approval on this purchase
order I've decided that I want to view
more information related to the
motherboards

review the request to date the line type
the branch plant and the transaction
date I can also enter a comment if I
desire as I scroll through the order I
can see that this purchase order is also
requesting connectors hard drives and
USB point ports I don't know the purpose
of this purchase order so I'm going to
reject the order and enter a mark
victory remark I simply click the reject
button and enter literally mark into the
mark field after I enter my remark I can
click done and then confirm my rejection
the system then takes me to the next
order awaiting my approval I can go back
and review the orders or I can go back
