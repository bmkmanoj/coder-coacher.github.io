of the three weekly lessons about oracle
jet in this part we focus on jet special
support for the packaging and deployment
of jet applications as with the other
key aspects of jet there is an entire
chapter in the Oracle JDeveloper guide
dedicated to this topic the topic can be
split into two sections firstly focusing
on web applications which should run in
the browser and secondly on hybrid
mobile applications that should be
deployed to App Store's
such as for Android or iOS minification
is a process and whereby the files
within an application are reduced to
their absolute bare minimum for example
comments and white spaces which are not
needed for execution are simply removed
minification can be automated so that
you don't have to manually do it
yourself it reduces file sizes by about
30 to 80 percent and it also helps in
the sense that the download time for
users will be faster and that bandwidth
consumption will be reduced when you
look in your Oracle jet developers guide
you will see that there are commands for
doing exactly this the build release
command is a very important command at
this stage of the jet development
process this is where minification takes
place automatically for you thanks to
the jet support for grunt that is simply
built into jets via the oracle jet
command-line interface at the end of
your build release process take a look
in your web folder you've seen the web
folder before in the previous part of
this course however this time because
you've used the build release command
you will see that your files have
automatically been minimized for you the
white space and the comments have been
removed and you will see that your java
script takes up one single line within
each of your files what you will also
notice is that the build release command
will replace the development version of
the libraries that you have been using
with the minified versions were
available
again the jet developer guide is really
the place to go for full information on
this topic the build release command as
you can see is extremely helpful and
necessary at the end of your jet
development process because it prepares
the application for deployment to your
users in an optimal optimized format
next you will want to make sure that the
application still works once it has been
minified for that reason there is the
serve release command this command
serves up the application from your
WebRunner using the minified files that
have been created for you by the build
release command make sure that you run
this just to check that everything still
works as expected and that minification
is completed correctly in this part of
the course we have explored the topic of
packaging and deployment of jet
applications once you have used the
build release and the serve release
commands you are ready to place the
application in the place where you want
to deploy it for example on your web
server or in the App Store for your
homework for this part take one of the
jet applications that you've been
working on over the past few days and
use the build release and the server
list commands to see what happens look
at the minified files and serve up the
application to see if everything still
works correctly and with that as always
thank you for participating in the
course on jet and we look forward to
seeing you in the very final part where
we will wrap up the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
