sites is your site unable to track
visitors now you can with Web Center
sites usually 85% of visitors to your
site are not registered they come from
social media sources or different email
campaigns like LDAP and Eloqua targeting
and providing personalized content for
visitors gets challenging now with
visitor services you can monitor their
behavior and profile configuration but
how does this work here's how a site
visitor logs in as a guest to your site
through their social media ID visitor
services checks the ID across multiple
databases like LDAP and Eloqua until it
finds the matching user if the ID
matches the site visitor is added as a
user and visitor services provides
content based on the profile
configuration if no matches are found
the site visitors behavior is monitored
enabling visitor services to serve the
right content now let's have a look at
how you can configure this option for
your site when you log into web Center
sites and access the admin user
interface there are several options
under the visitor admin node each option
comes with default instances instances
are predefined parameters that you can
configure to use visitor services
identity providers help identify site
visitors for example if a site visitor
has already logged into his or her
Eloqua account their identity will
include the profile provider name and
his or her unique ID specified in the
Eloqua database identity provider comes
with two default instances the first is
Oracle access manager identity provider
which enables visitor services to
communicate with OAM the second is
sample identity provider which contains
predefined properties that can be
further customized you can edit the
instance and the identity providers list
and configure them you can also inspect
edit save approve or delete the identity
provider after configuring the identity
provider enable the option from the
identity providers list
you
if the site visitors ID matches with a
users ID in the profile provider
database complete information is shared
to the local database to enable this you
can either add a new profile provider or
customize the existing ones from the
profile providers list modify the
implementation by adding jar files and
other configurations along with an
enrichment rule enrichment rules enable
the system to identify a site visitor
across multiple profile providers for
example let's take a look at the
enrichment rule in the Eloqua profile
provider if the rule is set as email
equal to LDAP profile provider with
primary email then for an Eloqua visitor
visitor services will look for any user
in the LDAP profile provider with
attribute primary email whose value is
the same as the attribute email in
eloqua so visitor services links to
profiles to the same visitor
aggregation templates allow you to
combine profile attributes from
different profile providers you can set
rules and specify the number of
attributes to match the site visitors
data against the profile providers data
you can edit or add a new template from
the aggregation templates list update
the template using velocity or
JavaScript
using general configuration you can
capture site visitors interests based on
the profile configuration and page
visits set an expiry date to refresh and
recapture the information general
configuration contains two default
instances extended attribute
configuration and profile update period
you can add more instances as you need
with extended attribute configuration a
site visitor is stored as a guest when
no matching profile is found in the
profile provider's database his or her
interests are captured and stored in the
local database when sufficient
information is gathered it cross
verifies the guest with users and other
identity stores when it finds matching
data the guest is added as an available
user to the profile provider database
with profile update period you can set
an expiry period for the captured site
visitors data after the expiry period a
call triggers visitor services to obtain
fresh data from external providers the
site visitors data is refreshed and
updated to the local database
access provider allows you to secure
some of the rest endpoints provided by
visitor services protecting these rest
endpoints allows only an authorized user
to invoke these services and obtain any
users profiles otherwise a visitor can
only obtain his or her information you
can protect profile information by
adding new access providers and set
rules for accessing the site visitor
data thank you for watching to learn
