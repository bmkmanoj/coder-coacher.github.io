stem Oh series today I will show you how
to take Iraq today base environment that
has a single instance standby to a new
patch level using Crete maintenance
let's look at the environment we're
using today I have attracted a base
running on trollin or tube that has no
PS use now I was stand by also running
on Cullen or two without any psu's which
is a single instance database today i
plan to upgrade i plan to take the rack
environment to telenor tube with psu one
and standby environment to tolono to psu
on so i have created a reference
environment to help me create the gold
image so how do i create the gold image
i uz mcl I DV software maintenance
create software image with the input
files that has the necessary parameters
that we need for this so let's look at
the content of this input file so as you
can see it provides an image name image
description a reference target that I
can use to create the Golden Age the
location in the software library where
this cold image will be stored and
reference host credentials it also
provides the name of the version the
version name of the gold image you are
creating since we can have multiple
versions of the same gold image it is an
important parameter to providers since
it is the first time we are creating a
gold image for alone or two so this
would be my portion name which is BS you
want as as we move forward you could
have multiple versions that we have
different names specified there now for
the sake of the demo I've already
created this gold image for you so let's
look at all the images that we have
available see em COI TV software
maintenance get images will show you the
images that we created for this so as
you can see i have created a rack Cullen
or too cold image for the purpose of
this demo and here is the image ID of
that so we can using that image ID you
can look at the
options that are available for that
particular colony so let's run this
command EMC y DB software maintenance
get versions of this image ID since
there is only one version so there's one
wash an idealistic and we could also
make if we have multiple versions of
this available you could make one of
them to be your current one how do we go
about doing that EMC lidt software
maintenance update watching skaters
provide the washing ID and make that s
current let's try that here even though
we have a single version that you know
it would still make it the current now
as a next step we subscribe to that
image so EMC li DB software maintenance
subscribe target target name say now
case Rack is my primary database so it's
prit be 121 stars a type is attracted a
base and image ID so let's look at the
standby here standby is a single
instance data base running on color
notice since it is the same version the
software is identical we can use the
same golden age for both primary as a
left hand by in this case so we can
actually use the same image to subscribe
so we can do DB software mints and
subscribe targets target name STD be one
to one and target type is ranked at a
base I'm sorry a target type is Oracle
underscored a disease because this is a
single instance database and in hid now
once we give this command so let's
modify this so that we can actually
switch weight correctly
right so once you subscribe this we can
actually take a look at the images and
their subscriptions so I'm going to
since I already created the image for
you I will show the subscriptions that I
have done for this so as you can see my
primary database is subscribed to this
image and also my standby databases
subscribe to the same image like I
mentioned here i'm using the same gold
image for both of them so now that
subscription is done the third step is
to actually push this image as Shadow
Oracle home for both primary and standby
and then switch both primary and standby
to that shadow home right so let's do
the first step which is emc lieb
software maintenance perform operation
deploy single instance pac-12 Lenore to
and purpose is to deploy the DB software
target list is my standby target type is
single instance normal credentials
provincials and the location of where
this shadow home gets created so let's
look at that location as you can see
I've got to telenor to single instance
psu on so that is where this particular
home will be deployed next I will deploy
the same and now in this case for the
target primary right which is PR a DB
one to one target type is reacted a base
now here i specify the location where
the shadow local comm will be right so
let's look at that as well I'm sorry so
I missed
right now we're ready so we can actually
take a look at the content of this to
see where the shadow r-oklahoma will get
created as you can see till one or two
PS you want that's where the shadow will
be created so for the sake of the demo
purpose I already pushed the deploy step
through because it takes a few minutes
to complete this now since the deploy is
already done the next step is for us to
actually switch to the Chad Oracle home
now in the switch parting the update
step the order in which we do this is
very important you first take care of
the standby then we will take care of
the primary so how do we do the standby
update emc li DB software maintenance
perform operation and purposes specified
is update DB and target list is you
first take care of the standpipes OST
STD be one to one target type of single
instance credentials and this is an
important flag data guard role is stand
by so this is the first step that we
will perform so let's run this so as you
can see this Scott submitted
successfully so it will get switched in
less than a couple of minutes the next
step is to take care of the primary emc
lieb software maintenance perform
operation update primary now purpose is
update rank TP this time because where
our primary is running rack target list
is PR a DB one to one target type is
attracted a base and Fred Schultz and
this time the data control is primary
right so once the standby is done we'll
just submit this and that's how you know
we actually take care of a database that
has their standby running that concludes
this demo thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
