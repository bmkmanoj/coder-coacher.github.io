statement apart the sequel analytics is
around the calculation for a moving
average price and this is where we're
using the window feature as you can see
here here's the output from the in
sequel statement but how is the data for
that last column calculated en
underscore price with our data set we
have data for multiple stock symbols
when we're calculating the moving
average price we want the price that
relates to a specific symbol therefore
we partition by symbol this ensures that
the average price for acne is only based
on the price data for acne the average
price for blowbacks is only based on the
price date of globex and so on and
that's shown here when you've
highlighted the partition by statement
and we've grouped and data below and
color-coded the boxes to help you now
the data is grouped together the next
step is to order the data set which for
the purposes of the moving average needs
to be based upon the time column now the
data is correctly grouped and ordered
the next step is determine how to
compute the average ie how many records
should be used to compute the average
and then this case case the interval is
set has current row plus 19 days
preceding which gives us our total of
twenty rose from first of April to the
20th of april so now the data is
correctly grouped is correctly ordered
and we know what the interval for the
ranges which is the current row plus 19
days preceding so now we can actually
compute the average we can see that the
last record and each partition shows the
final moving average figure for that
symbol which for acne is 19.5 and for
globex 7.95
this simple example is hopefully explain
to you the concept of the window in
signal analytics it's a very powerful
feature and you should refer to the
database sequel documentation to learn
