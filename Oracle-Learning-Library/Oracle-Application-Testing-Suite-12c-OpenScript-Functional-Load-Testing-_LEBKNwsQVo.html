features and updates for the application
testing suite photo one my name is Utah
Nakata katsu and I'm a group product
manager for the product in this
recording I would like to talk about the
new feature that is available for the
open Swiss functional testing and load
testing the first new feature we have is
open script dynamic loading of data
banks in the version 12 the excuse me -
am 9.3 members in the open script in
order to use data bank you needed to go
to the script properties and associate
the data bank files explicitly before
starting using the data bank feature the
improvement we have here in 1201 allows
you to basically load the data bank file
without having this UI interaction so
the data bank is going to be loaded into
the script dynamically without you going
into the new UI to configure there so
please take a look at this screenshot
you can see - chunk of commands that
both start with get data bank load the
first one and secondly here the first
get data bank loaded man points a
specific path in the file system to load
up the data bank for dynamically at a
runtime so in this code it is
configuring the data bank file FM stocks
data CSV and loading that data into the
data bank alias FM stock underscore data
and you can do this without any UI
configuration you can run the script
without adding the data bank file
manually in the script properties now
take please take a look at the second
the set of commands and the first get
data first line here get data bank load
of command is a
configuring data bank file now it is a
AV tank CSV
but please note that data is actually
loading into the same data bank alias FM
stock data here so it is the same alias
we worked on the the first command here
so the well it it is doing here is it is
going to overwrite the data band
configuration dynamically in the run
time so well this API allows you to do
is still load or overwrite the data bank
file at run time without any UI
interaction so let's see this in a
script here is the actual script I have
in the open script UI so I have a same
code we saw in the slide and just to
make sure that nothing is added to this
script cause the script properties and I
do not have any data bank configured in
this script in 9.31 version if you put
together the data bank next data bank
record without having anything in here
it is going to cause a fader but I'm
going to play up the script
and looks like it is succeeded and the I
have to info command information command
to get the body of the data bank and the
first info statement is from the first
Data Bank file and I have T a1 and this
is taken out from IBM stock data CSV and
the second info command is Fred HOF comm
this was the value which was taking from
this a BTech the CSV let's go back to
side so so this a this feature allows
you to load or override the data bank
without having a UI injection and this
feature is available only for the
functional testing and this is now
applicable for the full scripts so that
was a dynamic loading feature for the
data banks the next new feature is also
dynamic loading but for the script end
functions so similar to what we have
discussed for the data bank feature in
the previous slide if you wanted to run
a child script from your master script
or you wanted to call it user define a
function in 9.3 percent open script you
needed to go to the script properties
and manually needed to add them on to
your current script and in 1201 we
provide api's to skip this process and
load script and functions dynamically
during the long time so please take a
look at the screenshot in this line I
have three commands in the script the
first one is a run script command which
enables the dynamic script loading the
commands take three arguments repository
script path and the number of iterations
you want to run this child script the
second and third commands are the Col
function by path
they load up methods from the
user-defined function library at runtime
so he has it takes four arguments a
repository script path and the method
which is a function name and the also
the arguments so let's take a look at
this in the script for the product okay
when you open the corresponding script
okay I have my script open and there has
the same command we saw in the slides
and I have one run script and to call
function by pass commands so let's go to
a script properties just make sure I
have nothing added to this desk as I
said there is no script added to this
script but if I play back your script
that's quick it's already played back
and what I can see is the first what it
did is still load the script which is
specified in this run scriptment which
are databank load is a strip name so
that was executed actually that was the
same script we just run in a databank
feature so the script was executed and
also was calling two functions from the
function libraries and I was able to do
that without configuring that in the UI
so this new API allows you to do is to
load script and function dynamically
from the code without any UI
interactions and unlike the data bank
feature these API is for loading script
and functions are available both
functional and load testing scripts so
we support dynamic load of data bank
script and functions and whether one now
you may wonder what if what about the
object library or jar files we we
actually did have there enhancement
requests but unfortunately we did not
support them and listen to the one
object library and jar files will not be
able to load during the runtime and
require still requires manual
configuration in the script properties
please keep in mind however this feature
dynamic loading of the data bank and
also the scripting functions does not
take the ability to from you to
configure data bank or script as a set
in these great properties it is still
actually recommended to configure assets
as needed and as there allows you to
import or export the script with the
associated assets and you can it's more
portable these api's are additional
capabilities provided for you
for morph to provide a flexibility in
your scripting the next new feature is
enumerated list function arguments this
is basically a UI assistance or UI
enhancements for the feature that was
only available at a code level in 9.3
one version of the open script so when
you create a function and add an
argument in the 9.31 version of the open
script you could select string int
double long or boolean well we have in
total one is a three additional data
types which is select list list and map
these are the new types of the arguments
we added to this argument dialog and
this is what we're going to talk about
for the next couple of slides here let's
go back to the slide and this slide
talks about the when you select the
database select the list now let's take
a look at this example here in this
screenshot is shows a two dialogues
function and argument and they are used
when a user creates function and specify
a parameter in the example here the
function name is changed color so it
could be a function used in graphical
application or and allows maybe allows
user to select the color that is shown
in a display or a particular object and
here the function creator only wanted
two users to use colors that almost
either red blue or green it's showing
here so in case the user selected the
specify the color orange or purple or
whatever it is now listed in this list
it is going to throw on either that
that's what this function is going about
so in total one you can do that by
select list you see the data type you'll
select list here and this will open a
dialog this argument dialog that you can
write down the specific body list of
values that you want user to select and
now that non-technical users or the and
any users who want to use this function
write a code to call this function but
instead of writing that in the code view
user can do that by the graphical user
interface that shows the list of values
only that is the ballot value listed in
the argument dialog when the function
was created so this will reduce the risk
of the errors because the user can only
select the bodies which is available in
this list box by this feature you can
ensure the users select expected values
and avoid calling invalid values
the next slide is again with some new
data types in the function argument and
this is when you selected list or map
data types this feature provides
specific UI for passing list of values
in the maps of the key value pairs to
the user-defined functions in 9.31 this
was actually possible however only by
writing a Java code so we have heard
many times that this is error-prone and
especially not easy for the
non-technical users for them to write
down a function call with valid syntax
they have to make a mistake correct them
and make a mistake so that's why we made
this enhancement which enables you to do
everything from the tree view alone and
now with the Java code interactions so
in this slide I mean the left side of
the screen shot in this example here say
in your application there is a page that
has three links that has a text log in
and your requirement is to verify the
href attribute for the each of the login
links and first of all the technical
user needs to create a function for this
requirement and he may want to write a
code to parse out the content returned
from the server and extracted H ref
values in the page well the logic here
is not the main topic in this slide then
he or she can add an argument for this
function with a data type list as you
can see in the screenshot right now and
which stores a list of string values and
this is because the extracted the HF
values need to be compared with expected
values and this expected values will be
passed from the function called later by
the user
let me take a look at in the actual
script for what actually happens when
you create a function argument with
lists or a map I'm going to open one of
the script that has function with list
argument already implemented so this is
the function that has three arguments
and one of the argument is the datatype
list and what happens in actually behind
a scene when you create this function is
hopefully you like the java code view
and the data type is actually mapped to
the Java util list and likewise when you
create the argument with map type data
type this is how it looks like in the
java code view the argument will be
mapped to the Java util map that takes a
set of two strings for the each list of
values in 9.31 this was only possible to
do in the code and has been a tricky
procedure because he often ends up in a
syntax error in 1201 all this can be
done in the UI and you don't have to
deal with this complex Java code okay so
once the function is created and then
the user can call the function from the
tree view when calling a function method
that has list or map type argument user
will see a list box in the UI that he or
she can write down a list of parameters
which you want to pass to the parameters
you want to pass to the functions excuse
me in this example of user can specify a
list of URLs that you want to pass to
the function so after that the function
will receive the list of value
and then store them into the java.util
list object is just so in Java called
and will do any necessary work within
the function to the process that data
this basically is a UI enhancement that
allows you to avoid the syntax errors
because you don't have to deal with a
complex Java code the next new feature
in toad one is a code assist capability
for the user-defined function libraries
in 9.31 versions of open script you can
create a function library and call the
methods from the java code but there is
no way to see what methods are available
in that function library with the
enhancement in toward one we have added
and code assess feature that allows you
to build what medals are available in
the user-defined functions and select
them by clicking them please take a look
at the screen shot in the side user may
create a function library and write a
cup of medals in the library and in this
example the methods are the start apps
and I also see another method here the
verify links now somebody else want to
call that function you created however
he does not know what methods are
available in the library well he can do
in total one is to type the library name
in this case it's my test class and type
period and that will allows him to Bill
the methods available for this function
please note that this feature is
available only when the function library
is created in the new 12.1 format we
have changed the way we create a
function later in total one from the
previous version of the open script for
the function lever is created in the 90s
persian of the open script we have an
option to convert that into the total
one format
and we will talk about that in the next
slides so this slide shows how to create
a function library in photo 1 which is
very easy when you create create a new
script in 12-1 you will notice there is
a new check box in the bottom bottom of
the dialog which says create script as a
function library if you are not going to
create a function every and just want to
create a big your script and you don't
have to check this and just go ahead and
everything is same as before but if you
want to create a function every check
this box and click Next
then you will see a dialog which did not
exist in 9.31 here you specify a unique
package name and a cross name for your
function library and then click Next
then you'll see a function every files
you don't have to but this is where the
it is created it is going to be created
in your script directory so this is how
you create a function library in 12-1
it's very easy then what if you have a
function library that was created in the
previous version of the open script say
you have 9.31 version orphan script you
created a function library as mentioned
the code assist feature is only
available with a with the function
Averys in the total one format so this
slide explains how you can convert the
old function library to the yun 12.1
format first open the library you
created in the older version open script
and go to the tools menu and select this
convert to function library option and
this will actually bring up the same
data which is just saw in a previous
slide where you specify the unique
package name
and the class name and click finish and
function library files are created in
the script directly so the second or
third step is actually just the same as
that when you create a new function
library intro the one you just need to
go to the tools and select the convert
to functionally every and that's that's
it
and please note this is also the same
procedure when you want to convert a
ligature script that you created into
other one to a functional library if you
created a script and later wanted to
convert it to the function library but
you did not check the checkbox when you
first time created the script don't
worry and just simply select the convert
to function every option from the menu
okay so finally how to code a function
library from the script
so once the script reverie is created
you can write down the middle in the
library and then you want to call that
function from this other script in order
to see the code assist feature the
function library script has to be added
to the script properties ISOs script
asset then it's all done you should be
able to see the code assistants in the
calling script and for the 9.31 users
please note that the syntax calling
function library has been changed into
the wound in the 9.31 the syntax was get
stripped the call function that that was
used in 9.31 or the older version opens
with but in 1201 the new function call
is the library name the method in this
case in my very my library dot login
what pascal supports both in tanks in
total one
the cold assist is available only for
the new syntax open script has
enhancements in its supporting browsers
and one of them is that I mean I support
open skate functional testing module now
supports Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
browser and we have added a enhancement
into our open street pho pho stands for
the browser helper object to ensure the
script recording and playback works in
the IE 9 browser and one of the
noticeable differences in the IE 9
browser compared to the older versions
of the IE is the way it handles the
notification messages so in IE 8 when
user downloads a file for example a
dialog pops up just like shala well you
can see in this screenshot and he asked
for the ask user for the first reactions
this has been the way that I worked for
a long time but Microsoft changed this
ni 9 and introduced a new components
which is called notification bar and
that shows up in the bottom side of the
browser so to go with this change in the
browser we have updated t-dub eh-oh and
added a new api into in order to go with
this change so we have a different way
to record and playback the the
notification messages in ie8 and ie9
and here is another browser support
enhancement open script functional
testing module also supports Firefox
version 4.0 from its 12.1 release just
like we have made enhancement change to
the IE phot we also made changing
changes to the firefox extension so that
open script can record and playback it's
functional testing script on the firefox
4.0 browser and for example some of the
firefox 4 components behave differently
from the older version of the firefox
because they made change in the xpcom
registration and we may change the
catch-up this change firefox 4.0 also
have a new component called tom orrow
dialogue which locks only certain
browser and we made a change to support
this feature as well and when you record
the script in firefox 4 and 4 you may
notice the browser menu displaying
differently from when you're now
recording with open script this is
because Firefox for UI components such
as menu bar is hidden in the foot
we found this causes of problem in some
of the UI interaction during recording
to go around with this problem we
enabled the menu bar Firefox browser
menu bar to be visible at all transcript
recording this will not affect
application behavior and the menu bar is
enabled only at recording you will not
enable during the playback let me just
show you that in the in the actual
browser so this is a Firefox 4.0 browser
and I am now recording with open script
I just launched the Firefox browser on
its own
as I concede in default setting the many
words are now shown displayed in the
browser header however if I start the
recording in the open script script it
is going to launch Firefox browser but
as you can see it looks differently from
the one without recording it displays
the menu bar in default in order to for
us to record some of the UI interaction
properly okay but this is not going to
be enabled at the Play and playback type
only after recording goes to stop the
recording and go back to the slide the
next update we have is the keyboard
shortcut key preferences that can be
mapped to the certain open script
actions so we have the fourth set of key
bindings now for example you can press a
out P to start the playback so how to R
to start the recording but you can also
change that key combination bindings in
the way you like in the new dialog we
have in open circuit preferences go peel
open squid preferences and find the 3d
node which is keys so this is the the
dialog we can manage your key
preferences in open script actions for
example if you don't want to record the
new script I can press out our to launch
the browser without clicking the
recording icon in the toolbar
okay I'll stop the recording come back
to us right
the last feature update we have for this
section is the preference dialogue
enhancement in the previous version of
the open script the preference dialog
displayed all options for all modules
the guard rest of the script type you
are working on for example if you are
working on the web functional testing
script options for the options for the
load testing or web services are also
displayed this is now useful information
as you cannot use them in your
functional testing script so in proto
one preference options are filtered by
the selected script type so if you have
functional testing script open and then
if you go to the bill and select the
open stupid preference dialog and it
will only show the relevant information
for this functional testing you are
actually actively open in your open
script UI and options for the load
testing or the web services we're now
going to be displayed so this way you
can quickly narrow down to the options
you actually need we also have cleanup
work done in some of the preference
dialog for example in 9.31
under the playback tree node we have
functional tests and we'll functional in
12.1 we integrated these two dialogues
into the single dialogue with this some
reorganization work and now you can use
both features in one single dialogue
okay so this is the end of the recording
of the total one new feature updates for
the open script function load testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
