about protecting data a few words about
myself in the data protection been in
that since the early 90s I've been six
years in an agency that is parallel to
NSA I then been in two startups last of
which was in protecting data within
thumb drives which was acquired by
sandisk and 2006 i moved to form master
key which is in cyberspace protecting
data consulting to companies and
developing our technology which
basically combines a Java Virtual
Machine and secure processors dispute
that have a chip secure mechanisms
before I go further into technology I'd
like to describe what are the
motivations and the goals or maybe the
challenges that we faced and wanted to
achieve to solve with our technology so
the most important point is the
asymmetry between the roles of the
defender and the attacker and what this
basically means it's much easier these
days to be an attack of a defender this
is a can pretty much be seen from this
graph that i got from much the same at
DARPA and what much did was he counted
lines of code now he counted lines of
code in the system that protects our
organizations and he did that from for
the systems in place in the late 80s
since the late 80s until this day from
the early firewalls until today is the
unified meta threat management and what
he found
well the as time goes by the number of
lines that are used in the system that
protect us organizations grow
exponentially what much also did was he
took his over sorry about that he took
his nine thousand samples of malware
which includes exploit swarms botnets
viruses do s tools and the average is
average those lines of code number of
lines of code and when we found that
these average at 125 lines of code and
the bad thing is that this is constant
throughout the years since the early 90s
late 80s until today 120 short lines of
code now lines of code is not something
you know mystical it shows complexity
amount of time invested then basically
the amount of money that was put in to
to these to these systems so let's say
for example I take two programmers and
have them work on a project for four
months and try to break into a fortune
500 company would I be able to do that
well probably these are programmers are
okay and find some you know some
zero-day attack or some something
probably be done now take these
programmers for months and protect this
fortune 500 company would they be able
to protect that company well probably
not so the rules are the the adversary
roles are much easier than the attacker
and the worst thing is that we are
diverging from the threat so as time
goes by we're not getting better it only
gets worse more like the cold and
heavier assistants are in place so how
can you win in this situation so this is
the main point other points that are
importance are the security layering and
interfaces organization put in layers on
layers upon layers of security in order
to get a better confidence in the
security they have in place problem is
those at the actual layers themselves
have weaknesses and exploits to be used
so you may feel better but if I'm an
attack and I know that you're using this
kind of system then maybe if I know that
you're using this kind of system then I
can i can get into I can break it so
it's a false feeling and surface areas
is one thing that once i'm an attacker
and i managed to break into the network
well i'm there now i'm looking around to
find some something interesting some
data doesn't want to stay on this slide
for some reason so i'm there in the in
your network and i want to put it on put
my hands on some data so how do i do it
well modern operating systems have
hundreds of thousands and millions lines
of lines of code the what you build the
your application maybe even if it's a
small application links into dll's and
libraries that are very large and these
call other libraries which means that
sorry about that which means you're
actually in a in a place where an
attacker can has a lot of surface area
and IBM has this rule of thumb for every
for every 1000 lines of code there are
between one and five bucks so that means
a lot
exports to be used by the attacker so
these are the main things that we had as
a challenge and our solution thank you
for moving on to the next slide our
solution basically talks about a black
box it means that data is kept within
the box it never leaves it so you have
data entering it data staying within the
black box they are being processed
within the black box and outputting only
the results of the of the computation we
achieve this with obviously a Java
Virtual Machine within a hardware
securing mechanism which is actually a
DSP chip that includes secure mechanisms
on the chip to protect actually in the
chip itself we are using an analog
devices blackfinn DSP for our
implementation this processor has this
technology called lock box that does
something very basic it actually lets
you isolate the chip from the outside
world so nobody can access it and within
that isolated space it executes a signed
code and has access to secret data
secret keys to be used so let's talk
take for example how is this being used
let's take for example a user that wants
to sign up to say to sony playstation
sony is a good example here so it's only
had this system in place well your user
signs up to the system sends username
password to the SSL tunnel the SSL
tunnel goes directly into the black box
the data is stored in the database
here's an event password next time the
data sorry the user signs into the
system again the data travels into the
system to the ssl
Tunnel the JVM goes data-based fetches
the the user credentials checks that
they they match an output success fail
success or fail now if I'm Anna an
attacker if I'm a hacker and managed to
break into your into the sewing network
now I want to get the passwords where
are the passwords were they sitting so
what would I do first thing I can do i
can try and password as they come in
internet from the users but if i go to
try and get those well those are going
through ssl and go directly into the
black box oh I can't get it as an
attacker I can try and put my hands on
the data as it be as it is being stored
well again the data is being stored
within the database so I can't access
the data as it is being stored and the
other place the third place then try and
put my hands on data as it is being
processed and again java virtual machine
is within the black box and i can't
access the data so the idea is that you
protect your data even if an attacker
manages to break into your network and
this is an important point because if
you have data if you are a fortune 500
company or an important they have
important data that you're afraid that
someone may want to access it want to
break into your system you can pretty
much assume that your network has
already been broken and you know if it
hasn't been broken it will be broken in
a fair amount of time there are a lot of
attacks being taken place and people you
know IT managers they just don't know
that their network has been breached and
sometimes you know about it weeks months
even years later so sorry about that so
the idea is that you protect your data
even if your if your network has been
so if we have that in mind how do we
measure up to the challenges that we we
went through on the first slide so if
you remember we had the asymmetry
between the attacker and defender but
now me as a defender if I want to update
a security security policy because you
know maybe my program has changed or I
want to put in a new policy all i have
to do if i have this black box and all i
have to do is program a few lines of
code into the JVM into the Java Virtual
Machine and that's it my policy is there
I write a few lines of code and that's
it so if I see if I analyze what the
attacker and the defender roles are what
each one has to do so if I'm an attacker
I need to study to see what you did I
need to understand how the system works
I need to research to put in money I
need to do a lot of things but if I'm
the the defender all i have to do is
decide i want to make a change i make
that change and i put it in and that's
it so what we actually do is reverse the
asymmetry so now it's much better place
to be a defect to be to defend your net
your data your critical data than to be
an attacker the other points we talked
about the surface areas what's
accessible to the to the attacker well
there are no operating systems here
there's no operating system there are no
libraries huge libraries there's only
the secure mechanism and very thin java
virtual machine that is actually
modified java mobile edition so and in
addition to that the mechanism even even
that is is isolated within the charm
within the
so the interfaces are available to the
attacker are only say for example the
input SSL and the at work what comes out
as output so we're having this in mind
good timing the challenge that we had in
implementing this system was first and
foremost was first was most importantly
the java virtual machine itself the
on-chip resources are very slim
yesterday's keynote talked about
megabytes that that are tens of
megabytes sixty five megs of memory of
code required for for java to run on
embedded devices were here so about that
well here we're talking about all we
have on chip resources as 256k while off
chip we have sdram which 64 megabytes or
more problem is the memory outside the
chip is not protected only be on ship
resources sorry only the unship
resources are protected so we wanted to
use Java Virtual Machine that it's
easier easy for the programmer to to use
with you know the threading and every
end and all of that and you know a fast
implementation but okay but we and we
still needed to work within the two of
the 256 kilobytes so what we actually
did was we implemented a secure virtual
memory within the java mobile edition
what we actually did is we
modified or read completely changed the
memory we completely change the memory
bill just sorry about that but can't
cope with this changing I don't know why
does it didn't do it at home um should
have taken should use my own laptop
still doing it mmm good thing I only
have five slides there was would have
been much more difficult I don't like
doing too many slides so good good thing
for that so yeah the the memory
management the whole memory has been no
I just forget it just a bit that so the
whole memory has been redesigned so that
when one memory actually Java when it
uses memory it doesn't access memory
directly as in CSC does which is
basically why we're using java virtual
machine it doesn't access the memory
directly it s is the memory indirectly
through an object that holds you know
information about the object you know
it's an array or what is it and how how
much data is stored there and only then
does the actual axis we are using that
indirect taxes to implement a virtual
memory so that we have a bit there that
for every access like that it's the bit
is on that means data is on chip and we
use it if it's off we bring it on chip
and then we use it so very easy to think
about it problem is to implement
rich collection of that well that's kind
of a lot of work but that's that's how
it's been done and how it works so this
is basically the framework of what we've
done and what I'd like to talk about a
little bit about is the uses for such a
black box and go through quickly through
some use cases that we have but what I'm
interested this is brother of feathers
so what I'd like to hear maybe after I
go through these is what kind of data
you need to protect do you think cuz
black box like that can be used to
protect your data what are you doing
today and with black box like that be of
use to you and if not what what's
missing and what can be done to solve
your problems so the use cases we talked
about credentials username passwords
secret questions as well can be used and
any other kind of data that doesn't need
to be displayed back to the user just
buried within the black box and can only
be used to authorize who you are credit
cards credit cards can be used with the
system two black boxes can be configured
to communicate with each other for
example through SSL so I can have one
black box at at at Sony okay so some
holds all the credit cards within the
within the black box and when the user
wants to make a payment that credit card
information travels securely to another
black box that's located at the payment
authorizer the clearing cleaning house
does the credit card payment and sends
back only whether it was successful or
not so you
and if I the attacker hacker I managed
to break into the network I'm going to
put my hands on credit cards credit card
numbers credit card numbers are securely
located in the black box and securely
communicated with another black box
outside the network of Sony so that's
how you for example protect credit cards
another use case is you know just
protecting your data that's located in
your database or for example signing
digital certificates for example if
you're a certificate authority what you
do is actually use signed certificate
requests and signing the certificate
request itself the cannibal can all be
done within a black box to sign the
certificate requests you have your
secret key the secret key key is stored
within the black box and stay there
doesn't need to be to ever leave it the
signing himself is is done within the
black box and you get you get your your
your digital certificate output so this
way you can track exactly what you're
signing and what's being done and nobody
can enter your network and can put their
hands on your secret key or can generate
digital certificates as they want so you
know I think you know credit card
numbers credentials certificate
authorities these are pretty much making
the headlines in cyberspace I believe
that know if a Chris didn't have easy
access to such data we would be today in
a much better place so what there's also
one more thing I can mention is now I
joined Oracle
ok so maybe one more thing I can mention
is that this black box carries out the
data carries out programs that are
signed so and actually we're talking
about an embedded device so a chip so
this chip can be placed within medical
equipment vehicles for example and you
can be assured that the code that you're
actually that is actually being executed
is the code that you intended to execute
and not some other code so again this is
another use for the black box so now if
you're if you want to let me let me know
what you're doing to protect your data
what kind of data you have that you need
to protect how are you protecting it
today anybody here ok so yeah this is
basically it if you have any questions
for me I have some brochures here and
also I brought with me a device that we
actually a black box that we are using
so if you want to take a look at it it's
basically board that's weird that we're
using in some in some of the some of our
implementations currently we have a
single board that we're using which is
sufficient for for for the payload for
handing the payload that we are having
today but we are trying to create like a
server that has multiple number of cards
multiple number of DSPs so that if your
network has you know hundreds and
thousands of if your Sony for example
yeah hundreds and thousands of
request for a second we can put in those
DSPs and can handle the work because
obviously this work is very easily
paralyzed and we have that in place so
this could be this data can be processed
securely and quickly and this is mainly
the main reason for it it was opposed to
Java card or other platforms it's meant
to be something that works really fast
these the DSPs and day-to-day basis
render HD videos and compressing so
these are very strong and can be used to
achieve what we the protection that we
want and in large amounts okay okay good
question actually the those the this
network is can be it's it's up to it's
up to how you on how you want it
delivered it can be done through us or
it can be done through you that you have
your server so it can be within a
confined place but what's interesting to
note because the hacker can also hack
this server we are using the same black
boxes in order to deliver our software
okay or our updates or you know any
configuration you want we want so you
know the secret keys or we are what we
use to sign to sign the programs are
also kept within cards like that within
devices like that so this way we
securely manage and update code update
program
and other questions would you well we're
using basically we're basically using a
java virtual machines so you write your
Java code so this is this was our our
main goal you mean like open source by
the libraries or I get a malicious
library which I don't know I know well
our fermentation is sort of keeps it
clean in that sense that it only lets
our signed Java programs run so if you
want to make your own implementation or
you want us to help you with
implementation for some library we can
do that but not in the framework of this
black box it can also be a black box but
not in this kind of framework which is
meant you know to protect Java programs
and to allow you to quickly implement
and move fast and you know defining
policies to protect your data yes please
our site there are some really
yes well yes well it's possible because
well obviously once you have Java inside
and you write your own code then you can
basically store in there what you want
and you you know do what you want the
question is is the implementation that
you're doing protecting you you know as
you require because let's say you're
storing your secret keys inside but the
device that needs that secret key is
somewhere outside and you need to
secretly from the black box outside the
black box to that device now you can
communicate in an encrypted manner but I
don't know how the device outside which
is not a black box if you know how well
it protects its communication maybe it
receives the key in a secure manner and
then store them somewhere that is
unsecured so you have to make sure that
your implementation protects you
throughout the entire from you no end to
end
in the vio parties have secure so yeah
yeah
yours
yeah so it can basically be used so it's
I can be used as a secure store and
communicate securely with yeah so
what happens to what excuse me okay okay
yes absolutely and one black box can be
actually configured to to duplicate so
this is although I said that the data
doesn't leave the black box it doesn't
actually leave a single black what it
doesn't mean black boxes so as I said if
I have two black boxes can communicate
with each other each other securely so
in this manner I can duplicate the data
so i can keep two or more boxes
synchronized and secure so in this way i
can have you know my fault tolerance i
can have several servers and each of
each one of them can have its own black
box in the network or at another
location yes absolutely the yeah yes so
actually backing backing up is a good
question backing up will always mean a
backup like a tape and the black box so
the data that is actually being stored
on the tape will always be encrypted
using keys in the black box so when you
have your back up it's a backup plus bak
bak black box and you can obviously you
know make as many backups as you want as
many devices as you want but at no way
is your data you know being left in the
open and in many cases in some cases at
least that I know of security breaches
data was you know protected everywhere
very well but you know there was a
backup somewhere that was you know lying
around
it wasn't encrypted and that backup was
the was how the attacker managed to get
it to get the data so backups must be
also black boxed in this sense and yes
convey you can do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
