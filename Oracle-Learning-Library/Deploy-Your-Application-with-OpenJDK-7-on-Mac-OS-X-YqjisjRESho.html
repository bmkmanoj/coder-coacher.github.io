Kovac and my official title is
consulting member of technical staff at
Oracle but my actual title is lean
engineer on the Mac port or the Java VM
where Java 7 and this talk is going to
be the title is supporting your app with
open JDK 7 but it's going to be more
focused on native applications in the
Mac OS App Store and also deployment and
distribution if you're not interested in
the u.s. 10 App Store so the get started
off who is here at one o'clock for my
first talk just about everybody mostly
ok now ok so in the first talk I
basically gave you an overview of the
transition from Apple to Oracle for Java
and in that talk I mentioned about
something called native applications and
that's mainly what we're going to focus
on in this talk when it comes to applets
and Web Start you know all those things
are certainly work on the Mac and will
continue to do so in the future but this
is specifically talking about a
particular kind of deployment that's
we're adding now for Java 7 so as always
I don't like making any contracts based
on what I'm saying
what you're seeing could be changed
eliminated or I cannot exist in three
months so who knows so well pretend
we're never here so here's the agenda
for this hour and we're going to talk
about the hopefully making a transition
from jars to native applications for
deployment the kinds of distribution
models that you have on OS 10 or
standalone application see those two
models are called the developer ID and
key keeper and then the ilist an app
store and I've got step-by-step on how
to adopt each of those if you're using
Java and then finally and when we talk
about the App Store it will also do a
little bit more in depth about what's
involved in
doing that so what is a container what's
entitlements what is the sandbox things
like that so if you've not heard about
that before they'll hopefully be a
little introduction to you
and finally should have enough time for
your questions so what is wrong with the
jar Potter this actually common question
I see people say well you know I make a
jar file what's wrong with that it's
been around forever you know at least
what I say one not three I think might
been around it's one not two but anyway
you can do Java - jar and run your app
it's convenient for you as a developer
but what's the user experience when you
get wouldn't they get one of these we
they get one sit well you know what do I
do with that I've never seen one of
those before there's no there's on the
Mac there's no way to identify it as an
application it just looks like a generic
archive it's a jar with a little coffee
cup icon and what do you do when there's
no JRE available you double-click on it
and at least on the Mac it tries to tell
you you know oh there was a problem
trying to open that jar file go look in
the console maybe we can tell you
something there it's just not a good
user experience and there's we could do
better I mean that's true in all
platforms but particularly on the Mac so
you can say well the next thing so ok
applets and Web Start sure yeah you can
do that on a Mac that's very convenient
good for deployment good for updating it
has its own issues I mean it's not
there's nothing wrong with it but yes
users in solitaire some environments
that's hard if not downright impossible
particularly on the Mac where you have
to have full FFF administrator
privileges to install a Jerry for all
users sometimes a new JRE comes along
and it break your app not something we
try to do but it happens and it's an
option because you're now relying on a
third-party installation and that's
important for reasons all explained just
well we've got something new with GDP
seven and if we're calling a native
applications and for those of you been
on the mat before this is another way of
saying bundle application support which
is what Apple totally they looking at
just they're just yet another kind of
app the user doesn't know that you're
running Java doesn't care you know it's
all self-contained you don't have to
worry about a jig new JRE
coming along and breaking you because
you're going to include the GRE with the
app it's much easier to update and use
handy things like sparkle which is the
this is a nice open source self updating
framework now there's lots of ways you
can do it you can just roll out a new
version of your app and copy over the
old one there's no real updating that
has to be done the JRE is not visible to
the system and because there's no
command-line tools that none of the
command-line tools are included with it
Jerry it's gonna be a lot harder to use
it as a point of attack and most
importantly now you can get into the
u.s. in App Store because it is your
weekly with with the App Store people
often say well you can't put it Apple
said there can be no Java apps in the
App Store well that's only captured what
they said is that you may not strip an
app the requires a third corporate party
installation Java is considered an
optional installation with Java 6 so you
cannot put a Java app based on Java 6 in
the App Store there's no app there's no
restriction on bundling your own JRE and
have a completely self-contained app
running Java 7 we actually did it and it
was accepted on Friday
it had to be I had to pull it back out
for licensing reasons but yes it can be
done it is doable if nobody else is
doing pregnant
it's new so yeah there are lots of
benefits right if he puts it in the App
Store Apple basically takes care of
being the updater for you it's a nice
channel to get revenue through your app
Apple does take a cut but you know
you've got a knife you got an easy to
use store for disturbing your outlet so
yeah there are a lot of benefits using
and they didn't need about and once you
decide that this is the way to go for
your app there's a few things that you
have to ask yourself next you know once
you know that you want this first of all
you want to go through the hassle and
honestly there's some hassle involved in
submitting today to the App Store
are you selling consumer app if you are
then it's actually a pretty good idea to
be in the App Store because you get a
lot of good visibility that way are you
okay working the limited resource
environment where that means that you
don't have automatic access to the
network you can't go anywhere you can't
go anywhere and everywhere and users on
the user disk you have to basically a
say upfront what resources you're going
to use like USB peripherals camera
location and so on and so forth or do
you want to just stop or download from
your website now you don't want Apple be
a gatekeeper figure out or or you have
an app that makes up with absolutely no
sense to be in the store which is
something specific to your organization
or it's so specialized that young even
if you did ship it for free it didn't
make it doesn't make a lot of sense or
if you're going to distribute it
internally you know you don't mean the
mess around with app stores in that case
well first of all let's see how coming
how can we decide this well the best
thing to do is make sure you got one
that's suitable for the store and the
best categories of those are games
utilities developer tools are always
good and
document editing creation which is sort
of lately the app the Apple
bread-and-butter application if you will
is built around it that's that's almost
always a good candidate if you have to
be completely self-contained you can't
rely on a third-party components you
must be able put everything into your
application bundle after all the apps
for guidelines so if you're doing
something that's expressly prohibited by
the App Store by Apple's rules obviously
can't do that you have to figure out if
you're gonna be okay in a sandbox
environment you have to be willing to
let Apple review your app first that's
actually a big one that I think a lot of
people forget about
now if none of those apply you have
another choice which is called developer
ID and at the very least you whether you
do whether you leave here today is
saying well I'm not gonna even bother
with the App Store I hope you will read
up on developer ID is that at the very
least of something you will need to take
care about so what's the difference well
here's a nice summary if you're going to
be in the App Store
you have to be willing to be Sam your
app to run in the sandbox
if you want to let it be run by reviewed
by Apple and no matter which one you
choose you need an Apple Developer
membership so $99 a year you got to pay
to do this no matter what you choose
there are gonna be things that you need
while I'm at of course you need a Mac
Developer Program membership 7u 10 is
where all the tools and a compatible VM
and FX that will work in the App Store
you can get a preview a pre-release of
7u 10 right now from java.net you need
the your job application that you built
in NetBeans or whatever needs your
pretty icon of course that's like that's
a paramount for a Mac out alright if you
got a nice icon everything else is sort
of secondary
any any patients if you're going to put
some of the AppStore I submitted
something on Labor Day it got approved
yesterday or Friday
rather so that's 30 days right there and
that's actually it's running typical
right now for the apps for the u.s. for
the magnetics work so the first thing I
want to talk about is gatekeeper and
gatekeeper is a much lower bar to entry
and what gatekeeper is is that I talked
about how we're going to do it but I
realize I should probably describe it a
little bit so by default a new user and
mountain lion gets an environment called
gatekeeper and basically what gatekeeper
does is it verifies that new code
introduced to the system has been at
least signed by a identify developer so
if the application has not been signed
by a identify developer it'll be bought
from launch by default now the user can
right-click and explicitly say no I want
to run this application but that's an
extra step and a new or not terribly
experienced user won't understand that
so you're better off thinking it easier
for for your users if yeah if you want
to so to do this what do you need well
you just need to make a native maca less
native app using effects package or the
ant tools you're going to sign it with
your developer ID which you got from
from Apple and the last thing we want to
do is you get a test it so you want to
send it to yourself put it on a server
and then download it because when you
build things locally Apple considers
them safe just make life easier and use
about a little easier as a developer but
when you pick it up and move it to
another system it goes into this
quarantine State and if it's been signed
a little alert will come up
like that and say that you know here's
an app that lets attach to a message are
you sure you want to open it the other
possibility is safari downloaded this
file are you sure you want to open after
it you know if you ever seen this alert
this is gate keeper and if your app has
been signed with the developer ID at the
very least you will get this alert
otherwise you'll get a nastier one that
says yeah this this application was not
signed by an unknown developer and your
system does not allow you to open that
and show you how easy that is I've set
up my system over here okay here's my
teaching and this is teaching access
it's in your utilities folder I've
imported all my certificates as it that
I get as a registered developer and
these first two developer ID installer
and developer ID application that's what
we're going to use to build something
for gate keeper now to save a little bit
of time
and I have built ensemble which is the
FX FX demonstration at this plenty of
examples in FX and I built use the ant
ant task to basically build Ensemble
it's an application and it's got my
metadata it's got the little stub to run
launch Java and there's my there's my
run file and to show you the build that
XML I use for that one important thing
you have to do is you have to come up
with a unique identifier for your
application and it uses basically a Java
package notation so like reverse DNS
diversity in a reverse DNS packaging so
you have to specify that it's going to
be unique for your application and then
we're going to go down here in in the FX
deploy section we've got this native
bundles equals all and that tells the
ant tool that you want to generate
native applications and this particular
case is NetBeans based so that's why you
see some of these macros in here but the
name of the application is going to be
governed by that title attribute vendors
not so much important but category is
very important for the EPS or and the FX
tools have a decent amount of support
for Mac specific fields that have to be
included for the app sort this is the
important one right here is that you
have to specify a category so when I'm
running at this is what I end up with
end up with the dot app and I've got the
mg
so now sign all you need to do is paste
in is use this command right here code
sign F it's but definite - F is forced
which means overwrite if there's one
already there - B is verbose
s is - S stands for a signing identity
and in this case I'm using developer ID
application and that map's back and my
keychain to this right here because
that's the only one I've got my keychain
that's the only one that's going to find
please
there we go and because I want to wants
to get at a private key it's gonna ask
for my each Inc password there you go so
we've now signed it for x86 64 but we've
signed a a thin 64-bit binary and that's
its application ID so at this point I am
done with DQ that's it one line you're
right now ready to go if I were to take
that ensemble that app I mean you can't
really see that anything's happened to
it because it was the insides of it that
changed but yeah very does that mean
that's Ensemble now this this doesn't
tell you much because as I said I'm
running this locally and it treats it as
trusted but the difference you will see
is if you look at the look at the
content so we now have this code
signature for it
that's what code sign did that put that
in there now the OS now the OS knows
that this is a signed application and
probably good question to ask yourself
this well gee that's some very secure I
mean what happens why you know will yank
a file out of here once so run actually
yeah well because its sole person sole
purpose of gatekeeper is to identify
your application as coming from a
trusted developer if you if your even if
the user is going to muck about with the
with the app and they break anything
that's tough but the code is stressful
so it's not it's not a you know it's not
what I would call bulletproof security
but at the same time its sole purpose is
to prevent a bad website from
downloading an app and start running
code without the user knowing what's
going on so that in a nutshell
is supporting developer ABAP now
arguably if you don't care about the
store you can go right now and have a
you can go right now and have a cup of
coffee because the rest of the time it's
been talking about the lists and apps
right because there's a lot more going
on in there and this is actually the
future I don't want to say this is the
future of distribution on the Mac but it
certainly seems like it's going to be
harder and harder to just distribute an
app and heal any old way you choose so
you at least want to be aware of this
even if it's even if you're not doing
you know traditional third-party
developer distribution you're doing
internal type development yeah you do
you at least want to be aware of what's
going on in this field so for the OS 10
app sort again you start with FX package
or ant build the native app kept aside
what entitlements you need I'm going to
cover what in an entitlement is sign the
app create installer package in a
specific way for the store
test it there's some I called it out
because there's some actually sweet
facilities for testing signed out and
finally submit it I'll walk you through
all those things here so the first thing
is use epic packager and I did that for
you
the theory is a Java FX jar file which
contains an ant ass that comes part of
the JDK and if you specify this in your
build-out XML which I showed you earlier
it will just pick it up and generate
proper generate a native app for you
so next up before we talk about an
entitlement let's talk about a sandbox
because you have to be in the sandbox
for an entitlement to make any sense
conceptually speaking if you've done
applet or website deployment you know
about the Java sandbox model so you can
only get back to the and we get back to
the website you came from
that's only joking about leaving you can
only get back to the website you came
from can't get it the disk yeah some of
the things you're familiar with if
you're familiar with Java security but
the OS 10 app sandbox it basically does
the same thing limits access to system
resources and to user data as Apple
likes to put it contain the damage of an
exploit so if you somebody puts an app
on the store and lo and behold it
actually turns out to be some kind of
Trojan the Apple kid in the file and if
those bad things if the damage is very
limited to the container o theme of the
application what you're trying to do is
reduce the ability notice it doesn't say
eliminate reduce the ability for it
compromised at the steel corrupt or
destroy data so the way the sandbox
works is that as a developer you express
what you want this application to be
able to do each application is going to
run in some container and therefore it
has full access to that specific spot in
the undead's
user has full control over what
documents your application can access so
if you open an app look if you have a
standard file open dialog and the user
goes off and opens a document and some
other place on the disk well your apples
still be able to include it because that
document then gets added to the sandbox
effectively so how do you indicate what
you want to do
well that's where the entitlements come
in so entitlements are basically a
collection of XML that the use of
developer right up front and these gets
baked into the signature for the
application just a property list Xcode
it's got a good property list editor
there's third-party ones but yeah you
can use a text editor to mountain lions
got 2020 to find new ones come along
every couple of you know Apple suddenly
realizes oh wait but yeah there's this
usage case we didn't really think up we
need to add entitlement for it so right
now the main ones are does my app need
permission does my app need access to
user selected files do I need to get at
the Downloads folder maybe I you know I
want to watch the Downloads coming in
and automatically do something with them
secure bookmarks are specific locations
that user gives you permission to access
there's the personal information like
you know can I get to the users access
address book what where the location
with court location their calendar
information things like that can I get
to the music folder and I get to the
movies and pictures so I need network
access so I'm going to be a web server
do I want to be accessing the web from
my application I want to make network
connections to someplace and Alexa and
also devices may be in the camera
microphones printing so on and so forth
and last of all we have application
groups and scripting targets and
basically that means is that if you
write a suite of applications that need
to share resources then you have to do
some extra work to identify yourself to
the system that way so that's when we're
in entitlement it looks like so the
source of entitlements and for ensemble
we
that well first of all you have to opt
into the sandbox that's what the first
one is you're gonna get the story you
got to say you're in the sandbox the
second one is I want rewrite access the
files that the user selects and that is
because ensemble will generate an FPS
project for you based on the sample and
last one is Network client because we go
out to the net to read the Javadoc for
the for FX the FX API and that part
between the dick that's the part you
write the rest is boilerplate use a
pilla senator you don't have to worry
about that so so now what's a container
well every application gets one when you
install an app from the store then
container is created for that
application and it's in library 8 for
containers then your applications
identifier but you want to make sure
that you're not hard coding paths
because you know that's where it is
today they may change it in 10 9
I'm sorry and it's generally a bad idea
to hard coding fast in generals bad idea
all right okay
to really use containers properly you're
going to need some native code right now
that that's a solder is to it you would
hope that just calling system that get
property abuser got home would help
unfortunately it doesn't and that's a
bug right now and what you want to do so
you'll use it at home the implementation
looks up the UNIX level code that says
give you the users home directory and
you can have we get that but you're not
allowed to access that the sandbox
environment basically anything you know
try to create a file there or read a
file relative that happens gonna fail
which one is in its home directory or an
internet file manager call to find those
base directories and really we had
somebody write a an extension to our
launcher stuff that basically got all
this information passed and through his
properties that's one way to do it I
think for the specific use case if this
is important to you I think we'll be
better off writing the chunka native
code to get all this information
another thing after members in ESG file
chooser in the lake
one day file chooser his implementation
tries to get the list of all the files
in a directory which the sandbox
promptly says no you can't do that you
must use a native file dialog because a
native file dialog knows how to get it
knows how to add the files up the user
chooses to the sandbox and you know
without going the too much detail there
is a completely different implementation
of the native file dialog when you're in
sandbox environment to make this
possible so just know that you can't use
a file to you're gonna have to look at
you the dw5 dialogue or the FX file
chooser alright so now we know how to
get to the entitlements putting how we
take care of that well we use code sign
and we sign the application
and then we signed everything inside of
it is you have to you have to sign
everything and when you're in the sort
did that rope but here's a more specific
version hood
and again I'm using my private decent
password okay now we designed the with
send the application with my application
certificate now we have to go in and
find all the die lives and sign all
those as well
so this takes a while but I didn't put
verbose on but there you go it's not
that bad so now again I've got my food
signature and also down here my dairy
all right that's all these are not
ensign as well yeah that's great you
don't have to do that this is only in
the app alright so that's you know
that's sort of a summary version of it
what is slightly different for my
specific days here I mean although
options were the same I just built in
our ensemble the next order of business
is creating an installer package and
what you're doing is you're basically
making an archive of your app business
the thing you're gonna submit to the
store you're going to end up with a dot
EKG file and the actual command which
you write is right there in the middle
of product though the product definition
and plist I don't go into detail here
but if you look at the main page for
you'll see all kinds of details on it
but this is where you indicate you know
what a minimum OS version is there
certain hardware that you're only going
to work with there are a number of other
things like - archive I can't even begin
to list all of them but for Java apps
Minna at the very minimum you want to
specify an OS because again we simply
require 1074 so you can bake that into
your product definition and a user can
run the App Store and an older version
of 10-7 but they won't see your they
will not see your app unless you're at
least on 1074 so for that that's very
easy to
but this time when you do a product
build here you're saying start with
ensemble uh tap always installed it
slash applications sign it with your
installer certificate and here's my
product definition if you look up here
to see about pkg show up here in just a
moment
product field is also also useful for
creating a general-purpose installer
usually it's alright it's fine that week
a dragon's hope but you can also create
a dot pkg if you have additional things
to install other than your application
so I think here you go we got the
results here so it added the apple root
CA and the developer relations authority
because you have to get a chain much
like in Java and it rode out the are
gonna roll out our minimum version that
says three I think I meant to put pork
so now I've got a pkg and it's ready to
go
so the tested this all sounds
complicated but but there's a there's a
method to all of us right and the reason
is that if you do when you do all this
is what the user is going to go through
when they when the user now it all
happens behind the scenes when they
downloaded it from the store but you're
simulating what the US is going to do on
your behalf so to test it out you use a
pseudo installer and actually install it
into your system as if it came from the
store that's what the statutory argument
is and now what you wanna do is you
wanna try it out so once you do that and
you're on time that a you're all ready
to go so you've already got the sandbox
enable
now what you want to do is launch
console dot app and when you run what
you get is you look in the system blog
and actually in this case you want to
look in the diagnostic messages and run
your application if you've done
something wrong one of these lines here
will say sandbox teen with the
identifier for your app and tell you
what thing that what rule that you
violated and the cool thing is when you
do now this gives you more detail
there's this little arrow but in sandbox
D space it'll put a small stack trace in
at the point of failure so you can go
back to your code and figure out what
you did now if you're using the GRE we
have on to the effort to weed out all of
the obvious sandbox D violations and we
have quite a few just on starting up
we've gotten those taken care of if you
go to the 7u 10 all right that the JDK 7
pre-release site the JT 2 JDK you get
from there and the JRE is violation free
as far as we know that's why you need to
test your app it should be violation
free if you find something that isn't
that that's triggering a violation
please let us know well jump right on
what we think we've gotten off last
thing you have to do submit it you go to
iTunes Connect and create a new app and
see much ham leaving happens here
because I can spend another hour and
everything that you have to fill in for
iTunes Connect so you have to fill in
the name of the app a license agreement
we're going to sell it how much do you
want to sell it or what countries you
want to be able to sell it you need a
website for support oh and the other
thing I forgot to mention that you've
got a have a 1024 by 1024
for icon now so once you do all that
stuff get a app called application
loader and that will update though and
then you select your pkg file and what
this thing does is it goes through your
app and checks to see did you use any
private api's you know you didn't put
any PowerPC code in there things like
that and checks that you had all the
right sized icons in your free
application icon if any of these are
missing or wrong it just rejects it and
you have to start you have to try to fix
it and try again so that's why I'm
cloning all this stuff now because you
know you can get your app in the store
without the stuff done right problem if
all that was accepted congratulations
anybody here does that I will buy them a
beer that's where it sits it's work you
know and it's a brain exactly and that's
the point too is that it's not because
you're doing in Java right if you're in
if you were doing Objective C or
anything else you'd have the same
headache so you know the fact that
you're doing in Java you're not being
penalized everybody's paying this
penalty but the point of this talk is to
say that you can now do it in Java
don't feel like you have to run though
jacker see if this is important to you
for your distribution I'm sure a year
from now somebody will do be doing that
some windows 8 will be having a talk on
how to do this in Windows 8 and finally
sit back and wait and wait and we and we
wait and we travel to review it so after
all that here's what you'll take away
with a session at the very least please
consider looking in the native
applications for your develop for your
deployment choices particularly on the
Mac users are going to thank you windows
able to I mean I've not mentioned
Windows at all today but
with the commands I gave you you can
build a windows-based application as
well
get a dot MSI that you just double-click
and installs it in one spot you also can
do what is it on Linux you know commas
that Deb or dot yeah I forget not to but
but but we have Linux support as well
side of the store is sufficient for your
needs or if you want to go through that
level of work but please at least look
at developer ID I think that's I really
think that's a that's the core of what
you need to care about it right now
because if you just build an app and put
it on your website
you'll need at least a developer ID
signed application for users to be able
to run it without any problems either
way if you are going to deploy on Mac OS
10 you really want to buy a Mac
developer membership unless you're
unless you're absolutely positively sure
you're ever going to do applets and Web
Start you need to get a developer
program membership because that's the
only way you can get the certificates
you need to do the signing and sign a
nine dollars a year ago there was talk
at one time that there would be way for
a free develop for the free developer
membership to get at least developed
righties difficut I don't believe that
that's the case I think that was hoped
and I think people at Apple thought that
that was going to happen but that's not
the case
prepare for a lot of reading that you
can really go in deep down into a big
rabbit hole when it comes to
entitlements and what you can and can't
do in the sandbox environment but at the
very least you want to read up on
developer ID and gatekeeper that's the
end and I don't believe even you know
developer membership to do that some
initial resources so I started to help
my cards here
a proper is a tool from this company
called Ohana where that makes an
incredibly useful tool where if you
build your app with FX packager you just
drag it into this thing and check some
checkboxes it'll do all the work for you
cost $49 and that's the only reason I
hesitated to just say just get that
because and we don't endorse product so
that at Oracle but you know if you're
just doing this once once in a while
that $50 might save you a lot of time
you can easily make that up in the time
say it
it's very nice little pre verify
everything for you that you got the
right icon sizes they'll you know create
an entitlements for you sign it do all
the required product requirements and
when you're all done you get a dot pkg
the injustice Smith I think it's worth I
think I think it was worth going through
all the details because I think it's
important to know what you're getting
involved in in your application but the
actual mechanics of doing it this is not
a bad way to go if you don't want to if
you don't want to use Xcode these are
the three main tools that you're going
to use and I recommend that you read up
on those you want to get seven to ten
that build nine was recently released on
the JDK open JDK I'm sorry java.net that
has an fx packager that will
successfully package and create a native
application for you yes so I gave us I
gave a PDF to I think they're going to
be published eventually but I can see if
you give me a card I can send them to
you
I don't mind doing that okay it's time
for queuing okay
yeah you have to you have to start over
with your jars and use FX package or or
or the a plenary you cannot eat yet if
you build it with jaw with apples sup
look an Xcode that's not going to work
because it's going to rely on a private
primer okay so were you
let's see are you are you signing your
application with just developer ID huh
okay so there there are some additional
tools I think one it's like SP CTL there
these are all command-line tools and
basically what that will do is verify
actually code sign - B will actually
verify that the thing was signed it said
this is okay right there are additional
tools for turning on like the gatekeeper
quarantine environment and once you do
that you can get a little bit more
information and try to figure out what's
going on if it was accepted for
gatekeeper or you know specifically if
it was not I think it will tell you why
it did not the
if it feels it was not it's not because
of Java I don't think there's nothing
inherent about the the language or how
you built it it's gonna mean it's gonna
mean how you've signed it you didn't
have the JRE in the package that that
probably I don't think that'll matter
I don't think so for to proof or a DQ
for developer IDE
you might want to stop by at the one of
the FX booths tomorrow or we can try to
take a look that comes with the JDK
right fantastic
seven new ten JDK 7 java.net
you start there and then you can get
7010 pre-releases yep if you look in the
readme of a Jerry oh sorry
so is it can you legally redistribute a
Jerry if you look in the the read needs
of the GRE it will give you the terms
under which you can redistribute the
parts of the Jerry and they're very
explicit about you can strip all this
stuff out and FX packager here's to all
those all those rules
so okay we actually have a Java
deployment blog and I can I will try to
remember to put together a posting which
which has the Machado's commands maybe I
can expand on the example I was using
here because the code I have in Samba
that actually is part of the FX samples
are downloadable and I base it directly
out of that okay
yeah people been asking to do so I have
got one for gate keeper I haven't done
one for the absurd
the enterprise choice is actually not a
bad idea for what you're talking about
because it's easy to help eventually
have one administrator and they add
individuals who are allowed to access
that certificate and for $2.99 that's
not a bad deal
the tricky part is that when you sign
you've got to have a private key as well
as the certificate and again so they can
match up and you can't share that across
users sure oh yeah sorry anybody else
say again all right this way yeah that's
a tough question the retina display
support has to be handled at the job at
the 2d or the FX level not written
specifically if it's nothing specific
about the application I know that there
are additional properties you have to
put in short answers I don't have a good
answer for you right now I know people
are looking into it
no ensemble is not right now
I've seen so as I recall it will try to
scale it up in a bubble your app will
run at 1 pixel per 4 point and will try
to scale it up at the poor graphics
level so it'll probably look like you're
standing back pretty far hopefully fine
okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
