combine my own personal data such as a
Microsoft Excel file with curated data
that is already part of the business
intelligence data model recently my
company introduced some aggressive
discounting and new target revenues to
increase sales but the projections
aren't currently being tracked in our
business intelligence data model I
prepared two extracts that include the
new discount structure target revenue
projections and some new product
categories that I'm calling form factor
which can be mashed up with the
production model data uploading these
data sources and blending them with the
data model helps me figure out if the
projected revenue increases are in line
with the discounts data visualization
intuitively connects the new sources to
the existing model by matching
corresponding columns and identifying
measures and attributes the data source
diagram shows the data source connection
details data visualization has an array
of stunning visualization types from
which to choose as I select and add data
elements to the canvas data
visualization picks the best
visualization type for the set of data
elements and intuitively chooses the
best locations in which to place these
attributes and measures the scatter
chart shows me an upward trend in
revenue but I also want to see what
happens when I incorporate form factor
into the mix adding form factor shows me
the results and helps me see that my
projections for revenue and discount are
accurate next I'll create a pivot table
to do further analysis adding data
elements to the canvas and swapping a
data element helps me to discover how my
actions change the appearance of the
table and expose new relationships
it looks like the phones and education
form factors are showing the highest
amount of build units I'll keep going by
creating a new calculation to help me
see the actual increase in revenue I can
easily add data elements to the
expression by dragging and dropping or
double-clicking them
adding the calculation to the campus
really helps me to evaluate which form
factor will produce the highest revenue
I'll finish by saving the project in
this video I shows you how to create a
new project using data visualization
explore your data using different
visualization types add a new
calculation and mash up data sources to
