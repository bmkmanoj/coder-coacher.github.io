here with a Leo Bonazzi and today we're
going to present the oracle goldengate
adapter for coherence today's
presentation will start with an overall
description of the technologies that is
how does coherence work by itself and
how does the database work by itself and
then we'll segue into how the two work
together when the Golden Gate adapter
for coherence is involved in this
animation without the Golden Gate
adapter for coherence we see coherence
on the left and the database on the
right as you can see optics are being
inserted into the coherence cash but
they're not replicated to the database
those objects only exist in the
coherence cluster likewise objects in
the database can be persisted but they
only exist in the database unfortunately
those same objects may exist in both
places and changes to one or the other
are not propagated between the two now
if we look at the same animation with
the adapter we see it entering at the
bottom objects entered into a coherence
cash are then propagated via the
coherence of venting mechanism to the
other side and those same changes are
seen by the database likewise on vics
entered into the database are propagated
across the adapter and are seen by
coherence using this mechanism both
sides see identical data at all times
let's now look at an actual
demonstration using coherence 12c and
the Oracle database
hello my name is ali abbasi and i will
be walking you through the Golden Gate
adapter for coherence demo we will be
using a simple java application which
monitors are coherence cash which allows
users to store and retrieve employee
information using put and get empowered
consequent class connected to a schema
where the employee table is stored we
will store the new employee entries
using the java GUI application and we
will verify that the corresponding
oracle table has been populated by the
Golden Gate coherence adapter on the
other hand we will insert a new roles in
the employee table making sure that the
coherence cash is immediately updated
with the new entries we will also
perform updates and ease and verify that
those changes are propagated from the
database to the cash and vice versa
let's get started the demo takes a few
seconds to boot opening a few windows
however we will interact only with the
coherence cash monitor on the right side
of the screen and without a sequel Plus
that will be placed on the left side of
the screen using the cash Molitor
application we add a new employee to the
cash IP is ID one is named John and last
name Taylor we click the foot button and
the cash monitor displays the entry we
make sure that the new entrant has been
automatically stored in the table via
the Oracle gotta hate adapter by
entering a select statement in the
sequel class session
now we will taste the other side we add
a second employee feel English directly
into the article table using a sequel
insert as soon as we commit the
transaction the cash monitor on the
right side of the screen displays the
new entry to be sure we enter the number
two in the ID field and we click on the
get button the new employee is displayed
in the flesh monitor form we see that
insertions do work next we want to test
the dates in both directions in super
plus we update the first name of
employee number one changing is fist
name from John William as soon as we
commit the transaction we notice that
the Queen's cash is updated almost
instantly using the Queen sketch monitor
we are the third employee by the name of
Elizabeth Norton once again we verify
sequel plus that the employee table now
contains three rows
using super plus we attempt the deletion
we erase employee number two and we
commit the transaction almost
instantaneously the coherence cash
monitor reports the relation a single
deletion was successful now it is the
time to try multiple directions at once
in one atomic operation in sequel plus
we delete the remaining two employees
stored in the employee table again as
soon as the transaction is committed the
donations are reported by the cash
monitor this concludes the demo
