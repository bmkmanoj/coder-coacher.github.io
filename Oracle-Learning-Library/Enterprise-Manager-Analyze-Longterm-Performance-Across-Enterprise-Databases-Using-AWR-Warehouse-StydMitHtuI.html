warehouse a new feature of Oracle
Enterprise Manager
my name is Jagannath Raya I'm part of
the Enterprise Manager product
management team automatic workload
repository or aid of yarn as is
popularly known has been the de-facto
performance diagnostic tool for database
administrators and developers since
introduction of Oracle database 10g
Arabi our data contains performance
information about sequel sessions and
all the areas within the Oracle
databases that might potentially have
bottlenecks that allows the DBS with a
guided tools towards identifying
problems and guide them towards the
resolution one of the features of nobr
is the fact that it has a default
retention period which is the maximum
amount of data that is stored inside the
Oracle database for performance
information by default it is set to
eight days starting with Oracle database
11g seven days for 10g the challenge
with this retention period is that
database administrators are not able to
perform long-term performance analysis
such as comparing this quarters
performance with last quarters
performance which is a span of
performance that can span across three
months or more the traditional approach
that enterprises have done is they've
tried to either increase the retention
period which is caused additional
overhead on production environments
because now the database and
additionally to handling performance
workload has also needed to run these
queries on their a tabular data or they
have written custom tool to extract this
data which are often cumbersome and
difficult to maintain the architecture
of the area warehouse is that it is a
centralized warehouse recommended to be
separate from the Enterprise Manager
repository this warehouse is configured
for long term ABR data retention there
is an option with an Enterprise Manager
we
allows you to select the databases that
you want to configure for in a br
warehouse Enterprise Manager will then
collect the data from these database
AWR sources and will transport them into
the Adobe AIR warehouse allowing them to
be retained in it forever the ETL jobs
are monitored through the Enterprise
Manager job system and therefore
administrators can monitor the movement
of data and how well they're doing as it
goes from the source databases into aw
are these retention period can be
configured from weeks months or years or
be kept at the default setting off
forever now let's see a demonstration of
how you can configure any of your
warehouse within Enterprise Manager and
use some of which key performance
Diagnostics features within the
Enterprise Manager user interface what
we see here is the Enterprise Manager
databases page within the Enterprise
Manager user interface here we see the
list of databases that are monitored
through Enterprise Manager under the
performance menu there's a new entry
called in of your warehouse and I'm
going to select that
to configure the interviewer warehouse
page by default the message says
interviewer warehouse is not configured
and the status says not configured to
configure it I'm going to click on the
configure button to bring up the dialog
here it prompts me for the repository
database that could be used to store the
interviewer health data and also prompt
me for database and host credentials for
the repository database it is
recommended that version 12 102 is the
minimum database or 11 2 or 4 plus an
additional patch that is required to
enable and support a derby our warehouse
within it it is also recommended that
this interviewer warehouse database be
kept separate from the Enterprise
Manager repository so that the
performance data can be managed in
depend
off the enterprise manager IT operations
monitoring data I'm going to select the
database options and I'm going to select
812 102 database and configure that for
my 8 of your warehouse it's prompting me
for my credentials so I will use my
system near credentials along with the
host well if they come next which brings
me to the snapshot retention period
screen here I can configure snapshots to
be retained forever or I can click on
the limited period button and select
specific time periods for which I want
to configure in this case I'm going to
leave it as a default option forever and
I'm going to submit my job at this point
a job has been submitted to Enterprise
Manager to configure the interview
warehouse and instantiate the necessary
schema objects to support the storage of
either be our data coming from different
sources
I have not yet added the set of
databases and which is what I'm going to
do next to check if the job has
configured I'm going to click on refresh
in a warehouse repository is not
configured and it's ready to be used
I'm going to next click on the databases
icon which allows me to add the
databases which I want to send in a bar
snapshots to on a regular basis to add
them I'm going to click on the Add
button and select the databases from the
list of databases it's as simple as that
adding these databases will by default
bring the database interview our data
into the interviewers warehouse
automatically and we will keep track off
the snapshots and this progress in the
second part of this demo now at this
point we have configured it'll be our
warehouse and what we're going to do see
next is I'm going to start by looking at
a fully configured in a beer warehouse
which is already collecting snapshots
from different database sources and show
you how a database administrator can use
that to navigate to different
and view the performance data both
locally and stored inside the air view
our warehouse this is a fully configured
screen of an Arab your warehouse
repository page which has stored data
from different sources the first number
that you see is the size of the
interviewer snapshots that have been
uploaded into the Arab air warehouse the
second represents the number of
databases that have been configured to
contribute to the Adobe AIR warehouse
the third is the open incidents that are
currently on the warehouse and the
fourth is the set of databases that have
been configured without any recent
uploads these are potentially databases
that have been configured but are not
uploading data into the powerhouse
reason now this could be that the
snapshots is disabled or potentially
these are databases from which an
ability that has not been received and
therefore both are potentially sources
to be investigated on the chart that you
see on top represents a time view of the
day to be our snapshot that have been
collected over the different days and so
it allows me to see how many snapshots
am I getting on a daily basis at the
bottom of the screen we see the set of
databases that have been added for the
awr warehouse I can see the database
name target name the type of database
with a single instance clustered
database and its version along with the
oldest and the most recent snapshots and
the number of days and the number of
snapshots that have been posted into the
illiberal repository next we will look
at a specific database and see how you
can view the performance data from both
a local awr as well as the interviewer
warehouse through the database
performance pages which most database
administrators used today to you to
monitor the performance of the Oracle
database in this case I'm gonna pick DB
3 1 4 I select it and then here I have
different options these are the
performance pages that are now enabled I
have at analytics and Abby are reporting
pair period and performance home I'm
going to start with the page that DB is
used most free
quickly which is the performance hole
when I select a performance home it
brings up the database db3 one for
performance page note that I see there's
an option which says view data
historical in a warehouse if I select
that I notice I have so had the options
to go real-time or historical which is
coming from local database stored inside
the databases own integrator or I can go
to the area warehouse data which is not
part of the user interface what I'm
going to do next is I notice that the
time period of interest now goes back
from June 20th all the way up to June
30th which is much more than the default
retention period of 8 days for this
particular database I can go back and
click June 20th and then view the data
for that particular day as you can see
I'm not constrained by the default
retention period here now let's take a
look at another capability which is
something that a business really use to
monitor their data which is run AWR
reports on this particular database now
I have several options to run the a
tabular report I can go back to the
performance page select it up door and
run a tabular report the other option is
for me to go and run this report
directly from the ear of your warehouse
page in either case both of them bring
me to the same page in which case I can
select either the historical data or the
warehouse data and the run the
performance for the particular time
period I'm going to run my in tabular
report for a specific time period that
is from the data that is stored inside
the aid of your warehouse and when do
that by selecting snapshot and then
picking a specific you know be our
snapshot having selected this period I'm
now going to generate this report which
is now instead of running against the
database you know your data is gonna run
against the in over your warehouse data
for that particular database as you can
see is gives me a standard area report
which identifies the specific snapshots
that have been included for the purpose
of analyzing the database workload and
then gives me the specific analysis of
the performance of the sequel's
and the date of this performance during
that particular time period next I'm
gonna go back to my interview warehouse
page simply by selecting performance you
know you are in a warehouse I now have
the options of picking the same database
and then running other reports such as
compare period atom or the standard
compare period area report I will pick
the compare premium atom report note
that I need to keep track of where the
data sources I can either run against
the local 8 of your data or the eight of
your warehouse data let me enter a
period one week after my original
interval report date and then compared
to the performance of the date of my
interviewer period I've picked June 28th
from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and I'm
gonna pick the same period which is
offset by one week so it will run a
performance for performance analysis
comparing the performance of the
database stored in the aid of your
warehouse from last month to a period a
week before that when I run this report
I see that it shows me that there's
different database time for those two
time period I also see differences of
sequel commonality which are different
which means it's running 56 percent of
sequels are different so I can then see
what was it that caused performance to
be different one we ago versus that me
and my period of interest and thereby
analyzed them for further analysis but
those database administrators are
looking for a more detailed analysis I
can run the compare period report which
actually compares which runs the Adobe
AIR report for the two time periods as
well which is also available through the
performance screen by clicking interview
are running compare period report
selecting the appropriate interview
warehouse as a source and then providing
the snapshots for those time periods and
running the same report as well let me
move on to the final feature off the
Arabella report which is the ash
analytics capabilities ash analytics as
you know was introduced in Enterprise
Manager 12c to allow database
administrators to get more detailed
analysis of their performance by
different dimensions such as different
sequel IDs different weight classes user
sessions and to do all that through the
Enterprise Manager user interface do we
graphically represent the data instead
of analyzing the textual interview
report to do that I can now select my
source from being the local you know
Bureau data and now pick the historical
a tabular data now I can go and do a
long-term analysis and see what is my
performance characteristics look like
over different points in time to look at
the interviewer performance across the
entire time period I can do that by
selecting the custom option I can now
enter the period of interest now I can
see the data for the entire time period
represented and the different
performance characteristics of the
database shown by the particular time
period I can use the action analytics
capabilities by zooming in into my
period of interest which is around June
21st and figure out what was the
performance then and compare this to the
performance on June 28th for the same
time period as well to see what was
different so all these capabilities are
now available through Asha analytics
which means that all the performance
analysis that I was doing on my ash
analytics screen for a standard
interview our retention period is now
extended and available through the Adobe
AIR warehouse data which is available
through the aid of your warehouse
apposite or e so let's summarize what
we've seen in the demo as you can see
the awr warehouse provides a dashboard
to configure the inner warehouse
it also provides an ability to keep
track of the different Arabi our data
sources allows the user to view it on
one page so there they can keep track of
which databases are
generating the Arabelle data allowing
the user import them into the area of
warehouse it also allows the user to
navigate from the Illyria warehouse page
into the key database performance pages
such as the database performance page
the interview report page analytics and
the compare period Adam and the compare
period report page notice that the ALW
warehouse the data is completely
integrated into the Enterprise Manager
database performance screens whereby the
user can easily navigate from the
database performance paid coming from
the databases on a tabular data into the
database performance data coming in from
the interview warehouse repository and
because all this data is being stored
inside the innovator warehouse
long-term analysis will no longer have
any impact on your source databases
which means users can then from all the
analysis where there's across a month
across weeks or across ears and do that
within the air barrier house without
impacting any of their production system
