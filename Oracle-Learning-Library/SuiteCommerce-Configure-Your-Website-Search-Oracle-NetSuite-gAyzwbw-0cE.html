want them to quickly find the products
are looking for the key for this is an
efficient search service that returns
valid results there are three main
factors that impact the search results
these are the shoppers search string the
item search settings and your products
catalog although you can't control their
search strings you can make an educated
guess of what we'll search for and
configure the settings accordingly so
e-commerce advanced lets you configure
items search with your preferences and
enhance the item search capabilities of
your website during this video we are
going to configure search fields select
and configure sort fields and select
facet fields to help me with my
configuration I want to download a list
of field sets and I can get that list
from the field set reference topic in
the Help Center the easiest way to get
there is to search the Help Center for
field set reference click the field set
list XLS file to download it let's take
a quick look at this workbook it lists
all available fields for facets sorting
and keyword search it also includes
fields available for field sets and the
details such as field IDs and field
types this is an important reference for
configuring the search engine the first
step is to configure search fields to
complete this step you should have
identified the item record fields that
contain keywords shoppers might use when
searching for products you configure
search fields on the website setup
record at setup suite commerce advanced
setup website and then click the Edit
link next to the site then on the
website setup record click the search
index sub tab and our settings are on
the search fields sub tab that's we
provides default search field settings
to get you started however it is highly
recommended that you reconfigure the
search fields based on the data in your
item records you can add or remove
search fields by clicking the add or
remove buttons I want to add name and
set the type of match to starts with
exact
you can reorder the search fields by
clicking a row and dragging it to the
position that you want if the default
setting is relevant to your website then
don't make any changes when a search is
initiated in the webstore the system
searches based on the order of the
search field sub lists it's important
that you don't add an excessive number
of search fields because it can take
longer to search and include less
relevant items in the search results
adding a relevant type of match for a
search field is an equally important
step because it impacts the relevance
ranking of each result for best results
to find exact matches at the top of the
list for unique item fields such as SKU
or UPC starts with exact is the best
type of match a shopper might search for
a product for which he already knows the
product code exact match is good for the
online name field where there are
chances that a shopper will remember the
full name and provide the exact search
string but you also need to add another
type of match such as keyword for the
online name field because the shopper
might remember only part of the name for
fields with a lot of text such as the
detailed description field the keyword
type is sufficient because the shopper
might enter only a few keywords and
would never enter the exact description
for items to be searchable in your
website item fields that you have under
search fields should have values
assigned to the money item record let's
look at an item record to confirm that
the setup is correct we need to verify
that the field on the item record and
the field in our search fields sub lists
are the same here's an example the field
ID for the web store display name field
on the item record is a store display
name on the spreadsheet we see the store
display name field ID is used by the
online name which we used in our search
field
sub lists the second step is to
configure your sort fields sort fields
let a shoppers sort the search results
by that field instead of sorting by the
default relevance field it may not
always be obvious on which fields you
should or shouldn't sort but you need to
ensure that all item records contain
data for the field to choose a sort
fields especially if you select an item
record fields where a value is
shanell to configure the sort fields you
need to add the sort filter under the
search index this step enables sorting
for that field you also need to
configure sort fields this step makes
the sort field available to shoppers in
the Suite commerce advanced webstore you
add sort fields on the website setup
record at setup suite commerce advanced
setup website and then click the Edit
link next to the site and click the
search index sub tab and the sort field
sub tab NetSuite provide the default
settings to get you started relevance
and online customer price for the
pre-configured sort fields and relevance
is selected by default in the webstore
relevance is a required sort option and
you cannot remove it from the list
you can add a sort field by selecting
the field from the list and clicking the
Add button and you can remove a sort
filled by clicking the row and then
clicking the remove button if the
default setting is relevant to your
website don't bother making any changes
if you're adding additional sort fields
you must also add the sort order for
that field you can select either a
sending or descending order as the sort
order you configured to sort fields on
the Suite commerce configuration record
at setup suite commerce advanced
configuration then select the website
and domain and in the suite commerce
configuration record click the Search
tab and the results sorting sub tab
notice that we can set sort options for
desktop phone and tablet
here I have already set up sort options
for the online price which we previously
added to our sort fields on the website
setup record notice the price level five
in the ID column this comes from the
field ID column from the sort fields on
the website setup record the colon and
the abbreviation ASC specifies that this
item sorts ace ending and notice that on
the next line I specify descending order
by adding DBS see after the colon the
value I enter in the name field for each
row is the description that website
visitors see on the website when they
choose a sort option and you can see
that in this example the third step is
to configure your facet fields and to
complete this step you should have
identified the item record fields that
shoppers can use to efficiently narrow
search results with faceting multiple
FAFSA values are made available for each
type of item field selected as a facet
when a shopper clicks a facet value the
search results are reduced to only the
items that have that value and
additional clicks continue to narrow
down the search results to configure the
facet fields go to setup suite commerce
advanced setup website click Edit next
to your suite commerce advanced site
click the search index sub tab and then
select the facet fields sub tab you can
add a faster filled by selecting it from
the list and then clicking the Add
button
or you can remove a facet field by
clicking the road to select it and then
clicking the remove button when you
finish managing facet fields click Save
on the website setup record and this
triggers the search engine index process
there are a couple of things to keep in
mind with facet fields only certain
fields on item records are supported for
faceted navigation but you should always
avoid faceting on fields that have a
large number of possible values and it's
also important that you not add an
excessive number of facet fields because
it can impact performance now let's put
this to practical use and see it in
action on a website I'll enter mojo
final shirt in the search field and we
see that the Moto flannel shirt has
returned as the first item in the list
this is because of the exact match for
online name that we created in the
search fields we see a few other items
returned and those are because of the
keyword match for the online name field
notice that those have lower precedence
in the list depending upon the number of
keywords next I'll search for a specific
SKU and we see that it is the only item
returned if I look at the details for
the item I see the SKU here
now let's do a keyword search for the
word corduroy and that returns two items
if we look at the details we see the
keyword corduroy in the detailed
description finally let's do one last
search and apply the facet filters to
the search results here are my search
results for the word pant notice that as
I select filters the search results
narrow to only items that match those
facet filters when I select black the
results are random - only black pants
and when I select men that the results
narrow further to display only black
men's pants when Google Analytics is
enabled on your account you can see
analysis of your visitor search terms to
see this analysis log into your
analytics account and go to behavior
site search search terms
by analyzing search terms you may
identify areas in your site search that
you can tweak to provide even more
relative search results to your visitors
