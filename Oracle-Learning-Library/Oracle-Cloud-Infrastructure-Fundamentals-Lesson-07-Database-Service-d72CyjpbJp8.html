cloud infrastructure database service in
this session for this lesson we will
look into the fundamentals of the Oracle
database system or database systems
instances on the Oracle cloud
infrastructure we'll go over the various
types and characteristics of the
database systems an Oracle cloud
infrastructure and go over how to launch
an instance we'll also look into the
various types of database systems
ranging from VMs to Exadata
to bare metal shapes including rack and
we'll go over what you need to know in
order to launch a system for yourself
which is part of the hands-on lab at a
very high level there are three types of
database systems offered by Oracle cloud
infrastructure first is the bare metal
database systems that come in two major
flavors database systems come up with
single node shapes and there's also a
two node rack shape available the second
type of system is the VM base SE shapes
which supports single or two node
cluster operations the third type of
Oracle database system on Oracle cloud
infrastructure is exudative shapes which
come in quarter half and fold racks
Oracle database services is backed by
robust infrastructure and is capable of
handling mission-critical production
workloads this includes three
availability of mains and multiple
regions currently active redundancy can
be implemented the features like Data
Guard configured to operate across
available availability domains the
networking that back sees data system
database systems along with every other
system in Oracle cloud infrastructure
there's a fully non-blocking
fully contextualized multi tenant with
full isolation between networks network
isolation is accomplished through op off
box networking which allows bare metal
hosts along with database systems and
engineered systems like Exadata to
participate virtual networks without
needing V switch software or other such
techniques installed on the host for
multi node shapes the cluster networking
is dedicated database systems are
protected by either two or three way
mirroring storage setups
the database systems can be brought a
standalone or in a rack cluster which is
entirely configured and managed by the
database service in addition to rack
Exadata systems are also instantiated
and managed by the service because these
systems are fully managed they are
ma-maa or maximum availability
architecture compliant and fully
supported dynamic cpu and storage
killing features are available as well
as the ability to upsize Exadata court
deployments across shapes CPU core usage
can be changed hourly to right size the
database systems and also the storage
usage on VM based shapes can be scaled
up at any time up to 40 terabytes for
security there are a number of features
and capabilities as well built into the
service there are as part of identity
services users groups and compartments
and policies which can share our isolate
the database system with fine based
roles and controls it goes down to being
able to deal with database homes or
whether or not to be able to patch or
backup the system very granular set of
policies there's also networking
security which has implicit off box
networking which allows for isolation as
well as well as having security lists on
a non host firewalls in place and
there's no there's no need to use public
networking if you don't want to for your
database service licensing flexibility
is also available here with the bring
your own license option so either the
database service that you start can
charge you for the Oracle Isis user you
can indicate that you bring your own
license and to just pay for the instance
cost itself all the database systems and
OCS can be managed by existing tools
that you're familiar would say like
sequel developer Enterprise Manager and
impress manager Express as part of of
these systems and it pretty much acts
for all the monitoring that exists
author for on-premise database exact
acts exactly the same way so going over
what kind of use cases are suitable for
bringing over to what kind of database
these cases are suitable for bringing
things into Oracle cloud infrastructure
database because there's such a wide
range of database systems and they're
fully you know compliant supported and
curated by Oracle in terms of their
configuration pretty much any
Stingo based on Oracle as a candidate
for coming over to Oracle cloud
infrastructure anything mission-critical
will be brought to Oracle cloud
infrastructure database systems very
large databases are okay
what scaling an accident currently going
up to eight storage knows I was all
right eight compute nodes 336 cores
twelve storage servers six terabytes of
RAM 150 terabytes of Flash one petabyte
of raw disk and 330 terabytes of usable
storage with three-way mirroring on um
database consolidation is perfect for
for the database service you know we
offer a version 11 12 1 and 12 2
container on you know CD b you know
pluggable databases are supported so all
this stuff is pretty much written with
consolidation in mind of LTP and data
warehousing analytics and reporting all
good use cases for for Oracle cloud
infrastructure database along with their
adjunct you know workloads any of the
VMS or systems that hang off there you
know in the case where you have you know
other application servers are around
they can be brought up on bare metal on
supported images on Oracle cloud
infrastructure so there's a lot of OCI
database services have a lot of general
applicability for these things the
database service is also idea to bring
Apps unlimited types of applications
e-business suite JD Edwards PeopleSoft
and Siva all these are good candidates
to move into Oracle cloud infrastructure
database these applications all have a
growing set of tools to assist customers
and lift and shift and move and improve
from home premise to Oracle cloud
infrastructure so there's a few tools
that we're developing for each of these
that help basically migrate these
applications onto OCIO smaller shapes
and non-clustered shapes are ideal for
test and development and certification
efforts addition is possible test out
very large database systems without
having to deal with procurement to see
it all say good the next day to bring me
a lot better performance you know you
don't have to buy all that hardware you
can actually try it out on a monthly
basis
database systems on OC I can be managed
with any existing tools again
manager 13c for clouds control same as
on-premise systems database systems can
be configured with data guard you know
Dana bombed Golden Gate all that stuff
works with our man so all of your normal
kind of DB a backup restoring management
type tooling it's all present on the
system and all the custom tooling and
scripts that go around that will all
work with our database service so in
general the flexibility for suitable
workloads is really there and and the
shapes offer kind of a whole gamut of
small VM all the way up to full rack of
exadata again the three types database
systems on the on the platform basically
ranging from VM to to bare metal servers
to bare metal servers with racks all the
way up to exadata so with all these
shapes they operate under the same API
there's no special invitations for the
various shapes the tooling is the same
API is the same the console is the same
the workflows are the same when
orchestrating would say terraform or
scripts the resource type is going to be
the same thing so let's say you know you
could basically have scripts that cater
to test and development and then you
could have production scripts and they
can be pretty much the same type of
script with just different shapes in
them again you can manage these things
with things like Enterprise Manager or
you know you know we got the API you can
do it with a console you can do it with
you know things like sequel developer
will work and then we also have a DB CLI
which basically is on each database
system where this tool is available to
fund end all the operations of all the
database instances on the on the system
taking a look at database service on VMs
database on VMs offer kind of a wide
range of flexibility for the database
you could do single instances or two
node rack shapes you know not all these
workloads out there and need dedicated
in bare metal servers some a lot of
customers have asked for cost-effective
easy to get started durable database
option
and vm's are well-served suited for this
for the variety of workloads ranging
from real proof concept type things to
dev and test environments to production
small production applications VM
database shapes accommodate all these
types of workloads the database service
on VM is very full-featured all these
instances are run on VMs of software
convenient figured with you know
standard enterprise exceed all the way
up to extreme edition the database
service on VM is built with the same you
know high performance enterprise
security and enterprise-grade security
highly durable and using the same
infrastructure that the rest of the
shapes use and you have a lot of good
flexibility with storage on the VM you
can actually scale that live all the way
from 256 gig to up to 48 terabytes raw
with 40 terabytes usable and that's all
being backed up by block so you know you
get a really good durability box there's
at least three copies of everything
written out to disk when it's persisted
we also see that with the higher shapes
like the sixteen and then we get the M
service on the second-generation shapes
we're gonna see up to 24 threats CPUs
per 48 threats actually that 2400 CPUs
per per VM that's how high the VM scale
so and with that scaling comes
additional networking bandwidth and
double the memory as well so we have a
really good wide range of where the VM
based database shapes can go from and to
so again with the VMS very
cost-effective flexibles users can start
as a single CPU Oh CPU go all the way to
16 they're only gonna pay for the CPUs
and storage used so that's another good
ways where you can get your feet wet
what's a system that can grow out a
scale out to quite quite large without
having to start with a big price point
it's very easy to get started they're
still oracle certified they're fully
featured 11g 12 one and 12 2 are all
available on each of these systems in
any Edition that's that's desired when
you go with the multi node setup it's a
rack configuration and it's fully
supported users and
traders can get full root access to the
systems so basically bring your standard
tools and and scripts and manage the
database that way when storage is
actually scaled out from say some some
smaller amount to a larger amount
there's there's no hit associated with
that which is actually very convenient
so you can write size your storage at
any time and customers will still get
the advantages of the identity service
where you can create policies around
these systems so the policy set
available for VMs or larger systems is
going to be the same and then also with
the virtual cloud networking or vcn our
security list can restrict who can
contact these systems on the network as
well so there's there's no real features
that are missing when you're going with
VMs and with the largest VM shapes we're
starting to get into the territory of
smaller bare metal instances so that you
know have a nice range of scale for for
VM based shapes there are two main types
of bare metal database systems the first
is a single node database systems which
consists of one metal servers running
Oracle Linux 6 8 has locally attached
nvme storage these are very durable
storage devices these are the least
expensive types of systems that aren't
VM based and it's kind of recommended
for test and dev environments if the
node fails you can basically launch
another system and restore from backups
that's pretty easy to do or you know
once we've done our backups which are
automated at this point you have to you
can select them when you create a
database system is to back up to object
store and you can basically use that as
a clone so you can take that that backup
and restore it to any other database
system and then we also have the two
node rack based systems which are two
bare metal servers running ol6 8 it's a
fully full rack configuration all the
grid setups and the cluster where and
all the ASM and all the fabric
interconnects for
for networking and all the heartbeats
and everything that all that
complexities already done for you and
it's done in a managed way the the
storage is directly attached as well and
the cluster provides an automatic
failover so that's all set up as well
and this these additions to support
these types of shape support allow
Enterprise editions so except extreme
performance is pretty much required for
using these shapes and with these with
these sooner rack systems in one of the
region's we have 24 terabytes of SSD and
the other regions there are 64 terabytes
of SSD raw storage available for those
shapes you can see within bare metal
shapes for the for the high i/o we have
single x86 server 36 cores half a
terabyte of RAM and 12 terabytes Vestas
nvme SSD for 4 devices you can still
scale between two and thirty six cores
for CPU usage on that high i/o dense I
offers double the capacity with nine
nvme devices again these are all set up
for you with ASM so you'll have to deal
with partitioning and dealing with you
know how the how the discs are set up
that's already done for you and then in
a two node rack shape you see that we
have two servers for a total of 72 girl
of course 512 gigs each and scales from
up to 64 terabytes of SSD and the
interconnect on those are dedicated
InfiniBand so there's no shared
networking there so all the interconnect
networking is completely non-blocking
and dedicated so that gives you a scale
out from for 272 cores on that on those
shapes this is how the storage is set up
on the OCI database systems ASM is
directly interfaced with the disks we
don't they just start mounted on a CF a
CFS or any other type of files system so
that's gonna provide a little bit more
IO speed by doing that some resources
such as wallets and and and you know
database homes and the binaries for that
are all stored in a common store area
but the data and recovery areas for the
databases are stored with enhance them
the storage of continuously monitor for
any failures with the disk these disks
are basically their nvme or SSDs in the
case of VMs when you're using let's say
H a the same type of configuration is
used but the block volumes are backing
up those VM based database systems any
discs that fail any disk failures are
detectives going to be managed the space
usage is calculated based on a amount of
free space that has to be reserved for
rebalancing if any other disk fails and
maintaining a two or three way mirror of
every extent so you know every time you
look at the maximum amount of usable
space in the data or recovery areas that
rebalancing has already been taken to
account and then the root user has
complete control over the storage
subsystem so custom and customization
and tuning is possible but but by
default the database service will set
these up in an optimal way so here's an
overview of with normal or 2-way
mirroring and with high or three-way
mirroring storage configurations how
much is going to be left to be usable
for raw versus what's actually there so
again the the recovery area you know
that fraeno fast recovery recovery and
redo and all that stuff dedicated and
then also when you're creating instances
you have a choice of whether to use 40%
of the total storage for data or 80% and
that leaves that either that's 60 or 20%
over for recovery and the purpose of
that is either do you want to be able to
backup the database to itself or do you
want to just you know do a little bit
more you'll have a larger data set and
then have to do off system backups for
full backups so those are your choices
and then again when you when you're
looking at that we can use ASM CMD on
the system you can log in go in as the
grid user and and check out how ASM is
dealing with these disks but basically
this is after all the reservations have
been made at all those recovery areas
are set up for you know are set up for
20 or 60 percent of the disk for
for all those recovery area type
operations and then you know you have
the reserved amount for if you were to
lose a disk how much space has to be
left for rebalancing the the the system
so that's already taken counsel this is
what's usable after all all the utility
storage and all the other types of
reservations have been taken to an
account in addition to VMs and bare
metal hosts and rack shapes we also have
Exadata available on OC i exadata
systems are provided in three shapes and
all of them have the advanced options
that excavator provides turned on so
there's not like it's not crippled where
it's basically everything that you would
have on an on-premise system all of its
been turned on all the features they're
fixable the these are actual physical
exadata engineered systems complete with
the infinite network and dedicated and
scalable storage and compute nodes and
these all can be run on OCI with
modification the complete isolation of
tenants is isolated so for whenever
partials REITs use like quarter or half
rack the the system has been set up so
that there's no sharing of resources at
all so you know each of those users will
get their own storage and compute nodes
and the networking will have been
partitioned correctly so that they can't
interfere with anyone else and they'll
have complete access to their portion of
the system so Exadata on OCI gives you
all these features these can
capabilities and flexibility of arm from
AXA David's back Chua offering as a
cloud service all the installation from
systems to firmware to OS to install
maintenance and patching all that's but
it's going to be managed by Oracle and
presented as a service so there's no
reason for you know users to worry about
managing the system itself they're just
gonna be dealing with a database piece
you know dealing with users and dealing
with their database homes and dealing
with their tables and that's that's
where they live and then the rest of the
management of the system is taken care
of by Oracle cloud infrastructure so we
see here that exadata systems are
offered in a in a full range of
configurations and each of these
configurations consists of certain
number of compute and storage nodes so
for
for the smaller shapes you know three
storaged half six full twelve and then a
number of compute nodes two four and
eight and that it kind of gives you that
idea that scaling here it's very nice to
be able to try out Exadata for databases
you know for people who have database
that haven't tried on I sedated it's
really approachable to you know grab a
corner rack and try it out for a month
and then see how the performance goes so
that's been a pretty favorable with
customers each compute node here are
configured so that users have root
access to a virtual context on their on
their computer note so the idea is that
while this is a shared system they're
completely dedicated therefore the
portion that there are allotted there
the system is completely dedicated in
terms of performance and sizing of
memory and disk and flash is all for
that particular user
so while users have you know access to
the root on those virtual contexts and
all this they do not have administrative
access to exudate infrastructure
components like the physical compute
nodes the networking switches the PDUs
the lights-out management all that stuff
those again are all managed by Oracle so
it takes a lot of the management
overhead and Karen feeding operations
and and Oracle is taking care of that
for operators and administrators will
have full administrative privileges for
their databases and you can connect your
databases via public or private IPS or
both
you know the networking very flexible in
these networks as well you know users
again are responsible for database
administration tasks and you know
creating more database instances and
managing databases and doing backups how
they want all that can be configured by
the by the administrators of the system
you can also customize how the default
automated maintenance is set up so you
can you know set up how how patches are
apply when when maintenance occurs so
you have control over that even though
it's a managed system you don't have to
take any outages or hits that you don't
want to take so this table shows what
database editions of versions are
various are available to the various
shapes so basically for Exadata you're
going to be using extreme performance
and then for any of the rack shapes for
note
VMR bare-metal can be using that as well
but for bare-metal systems our vm single
node systems you can bring any addition
that you want and for all these you can
bring your own license so any of these
are able to to be used with bring your
own license another thing to note is
that multiple editions or homes of the
databases can be done on the same system
so if you have you have like 311 twos
and one 12:1 and 312 twos and all get
their own homes and the nice thing about
that is that you know patching and
lifecycle and stuff can be done on a per
database instance per home basis so you
don't have to take hits across the whole
thing if you don't want so for
provisioning and patching we have a few
few guidelines here provisioning systems
are packed with the current patch a
database bundle or PSU all the critical
one-offs are done so when you start a
new instance up all that's taken care of
for you and then for patching a
lifecycle for patching you just don't
you don't need to research the required
package patches firmware and database
patches are already collected for you
and so for system and OS now firmware
and OS type patches are queued up and
then for database homes each one will
will end up having you know the patch
agent go in and figure out what patches
apply to your to your database instances
and allow you to stage those pre apply
them for pre-check and then apply them
and if they fail roll them back so all
that's handled so how this kind of
typically works is you know patches are
automatically queued up for the systems
themselves the software repositories are
automatically updated OS updates are
then optionally oh there you can control
when they're apply but they're applied
then gritted for structure updating
occurs and then firmware updates can be
applied for you again whenever you want
to take that no hit and then finally
database instances are updated you can
do once or one at a time however you
want to do it so all that stuff really
if you think about managing all that
kind of stuff on premise it's a lot of
work and there's a lot of infrastructure
to build to handle that and then all of
that comes in with the Oracle cloud
infrastructure database service well
this is an overview of the various
security features that are implemented
for the Oracle cloud
structured database service instances
are completely isolated on their bare
metal host so there's no multi-tenant
for any of the bare metal ships there's
no notional multi-tenancy in the case of
exadata exadata systems are partitioned
completely so there's no exposure
between tenants or performance
implications for doing that there in the
case of shared infrastructure with
database on VMs the database systems are
completely isolated from one another via
the host and networking is being done
with a pass-through so so basically here
you have the optics networking
virtualization working to keep that
isolation right up to the host and then
those come in on virtual functions into
the host so that the networking
isolation is very robust on those VM
based shapes again on the physical
networking side those that's completely
virtualized and done off box
you know database database systems can
be can be completely isolated or put
into into networks that are shared in
the tenancy or they can be completely
isolator or only access through through
a specific gateway or and they can be
done through a bastion host okay can be
highly walled off or they can be shared
liberally in addition to the implicit
isolation that's there you know we can
we can also use policies to kind of
regulate which users of the cloud
infrastructure can actually either see
the device read it management updated
manage it or update it so there's a
whole bunch of granular controls that
are implemented to keep people out both
on the network and on the policy side
for off cloud networking dynamic routing
gateways can be used to connect the vcn
in cloud networks to other locations
either via dedicated circuits through
fast connect or they can be done through
have sex PPN and then they data
encryptions on by default so transparent
data encryption is already handled on
all the database shapes the wallets are
managed when you start and stop or
restart the server they automate
basically giving the right keys to the
system to boot up but those wallets are
set up in the common store area and then
if you want to use a wallet manager or
something else that you're used to using
you can do that but a lot of the
hanging up and restoring and all that
all that encryption stuff is being
handled but that is all on by default so
in addition to the actual kind of
encryption going on at the database
level the object storage and and the
block storage are all encrypted at rest
and also all the networking between the
host and and those systems that
implement block and object storage those
are encrypted and flight as well so all
this is on by default I've for
performance reason if TDE has to be
turned off it can be it can be done but
by default all the all the databases and
tables face that come up by default are
going to be encrypted and also there's a
fairly robust auditing infrastructure in
place you can hold hold auditing events
for both the console on the API for up
to year and then for monitoring the
database instances themself beyond what
the agents already do about you know if
the backup fails or not some job goes
wrong or if it's working or if it's
taking too long all that kind of stuffs
being monitored by the database service
but in addition to that you can use your
monitoring tools or you can use things
like Enterprise Manager to kind of keep
tabs on your systems as well so you both
have the you know the auditing to see
who's doing what would the infant at the
infrastructure level then you have the
you know the logging and management
stuff that goes on that can go on on an
assistant / system basis and because
these are bare metal hosts or you know
they're not any different than your
regular on premise data basically your
normal set of tools can be used you just
have to basically get the agent in there
and you're and you're good to go
so basically we've covered all those
kind of features and shapes of the of
the database system basically launching
a database is easiest under the console
it can also be done through terraform it
can be done with the OCI CLI we have
SDKs Python Ruby and Java that these are
all capable of starting database systems
but on the console it's pretty easy to
start just go to the database systems
tab you basically give the system a name
pick an availability domain
pick one of your shapes for the
exudative rack VM or bare metal
choose your your software Edition and
your license type or whether you want to
bring your own license select your core
accounts so the core count can range
anywhere from the smallest number of
cores for the given shape they have up
to the maximum you select your client
now subnet and if you have you know an
exudate of shape you have to I have a
second subnet for backups
he's didn't you select a hostname name
your database set your database admin
password whether it's like whether you
want on about back automatic backups on
or off and then you start the system so
the stuff is very easy to start and then
all that cluster where and grid
configuration and disk configuration and
all that stuff and the patching and the
inventory and all that stuff's being
done for you and then when the you know
the system comes up you can a few multi
node shape you can select the nodes
login to them individual if you have a
you can create additional databases of
any typing one eleven to twelve one or
twelve to create more of those and
they'll each get their own home and so
their life cycles can be managed
separately and then the listeners so
they'll all be by default by 1521 but
each of those databases you bring up
additionally will get their own
listeners so that's all everything that
I'm talking about here is automated for
you so it's it's really quick to get a
fairly complex system that's enterprise
grade and and production well up in a
very short period of time so for this
lesson we we were kind of went over the
following we went over how to describe
the options shapes and types of database
systems in Oracle cloud infrastructure
we learned about some of the features of
the Oracle cloud infrastructure database
systems and you know about backups and
and how racks automatically in failure
and all that and then we're now prepared
