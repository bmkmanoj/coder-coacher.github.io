for Oracle server technologies in this
video you see how to analyze the use of
the system and object privileges that
are used by a user who has been granted
the DBA role and who performs database
tuning operations we follow the tasks
outlined in the slide the product
documentation also shows this tutorial
step by step meet the team and
understand their roles and privileges
Beatrix is the DB vault Account Manager
and has been granted the DV Account
Manager role Pet Smith is the DBA both
privileges to grant roles and system
privileges to other users pet has been
granted the owner authorization for the
Oracle system privilege and role
management we are Paula has been granted
the CAPTCHA admin role so that she can
use the DBMS privilege capture package
for privilege analysis Tina or Tony
Jones is a DBA in performance tuning
expert she is performing a sample
database tuning operation which will be
analyzed for privilege use log into the
database is a user who has been granted
the database vault Account Manager role
create the user accounts with an initial
password then log in as the DBA who can
ground rules and system privileges to
other users and who has been granted the
owner authorization for the Oracle
system privilege and role management
rearm and grant the privileges to the
just created users connected is the
privilege analysis administrator you
create a capture and enable it if you
check the type here it specifies where
this policy type is a context-based
condition and in the condition you see
that a boolean expression is used which
must evaluate to true for the policy to
take effect so in this case the
condition checks if the session user is
T Jones
next we perform a sampler database
tuning operation the UTL explained that
sequel script creates a plan table and
we run the explain plan sequel statement
on DHI employees table then we run a
script to create the change rows table
and run the analyze table statement on
the HR employees table again the
privilege analysis administrator
disables the policy and generates the
privilege analysis reports next you see
some secret + formatting commands and a
query against the DBA used such proofs
pass dictionary view
here are the object privileges that he
Jones used during the analysis period
it's quite important to find the unused
system privileges for t jones because
you might decide that they have to be
revoked to remove the components for
this tutorial connect his privilege
analysis administrator and drop the
capture and then connect is database
fault account manager and drop the
sample users we just covered the task
steps outlined in this slide thanks for
