RightNow and NetSuite applications do
you need to synchronize data between
your Oracle RightNow and NetSuite
instances Oracle integration cloud
service or ICS enables you to integrate
Oracle RightNow and NetSuite to
synchronize data like accounts and
organizations Bob needs to synchronize
account creation so that every time an
organization is created an Oracle
RightNow an account also gets created
and NetSuite to complete this
integration Bob performs several tasks
in ICS he creates the source and target
connections creates the integration
performs the data mapping and saves and
activates the integration here bob
creates the integration between Oracle
RightNow and NetSuite by using Oracle
integration cloud service on the home
page he can establish the source and
target connections required for his
integration and create his integration
by using his configured connections Bob
creates the Oracle RightNow connection
by using the right now adapter as he
provides the connection name the
identifier is automatically generated
based on that name after the right now
connection is created he configures the
connection properties to the Oracle
RightNow endpoint to do this he is the
wisdom file that contains the endpoint
details since it's password protected he
also sets the credentials for the
RightNow connection after the connection
settings are configured he tests and
saves the connection on the connections
page Bob creates another connection this
time he uses the NetSuite adapter just
as before the identifier is
automatically generated based on the
connection name after the NetSuite
connection is created
Bob configures the connection properties
to the endpoint by using a wisdom file
that contains the NetSuite endpoint
details
the NetSuite endpoint is
password-protected so he adds the
required credentials the account and
role settings for this specific endpoint
once the connection is configured in ICS
Bob tests the connectivity and verifies
that it's successful otherwise he won't
be able to use this connection in his
integration the NetSuite connection is
now marked as configured on the
integrations page he continues with the
creation of the integration between the
Oracle RightNow and NetSuite connections
he builds a new integration to create an
account in NetSuite when an organization
has created an Oracle RightNow the
integration canvas is displayed with all
the available fully configured
connections Bob configures the
integration by setting the NetSuite
connection as the integration target he
provides meaningful information for the
endpoint reference he selects the target
operation in the business object on
which to perform the operation in the
NetSuite application on the summary page
he verifies that his selections are
correct before completing the target
endpoint configuration the NetSuite
connection appears as the target on the
integration canvas Bob continues with
the integration by configuring the
Oracle RightNow connection as the source
he provides the endpoint reference and
selects the same business object for the
request and response on which to perform
the operation and the Oracle RightNow
application on the summary page he
verifies that his selections are correct
before completing the source endpoint
configuration the integration canvas
appears with the configured source and
target connections now Bob needs to map
the data that will be exchanged between
the source and target connections Oracle
integration cloud service offers a
number of ways to map the data exchanged
between these connections Bob creates
his own mapping by just dragging and
dropping the corresponding field he only
needs to copy across the organization
lookup name in Oracle RightNow so that
the request is sent with the correct
account name to NetSuite
to complete the integration Bob also
sets the response mapping and configures
the data tracking for monitoring once
the data mapping and tracking are
complete the integration is ready to be
activated when Bob activates the
integration he has the option to enable
detailed tracing that can be used when
developing and debugging the integration
between Oracle RightNow and NetSuite is
now active any changes to the
organization in Oracle RightNow are
automatically reflected in Bob's
NetSuite instance for more information
