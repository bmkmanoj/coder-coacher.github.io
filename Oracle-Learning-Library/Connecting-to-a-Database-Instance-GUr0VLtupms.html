connect to your database cloud service
instance running remotely in an Oracle
cloud virtual machine or VM to access
the database in your VM you can either
have a cloud service administrator open
ports or as we will show here you can
use secure shell or SSH client software
to connect securely to the VM and login
to your database several SSH clients are
freely available including the SSH
utility on Linux platforms and the putty
utility on Windows platforms in this
video we will see how to use putty to
tunnel through an SSH connection to the
VM hosting a database cloud service
instance and with that connection
established we will see how you can then
use the putty command window and other
tools like sequel developer to do
typical database tasks first you
generate in store a private and public
key pair on your local PC using a tool
such as the puttygen key generator make
a note of where you store the keys as
you will need this path when you create
your database as a service instance next
when you create a database as a service
instance you provide the public key
which gets stored on the database as a
service cloud server later when you
initiate an SSH connection data
encryption and decryption using the
public and private keys allow your
client and database as a service host to
authenticate each other without passing
the private key across the network
before you use the putty program to
connect to a VM you will need to find
the IP address sequel net port and CID
of your database instance on your VM and
you will need access to the SSH key file
that you used when you created your
database instance to find the connection
information for the database instance on
your VM connect to your database cloud
service console and click the name of
the database instance
you want to connect to write down the IP
address sequel net port and CID name
open the putty utility in your local
Windows environment and in the initial
dialog enter the IP address you just
noted in the host name field for
connection type select SSH in the
connection category select data and in
the auto login username enter Oracle in
the connection category expand SSH and
select off click the Browse button to
select the key file that you generated
and stored on your local PC click
tunnels and take the local machine
sequel net port 1521 and forward it to
the sequel net port on the remote cloud
VM click Add scroll up and back at
session provide a name for the session
and click Save when you click open
because this is the first time you are
connecting to the VM the SSH utility
prompts you to confirm the public heat
click yes you are in the putty command
window connected to the VM as the user
Oracle and you are in the Oracle users
home directory you can now use sequel
plus to connect to your VMs database
instance now that you are in the
database you can perform database tasks
for example let's simply select table
name from user tables in the putty
command window on your PC we see listed
the user tables on the database running
in your remote VM now that you've
tunneled into the VM using putty on your
local computer you can keep the putty
session open and use other local tools
to connect to the database using that
SSH tunnel for example here we see a
sequel Developer connection pointing to
hostname localhost and port 1521 which
will use the SSH tunnel to connect to
the remote VMs database once sequel
developer connects to your database in
the VM you can use a worksheet to issue
commands such as this same select table
name from user tables at the output
panel at the bottom of the sequel
developer window we see listed the
databases user tables and that's it you
now know how to connect to the database
running in your Oracle database cloud
service VM thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
