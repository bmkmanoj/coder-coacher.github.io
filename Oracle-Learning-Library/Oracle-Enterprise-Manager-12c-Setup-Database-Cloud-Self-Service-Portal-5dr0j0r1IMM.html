steps required to set up private
database cloud self-service portal all
the actions in this demonstration are
taken by the database as a service
administrator go to the setup menu click
cloud and select database the database
self-service portal setup has five
distinct steps first is to setup a
database own a database zone is a
collection of servers or clusters that
will participate in your cloud setup a
prerequisite is to install the database
software or the Oracle home on all these
hosts and clusters click create provide
the name and description verify and
update the placement policy constraints
for the hosts or nodes that will
participate in this zone the placement
policy constraints provide a maximum
ceiling in terms of resource consumption
this is designed to protect the host
from over usage you can control the
maximum CP utilization maximum memory
allocation and the number of database
instances that are allowed on this host
or node click Next to continue
provide certain search criteria to
filter the Oracle homes that would
participate in this zone once the
filters are set click Add to see a list
of filtered targets select all the
Oracle homes that you wish to add
provide a set of credentials that would
be used across all hosts or Oracle homes
that would participate in the zone these
set of credentials would be used to
create new databases click Next to
continue
select a row for the SSA users members
of which will have exclusive access to
this zone click Submit to finish this
process confirm that the zone has been
added next step
is to set the request settings this tab
provides two options first future
reservation which controls how far in
advance a user can make a request and
second the request duration which
controls the maximum duration for which
the request can be made step 3 is to set
the Korra for SSA users
Cora is calculated for each self-service
user belonging to a given role it limits
the resources available to the users for
example let us see the code asset for
the SSA user role this coder will be
applicable to every user that has the
SSA user role assigned to him or her the
coder said for this role is 100 GB of
memory 200 GB of storage and 5 databases
note that coda is applicable only to
those databases that are provisioned to
the self-service application step 4 is
to create service templates a service
template is a standardized service
definition that is offered to
self-service users self-service users
will invoke these service templates to
provision databases of their choice
click create provide a meaningful name
and a detailed description the
description is important here as this is
the only piece of information that would
describe the contents of this service
template a prerequisite to service
template creation is to save a copy of
the create Oracle database deployment
procedure with the relevant inputs
locked select the saved deployment
procedure and click select click Next to
continue and all database zones against
which this service template can be
invoked
select the appropriate zones and click
Next to continue
you can make service templates available
to select set of users for example
restrict access to a large configuration
of database the only production uses and
not
developers due out suitable rules click
Add select the appropriate rules and
click Submit to finish now that our
service template has been created we
will move to the last step which is to
set up charge back to set up charge back
navigate to enterprise and charge back
on the charge back application switch to
the targets tab here we will add the
database zone we just created for this
click on add targets choose to view the
target selector change the filter
settings the only view database zones
and select our database zone confirm the
selection and click OK now that our zone
has been added we will assign a plan and
a cost center to it to assign a plan
click on the assign plan button select
the appropriate charge plan and click OK
next click on the assign cost center
select the appropriate cost center and
click OK with this we have completed the
setup for our database self-service
portal this concludes the demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
