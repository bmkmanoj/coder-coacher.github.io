the Enterprise Manager team in this
tutorial I'll show you how to use
Exadata sparse clone to create a thin
clone of a pluggable database as well as
a thin clone of a non pluggable database
running an exadata environment in
earlier releases of the enterprise
manager product we introduced snap clone
functionality with engineered systems
such as Exadata snap clone is a way of
taking advantage of copy-on-write
technology to produce a thin clone of a
database allowing cloning of an existing
database in a way that takes only a very
small subset of the amount of storage
used by the existing database in earlier
releases snap clone on engineered
systems used external storage such as
the Oracle ZFS storage appliance on that
app filer to store the data file
artifacts on the clone the downside of
using these external storage systems is
they are not exited or aware and cannot
take advantage of a lot of the unique
innovations that X star litter is
brought to the table as you see on the
right hand side here such as smart scan
and hybrid columnar compression now with
Exadata sparse clone you can create fast
space efficient snapshot databases in
two simple steps firstly you create a
space disk group on your extra data
storage and then you either create a
snapshot database or a snapshot
pluggable database that reads data from
a read-only test master database and
rights to the space disk group depending
on the environment you are building the
Exadata snapshots initiated either by a
snapshot copy for pluggable databases or
a clone DB operation for non contained
databases the test master database must
be in read-only mode because we are
using a disk group on the extra data
storage or the Exadata features work as
expected on a snapshot databases
diagrammatically you can picture this as
shown on the left hand side of the
picture we have our production database
we use data guard or an arm and clone
operation to take a full copy of the
production database to our test or
development environment the test master
is read-only
the snapshots are made up of sparse
files composed only of change blocks
other data is read from the test master
now we understand the concepts behind
Exadata sparse clone let's have a look
at it in action firstly we'll look at
using it to clone a pluggable database
and then we'll look at using it to clone
a non container database here you can
see my excavator machine I'm going to be
using for this example let's expand a
list of databases here on the left you
can see there are several databases
already on this machine and I'm going to
be using this products our database as
the database that I'm going to clone
from if I click on that database you can
see this is a container database from
the container database homepage I can
use a container switcher next to the
contained database name to select the
pluggable database I want to go to this
is a homepage for the ABC product pdb
one pluggable database if i look at the
storage for this database i consider the
table spaces for this database have a
total allocated size of just over five
hundred and 60 gigabytes the data files
for this database are on the data sea
one disk group I can validate that by
looking at the data files and here you
can see that all the data files are
indeed sitting on an ASM diskgroup the
first step we need to take in this
environment is to create the test master
for sparse quay and we need to claim
from a database in read-only mode which
is why we are creating a test master off
this production database i'm going to
start from the database homepage for the
ABC prod pw1 database from here
all I need to do to greater test master
is to follow the path oracle database
cloning create test master on the first
step of the wizard I need to provide
some source and destination information
first I need to provide some source
credentials since I have preferred
credential set up in this environment I
can just leave that as is on the
destination side I need to provide a
meaningful name for the database and I
need to provide a display name I also
need to provide the pdb administrator
credentials notice here I can also
specify the container database so i can
actually switch this to another database
if i want to but in the example I'm
using here i'll click on this selector
and just select the same container
databases the pluggable database is
currently in
I need to provide some credentials for
that again I have the preferred
credential set for the database but I'll
provide the ASM credentials by clicking
on the selected credentials button and
then I'll move to the next screen on the
configuration step of the wizard I'll
need to specify the ASM diskgroup
they'll be using if it's different to
the data sea one disk group that I had
already created in this case I'm leaving
them as it is and I don't need to change
that for a sparse clone test master you
also need to set the access control list
if the user other than the one that I'm
creating is test mastro's needs to
create sparse clones from this test
master that user will need to have
access to the data files an example i'm
showing here as long as the user is part
of the operating system group DBA
they'll be able to create sparse clones
the next step allows me to do some post
processing and so here I can set up at
masking definition and also select
custom scripts from the software library
to customize the test master again I'll
leave these fields alone and move on to
the next screen on the schedule screen I
can change the name of this deployment
procedure instance into something a
little bit more recognizable I can also
change the schedule for this great test
master database it defaults to
immediately but if I wanted to move that
to later finally add a review screen
where I can see everything over added
and I can click the clone button to
perform the cloning itself on the
procedure activity screen I can minimize
the region for the elapsed time so I can
see a little bit more when I do if you
expand all I also tend to change the
procedure refresh period to every 30
seconds so I can actually see things
taking place that'll take some time to
finish so I'll pause the video here and
started again once that's actually
taking place as expected that took some
time to complete into database was
around 500 60 gigabytes in size so let's
go now and have a look at this target
and see
what we've created here you can see the
test master database we just created
sitting within the same container base
as the original let's drill into the
cloning menu for this test master
database you'll see that since we
already know this is a test master
database that the options here have
changed from what we saw earlier and now
we can create a snapshot clone from the
test master database on the create
snapshot clone pluggable database page
that preferred credentials or again
already set for me on the destination
side of the page I can provide a
meaningful name for the pluggable
database and a display name let's change
the display name for now I also need to
provide a password for the pdb
administrator notice here I have the
option to claim the pluggable database
into a different container database I'm
cloning this pluggable database in the
same container databases production so
I'll leave this unchecked I also need to
provide the ASM credentials the test
master and the clone need to be within a
single ASM installation so the ASM
cluster has to be the same page we're
looking at actually has two flavors one
is the simple interface we just looked
at we can click the clone button to
clone this environment we can also click
on the advanced button to walk through a
more advanced configuration if we do
that you can see on the second screen
that we can change the sparse disk group
here and we also have the ability to
change other Peter be level options the
good thing about this wizard is from any
steps such as where i am now if you're
satisfied with all the inputs you can
immediately click clone rather than
stepping through the remaining step to
the wizard now I can watch the cloning
process again I'll do and expand all on
this so we can see all the procedure
steps so what we're doing now is
creating a snapshot clone of the test
master database which is you might
recall is around 560 570 gigabytes and
eyes I can just refresh the screen a
couple of times here and you can see the
process completes very quickly in fact
it's only taken about five seconds to
prepare the sequel for creating the
clone and you can see the sequel here
what we're actually doing is as you'd
expect creating a pluggable database
from the test master we specified this
vast this group and we've got the
snapshot copy option on the command here
the actual execution of the script only
takes around 11 seconds in the screen
what you've seen how easy it is to
create exadata smart clone snapshot
databases using both the pluggable
database and an uncontained iraq
database as the source untie charman
