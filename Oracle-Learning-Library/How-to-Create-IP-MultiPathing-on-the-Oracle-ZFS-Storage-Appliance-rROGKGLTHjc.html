going to spend some time showing you how
to create an IP multipath group or IP MP
group for a network configuration IP MP
allows you to have multiple NICs
basically team together on the appliance
itself there's lots of different
networking settings you can create on
the box
we support VLAN tagging virtual NICs IB
partitions as well as LACP aggregation
in our case we're going to be doing
something called IP MP our IP
multipathing it's part of Solaris if
your Solaris guy you're probably
familiar with it but it's basically just
like NIC teaming on any other summer so
you can have multiple NICs within an IP
MP group have them active standby
it's up to you and they can be different
speeds as well so you can't have say 10
gig is active you could have your one
gig link be a standby that's also an
option with IP and P groups so the first
thing you do and there's two types of IP
MB groups there's Pro based and then
link state based we're going to do link
state that just means if the links down
it'll fail over a couple things you need
to setup one if you go to configuration
and then services down here you'll see
IP MP under system settings and just if
you want to make sure it's online you
can change this is how long before
detects a ten minute ten thousand
milliseconds you could lower that if you
want to and also if you want to
automatically fail back or not you can
control that those are the default
standings settings there the next step
in oh yeah just from a documentation
standpoint if you click the inline help
you can go right in here and it's
context sensitive so I was on the
network page they'll pull me into
network if I click I P MP you can read
all about it it tells you the difference
between pro based and link state based
those sort of settings and
there's also it's documented in here as
well how does it this up but I'm gonna
show you right now so the way we're
gonna do it today because almost my
links remain used we're going to create
some virtual nicks so first thing we'll
do is create GaN the plus for a new data
link and we're going to say let's create
a virtual NIC and let's do it on IG b2
and we're gonna call this I PMP link 1
and we will click apply and there it is
right there and let's add one more
IP MP link to and this one will use IG
be - okay we have those two links I'm
gonna click apply to add that into the
group ok those are now active the next
thing I am going to do is create a
couple of and I'm using link state rep
and so when you use link and this is in
the documentation as well but all you do
don't go in there we go
and you give it an address for these
initial IP and be links you give it an
address of 0.02 0/8 and I'm gonna say
don't allow administration so that's the
first one let's create one more
call this IP MP link to well click apply
and apply again I like to click apply on
each basic step I do just to not give
the system too many things to do it once
it seems to be a little smoother than to
give it 20 things you're now sitting
there waiting watching our device you
can do it all at once but I just like to
do it this way myself
so I got those two links the next step
is to actually click create the IP MP
interface so click the plus you come in
here and I already have one I'm using
this collide PNP 1 and here again you
can give it an address I'm gonna just
give it one but I know some that's being
used anywhere and then you see there's
no data links if I look somewhere to use
them all but if I click I PMP group it's
going to pull up those IP MP link 1 &amp;amp; 2
I'm gonna make them both active and hit
apply
and there you go so here's the IPM group
if you click it you'll notice this -
this happens with all the links it'll
show you what this interface is composed
of if you actually click on any of these
things so you know this IP MP group is
composed of these two interfaces the
0.01 so we created those then link back
to these Phoenix vena convening - we
created which are linked to these
physical data links which link back to
these physical devices so you can kind
of see that sort of map through you see
here's the IP MP link if you wanted to
you could create another default static
route normally by default it's gonna
create one for that subnet already you
can see it down here 192 168 at 2.0 it's
using that gateway that IP I just
created but you could create a so if you
had another gateway on this network you
could create that as well by just coming
here and clicking + and doing a default
gateway there as well so that is it for
creating an IP MP group again if you
have other questions the online help is
context-sensitive and would help answer
any of those questions you have thanks
so much have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
