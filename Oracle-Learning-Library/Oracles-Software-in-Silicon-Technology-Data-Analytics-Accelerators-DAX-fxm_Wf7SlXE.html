software and silicon data analytics
accelerators commonly called Dax
high-performance big data analytics are
now critical to surviving in today's
real-time business environment this
overwhelming growth of data means that
not only must you be able to analyze the
information that truly counts but you
also must involve sophisticated search
and machine learning algorithms over
large data sets Oracle is rethinking
this challenge with their innovative
approach to processor design Oracle's
revolutionary software and silicon
technology hardwires key software
processes directly onto the processor to
enable high-speed analytics and secure
data without adding latency Dax R of
revolutionary software and silicon
innovation which dedicate coprocessors
on to each spark microchip to process
specific types of analytic operations
the dax coprocessors located on either
side of the SPARC processor process
large data sets directly from memory
leaving the CPU cores to focus on other
tasks this approach reduces data
transfers offload CPU tasks and reduces
level three cache pollution as a result
operations that are common in big data
analysis machine learning algorithms and
in Oracle database in-memory large-scale
queries all see significant performance
improvements with Dax each spark
processor has eight Dax coprocessors
with four data pipelines each this
configuration enables the chip to
process 32 data streams that are
completely independent from the work
performed by the processor core to see
how offloading SQL queries to the Dax
coprocessors produces such dramatic
performance benefits let's take a look
at the way an in-memory analytically
runs in this example an SQL query runs
only on the CPU core the core reads the
data which is already compressed in
memory decompresses it writes it back to
memory
again from memory and then performs a
software scan and writes back the
results this process can inhibit
performance now let's take a look at the
way an in-memory analytics runs when Dax
is in use in this example
Dax decompresses data on the fly this
real-time decompression eliminates the
iterative steps of traditional SQL query
processing which simplifies the
operation and eliminates clutter in the
processor cache the net result is that
queries are processed as much as ten
times faster than queries run in the
traditional manner
note that when you enable the Oracle
database in-memory feature in Oracle
Database 12c analytics and mixed OLTP
workloads automatically benefit from
improved performance and real-time
analytics Dax can also be used through
application programming interfaces
called api's to accelerate a variety of
analytic workloads Apache spark is a
popular open source clustering computing
framework from the Apache Software
Foundation by allowing user programs to
load data into a clusters memory then
query it repeatedly SPARC is well-suited
to machine learning algorithms and
iterative analytic processes it is this
performance gain that has made Apache
spark one of the most popular methods
for processing large data sets through
open api's Oracle engineers have
demonstrated that software and silicon
Dax can be used to accelerate Apache
spark performance in this project the
engineers use spark m7 Dax with Apache
spark to take 1 billion rows of data in
memory and filter it into a 3d cube to
enable interactive data analytics
performance testing was performed both
with and without Dax integration with
Apache spark with Dax enabled the team
was able to achieve a 6 times
improvement in cube generation
performance the analytics queries were
handled by Dax freeing the processor
cores up for other workloads minimal
changes were required to Apache spark to
take advantage of the Dax capabilities
and packages which are built on top of
Apache spark will also benefit from this
acceleration with no changes require
the phenomenal growth of big data
analytics is driving the need for
innovation in processor technologies the
sparked m7 processor with Dax
coprocessors offers unprecedented
analytics efficiency for both the Oracle
database in memory along with a variety
of other applications through open Dax
ap is shown here are just a few
additional application examples for Dax
through Oracle's software and silicon
developer program developers can now
apply the Dax technology to a broad
spectrum of challenges in the analytic
space go to Swiss dev dot oracle.com
forward slash Dax Dax and caps and
leverage Oracle software and Silicon
cloud to gain access to this technology
along with numerous free developer
resources
