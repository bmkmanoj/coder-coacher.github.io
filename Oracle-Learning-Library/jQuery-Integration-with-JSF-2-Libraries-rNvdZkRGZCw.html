have developers at the Institute for
quantitative social science at Harvard
University in this discuss in the
session we will discuss jQuery
integration with jsf two libraries our
institution is unusual compared to other
research institutes at Harvard because
it combines active research with
technology giving a opportunity to
develop new tools and applications to
improve the research cycle among the
many tools developed at IQ SS we have to
java products the dataverse network and
conciliation source repository for
sharing research data it gives
incentives to researchers to make data
accessible to others by offering data
citation branding control of the data
while the application takes care of data
preservation and good archival practices
I qss hosted a diverse network for
social science research that holds over
50,000 studies with 700,000 data files
distributed across more than 470 data
versus dataverse is individual site and
a diverse network created and managed by
a scholar research group center
department journal or institution each
data verse contains research studies
with descriptive information and data
files consilio in finding groups or
clusters of a large set of detects
documents using existing clustering
methods and finding new clustering
solutions it is a new way to read
organize understand and derive insights
from large sets of documents you can
discover and organize unstructured text
navigating from the universe of possible
clusterings to each individual text
document integrating jQuery with jsf can
raise several issues the session
compares various use cases to see how
jQuery integration for I spaces three
compares to previous releases in which
integration was occasionally problematic
we also present a comparison of jQuery
and JavaScript features in icefaces
primefaces and rich
is when we when we started to integrate
jQuery into our apps it was initially
simple functionality like toggle to show
and hide blocks of content or form
elements on the page also rounded
corners before css3 to give layout more
appealing look and feel now we use more
advanced techniques like in concealing
us where we animate the apps navigation
in this presentation will review some of
the JSF and jQuery use cases and our
data versus network and conciliatory had
to figure out in order to get everything
integrated properly this is the
application architecture of our to
project the dataverse network was first
started in 2006 in 2008 with version 1.7
1.7 we added icefaces we are now up to
version 3.2 conciliate still in beta it
was started last year and may be
released later this year for version 1
we also develop everything and that
means it's pretty good we selected
icefaces primarily further directed Dom
rendering which utilizes Ajax and
allowing for incremental changes to the
dawn that affect only parts of the page
that have changed jquery is the most
popular JavaScript library and makes
adding JavaScript to our apps easier
when first integrating high spaces in
jQuery we encountered a few issues now
faces three AC e compute its components
utilize jQuery so we will evaluate how
those supply to our apps with other
libraries with all the libraries like
primefaces and rich faces emerging we
have taken to evaluating those as well
we have a few useful tips for went into
integrating jQuery initially into your
project first like many other JavaScript
libraries
jquery uses a dollar symbol as a
function or a variable name in jquery
this is just an alias so you can rename
or to avoid any any conflicts your first
line of jQuery you just place a jQuery
no conflict and and you'll be able to
switch that out so in this example we
have the money symbol the dollar sign
and then we've introduced the the jQuery
no conflict and have switched that
switch Jerry quarry out throughout our
code I here we show the use of IDs as
selectors JSF renders IDs to the page
that contain a colon symbol separating
name container components in this
example we are using text 22 for our
output checks normally with our our
jQuery we could just use text 22 as a
selector but in the the span element
that is rendered on the page with the ID
of form one tab set 10 context 22 we
can't use that in our jQuery jQuery uses
the colon as a pseudo class eliminator
for an element for instances such as
hover or disabled in order to you select
this element with ID text 22 jQuery you
should use attribute ends with a
selector the the dollar symbol wildcard
finds the element with a specific ID
suffix example right x 22 or for some
simpler naming container ids you can
also use double backsplashes to escape
the colon civil and here we have the
live method for attaching event handlers
when content is dynamically added to the
page as of jQuery 1.7 the on method has
replaced live as well as behind it's
more efficient for selecting IDs
and you can still use live but
underneath it's it's using the on method
so we're going to get to a demo of our
apps on the first page will ground look
at is Concilium the clustering space
page we will compare the animation
effect with the with I spaces acee
animation component and various jQuery
techniques I'll then turn it over to
Steven he will demo the dataverse
Network add files page where we use a
jQuery click method integrated with the
I spaces AC e-file injury component so
so here we have the clustering space
page we have a map that represents the
the clustering space you can navigate
around the map to discover new
clusterings we utilized play this a
little by video here so navigate around
the map we utilize a toggle form to the
toggle to toggle form elements on the
page as well as the the animate for a
sliding and navigation then toggle
elements on the page view a single
document and here we are using the
highlight plugin to highlight different
keywords on the page we can also go back
and now again they were one of the
clusters and then that will allow us to
compare two clusters and the jQuery
graph up plug-in creates a color map to
help visualize visualize the results and
we can toggle between percentage and the
total number of shared documents this is
a local example that we created
to evaluate the new icefaces a CG
animation component as you can see the
obnoxiously colored block of code up in
the top with the three buttons the we
have the clusters set to five you can
see at the top of the the table each of
the three buttons are using different
animation techniques that will represent
our sliding animation for the net for
the nav the green button is wired with I
spaces is the animation component the
orange button uses jQuery within the on
click event of a command link the blue
button blue the blue refresh button uses
the jQuery live Bethan everything here
works nicely as expected we go and
change the settings from five to ten
which you can see dynamically changes
the the content the number of clusters
within the element that we're animating
and everything still works nicely
unfortunately we try to apply this ice
raises AC animation to our navigation
for the entire app and we we couldn't
control the the animation the to a point
where we could replace it with the
relays the jQuery that we used the the
animation we couldn't control the
trigger when the user clicks around
other functions on the page so clicking
around the map and clicking the labels
and whatnot would would then trigger the
animation so we had to scrap them here
we have the here we have the code behind
it you can see the the first panel grid
is our AC e ace component and underneath
that within that excuse me within that
you can see the the one line of
of a code that we have the East
animation with the event click and some
parameters for positioning and duration
underneath that we have another panel
grid that contains the commands link and
in that you'll see the you see the on
the on click event triggering the jQuery
and um we have the position and duration
pointers sitting there as well and then
below that you see we have our refresh
button and we have some jQuery that is
controlling that we placed everything
within the live method which maintains
the click handler after the page is
dynamically updated and then we go and
check the positions of each button and
return them to her original positions
with the anime method and this is where
we turn over to Steve demo the dataverse
network so last week we did a rough cut
for our team and our director gave us
some constructive criticism and and then
she said can you give the dataverse one
more plug because you never know who's
going to be in your audience someone in
your audience could know someone who
knows kevin bacon or something so just
want to say that the dataverse is a way
for social science researchers to
preserve their data and not have to
worry about changing storage media so
you know these folks are researchers
they're not data archivists and our
application gives them a way to ensure
that the data that they collect is
stored in an easily accessible way
forever so they don't have to worry
about you know going from floppies to
zip drives to CDs whatever and you know
forevers a long time but harvard
celebrated its 375th anniversary last
year
so hopefully that fits people's
definition up forever anyway this is our
our add files page uses the ACE file
entry component from icefaces too and
here's the documentation that we get
from I spaces see it's got a browse file
button so what we wanted to do was to
have our users not have to use that
two-step process to upload a file so
what we did was first thing we did was
we hit the send file button in our
application and then in order to get
around clicking that button we added a
change event handler to the file input
that calls a JavaScript function that
actually clicks the button and we'll see
that in action in our page but the issue
that we ran into was that on page
refresh the file input was losing its
change handler and our solution was to
add a javascript call in the pre render
view so to reapply the jquery method to
the file input and we'll take a look at
the page in action and then the code
that makes it work so here's the page
select the file type and you use that to
process the file upload and then here's
the brows that you saw in the icefaces
component but there's no sin 5 and if I
start it you can see what happens so the
user selects a file type and then
selects a file and then you see my low
fluid has actually been triggered and
now the user has a chance to add some
textual description at a category or
even if they design but they don't like
with what they've selected there's a
remove button here and then once they
press the Save button at the bottom that
actually updates the the study with
these files so here's the
it's disabled before the file type is
selected there's a Highland tree
listener which is called the command
button can see the command button
displays none so that's how it's hidden
and as I said in the backing bean we
have in the pre-rendered view adding a
JavaScript call rich click the hidden
button and then in the JavaScript
section the page the cliq hidden add
file button uses jQuery to select that
hidden button and click it
so you know we used icefaces since 2008
and we became aware of impending
releases of icefaces 30 and we saw that
it was integrating jquery into some of
their components the ACE components that
I just pointed out one of them so we dug
a little deeper and we saw that that
these had been forked from primefaces
libraries so we want to see what was
going on there and learn some more about
the prime faces three libraries and
while we're at it we decide to see if
there's anything else going on and look
at the other major player which is rich
faces
so again icefaces three you know it has
these new ace components it also we're
also using it right now in the
development version of the text
clustering concealments application
and primefaces three one of the one of
the things that that they did in the
their version 3 was they eliminate the
use of the jQuery UI and Yui in building
the components to make it more jsf
centric also one in one neat thing that
they added was a widget bar which one of
the things that Mike mentioned was that
sometimes we have hard time getting a
handle on a component in a page and this
widget bar allows you to assign a
variable to component and then use it
elsewhere so this dialog box has a
widget RG and then you can have an
output on click shows the dialog box and
refer to realize dlg so that's kind of
neat you know I have to go through the
hierarchy form one and wherever it is on
the page so primefaces 3.4 was released
just a couple months ago they added some
performance enhancements including the
lazy loading of views so you only
incorporate that much as much data as is
you know shown and we actually ended up
in our application we have icefaces data
tables where we wrote our own lazy
loader so be interesting to see if we
you know if we tried primefaces if that
would improve our our performance beyond
what we were able to do and what we
wrote on our own and they also have a
jsf mobile for using jQuery Mobile which
we
haven't really dealt with and rich faces
for like primefaces it avoids using the
jQuery UI and Yui and another
interesting feature that it has is a
rich jQuery component that applies
styles and custom behavior to jsf
objects and regular Dom objects and
allows you to encapsulate functions into
a component instead of writing the
writing in the JavaScript section of
your page and it also has a couple of
hooks into IDs similar to the widget bar
so rich component ID allows you to get a
reference to the client JavaScript
object and invoke the available methods
on it
so we've found that a spaces three it's
a good solution for our project use
jQuery and Abel component without
rewriting large code base the new jsf
libraries don't completely eliminate the
need to write around jQuery if we want
to use something you know a little more
customizable of a feature some issues
remain need to reapply jquery after page
updates and incorporating multiple
jquery enabled libraries causes
conflicts for our constancy by spaces
ace animation point doesn't allow for
the animation navigation we created we
have if libraries were to add more hooks
for existing components then allow you
know more specific attributes to be able
to control you know different elements
across a darme rather than you know
specifically what you're you're clicking
so it's a all we have for our
presentation on open the floor for
questions or comments or anything
the dataverse yeah dataverse
browse button space which is a tricky
issue for you yeah it is and they the
corner that we use doesn't really
doesn't support it yet that's a known
issue a nice face aside so what we did
was you know their their proposed
solution is to have multiple and you
know browse buttons yeah yeah so what we
did was you know have a single browse
button that you could use multiple times
and that's why we had to apply the click
method I'm major crash shortly kind of
around yeah we had to work without yeah
we are we also have in the example here
other other fields that we had to sorry
upload an hour yeah profile so is so
like you know category and description
in one night so it's it yes so but but
in your case we were talking about like
the Browse feature yeah the Browse
feature we the component did not allow
for you know highlighting but multiple
through control
okay um the file actually gets uploaded
directly after the brows but it's not
until the Save button at the bottom page
that it gets assigned to the study that
you're editing so if you used to remove
the file is still been uploaded but it's
not assigned to that study that you're
in right yeah we'd leave we had a
disabled if you said that like part of
the component like that that that does
the the upload so that we could have
this second step of adding a category
title
get on the stage
and in the back
um we're on JS f 2 for both of our ass
Mahara
yeah I think so when we first decided to
integrate one of the the jsf libraries
they're just there wasn't the options
that are available now so I think we
would have had a lot more work you know
just deciding between them I I'm not
sure which we would go with play down
the code base right now for the
dataverse is is pretty good we've got
many many more pages the the from for
this this talk I mean the others the
others look impressive so it definitely
would be a decision just you know which
ones out in the front right now I mean
it it really gets down to specifics for
for the you know type of functionality
that we have an exam example is like the
add files page which is which was
something that you know that it was an
ideal solution but you know we were able
to kind of work around it and make it
like the best we could and I feel like
it would have to kind of be like a you
know page by page type of comparison for
fridge librarian or it's a figure out
which works best and what would be I
guess the least amount of work to make
that work
it was um it was sort of like a you know
it didn't make sense in the UI it was an
extra click and we thought it would be
an easy enough solution week with with
jquery just to kind of like you know
trigger on have on change event and and
trigger that click and and it did work
out easier than we expected actually
I have no experience in javafx I've been
to a bunch of the presentations and as
far as i remember hearing that yeah it's
it's a it is jquery and an html5 and
css3 utilizes all of that but in terms
of applying it to a project I don't have
any experience of that
with us
um sort of like the a lot more a lot
more of the components that they provide
stuff like data tables and pagination
and like file upload that we that we
showed the add file all of these are
stuff where you know everything is built
for you the so you just really just you
know apply applying add to your page and
it's ready to go yeah when when uh oh
the foot the first version is 11 26
yes they're nesting of data tables is
tripped us up for it
style
so we have like six
very complex form I can imagine but
anyway so we
and you're doing a martial arts
I haven't used it but I have tried every
combination okay but i have done with
styling but I had a natural
my god
made of money so he said it right
yep
I see if I can make it was um
yeah so so in in this we have the the
second panel grid with the command link
and the on click which with the jQuery
inside of that was that what you're
referencing there it was um it was a
workaround we have like for the for the
refresh page for the refresh button
below that you'll see that there's you
know just your your your code there and
this block of jQuery is somewhere else
on the page you know and and so we had
problems with where you know this would
be outside of a form or are you know the
placement on the page ended up being a
problem we had stuff that the backing
bean would use like a pre-render to to
trigger a function we put would put like
our jquery inside of a custom init
function and the the pre-render would
would trigger that with a add javascript
call from for my sis's well in in this
example I was specifically trying to
highlight the the live functionality
where we could the live method where we
get to have something that is pretty
much always on it so it's always you
know ready for for the the on click
event
no no I am NOT I've enjoyed that we
tried bind and live and and then since
since since the NN on is was new for us
so we were trying to figuring out as we
went through this about presentation
oh pretty good it's something that we've
been even been able to customize stuff
like the data tables and you know the
headers will have you know images behind
them and it's been something that you
know we can either go in and change the
theme with our own custom CSS or or
overwrite the theme depending on if we
want to you know change the look and
feel from one section to another we can
you know kind of control that with our
with our own without having to go in
change a theme from the front my spaces
but overall that was that was definitely
one of the selling points was that like
not only is all this great functionality
in there but but the themes are pretty
good looking as well
that that is something that was a more
of a recent issue and so you know it was
it was all you know new to us we didn't
you know have to consider anything like
that like we're already you know down
the path with Isis for a little while um
yeah yeah so in terms of you know he
said she said it's it's kind of it's
kind of difficult to pick a side where
we haven't really had too much
experience with with primefaces other
than you know the evaluation we're doing
for this
as you
yeah you're at right down yeah it was a
the latest three-point Oh had a fork
from primefaces two point oh
um again it was it was it was just
something we evaluated for this
presentation and and they definitely
seemed to have some interesting features
that we specifically thought could we
could use for our furs and some of our
functionality here so um anything
specific that I remember
mmhmm yeah this uh the the first
component in the fine component we
definitely two features that we that we
side
yep
yeah yeah yeah yeah we initially just
started with jsf and and jquery doing
some very minor things like i was saying
with a with like toggle you know just a
you know expand it like expand blocks of
text and hide form elements like some
very simple stuff but uh you know then
we then we started looking more into
ajax to add even more dynamic
functionality to the page and started
looking at the I spaces you know
primarily for that and you know then
then then jquery started breaking on our
page and we had to kind of like go
through hole processes you know figure
out the best way and it's been a work in
progress or constantly you know figuring
out but are better ways to handle but um
but yeah to jQuery absolutely you can
add a whole bunch like the like the
Consilium that that navigation you know
really is just it's just all jquery the
sliding around so you really can add a
whole lot of features through
yep yep
well the the no conflict the no conflict
line that that is specific to the the
chunks of code so if you just you know
found a bit of code for for this ad
class that that you wanted to do if you
just you know we're to copy an example
off of a website and paste it on your
page and you know add the classes and
whatnot that you wanted and it wouldn't
work it could be because of the the
dollar the dollar symbol specifically
but separately so no conflict allows you
to to change the the dollar symbol to be
jquery or a different variable that that
you can you know also set but what
you're talking about it specifically is
having multiple jquery libraries called
in your project yeah and yeah that's
even that's even worse like sometimes
sometimes you can get away sometimes you
can get away with this like depending on
I guess what it is that you're doing
it's
yeah yeah that's difficult to you know
make sure you get everything and and
then if you know an update comes out
then you have to remember what you did
and apply that so be difficult to stop
messin with the libraries we didn't
specifically find what where it was that
that was using it we just found that a
typical a similar symptom was described
where no conflict you know was it was
the was the issue and the solution so so
we didn't happen we didn't have to
specifically find you know where where
was butting heads we just were able to
use this one quick solution and solved
everything
good
yeah the the browser compatibility for
for the for the components is jenna is
generally really good that's one of the
biggest selling points of the of the
libraries is they they work all that out
for you so it could be I don't know it's
like something specific that that in the
integration process if you're using
something with new jquery or CSS it
could be something like that I'm not
sure about we didn't we didn't have any
problems I i can i can think of major
