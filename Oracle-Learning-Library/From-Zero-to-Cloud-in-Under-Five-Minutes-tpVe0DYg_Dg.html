in this demonstration we will show you
how easy it is for a cloud administrator
to set up a cloud using Enterprise
Manager 12c as a cloud administrator one
of the first things that I need to do is
create a simplified model of my data
center a typical data center is simply
way too complex for a cloud user to
understand so I must abstract all of
this complexity which is exactly what
I've done here I've grouped all my
resources into two logical entities that
we call zones these entities are logical
so I could assign them however I choose
in this particular case I've done so
based on geography but I could do it
based on line of business or application
platform or similar the advantage of
this logical abstraction is that a user
can simply interact with the data center
at the logical level with no need to
worry about the underlying physicality
underneath it now the next thing I'll
need to do is go in and define some self
service policies access control and
standard
I'm going to go set up my cloud and you
can see here I'm on the machine sizes
screen one of the first things we see
here are standard machine sizes we have
standard machine sizes that we want to
promote to ensure standardization in our
cloud I see that we have a small machine
configuration here and a medium sized
machine configuration here I'm going to
go ahead and create a new configuration
i'm going to call this configuration
large and i'm going to assign at eight
virtual cpus 16 gigs of memory and a
terabyte of storage the next thing i
need to do is decide how future
reservations are going to be handled
i'll click on request settings here i
can decide are people allowed to make
future reservations and if they are
allowed how far ahead can they make
those reservations and how long can they
hold on to those particular resources in
this case i'll just accept the standard
settings i also need to think about how
the resources will be utilized by
different roles in the cloud will have
different roles such as a developer and
QA engineers and similar this is where
i'll get to assign their quota to one or
more zones and control their level of
access here we can see there is an
association already done for the app
developer but i'm going to go ahead and
create a new profile for a QA engineer
so i'm going to select the QA engineer
role
I'm going to assign that to the east
coast own and I'm going to decide how
many servers how many virtual CPUs and
how much memory and storage that they
could utilize I could also assign
additional storage here if I chose to
but I'm not going to do that right now
additionally I'll get to select from
standard gold images to ensure
standardization of the software that is
actually deployed into our cloud you can
see here we have a sales order
application and a database 11g template
now I have all the infrastructure taken
care of but what we really want to do is
deploy an enterprise cloud so it's more
than just infrastructure now we need to
address higher level artifacts such as
database I'm going to go back to my
setup menu and this time setup database
within my cloud here we can see the
database zone is very similar to what we
saw for the infrastructure these are
again logical pools of resources in this
case they happen to be a collection of
servers and clusters that have oracle
software pre-installed similarly in the
infrastructure i can control the request
settings how far and how long i can set
quotas against particular types of users
and i can define service templates to be
utilized by those different types of
users so i'm almost there but the final
thing I need to do is go in and set up a
chargeback plan for chargeback
enterprise manager allows us to create
charge plans associate those charged
plans to zones which will allow us to
ensure that as the resources are
provisioned in his own they
automatically inherit that charge plan
you can see the chargeback screen where
I could go and configure out chargeback
plans I'm going to click on configure
charge plan and we can see that
enterprise manager gives me a universal
charge plan this is a very generic
charge plan consisting of metrics like
CPU memory and storage if I didn't want
to do anything else I could simply stick
to this plan and it will apply to all of
the target types however i can define
plans that are specific specific target
types a database metrics as an example
may be very different than the metrics
of those for virtual machines and
similar we can see here for virtual
machines I've done something very very
simple for a large machine I've defined
a flat rate of fifty cents an hour and
for a small machine that rate is 25
cents an hour let's do the same for
database so we can see here that for a
small database I'm going to charge five
dollars an hour and I can also see here
that I can charge for any particular
configuration
so for example if a user wants to use
advanced compression I can charge for
that as well and then I can apply these
plans against the various zones that
I've set up and assign them to cost
centers so that they can be
automatically applied to the various
organizations within my enterprise in
this demonstration we quickly and
efficiently transformed RIT into a cloud
and it's now ready for application
developers to start deploying
applications and to turn on self-service
consumption thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
