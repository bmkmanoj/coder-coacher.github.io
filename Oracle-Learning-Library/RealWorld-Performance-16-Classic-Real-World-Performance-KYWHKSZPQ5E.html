fixing the symptoms of a problem and
actually learning to do classic real
world performance and within the real
world performance group we always take
pride in taking a top-down view of the
problem rather than debugging a problem
from the bottom up and this is a big
challenge that we face in our industry
particularly in IT departments that are
heavily segmented and very often don't
communicate well with other departments
and everybody's working defensively to
make sure that everything looks good
from their perspective and people aren't
learning to look holistically across the
whole depth of a system to see how we
can increase the whole system
performance and this is a big challenge
with in today's IT organizations and
it's something that I take great pride
in that the real-world performance group
does is that we look holistically over
the whole stack and see what can be done
to improve the whole system performance
and this is extremely important and what
we have is a very simple demo that we're
in a show and it probably is being
panned out and played out the similar
situations in multiple companies in
multiple industries in similar
applications all around the globe and
people are scratching their head
thinking how do we increase performance
and a lot of people are making lots of
suggestions but they haven't yet figured
out what the problem is and this is
something what we see daily or with this
desire to be fiddling with things
changing things but really no sort of
understanding of what the big picture
problem is so on this system what we're
looking at today is actually record it's
coming it's processing records coming
off a manufacturing facility basically
barcodes on
devices are going through on testing
equipment and manufacturing equipment
and it's generating a log and it's
producing manufactured goods and all
those manufactured logs and things like
that are going into flat files and then
we have to load those files into a
manufacturing database such that we can
figure out how efficient is the
production line running what's our
defect rates is there a genealogy
associated with bad machines that have a
higher error rate and things like that
but this could be the same as in many
other applications this could be your
telephone bill this could be an online
application where all requests are
coming from a single browser it likewise
could be from a government and agency
processing tax returns or tax forms and
things like that there's so many times
we have seen this occur within the real
world yet we have seen a lot of very
smart people focusing their effort
literally trying to do bottom-up
debugging fiddling around with database
parameters and actually having
absolutely zero success of raising the
real world performance number which is
the business transactions that they push
through their system and so this is just
hopefully a bit of a wake-up call and an
education when we actually built this
demo we were surprised at the
performance gains that we can achieve by
just doing the basics of good computer
science and doing a top-down analysis so
maybe I should introduce the system it's
a workload that is loading manufacturing
data from a series of flat files and the
application is basically reading the
flat files and then basically hashing
the data of each row to a number of
application servers and it's doing this
as a means of load balancing everything
all the work that happens and all the
rows that arrive are load balanced
across the application servers which is
what you can see with the red lines
there and then the application servers
load balance across to two instances
within an Oracle database now let's have
a look at the performance
of the system and by the way this is not
good performance this is our start this
is our entry point at the start of the
analysis you'll notice the transaction
rate is about eight thousand
transactions a second maybe closer to
seven you'll notice we're spending a lot
of time waiting in the app server the
database response time is getting close
to 40 milliseconds and if we actually
start looking at the actual report or
the awr report you can see they were
actually not spending much time at all
on the CPU which would be that thin
green line at the bottom bearing in mind
we've got two instances but boy are we
spending a lot of time in sort of rack
related moved cache fusion events moving
the blocks back and forward between
database instances so at this point in
time people are thinking whoa what's
going on here with a database doesn't
scale so perhaps we can just go a step
through and just start to understand the
problem people are saying you know
perhaps we need to rebuild the indexes
hash partitioned reverse key indexes
people saying build a rebuild the
indexes with higher percentage freeze
reset any trans to a large number but
for the sake of this analysis we're not
gonna actually change anything on the
side of the database we're not going to
change any storage clauses we're not
going to change any table definitions
we're not going to change any index
definitions and we're just going to use
some real-world principles to actually
identify what the problems are and then
work them out of the system up the stack
in the application layer
because we believe that's actually where
you can make the most difference so the
first thing we want to do because it's
also confusing with all the clustering
is we're actually going to start running
the system literally on a single
instance and just let's just see what
happens there to the system we certainly
expect all those gray weight events who
disappear because we're redirecting all
the workload now down to a single
instance and you can see just by
redirecting the work
load to one instance we've actually
increased the performance quite
dramatically and the response time has
come down but you can see that this
really isn't the total answer because
we're still not getting that good
utilization within a single instance we
still got a lot of contention within the
system we got latch contention here but
we also got index contention and buffer
busy weights still within a single
instance so perhaps we still although
we've moved the workload around and
shuffled it about we still don't
understand the problem but let's have a
look and think what we're doing with the
workload we're still doing a lot of load
balancing and shuffling all the data
across all the application servers now
this file contains all the instrument
readings for a single serial number of a
process of an object being manufactured
likewise it could be your tax return it
could be your phone number
it could be basically your browser IP
address if you were doing an online
system so we're basically redirecting
all your requests pertaining to a single
element of data or something a cluster
of data across multiple application
servers now let's think about that if we
could actually just get some affinity
between that part and an application
server let's think of the impact that
that might have on performance getting
some affinity up the stack and instead
of trying to load balance all the
manufacturing data for one part across
app servers how about just stream it to
one app server likewise all requests
coming from a browser instead of trying
to load balance them across multiple app
servers let's try and affinia ties it to
one app server so let's try that and
let's just show affinity to within an
application server and what we should
see is we should see that cross red line
disappear and now we're starting to see
that we're so really actually starting
to make a bit of difference
performance because we've we've actually
what we've done is we've actually in
this case have the number of processes
all fighting for the same data
that was being fused either between two
instances when we were in the rack case
or contention for the same blocks within
a single instance so we've taken the
performance up from less than 8,000
transactions to segment but we're now
getting it up into the 30s and all we
haven't used a single thing in the
database at this point in time all we've
done is redirect everything to a single
instance at this point and then got some
affinity between the application and an
application server now each application
server has multiple threads and we're
still load balancing amongst those
threads within an application server so
the next logical step would be to get
some affinity between that data and just
one application server thread so if we
were manufacturing a piece of equipment
every bit of data associated with that
piece of equipment if that was all to go
through one application server thread
there would be no contention on that
data from any other threads so let's try
that and this and we will do what we
call full affinity this would be the
same as if we had a browser so we would
redirect and get some affinity that's
all requests from a single browser would
just go down one application server
thread now you can actually see that
we're really starting to move and in
fact the red and blue lines are snow
showing that we're doing a lot more
throughput on these sort of things and
you can see literally by getting
affinity we've removed a lot of the
contention and we can see that we've
taken the throughput here literally up
to 65,000 transactions we're nearly ten
times faster than we were when we
started okay
so this gets to the point we've learned
that if we start stop trying to hash
everything over everything and
load-balanced everything over everything
by doing all that load balancing what we
are actually doing is we are initiating
contention at both app server and
database level and we're also diluting
our ability to get good cache hits to
find the data in your local cache so the
last move on this move is instead of
having a connection where all app
servers connect to all all database
instances if we were to map the app
server to a specific instance we can
case it to the next point and then we
can fully utilize all the hardware so
now we have a dedicated service where
each application server maps to its own
database instance you can see that the
performance at this point we've now
taken it up to twice what we were
achieving with a single instance we're
now at about a hundred and twenty five
hundred and thirty transactions per
second which is more than ten times that
we achieved when we were load balancing
everything over everything okay now it
may look smart in an architectural
diagram to load balance over everything
over everything but all data by its
nature tends to have some sort of
clustering ID so if we can route things
through the middle tier clustering on
that data element now that could be your
social security number your telephone
number it could be a serial number of a
part all those sort of things or even
your browser IP address we can actually
affect some affinity that the database
level and it comes back to that
old-fashioned idea of if you can be
modifying your data in your own local
cache it's a thousand times faster than
if you have to get it either from
another instance or from disk and you
can see as a result of getting better
affinity through the system we have made
the performance go from eight thousand
transactions a second to nearly a
hundred and forty thousand transactions
per second
you'll notice we didn't change anything
on the database we didn't change a
storage clause we didn't rebuild an
index we did absolutely nothing at the
database level we just basically refine
the workload coming through the middle
tiers such that we could get good
clustering of data now this doesn't have
to be an exact solution this is by no
certain an exact solution but if you can
get clustering through the middle tier
and you get it right nine times out of
ten you're going to be doing better than
you do it five times out of ten if you
can get it not correct 99 times out of a
hundred you're going to do better but
you're no way in modern applications are
far too complicated to ever get this to
be exactly a hundred percent but if we
can get it into the 90s we're doing
really well and this is really important
that it's understood that you can kill
systems performance by trending to hash
everything over everything the load
balance over everything over everything
and we actually know this in real life
if we keep all the data that we want to
process together together instead of
spreading it out we always can do that
performance it's very simple when we
when we if we were basically to put all
the data we need it over sixteen desks
it would take a lot longer to process if
you put it all on one desk you could
process it together we all know this
stuff so with that in mind you can see
we've built a high performance system
that's doing a high throughput but it's
sensitive people need to be educated as
to what you're doing
architects need to think about data
affinity through the middle tier and
this can be degraded by literally
somebody not quite understanding what
they did what's going on and if suddenly
they decide to say oh I'm going to use a
different connect string and perhaps
we'll use something like the scan list
and they're thinking they're going to
load balance it they can devalue the
whole thing straightaway because you can
see fairly quickly we're now trying to
load balance we think we're logically
load balancing over instances but we're
now degrading our cache affinity
so back come the gray wait events and
the system throughput has been halved so
you can see by not touching anything at
the database and just trying to ensure
better data affinity coming through on
the transactions we can have dramatic
impacts on response time and on
throughput
