all the horrible customer well online
and it's great to see so many Gideon's
morning that's great my name is nothing
acai I work in Argyll UK and technology
sales consultant group and I'm your host
for today before we start I want to run
over a couple points on our possessions
going to be run so firstly this webcast
is being recorded and the recording will
be available in a few days you'll be
able to get to the recording from the
website vegetable event also from the
Oracle Learning Library and also from
the Oracle Learning Channel on YouTube
just as a youtuber putting Oracle
Learning Channel you'll you'll soon find
it there during the webcast do feel free
to post any questions you have using the
chat window or the Q&amp;amp;A window which ever
you prefer you can find that from the
toolbar at the top of your school please
direct your questions to either all the
panels all pocketbooks whichever you
prefer will answer as many questions as
we plan via chat during the session but
also we're going to have a specific to
announce that solid Carson talking
through some of the questions do also
remember today's weather clouds is part
you might be interested in some of the
other ones if you are curious do make
your way back to the launch to oracle
com website you can see here on the
slide and have a look at your wake up
its electricity and finally before we go
any further I need to show you I'm able
to explain a small
now onto today's topic which is what's
new in a web Center 11 11 it this topic
we presented by Jonathan Ives who's a
very experienced with has a sales
consultant okay helping Jonathan are two
people are doable can do using are
called red small web has ourselves as
well is based in Bucharest and also
creating a couple who's based in
bangalore so thanks very much without
further ado I'll hand you over to
Jonathan go to you Tommy thank you
actually we're good morning everybody
I'm going to take you through a fairly
brisk walk through what's new in
webcenter 11 11 eggs now just a
summarized webcenter has three principal
components but set a portal for prepping
portals was into content for managing
websites digital assets document stars
images video etc webcenter sites for
building compelling web experiences and
customer experiences each of these has
bit had significant improvements and
upgrading let more monday i'm going to
go through each of them in turn there'll
be some common themes and as we go
through those will emerge so let's start
with webcenter portal
the two major themes of this release are
around the tooling the youth grateful
and support for mobile devices and
actually you will see this again with
content and you'll see this with types
as well
so when we talk about tooling and
knowledge work of tooling what we really
mean here is the ability to create or
form and manager for in a browser by a
user that doesn't have Java skills and
when necessarily in HTML skills so it
actually means for the portal can be
created from templates its creation
process is very quickly taking the
techniques to essentially a wizard
process I once you created the portal
you can customize it from a library of
assets that you have which in fact is in
the right arm there i'll show you in a
bit more detail in a moment even tough
most pages you can customize who had
access to that site and this is all done
within a browser and anybody that's
familiar with any kind of web experience
and if you use wordpress etc this is a
very familiar type of model so it means
to the knowledge worker complaint of
boardman manage the portal without
recourse to people who are specific HTML
Javascript CSS 6 experts now the other
key thing around this is about making
this available so in terms of how you
access the poor on grading the ball in
my exits through an existing desktop
browser you might access it through
mobile device in the last year or so
we've seen a number of people using
mobile devices taxes for net exceed the
number of people using gets on the
license and there's a generation below
us that are probably using mobile
devices or requirements their point of
entry so the point is with the new
tooling I can play the ball I can check
that it runs correctly both on a distant
browser and on a mobile device but I can
also create profiles based on specific
by stem bolts so it might be that on
certain devices made into bones maybe
phones from a people and ventral or
bladed the ball flattening from wine and
we have the ability to create device
profile some families of device pro bars
than enable us to do that and we can
test it inside the board builder itself
before we actually happened try it on
the individual devices finally all of
this capability we can also make a
choice as to whether we want to generate
build our own mobile app
so this is different this is where we're
actually building a mix of application
we did use an idiot mobile or the native
Mexican carriers of the devices so when
people talking about mobility and
multichannel we really cover a wide
variety of types of big women ranging
from a desktop browser a desktop browser
that is responsive and reporter and
works well on a wide range of devices
specific profiles of finally through to
a truly mobile locally installed
application now let's go back to our
issue about the tooling and the etc so
we in 18 we have the portal builder so
this is new previously we had something
called spaces and wants uncle composer
but we've really taken those concepts
and come up with something called portal
builder and this is where you assemble
the portal it runs in a browser so the
screenshot that you see there is laying
insights and web browser you create
portal from a range of templates and
it's a big organization might define its
own template so it might have one for
collaborative work on the knowledge
management one for self-service you can
create fire our construction break a
dish you can lay out the pages you can
pull in assets so the idea is that a
user can perhaps within a marketing
department or not necessarily from IIT
function as the ability to create and
customize that order experience now
jdeveloper which is our internet
development environment is really used
for creating some very specific
components within that so for example
you can use to have developed a new
skins and LU page Styles templates you
can also use it to create the top ask
flows and the portlets that you have
assets you can drop in the Corporal
builder and people use our portal and
they never necessarily use jdeveloper so
it's an option there it's typically used
by a different type of person will be
before builder but it's you
other very specific set of talking
whereas normal builder is really aimed
at a general user who is comfortable
with this kind of drag and drop
web-based experience so if we try and
take that and layer that on the people
in the organization here we've got a
cast of characters but parodies a
knowledge worker and she's the person
who builds the portal creates the UI she
manages made in a search and Lucas so
she's she's managing the portal and
she's creating new portals within the
environment then she might have she
might occasionally access or turn to re
and ask him to do some more technical
work so he might start to add some
capabilities to the portal maybe working
around the mobility maybe using some of
the capabilities to access some of the
backing back office systems but again
not needing to rely on writing what's
wrong now if Cody's been we've got big
the developer here and dave loses
jdeveloper creates the new task Rosen
portlet which then become reusable
assets for both Karen nary from news in
a day to day jobs in the portal now in
this example we've split it out into
four so I've got a messiah here is the
administrator so he manages some of the
other kind of more general capabilities
across all of the Warhawks so that might
be around managing things were like the
search configuration managing the portal
metrics we have analytics tools within
the portal so he might be interested in
all of the pages paper going to what
we'll search is by performing maybe what
are the searches they're performing that
return no results because that's
interesting Google obviously then lends
itself to writing some content that if
people are searching for that so
different people different roles that
they have supported by word center so as
I mentioned earlier parading a ball who
is choosing from a range of templates
button definer creations from the pages
that i want to have and i can do things
like provide a friendly URL so i go
through three steps and my portal is
created
some of the other things that immune 11
woman I around refining the level search
to the handles and presents the news lot
so for example now we should have some
acid is searching scope searching and
this improves on the capability to be
happy also it means that I open when I
search for something within the portal
it separates them by attribute so this
might be metadata so it might be I want
to see the bottle for the return but I
might want them grouped in a number of
subheadings are you storm the department
whatever I can also have scope searches
so depending on where I am in the portal
the search is adapted to the type of
searches I might want to do within that
particular screen or context
and having returned my results I can
bang boom box for criteria so result we
see on the left rank a date or alter
recital but and here you can see some
metadata on the right relating to that
particular document only these metadata
fields began 40 or standard ones through
attend the content but typically they
would map onto the business requirements
or business meta beige and taxonomy
another custom
better look at the portal bill bill so
the central region is how you design
your portal and here's your lips got a
state recent activities pain taking up
about two-thirds of the wit and then
we've got announcements events and links
on the left hand panel we've got them at
the map of the pages and we've got the
documents discussions announces and all
of the these are configurable and drag
and drop things from here move them
around on the right-hand side we see how
our library of assets so we things a lot
and see things like our alerts and
updates our analytics head content
management and all of these are
configurable so if a customer might have
their own list of applications so if
they were building a self-service portal
they might have company a's self-service
port it's as a library of components and
they might be a component in there for
somebody to find there how much vacation
they had left or how much are they
receiving and our salary and these that
could then be just dragged onto the onto
the desktop for example Karen a portal
admit that builder and added to the
layout
so I mentioned about mobility and
mobility I'll come back to again again
cross swords and products but here what
we're talking about here is learning
different devices that we can have rules
that caused portal to the den itself
slightly different so you can see in the
top view screenshot elicited biases it
and you can expend this obviously that
the number of mobile devices is growing
at a huge rate muscles change probably
daily so you can define nude and biases
and then you can prove them together see
you might have behaviors which are
common to a group of devices for example
you might have apple tablet or android
tablets or you might have apple bones or
you might have desktop browsers and you
can use these device settings to
actually drive the page with the portal
you might use it result will be
determine what images using the portal
so the expectation of images might be
different if you'll run off on a small
screen device from running on them
sixteen by nine format desktop for
example it may even the options that you
don't present to users on mobile devices
that you do present them if they're in
the office coming in over your corporate
and land
the other nice thing is you can preview
what it looks like so having having
started to build your portal and
recognize the different devices what you
can then do is preview how that's going
to look and you can check as your
invasion see how it looks in landscape
she looks in port road and that speeds
up the whole process and it also means
that you don't have to equip every
developer with every device they can
preview here and have confidence that it
will look appropriate when they actually
access from all devices so everything
I've described that at this point around
mobility is really about a web-based
experience it might be on a desktop it
might be on a mobile device but we can
take this as stage Spergel the latest
release of webcenter incorporates the
latest versions of area application
development framework for an Oracle and
that's support things like html5 and
css3 it's got lots of refinements the
mud around performance equipment so
different ways of compressing the
JavaScript that's delivered to the
browser from ways of improving the
bandwidth and some of the capabilities
around images so for example how you
handle the roaming around bullets when
you have birthing agent curved corners
traditionally this is done by retrieving
images from the server that's all now
part css3 so it means that essentially
the amount of data that's going to the
browser is reduced X naught addition and
we have a whole new range of components
it's available to developers to build an
idea so things like sunbursts timelines
and multi file uploads from drag and
drop so the new new set of capabilities
there that we we get because we built
this all on a year
now a couple of things around
administration so this is this is a long
way away from user experience but this
is really around the capabilities that
med administrator would see so we've got
things like lifecycle enhancements
search refinements the support for
enterprise manager and southern good
impersonation and I'll just have a quick
look through these so then quickly
through this life cycle enhancement is
really about ruling that enables us to
better assist the administrator this
environment so for example the scripting
but a typical weblogic server
administrator rules to deploy the server
to run a brothel or to take down a
porter to upgrade your back wats so we
improve the 16 capabilities for we've
also provided a number of refinements
about how you back up the portal and how
you integrate it with the capabilities
the underlying oracle weblogic server
capabilities in this space
so we talked a little bit about search
already so not going to spend too much
time on it we ways of restrict seeing
the the sources of searching that a
person can use so these are just acting
screwing that somebody building a portal
news if they just wanted a restrict
searches to either particular groupings
of content or particular attributes of
their content now in 11 one night with
incorporating something called
impersonation but what that basically
means is if the secure wires granting
that person
make another person so I suppose we the
closest approximation to the second
thing Bob is where a nap sir a manager
might give an administrator at Oh or PA
the ability to act on their behalf of
managing someone's diary could be
familiar with that concept well this is
the kings of that so essentially i can
give somebody good right to securely
impersonate me why would we do that well
it might be that in my absence so I want
somebody to take over the management of
a particular aspects of the portal or I
might want to allow them to manage
blocks or wiki's on my behalf so it's a
way of providing this capability which
in a typical organization is very useful
for home now enterprise manager
earlier we have support for enterprise
support websense portal with in
enterprise manager so that means on
standard enterprise manager swings I can
see all kinds of metrics about the
activity of the portal if status its
responsiveness and I can manage it along
with the application server the David
Wright is an entire infrastructure
Graham Oracle through one single
management console and here you see a
number of typical screens so for example
here i'm looking at ticking LePage's
based throughput the processing time and
it might feed the vaio decide that
certain pages or certain aspects of the
invention or visiting others I can
reallocate resources of all the more
full
so that was a quick overview of a little
one when a portal are now going to look
at the content component of webcenter
words in content and again the themes
here are around a refinements to the new
interface and spoken mobile apps we've
got some requirements around the imaging
and capture so that specifically you are
scanning in a doctorate physical
document it's installing them within
webcenter content possibly as part of a
any business application or siebel or
any of the other applications will
provide and a number of integration
options they listed here as platform
updates but there's move interesting
things that we have around a the
capabilities of integration webcenter
content
so first of all webcenter content has a
new web UI and as you'll see there it's
very consistent with the look and feel
of portal and it's a simplified UI from
the older we're sending why so you can
see here screen sharing documents using
thumbnails descriptions or just using
farmer levels they're quick way to look
through a library of digital assets so
easy to use and consistent with the
portal and with me the refine seed
expect so ability the drag of content to
sir let's arrange many deals the other
nice thing with the new UI is it's
decoupled from the actual server
components or temp content makes no
difference to a user but from an
architecture point of view it means that
you've got new ways of deployments and
might have service video casing of a
bind these are in place to consume
content servers and I guess that's akin
to the way that maybe an application in
ADF pull walks to an Oracle database at
the back end d capable presentation
layer from the repository and we have
that capability now with a new good
sense content law
we also have a mobile application will
return convent this is very much aimed
at organizations who have perhaps field
workers they like new technicians or
sales people people could go out on
visit customers or sites and they need
to take the whole volume of buttons with
them so if I'm going if I'm a repair
technician I might want to take that set
of documentation or something on going
out and build rapport a tablet computer
is model with rice and this is really
aimed at those nothing I can table where
all that set of documentation with me I
can be underneath the piece of equipment
that I need to fix tablet looking at
images looking at documents looking at
video which I've downloaded I mean I go
online we synchronize with this being
any update so can pick those up
similarly for those words in a field it
won't affect the latest list of prices
or the latest brochure information they
can take that around on them and mobile
device
now a number of refinements to document
capture so for example Oracle document
caption ouch formerly with odbc and no
bc it now has completely web-based you I
its have been ported since you're in
right edition runs on top of the
standard weblogic server environment
which means it integrates with all of
those capabilities around enterprise
management around the ws wls tswift c
language for energy that environment so
it means that it's very much part of the
fusion middleware all now not cross
browser support and some simplifications
in the architecture
you
so couple things here we've made a
number of refinements around our reforms
recognition so this is the ability to
intelligently scan documents to the
invoices where you don't know precisely
where the invoice number or the customer
number or sales number is on the form so
we can call operating a number of new
requirements this technology is some in
oracle area then we takin all the latest
version and so some of those benefits we
get by upgrading that consistently the
lexus version we're also localized in 16
languages so that increases and
increases the Rangers got languages the
pepper proc supports now on the
SharePoint side this is very interesting
so essentially what we're saying here is
now people who use Microsoft SharePoint
and integrate the websense content in
such a way that content as it evolves in
sharepoint is migrated into words
they're into content so it might be that
you have a number of my service and
when documents reach a certain version
or a certain maturity they automatically
migrated into web center conferring web
censor content provides the records
management the old thing security so our
documents are formed in the sort of
white heat of SharePoint creation so
people clap I protect collaborate
ex-library eating well very quickly on a
document but once those documents need
to go into a longer life cycle then
something like what's in a Content
reliable place to put them so
essentially what this means is that
convent moves in sua soan car on some
overtime based on metadata based on
painful time and at that point corporate
retention policies can be applied to
that concert in one single points it
also provides a single place to search
for content which is another challenge
for organizations that want to establish
if they having legal obligation or they
have in particular issues they need to
find within their content store where
relating to policy legal requirement or
records retention
now finally let's look at webcenter
science so webcenter heights is about
creating compelling digital experiences
and these are the key things here is
multi-channel so the ability to acquire
compelling mobile web experience
alongside desktop web integration with
the external content so traditionally
would Center site as had the ability to
build very quickly compelling websites
using content managed within itself now
we have the ability to build websites
using condoms external exam results and
finally enhancements around search and
personalization capabilities so these
are the three messages and again we see
mobility being a key message so now as
with report or when I build a site I can
immediately see how this looks so as
part of the tooling and again the screen
that you see there that's running in a
browser that's not on a desktop tool
that's just simply running inside a web
browser so when I'm building my site I
can preview in check that it looks okay
in the devices that I know why employees
still my customers are music and also we
can detect what the type of it I since
we can make decision is based on the
resolution one factor or the capability
and again that's all based on producing
html5 and supporting things like
responsive design where where possible
we make the content adapt to the video
available space on a device or the
available capabilities
now one of the really interesting
capabilities of webcenter soil is the
ability to personalize the content based
on the visitors behavior typically a use
of a website site would be navigating
around the site they haven't necessarily
log into the site it got them down so
over time we build up a profile based on
the content they looked at and it's
based on rules and building those rules
is now available to anybody within some
marketing department there's no really
hard work Debbie done here it's simply
setting up rules and filters as you see
in the screenshot which means that
creating really compelling really
personalized sites that adapt to the
behavior of a visitor is now very easy
for people will do there's no really
advanced things to be down here but also
we have the ability to extend it and
invoke things like or a cloth TD no
Oracle RTD is essentially able to fly
personalization based on back office
things so for example if i visit us i
might click on certain images are
certain ask cause over time this tooling
builds up profile of me decides the
kinds of articles are interesting in all
the science of content or maybe the
kinds of offers in a retail side it
would like to potentially ltd can also
talk to the black n systems and apply
some logic from there so it might be
that I'm offered special deals on items
that hands and Barry while stock levels
for example more commerce site so that's
where our TD is talking for the back
office maybe the stock control systems
establishing what things we have a large
number of and building that into the
equation that determines law or products
or what content I'm offered on the
screen and all of that segment tuition
tooling is now available through a REST
API are well so this kind of capability
be exposed to people along baby mobile
devices if you earn a very rapidly
moving industry where
changing these filters on a daily or
maybe hourly basis is important than her
having access to it from the widest
range of devices and connections is
important
you
so one of the other existing what simple
sites is the advanced URL management so
here we get in there what are called
vanity URLs or friendly URLs which is
either set up people are like if they
expect a URL to reflect the
organization's name or reflect the
particular page structure so very easily
we can set up the URLs within the within
the site's tooling and it allows those
URLs to be customized and conformed to
the team of corporate standards best
practices etc
now another capability that's new in 11
11 hunt is the access content or to
manage content within web synthesis on
iets there is actually residing web sent
quantum websense content is a highly
scale-up event management system or
Center sites consumes content so
obviously the lunchroom step was to link
the two products together so it might be
that content libs good in web sent
across 10 it evolves in there and at
some point it is mapped by the UI in
webcenter sites fund that content in
that's available to at levels is
actually coming from within the content
and they copied for going to Center
content in the webcenter sites so it
might be that what's been a Content
really is your vault of images cons and
brochures etc and those images that are
deemed to be appropriate for the website
or maybe I'll be the corporate standard
or migrated out of webcenter content
pushed into eternity sites from which
then can be laid on site and as those
images or as that branding changes that
flow from contacting the sites continues
so that means that the same sites is
always picking up the latest approved
content and that's subject to all of the
benefits would send content in terms of
records management retention motion or
get log security etc it also means that
what Center sites can exploit the
digital asset management capability is
awkward send content presenta content
can transform images into a range of
resolutions into a range of formats in
the video or any file format so it can
really use webcenter content and an
engine to get the best content out onto
the most rapidly evolving corporate
websites
now the other thing that we can do is
reference content that's stored
somewhere completely different we're not
bringing the content insights for sale
we're simply enabling a marketeer for
example to create a site and see a
library of images are a lot of your
videos where they are actually stored
somewhere else the news that have to
worry about going somewhere hiding URL
cut and pasting getting it right
understanding all the syntax of YouTube
videos or Brightcove videos they simply
see as an asset and that means that more
and more organizations are you using
different channels to present themselves
out for their customers of the citizens
YouTube might be one Brightcove another
they could be arranged to external
channels through which they market
themselves so rather than have to
duplicate this across multiple different
systems we can simply add that to the
tooling so here we might see on the run
quite some video footage that's come
from YouTube the person reading this I
didn't know that that was coming from
YouTube they simply drag it from the
library across some images and as I said
it's a reference so it's transparent to
the to the marked here or the person is
building the site
now I touched an RTD real-time decisions
earlier and this is really powerful we
can also send us items always been able
to make decisions that the content you
possess the sum of the based on their
behaviors step browser possibly even
where they located so they gave a very
personalized experience which is key to
winning good websites what RTD can bring
to that is the ability to combining that
with information from other systems so
that might factor in availability of
items local to where the person is in my
vector in you know various aspects of
maybeee business suite or self-service
apps if it was an employee of website
where it may be the employee needs to
see content that's perfect and into the
location they were based back all the
wrong a born so RTD provides and useful
during between the recommendation
mechanism building for sites and the
back of the systems and the custom
applications of any organization has
which might actually be nice to be
factored into that and he's an example
earlier if somebody was buying something
and a former retail site building
sabersense site if we knew that they had
large stock in their area we might offer
than a better offer than if they were in
an area that had no level system and
that would be an example where our TV
won't bet information available to the
logic behind the soul
some of the other fun refinements around
the tooling websense buy it for things
like the social elements of learning a
site there things like bowls and ratings
and reviews is all built now into the
standard tooling so if I want to drag a
comment region onto a page or I want to
make posle ratings I can do that we've
also extended the range of social media
logins without a Google Buster that in
addition to interface book etc and the
installation which used to have a second
install about community and gadgets
server that's what being rolled into a
single school so the the installation of
variety of Eden was there's less
components and that's been streamlined
so the whole process of propylene
content with social media with gadgets
has been somatically central all
okay now at this point I'm a little bit
ahead of schedule I don't know if we
have any questions at this point
you
ok so i start the ball
I've had a question regarding the
relationship of spaces and framework to
water bill so in previous version of
webcenter the portal essentially use
this portal was built using something
called fee or said framework and we
included in application spaces which was
really a tribal law so where we've
evolved to is that with a new portal
builder this really takes over where
space is startling so this takes
capability of words in the spaces and
build this into a fully functional
portal builder so before we had
essentially two ways to build a quarrel
and suitable for different scenarios now
we have portable double cheese for what
and single word we build the poor but
the jdeveloper framework is really used
to what it's really good at which is
building those compelling ad at our
slows and those compelling portlets so
we're perhaps before the little bit
confused maybe for customers as to which
technology big news it's very clear now
that new new build using portal builder
in tamale browser-based it's easier to
use and j developer is really detailed
problems of maybe integrating with
particular backs of bank of his systems
or particular capabilities for the not
providing quite portable i should say
that the board provides something 200
plus different components tas clothes
that provide things like integration
with email alan ball so a lot of people
will date the portal use both a builder
and that may be all they ever need to
eat a great reward rating systems will
be more than malfunction
any other questions at that point
okay I'm just looking in the Q&amp;amp;A panel
so there was a question about rapid
application integration I've try my best
there so we have the range of the portal
is has a range of technologies you would
use to integrate into backup systems so
for the pagelet producer place it
producer is a way of accessing systems
which maybe you don't have a good web
service Lee the aisle then or respective
to suppose that producer is the way of
quickly building a web UI or component
you can plug into a portal that might
talk to a packable system so it's a way
of getting data from the systems
providing basically their systems where
no other api's exists or maybe no other
appropriate technologies or access is
available then going through we
obviously have a range of increasingly
sophisticated solutions right up to
building with service based eight-year
task falls on that if you like the
preferred route so you could have such a
solution based on simple things like
iframes you could have a more
sophisticated solution based on
basically producer and I suppose final
solution is to have web service type
calls from an ADF application that's the
most sophisticated so a lot of
innovations would use them another
patient producer to involve into
prototyping build something rapidly and
then that might require then a full ATX
or edit adult or it actually might be
suitable for the job so you really have
got a broad set of tools in the toolkit
here writing from things that are quick
and easy to use right the way it's
through two things that a longer and
more sophisticated but you know where
you really need that kind of
functionality
so I'm just having a looking at you and
I panel
so there was a question about a VFR be
available thermal well I need 11 11 I
understand is that that isn't out if
Claude on my body so I might need to go
and get some more details so that was a
question for Kira McDonald so if you and
I will perhaps get an answer back to you
on that one but as minus thing is in 11
118 the the forms recognition is
available it has been ported to weblogic
server and run within that environment
but i'd like to confirm that so that if
you forget me or I'll take that one away
and get a definite answer to you we will
have your email address so I long for
that boy
so I think let's think covers most of
the questions that I've seen on there so
if nobody else has any questions anybody
having questions over the voice link
none that I can say Jonathan
so instead let's edit start this this
particular presentation was one of a
range of that were providing at the
moment so you can see a URL there so
those are the prom / treasure mart UK ID
and take the costs and obviously you can
also get it replays that this one this
series of presentations through this
mechanism or through youtube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
