on oracle advanced security in oracle
database 12c my name is todd barker and
i'm the product manager for oracle
advanced security this is the second in
a series of short video recordings for
anyone who's looking to learn more about
oracle advanced security and quickly get
up to speed on what's new in the current
release it is often said that one
picture is worth a thousand words so
let's pick up or the previous overview
presentation left off and show a product
demonstration in this oracle advanced
security data redaction demo you will
see sensitive information being redacted
by the database in a real-world
application you also will see creation
and management of data redaction
policies using Oracle Enterprise Manager
we will end by looking at an actual PL
sequel script that creates a data
redaction policy here is a simple call
center application built is an Oracle
application Express or apex and running
inside of an oracle database 12c
pluggable database I'll start off by
logging in as a call center operator who
is coming in to work and starting their
shift after logging in the operator is
taken directly to the customer summary
screen the operator picks up the phone
to take their first customer call and
the customer on the other end of the
line communicates their name which we
will use to look up their key
information
here we see the customers details
including contact payment and other
profile information at the top right of
the screen you can see that per the
requirements of the payment card
industry standard or PCI and according
to the direction of our auditors we
already are redacting the customer's
credit card number so that it is not
displayed in the clear in this
application at the bottom left of the
screen you can see some personally
identifiable information or PII about
this customer that the auditors also
want to be displayed in a redacted form
specifically it is the customers date of
birth and us social security number that
the auditors are concerned about at this
point I'm going to switch over to Oracle
Enterprise Manager to set up a new
redaction policy for this PII data here
you see the data redaction home screen
for my pluggable database notice the
existing policy titled redact customer
PCI that has been defined for redacting
a credit card number I'm going to click
on create to add a new policy for the
PII data first I need to identify the
relevant database schema so I click on
the search icon and select the schema
titled CRM
second I need to identify the database
table in this case will be redacting a
table called cust accounts third I will
give the policy a name we'll call it
redact customer PII fourth I need to add
the relevant columns to this redaction
policy to do that I click on the Add
button below
we want to redact the date of birth
which is stored in a column named DOB
will use standard full redaction for the
column this redaction method swaps an
own constant value into the query
results that get returned no additional
parameters are required now we want to
add a second column to the policy we
also want to redact the US social
security number which is stored in a
column named SSN notice that data
redaction provides pre-configured
templates for common sensitive data
types such as social security number so
we will simply select the relevant
template which then will fill in the
remaining parameters automatically you
can see that will be using partial
redaction for the SSN matching on the
appropriate string format and replacing
the first five digits with an X
okay now this redaction policy is almost
complete lastly we want to set an
enforcement condition for this policy
notice that the policy expression on the
Left defaults to 1 equals 1 which
evaluates to true meaning to always
redact the column data in this call
center we have a supervisor who handles
customer escalations and this particular
application user may have a legitimate
business need to see the unredacted date
of birth and social security number so
we need to add a condition that checks
the current application user and exempts
from redaction when it is the call
center supervisor to help with this I
click on the pencil icon which raises
the policy expression builder dialog
in this condition I'm going to leverage
application information that is passed
into the database environment I select
the client identifier to read the
current application user and set in is
not condition that specifies the
supervisors account name
this causes the database to redact for
all app users except for the call center
supervisor now that the data redaction
policy is complete I can click on OK to
commit this change and the new policy
shows up in my list this policy will be
immediately enforced on active database
sessions no servers need to be restarted
and no logging in or logging out is
required all I need to do is refresh the
page in the application and the redacted
version of the data will be displayed so
to show that I'm going to switch back to
the call center application in just a
moment I'm going to click on the refresh
button to reload this customer detail
page but before I do this watch the
bottom left panel which displays the
date of birth and u.s. social security
number notice that the sensitive data
being displayed has been dynamically
changed by data redaction but what about
the call center supervisor account if I
log out and then log back in as the call
center supervisor and then I look up the
same customer name again
notice that per the condition in our
data redaction policy the call center
supervisor is exempted and still can see
the unredacted data this is the final
step of the product demonstration here
is a quick look at a PL sequel script
that generates the same redaction policy
that we just created in the demo the
first call the DBMS redact creates the
policy on the cost accounts table
specifying the policy expression to
exempt the supervisor account and point
into the date of birth column which will
be fully redacted the second call the
DBMS redact adds the customer SSN column
to the policy which will be partially
redacted so to wrap this up data
redaction enables you to reduce exposure
of sensitive data displayed by
applications it does this directly from
the database where you can redact
consistently across your apps without
having to make a lot of application code
or configuration changes and as we saw
in the demo you can make intelligent
redaction decisions based on different
runtime conditions that concludes this
Oracle advance security product
demonstration as the next step please
join me for the next recording thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
