infrastructure fast connect hi while
setting up the vcn for my compute
instance I came across the fast connect
service option can you tell me more
about it please
sure Oracle cloud infrastructure fast
connect is a dedicated network
connection alternative to using the
public internet for connecting your
existing networks with your vcn it
enables you to establish a dedicated and
private connection between your existing
physical network and your virtual cloud
network or vcn fast connect provides
multiple bandwidth options as compared
to public internet it is a secure and
reliable way of connecting to any of the
Oracle cloud infrastructure services
here are some other things to keep in
mind fast connect enables hybrid and
multi cloud workloads between Oracle
cloud infrastructure and existing
networks Oracle cloud infrastructure
fast connect is built to provide
redundancy building blocks that help you
balance availability and cost Oracle
cloud infrastructure fast Connect works
with multiple network providers for a
complete list please refer to the Oracle
cloud infrastructure fast to connect
site or ask your salesperson
Wow you mean fast Connect enables
dedicated and highly available
connectivity to my existing networks yes
fast Connect was designed to provide
multiple bandwidth options and a highly
available private network connectivity
this connection supports native cloud
workloads and lift and shift workloads
from your network to the Oracle cloud
network
I guess that's where it gets the name
fast connect from what connection speeds
does the service support
you can connect to your closest fast
connect locations at port speeds in one
gigabyte per second and ten gigabytes
per second increments this enables you
to start small and grow seamlessly as
your demand for bandwidth between your
network and Oracle cloud infrastructure
increases
that's great are there different options
for connecting with fast connect
with fast connect you can establish a
connection by collocation or via a
provider in both cases the connection
goes between the edge of your existing
network and Oracle your DRG for a
complete list of fast connect colocation
sites and partners refer to the FAQ
section under networking on the Oracle
cloud infrastructure portal
collocation co-locating with Oracle in a
fast connect location means this is your
physical connection to Oracle within the
fast connect location provider
connecting to Oracle via a fast connect
provider means this is your physical
connection to the provider and the
provider's physical connection to Oracle
within the fast connect location
can I connect to all my resources within
a region with a single fast connect
connection
yes when you connect to an Oracle fast
connect location within a region you can
connect to your VC and resources within
that region including bare-metal compute
virtual machines VM and database
what about the price bet it is pretty
expensive right
actually the fast Connect pricing
structure is based on your port size and
is billed hourly there is no bandwidth
charge
Thanks fast connect sure does seem to be
a promising network connectivity option
sure with fast connect you can easily
create redundant connections required
for critical applications and workloads
hope you are clear about the fast
connect advantage to learn more please
go to the Oracle cloud infrastructure
portal you can sign up for a free trial
and get started right away
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
