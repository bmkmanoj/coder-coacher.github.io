title of this talk is tools for java ee
7 evolution or revolution so to
introduce myself I'm better utica and
I'm the development manager working on
the NetBeans IDE team and I'm
responsible for the developer occasions
area which includes the Java platform or
and support for java in the NetBeans IDE
as well as the decline side tools around
HTML CSS JavaScript so this is just a
standard disclaimer because we are going
to talk about you know possible product
directions and future stuff so just
letting you know that anything will
change and nothing is set in stone so
how many of you have seen a slight like
this before okay looks like every many
so basically this is a list of
technologies which are new in java ee 7
or or updated in july seven you know
some of these are minor updates some of
these are major updates some are
completely new but this is actually not
what we are going to talk about today so
the purpose of this presentation is not
to provide a comprehensive list of
things that may change or will change in
I des with java ee 7 you know this is
very very broad area and I'm sure there
are specialized talks about you know GSF
GPA CDI JMS and other things that you
may want to talk to go to so this this
will be a very small subset of what you
see here and we will just focus on a few
few things of these because this
presentation is too short to cover all
of this so what what are we going to
talk about so in the first part I'd like
to talk about the changes which are an
evolutionary in
the java ee 7 platform so java ee 6 is a
very mature and establish false form and
basically there are many many changes
that build on top of this maturity and
to provide more in this area more
features more alignment more ease of use
ease of development and so this is the
first part of talk at the same time java
ee 7 contains some technologies which
are which will enable and accelerate
development of new kind of applications
these applications are sometimes
referred to as basically html5
applications or also thin server
applications so has people heard
internal sensor in suburbs i also heard
the detailed poh wife plain old html5 so
those are the kind of names people refer
to these applications and actually
related this boo boo of you have been
and at the keynote on Sunday and has
seen the demo of the new NetBeans 73 so
quite a few so you know that you may
know that at this talk we introduced a
new support for html5 development in
netbeans called coordinate project easel
and basically this is targeting this
exactly this kind of applications has
have people have been to added talks on
project easel and about how about what
it is we've seen some other talks ok so
again quite a few of you so we don't
have enough space in this presentation
to talk about program is that such and
all the features that it has i would
like to refer you to NetBeans org so
that means dot org has all the
information
the new html5 features in that bin 73 so
here it is just click click here there
are a couple screencast wiki pages and
and some more just briefly the main
features of the project ezel html5
application development are there is a
new html5 application project which
contains JavaScript testing there is a
major improvements in the javascript
editor until this has basically been
rewritten from scratch there is a visual
page inspector and visual CSS style
ideas so I think this looks very nice in
the industry cast so I recommend you to
watch a screencast there is JavaScript
debugger so basically can put
breakpoints in your JavaScript code and
their bucket life and all this works
actually with that currently 22 browsers
first there is a chrome plugin so
NetBeans as a plug into Chrome which
basically enables all the debugging and
page inspection and styling in in chrome
and then we also have the embedded web
browser which is a component running
right inside the ID window and is bad
webkit-based so basically it will be
compatible with many modern browsers
like such as Chrome Safari you know
Mobile Safari Android browser and all
these so if you are interested in in
this area look at NetBeans or actually
one thing I'd like to also mention is
that or announce is that netbeans 73
beta was released just today and this
release contains all the features that
I'm talking about so feel free to go to
NetBeans or canned
no the brand new LED been 73 beta so
what I would like to talk about here is
actually some aspects of this html5
development which were not mentioned
before and which are more kind of
revamped to java ee 7 applications and
new capabilities in this area that java
ee 7 provides and maybe look at some
things from a new angle that that wasn't
mentioned in the previous presentations
so first let's start to talk about kind
of general basics that i would like to
expect that i expect in java ee 7 tools
so these are just very basic things that
are taken for granted and you don't even
think about them so you would like to
have completion for new api is that are
in the e7 platform like you see on the
screen shot on the right that's a class
from the new jax-rs 20 api and you see
that it's a you know in the code
completion and there is documentation
and so on and there is things like
supporting the new formats of the poem
descriptors config files and so on they
point to new versions of servers so you
don't even talk about those that that's
just taken for granted one thing that
may not be too obvious is that NetBeans
team actually provides and maintains the
maven archetypes for java ee technology
so where when you create and maven a
application in netbeans it uses a
standard up archetype that's published
in in the central repository and that
can be used by anyone not just NetBeans
users come online or you can use it from
from other IDEs so of course we plan to
update this archetype to support java ee
7 as well let's now talk about some of
the more prominent specifications in e 7
and
what we can expect in in the the
established technologies so I think jsf
20 was a really good views of jsf and
even the big biggest haters of GSF 1 dot
x needed to say that JSF 22 dot always
saw was much better than to eat reworked
so just 22 dot 2 has many further
improvements on top of that again I'm
not going to talk about most of them
here just the main ones there is a faces
flow which is a new visit like flows
support so basically if you have
multi-page scenarios there are no easily
supported in a JSF 22 there is a support
for html5 so for example html5 has data
attributes which are now allowed and
basically JSF 22 allows you to specify
these through special special tax
similarly html5 raxxess rules around the
ID attribute so maybe a currently any
element in HTML can contain an ID
attribute and JSF 22 reflexes Joseph
tutorials on the new expression language
30 which is actually a separate spike
but for the purpose of this slide I
think it's quite quite tight to jsf or
and quite related to jsf so let's
mention it in this context which
contains a support for lambda
expressions and operators on collections
that hair care act as queries previous
on objects in collections there is a
feature that I heard about called multi
templating but I not sure actually sure
whether that's in in jsf 202 or not or
over there was left out and basically
that support for skinning and having
multiple skins to to a component so how
is good going to work in a tool so I
have this
here called Joey seven six and seven
playground so if you look at some JSF
page so currently in tools you expect
that basically you have code completion
everywhere and that you can just you
know select anything and the idea is
intelligent about what what's in your
application and what it can do you know
so here are the methods of the
controller and so on and so what's new
in in here so there is this a pee-pee
namespace declared and as you can see
there is this red red icon which means
that NetBeans 73 currently does not
support the e7 so basically that means
does not yet understand this this
namespace what what this will do is
basically here is how you use it so
actually I can now create an attribute
called P something and this will
actually be transformed to the html5
data attribute that that we discussed
earlier so data attributes in html5 can
be supported through this way through
the new P namespace another notable
feature here is this thing so faces full
scope that's a new school basically that
is tied to the faces flow feature so you
have extensions in the expression
language and basically you would expect
to have code completion here which
doesn't work right now correctly
so let's go on to the next area which is
java persistence to all so the new
features here are stored procedures
support so basically you can have a name
query let me just show it right now
okay so here is an install procedure so
if you have a stored procedure in your
database you can refer to it and
basically expose it through jpap is and
next area is updates and deletes through
criteria API so so far you were only to
be able to do queries through criteria
API is now you can do also updates and
deletes enhance jpk syntax so I'm not
going to go into detail here but
basically right now you can have code
completion here in the j PQ el so of
course you would expect your IDE 22 also
cough offer the new syntax of JP q l and
the enhanced syntax of JP clear in in
the code completion and that's what you
can expect your to tune to do
multi-tenancy is a very big feature that
I don't even want to go into I just
mention it because it's it's very
prominent but if you are interested go
to it please go to a GPS Pacific talk
CDI has lots of enhancements here so
this is a screenshot of a blocker of the
weld implementation again I'm not going
to go through all these refer to the
source if you are interested so one one
thing that said it's actually notable
about CDI that until we will see that
later is that it works now much better
with all the other specs and so the
situation is that actually at the in
July a six-cd I was basically strolling
in the in the platform at the last
minute and many many there were there
are many rough edges and not everything
works across all the technologies so e 7
is much more well around it and it
support CD is supported in many more
context so 11 kind of fallout from that
is basically that jsf managed bean may
become deprecated or not needed because
you can fully replace it with CDI and
you probably don't need managed beans
anymore in e 7 ejb 2024 complete nuts
it's a alignment with JMS 20 which is a
major revision is obviously the you know
the obvious item that i would expect
here other than that it's mostly small
adjustments to the behavior one
important aspect of the tooling that i
would like to mention is that in tools
it's every its it's important that all
specs are considered together not in
isolation so you may have some wizards
which generate some pieces of code and
jen i'm not a fan of a big visitors that
generate lots of code but sometimes they
can still be useful and it's a it it's
good if these wizards are basically ever
of multiple technologies at the same
time so just as an example here in the
manufacturer entity that was generated
you see lots of kind of java expert
systems in poor that as you would expect
but also there is some bean validation
imports let's see how they are used so
basically this is the this reflects the
database column size and if you so
basically that means this ever of the
fact that you should not exceed the
column size of your of your entities of
your over your tables and so it puts the
bean validation constraints on the
columns similarly you may want to pass
your entities through
the wire as a / jugs be as XML or or
Jason so here is the XML root element
which basically makes this beam
serializable through jax be as XML or
JSON so and in in java ee 7 they're
going to be many more examples of this
where the ide will need to be ever off
all the technologies together and how
they work together okay so before we go
to the next part of the presentation I
would like to smoke do a small detour to
application architecture so this is kind
of the classic application architecture
for a web application not even a java
application just a web application there
there will be various frameworks by the
standardized or not you know it's either
ejb or spraying on the view layer it's
gsm or wicket or whatever and the
importing is that here basically it
communicates the browser by a request
response and that was the traditional
model and basically everything was
happening on the server and we as java
dopest weren't really concerned about
what's going on in the in the browser
that was a designer job and we just did
everything on the server side then when
you look at a few years later basically
now a modern java ecigs application is
now mostly standard-based because the
standard has become very good and you
have all the business logic here and jsf
as the main kind of presentation logic
technology at the top and it still
communicates by every request responds
with the browser in addition to that
there are some Ajax calls probably and
partial page requests and things like
that from the beginning I think one one
thing that the java community got right
was that there there is
there was also always a clean separation
between the presentation logic and
business logic so I think that's
understood for many years that that's a
that's a good practice so now let's
let's look at another application that
you might want to build so i have this
application called drawing board which
was actually written by my colleague
martin Mutulu from the jersey team and
it's basically a group drawing
application so it's actually already
running here so let's look at what it
looks like in the browser ok so and it's
a group throwing so you would expect
more than one person to to use it at the
same time so let me fire up a new new
window and load it as well and we can
just create a drawing here ok so it's a
picture one created see what happened so
the other window the other user received
it the update immediately and was
notified of the fact that this drawing
was was created let's now go to the
drawing and actually draw something no
so it might draw a circle same thing
it's a group drawing application so
everything happens at the same time
simultaneously like would expect so
what's what's actually behind this this
application let's look at the source
code and ok so
drawing websocket that looks interesting
so there is a other imports of the new
web socket API which is new in Hawaii 7
and business is basically a
bi-directional communication protocol
that allows the user it allows clients
to communicate with the server in a
bidirectional way not just through with
a request response and basically the
drawing application is is made possible
through this so this this particular
thing is used for drawing the dots and
the shapes and then there is a where is
it
okay and then there is something called
SSC dot dot star note several classes
from SSC so sse star stands for server
sent events and that's also an extension
of the HTTP protocol which allows to
assign curiously send responses from
from the server to the IDE sorry to to
the to the client and that's basically a
server push technology that's been
sanitized quite recently and but now
it's supported by most major browsers
and so unfortunately this is not
supported by java ee 7 as a per se but
there is the jersey as the
implementation of jax-rs supports its
route through its own api so these are
jersey api so they are not standard but
you can use them they work and you can
use it for service and events okay so
let's go back to the actually close
these windows let's go back to the
diagram and so this is basically the
architecture of this kind of
applications so you see that there is
bi-directional traffic of kover classic
HTTP of course and additionally across
through web sockets service and events
here in the darker color there are
technologies which make it possible or
help help with this on the on the java
each side so jax-rs as i mentioned of
course that's a that's a web services so
you would expect XML or JSON to be
transferred over over this so jax-rs is
a natural candidate WebSocket is a new
API is that that I mentioned so Java has
a java ee 7 has new EP a-- for web
socket
sir what specification was revised and
improved so it has also some additional
capabilities in the in this area in
particle it allows so-called upgrade
requests so if you have an ordinary HTTP
session you can upgrade it to WebSocket
through some negotiation protocol Jason
API is a an API for standard mac keep
mapping of or start processing of Jason
in your Java applications the rest is
the same basically on the on the server
so these technologies are very much
relevant and induced on the right hand
side basically html5 and that's
basically a term for that basically and
I brought them for a set of technologies
not just html5 itself well so css3
modern JavaScript implementations new
JavaScript API is in the browser offline
applications and so on and then of
course you would expect your application
to work across multiple devices not just
the desktop browser but also tablets and
phones okay so here's just a summary of
fatty the HTTP protocol enhancements
that I was talking about so you can just
read through them I think that's yeah so
one one thing I'm did mention is
cross-origin resource sharing so this is
kind of a new concept so originally HTTP
protocol and browsers implemented a
policy that when you have a page that
the way that was loaded some from some
browser and this page makes an AJAX call
this a jaczko can only go back to the
server and it cannot really go anywhere
else that's for good reasons like
security and it's called the same origin
policy it became apparent over years
that it would be beneficial to somehow
relax this policy and in some cases
allow to actually call other resources
then the then the ones that are coming
from from the same server so basically
there is a new standard for in the HTTP
area for cross-origin resource sharing
which which allows these based on some
negotiations between client and server
so i would like to show you another
application here so so here's an
application that provides a list of
products as a service and now i'm going
to run the client for this so this is
oops maybe the demo gods are not with us
okay so there is some there's a problem
here do you know what's the problem the
problem is that basically I didn't
enable cross-origin resource sharing so
this this application the server is
running on my glass fish whereas this is
running somewhere else this is another
port and thus it can be allowed so what
I'm going to do here is fortunate there
is a bizarre in netbeans for this so
create a cross origin resource sharing
filter
okay so let's see if the idea auto
deployed the application correctly yep
there it is so this is my my list of a
list of companies or a list of
manufacturers that basically is exposed
by my jersey dirty AP ice and actually
right now you are seeing netbeans
project easel in action so this is the
new here is the new support for java
html5 applications so this this client
project is basically playing old static
html5 site so there are no dynamic pages
just HTML CSS JavaScript and that means
as a special specialized project type
for this this kind of applications and
you may also have noticed this this pub
this bar saying that means is debugging
this tab so that's because Nadine say is
connected to the webkit browser in
inside Chrome through a debugging
section which is able to manipulate you
know manipulate the the page actually
this is okay so i can now say start
select mode and let me actually make
this more and when i select something it
it's selected in the IDE it's made the
smaller
okay here i see the styles that are
applied to to this component and so on
so but that's just an aside that's this
is project easel in action but you may
have noticed that actually this is this
is this application is created using the
jquery mobile framework so it's
basically let me turn off for this
select mode when I stopped select mode
then it's back to to just normal
operation and so this is a framework
that you would do you would use normal
on your phone so but I would like to
maybe have some enhancements and i would
like to enhance this application somehow
would it be nice if you know when i was
running this application of my phone and
then it could it i would like it to
match this merge these companies with
the contact list on my phone and tell me
you know is this is this company already
in your contact list on your phone and
if not you may want to add it to our
contacts would be possible to do well
not really with with plain plain web
applications but fortunately there is a
little framework so yeah by the way I
this is one thing i didn't mention so
these are they are frameworks that allow
to that move the presentation logic in
the client so when you go back to the
slide to slide that talks about the
html5 applications you may have noticed
that the presentation logic is no longer
or server it's it's on the on the client
and that's made possible by by these
frameworks that are written in
javascript and which provide
which provided the control framework on
on the client in in the browser there
are just some of these this area is very
fluid and there are new ones popping up
every month you know so this this slide
will probably not be were won by the end
of year and by the way the drawing
application that i showed earlier the
group drawing that's using the angularjs
framework so it's actually based on one
of these frameworks okay let's go back
to the contact list question so there is
a framework called phonegap who has
heard of phonegap okay so basically this
is a free tool kit sponsored by Adobe
also a an Apache project which provides
a integration with with the device you
know so what it does is basically takes
you about web application packages it as
a native application and sends it over
to your phone and tear basically the
model is is that you are supposed to
upload these applications to the mobile
store and app store and it will be
downloaded and installed by the user
from the app store and then it has
access to all these nice features of the
of the device such as XO a meteor camera
and yeah there is contact so if I'd like
to talk to contacts on my phone I could
do it through this framework and it
works on many different platforms about
eight they don't even fit on the slide
so there's lots of capabilities and all
these are exposed as a JavaScript
library so you have JavaScript API for
your html5 applications which basically
facilitate the communication with the
native device
so let's see how it how it actually
works so here is my my application and
see that say here is a right now I was
always running this for this home so let
me change this to iPhone simulator and
hit run it's building building what's
that
hello ok here is my contact list on the
phone sorry my company list or on the
iPhone simulator so this is basically
another feature of a NetBeans 73 project
easel that's that's going to be an
add-on plug-in that provides the
integration with mobile devices both
simulators and then we'd actually real
devices so I tested deployment to my my
phone and it works fine so I didn't
actually implement the functionality to
add these these companies to my contact
list but you can imagine that could work
that way so here's just an overview of
new capabilities in in the other Java
specs jax-rs again probably you may want
to open the specialized presentation on
jax-rs to find out more about this oh
there is one thing that I would like to
show you so standard API for filters and
interceptors so when I implemented this
cross restructuring filter it's a it's
actually a filter that basically goes
through your request and response and
does some operations on the request and
response and this is actually a t6
version so you may will be wondering how
is this related to e7 and actually here
is a an e7 version of the same thing
okay there it is and you know it looks
almost the same can you tell what's the
difference okay so the difference is
that in ecigs there is a I have constant
jersey SPI something in in the east and
perversion this is actually a part of
the spec so as as part of the spec java
x ra w srs as a part of the jax-rs to
all i can create a filter like this
without needing to use jersey specific
api's and you know internal API offer
each jersey implementation so that's
what this this item is told about the
standard API for filters and
interceptors there are more things I'm
not going to talk about I already talked
about the servers and events again more
API is WebSocket server 31 JSON API or
relevant to this class of applications
until here's a quick summary so I think
judge every platform is doing very well
and many more things are coming in e7
which will make it even better for the
current class of applications besides
there are some important improvements
which allow us to and encourage us to
bright new class of applications
basically thin server apps or html5 apps
or whatever we call them and through API
is like web socket and these are all
supported in netbeans 73 beta which was
reached today so you can go get it now
one thing I didn't talk about is that a
future version of NetBeans i call it
seven not seven but that may change so
in this version we would like to add
support for e7 using and used by html5
front end
so basically very good communication
between html5 on the front end and e7 on
the back end okay so here are some
resources aquarium is the glass Fishbach
here's a page which contains progress on
e seven spikes really interesting
glassfish netbeans as I said screencasts
and more information on project easel
and 73 beta and if you like to meet see
more we are at the exhibition and we can
we'll be happy to to see what's there in
that bin 73 ok I'm not sure if we have
room for questions maybe 12 to two
questions did
can we repeat this
roadmap for XHTML you mean in jsf I
think that's just a part of the general
e7 spec so it's the same road map as the
rest of a 7 and from what I heard the
announcement was that the plan is to
have the reference implementation in
spring next year so around April and
that will be the reference
interpretation not the not the kind of
production version of the of the server
but reference implementation in the
spring final okay and maybe one more
question there is one yes
sorry
yes yes so the question was whether the
cross resource sharing policy requires
changes in the brow on the side of the
browser the answer is yes and so
basically all browsers need to support
it and most modern browsers do so I
think if you can if you look at can I
use that use a site call can I use which
tells you which browsers support what
when I looked I think I ie9 still
doesn't support it but all other
browsers do and I tenable supported so
you probably will need to do some
graceful degradation to support other
browsers but the latest version of of
all browsers will support it
yes it's it's rated to to JavaScript
okay thanks thanks a lot everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
