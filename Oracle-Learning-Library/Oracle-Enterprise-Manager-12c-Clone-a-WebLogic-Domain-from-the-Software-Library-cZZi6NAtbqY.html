cloud control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I will show you how to
clone a middleware environment once you
are logged into Enterprise Manager cloud
control as a designer and have navigated
to the middleware provisioning screen
under a middleware provisioning
deployment procedures click provision
middleware and then click launch there
are two ways to clone from a
provisioning profile in the software
library or from a middleware home
directory I have previously saved a
WebLogic domain provisioning profile in
the library based on my gold image
domain so that is what I want to select
which provisioning profile click the
magnifying glass in the pop-up window
select the provisioning profile you wish
to use and click select
now that the source is set click the
next button click the plus to add hosts
in the pop-up select the target host
desired and click the select button
credentials for the hosts must be set we
have created preferred credentials for
the hosts and we'll use those next the
destination location on the target must
be set we are creating a new middleware
home
once everything is set click Next on the
configuration page on the left hand side
you can see a hierarchy of domain
configuration categories the domain
properties category is selected by
default here you enter the domain name
domain administrator username
the password twice
an optional description
a unique domain identifier
and the domain location some of these
fields have default values which you may
override you may select other categories
of the domain configuration to make
changes there in this demo I have
decided to change the port of the
administration server so I click it in
the hierarchy
and make the change
I also want to change the port of the
managed server so I click servers
and make the changes I want on that
configuration page
finally I've decided to change the
server startup mode
I do not want the server's to start
until I start them manually once all the
changes to the configuration have been
input click Next
now scheduled the job give it the name
desired in the deployment instance field
pick when the job should run I want it
scheduled immediately under notification
choose the type of notification you wish
I choose to be notified if the job has
succeeded or has problems you may also
under analyze mode decide to pause
before running the job once the
prerequisite checks have been made I do
not want to do that
once everything is set the way you want
it click Next
review the middleware provisioning job
you can see the source the destination
and the domain configuration information
if it all looks correct click Submit on
the procedure activity tab of the
deployment procedure manager screen you
can select how often to automatically
update the screen from the view data
drop-down list or you may manually
refresh by clicking the refresh button
you may also click the name of the
deployment procedure to see the details
of it
well that's how to clone a middleware
environment through Enterprise Manager
cloud control
