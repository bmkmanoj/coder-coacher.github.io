product manager for you know Java card
and looking also at all the embedded
security topics at Oracle so I will
focus as presentation on security with
video specific focus on the edge devices
and even further that into what secure
elements in edge devices can bring in
terms of security so what we'll start
with a little introduction about the
specific requirements for embedded
security and for doing that I'll try to
illustrate it by an examples from the
utilities area with a smart meter use
case that to which a lot of people can
actually relate fairly easily and then
we'll look at how we can build trust in
several ways by using secure elements
and then we'll look at how you know Java
card and Java can be worked together on
embedded devices and including a few
final statement on the edge to
enterprise security so let's start by
setting the scene here so we're in
something very classical in terms of
deployment of devices so we look at
systems in which we have an enterprise
application which is made of back-end
some storage maybe it's in the cloud
maybe not that's not really the main
topic here since we will be looking at
the other side of the end-to-end thing
and then we have connected many devices
so these devices can be of any kind it
can be very small like sensors they can
be very large and very devices like you
know multi-million dollar machine used
in a hospital the important thing here
is that these devices they have an
existence by themselves they are not
just made like computer or tablet just
to interact from a user with a
I can't they are meant to work by
themselves in most cases I think a white
majority of these devices will be rather
small and in some cases also there will
be so small that it won't have the
ability to connect directly to the back
end or to the cloud which means that
they will be a gateway in the middle
awesome and typically that's a slightly
larger system that specializes in
establishing the communication channels
and maybe do a bit of pre-processing in
the meantime so what we can ask is what
is new when you do these kind of
deployments when we you move in your
deployment in which you have actually
connected devices here so what changes
from a traditional system with the back
end and users are the devices of course
there are many of these devices and many
in some cases like to hear utilities may
mean millions and in terms of management
this can lead to interesting challenges
then in many cases for many use cases
the devices that we're talking about
here are at the heart of your business
they are really something that defines
the business you're doing so the meters
for an electric company is important
because they are really the interface
with a with a customer so what that
means is that for the customer in many
cases the devices they are you they
added the company watcher elms device
they are the representatives of this
company and it's important that these
devices work correctly there however of
course if you compare these devices to
the other elements that make your
information system you will have very
little control so these devices it's not
easy to reach to them at all times you
may be able to reach to them sometimes
in some cases it may be even you know
difficult at all times especially if
they are the customers premises behind
firewalls cetera so they may come back
to you sometimes but you may have some
trouble to actually manage these things
and since we're talking about security
here we can also look at what kind of
new risks are introduced the main risk
here is that you have a new entry point
or millions of new entry points to your
system so that means that there's a new
way to reach our to you system and maybe
attack it in some way so there are at
least two big categories of attacks it
can be made you there can be some
attacks on the device either by
tampering with the device or even by
building a fake one also to attack the
link between the device and the backend
in which you can steal the customers
information or inject false information
and of course we have to mix that with
the fact that these devices still are
very much representing you and they are
hard to control so that's why the
security needs to be considered
seriously at the beginning before the
devices i deployed so let's look a
little bit about the typical security
thing that will have to do here the
security of talking about is really
about the resistance to attacks so we
can have many definitions but here we're
focusing on on that and defining an
attack as an action that is intended to
abuse the system for the benefit of the
attacker rather than the benefit of the
devices owner and when you do think
about security as resistance to attacks
we need to have a different frame of
mind which is the users are important we
don't want to disrupt what the users
doing but it's important also to
understand what an attacker may want
because the motivations of the attacker
are going to be important in
understanding what kind of counter
measures are needed if you're going to
do some kind of a media player your
attacker may be the customer himself
trying to go around drm if you're more
into critical infrastructure you may
have you know to deal with potential
terrorism actions so you don't
have the same you know the same way of
acting against these kind of attackers
you don't do the same thing against a
standard user and again to potential
terrorist threat so this is something we
we need to to do and if we think about
it also about the vulnerabilities this
is something that we need to think not
necessarily as bugs if we look at that
the vulnerabilities that make the news
on systems that have been deployed for
years and that have been used by
millions or hundreds of millions of
users they are very often related to
more or less bugs but if we think about
systems that are new in many cases the
vulnerabilities are not related to an
implementation bug but they are related
to an actual feature which means that
something in the system or in the device
has been designed to work in a certain
way and in that design the reservoir
ability and these kind of things when it
happens can be very hard to fix because
if the specification is wrong of the
device if there is something that
actually you do when you shouldn't do
then fixing it may be harder and in some
cases it may actually make the
application now just impossible you know
make it impossible to have the
application do what it's supposed to do
so if we look about the requirements
here about the security the ones that we
see most often on under devices the
first thing of course is safety and we
have privacy regulation access control
and accountability those are the things
that we see most often as being
mentioned here there are not you know
very fun things except that like always
when we think about security we have to
make sure that all of these things
remain true even under attack and under
attack for a device you may not be very
much aware that there is an attack at
least your back-end may not be aware at
all that there is something happening so
you have to need you need to have some
local no security features here so in
terms of safety you're doing what you're
supposed to do means that
even in the case of attack you need
either to have an application that keeps
working or that fails gracefully in a
way that is planned in the specification
and so again this is this means that you
have to consider what kind of attacks
can occur which will lead to what kind
of failures and then you can figure out
how to deal with this different failures
and when we talk about privacy here
we're not talking about maybe you
deciding to sell your customers data but
more about somebody else who would steal
the data and sell it so if you have
defined a privacy policy that what
security people will care about is
making sure that the policy is applied
now defining the policy and ethics
whatever that's you know business
consideration that's that happens before
that then the regulation so regulation
has a bad reputation because it forces
you to actually abide to some rules that
were defined by somebody and in many
cases these rules may look obscure and
not very useful but if you think about
it in terms of what the regulation is
about in many cases it's it is a
consequence of people thinking about
what may happen so if you look on sense
what the piece various PCI
recommendations that for which there are
some some regulations and that that
needs to that I really needed for every
system that works with payment data we
have defined these things over years and
years of experience so for a newcomer in
the industry it is actually an
opportunity to get access to a lot of
knowledge that is difficult to get
access to then no access control this is
something where you know there's not
much we said just we just want to
restrict access to authorized person and
accountability this is more of a meta
property but we want to make sure that
the other property the safety privacy
regulation we have some traceability
about how we actually apply that so that
we can prove
to the outside world that we're actually
doing the right things to protect the
systems for this thing so in order to
meet the requirements of course we have
a few security functions so very rapidly
about that you can read full books about
every one of these things so you have
the data protection where you can
protect confidentiality and integrity
they're going to have authentic asian
authorization where you know you can
start with passwords but if you're on a
on a machine it's going to be maybe
different it's going to be more
cryptography and based because the
machine doesn't know passwords what at
least it's better that device is not
authenticating with passwords
authorization is about access rights so
this is something that is very important
making sure that it's always the right
the right person accessing to to the
device in your the logging and auditing
this is extremely important all the
security log in case of an attack if you
have good logging capabilities that
means that once you know that something
has happened it's fairly easy to
understand where the problem comes from
and at least find some immediate
countermeasures if there is no log they
may take a long time to just figure out
how the attack happened and when there
are logs was going to be careful that
the access to these logs will contain in
many cases a lot of sensitive
information is restrictive also to
auditors then we have provisioning so
provisioning is not necessarily directly
related to security but in devices it's
important to understand that having the
ability to have a system upgrade or an
application upgrade is one way to deal
with some kind of a vulnerability in the
in the device and the main problem that
we may face here that depending on where
the vulnerability is it's really
difficult to make sure that the
provisioning system on the device will
keep operating normally so that it will
still be a still be possible to perform
the required updates so this is
something that is important to to think
about it and then we have the software
protection making sure that the code is
not modified the code integrity with
signatures with code verification like
you know it's done in Java or the bicoid
verification and some runtime integrity
and that's possible so let's look at
that smart metering now so we have get
some kind of a real life example the
reason for most people to move to smart
meters there are two main reason the
first one is have better data collection
so we want to have less manpower and
maybe more accurate information because
there will not be any anybody having to
type a type in numbers all day there's
also the idea of enabling the smart grid
the big data so you get an enormous
amount of data about the customers
consumption of whatever your metering so
you can get better control of the grid
and also get some feedback to users so
if you want to modify their habits for
consumption this is something why it's
important to get this data so you can
provide some feedback to these users but
there are some consequences in there if
what they are less manpower then it
means in some cases fraud detection will
be difficult I mean if somebody just
puts a cable that goes around the the
electric meter it's not that easy to do
but if there is somebody that comes to
look at the meter once every few months
they will see this thing if nobody ever
comes to look at the meter some you know
cheaters may may go away for a long time
before anything is detected another
thing is that of course before because
there are there's a lot of data flowing
in and out of the other meters there was
a possibility here of injecting wrong
data or looking at new private consumer
data so if you look at one
consumer data you get easily some
information possibly about this person
has not been around for 42 days now if
you get the same information for an
entire neighborhood you can map the
neighborhood about half a map of who is
who's in town who is not in town and
sell that to you know people could be
interested in visiting empty houses so
we have to be careful that these leaks
don't happen so if you look to more
details about the smart metering if you
have a meter where it's going to be
owned by a utility company or 12
depending on the countries there are
different configurations but it's
usually owned by the company was going
to build you for the electricity the
obvious thing is that this company
usually is in charge of the maintenance
and one of their big characteristic is
going to be that the lifetime needs to
be greater than 10 years they don't want
to change your meters every time so it's
very hard with smart meters because this
is new technology they and they have to
get it right the first time and not have
to change it too often the same thing
they don't want to have human
intervention if you have 10 million
meters and you need to visit every one
of them the cost is staggering so you
have to be very careful that these kind
of things don't happen so what the
looking at here is having a meter that
is tamper-resistant with we have always
had some requirements like this four
meters but we really need to make sure
that you know the meter can't be too
much tampered with the good part for
people who sell the meters is that
usually the price sensitivity for this
is quite limited which means that it's
unlikely that utilities will go straight
for the cheapest meter around there will
more look at the functionality and make
sure that they get the best combination
of good price and good capability so
there's a possibility here definitely to
differentiate on these kind of things
and the last thing also is that the the
raw data here is privacy sensitive so
that we have to be careful about this
data
so if we think about it on threats i
will look at them maybe with more detail
to on the device we can tamper with the
data collection we can tamper with the
collected data and between the device in
the back end we can insert fake devices
modify transfer data or steal the
transfer data so let's talk maybe with
more detail so in terms of data
collection with a standard meter what we
want to achieve usually is tamper
evidence which means that if somebody
tampers with your video meter yeah what
we need to ensure is that when somebody
comes an employee comes to look at the
meter it will notice immediately that
something is wrong so that's the
evidence if something it gets tampered
with the meter would just if you open it
it will never close correctly and this
is visible if nobody visits the the
meter you have to move from tamper
evidence to tamper resistance which is a
bit stronger property what you need to
make sure that the meter actually
resists to tampering and until something
up to a reasonable amount of tampering
and then when it's unreasonable it just
breaks down so this is a bit more
difficult to achieve this we
particularly because you want to make
sure that you know a lot of things are
remain impossible here then about data
storage this is a completely new issue
in a standard meter there is no storage
of data there is one value that keeps
being updated but that's about it in a
smart meter usually you can have to
store some data at least temporarily
between two data collections so you can
make sure that this data is not modified
and that this data is not leaked so
integrity and confidentiality issues
another problem is we can have fake
devices I'm not completely sure why
somebody will have a fake meter that
could be just to inject fake data in the
big data model and make somebody believe
that there is more consumption in the
area or something like that but I'm sure
that there is a use case for that
somewhere
so we need to make sure that there is a
correct authentication of the devices
that we're talking to and the same thing
on the other way the device needs to
make sure that it's talking to the right
server so the device not completely
control the entire communication link
which means that the authentication here
must be mutual between the meter and the
backend and the last one is the man in
the middle which is that somebody can
come and look at what is happening or
modify the communication which means
that here we need a secure channel once
again that protects both in integrity
and confidentiality so in order to do
that we're going to have to design the
security in the meters so this is
something that put media companies know
how to do that a meter has always been
sensitive now there's a little bit more
sensitivity so was that we need to
temper prove the device that means going
maybe one step higher in terms of why
the device can resist to so for instance
if we think about the point-of-sale
terminals in in many cases the
point-of-sale terminals a particular
those that handle the EMV transactions
with chip cards they contain secrets in
order to protect these secrets the world
terminal is you know is lined with a
mesh and if anything touches this thing
if you mean if you try to drill or open
it in some way all the keys will be it
would be gone instantly so once again
this is about tempo proofing which means
that you make the device like
non-working if anything goes really
wrong what you need to have a protocol
that's secure enough these protocols
exist I mean you know TLS provides
everything we need from the
authentication to the the secure Channel
but you use a good software stack so
we're now java conference so we can
assume that Java ME for instance is
definitely good choice for a meter and
the last thing is about adding a secure
element so the idea when adding a secure
element here is is that you can get
really tamper with
hardware that was always designed for
that and that also because this piece of
hardware that you get insecure element
is very small the software on it is very
small so it's possible it's possible to
get to level of certifications that are
very difficult to reach with things like
even like a smart meter and of course
even more for something that is larger
than that so let's not you see why now
how we can use secure elements to
actually build trust on on devices so I
will focus on three ways in which secure
elements can be used to actually secure
device the first one is about basically
securely storing some credentials or
important secrets then here taking an
example the satellite TV cards the
second one is using secure elements as a
back-end proxy which is representing a
service provider in the device and
example take care of the sim card and
finally we can use a secure element as a
device root of trust so you can build
the trust that you need in your device
that starting from the secure element
and the example of this is the TPM which
is the base of the trusted computing
think so the first example is about
satellite TV so satellite TV is
interesting for hackers because it is
broadcast so the same signal goes to
everybody so you can catch a signal and
if you can catch it somebody else can
can catch it and if there is just a
simple device to just decode the signal
some say you know hacker or bad guy
somewhere can decide that they will sell
a device and then that will be much
cheaper than the original thing sold by
the satellite provider so of course now
the people who provide the content I've
understood that and the content now is
encrypted so you need to have the right
key on your device but the problem here
is that it doesn't change the basic
property the
this broadcast which means that is still
the same exact same content getting to
everybody which means it's the same key
getting to everybody so if the bad guys
are able to get a single copy of a key
they can duplicate it and their business
model is on again so that's why this ski
needs some good level of protection so
that's that's why we can put that in a
secure secure element that that's
actually the the really the original
rationale behind building secure
elements is to protect some sensitive
assets it started in the 80s with real
assets in phone cards phone cards you
had units of communications that will be
burnt one after the other and the idea
was that they were protected in a card
and difficult to to reach there so of
course that had some limits and very
rapidly we've seen the replacement of
these real assets with things that are
more based on cryptography so usually
the assets that are most often protected
in secure elements today are
cryptographic keys and here you know
once again is this temper resistance is
important and when we're talking about
smart cards or secure elements that the
level of temporary resistance we get is
that you have a very small chip that's
embedded in some special grew with a lot
of detectors light detectors and
temperature detectors etc and so if
anything goes wrong this thing will kind
of self destruct itself so the idea is
that attacking a card requires a lot of
effort and it requires also a lot of
equipment so once again the ID is is
always the same when we introduce a new
security measure is to make the price
for the bad guys higher so that their
business model doesn't work anymore so
when you have a secure element here that
the guarantee you get is that your keys
are better protected they are in the the
security
device which means that that the bad
guys and maybe not have access to the
keys anymore and that destroys their
business model so if we think about how
how this works today most a lot of
set-top boxes actually used smart cards
I've been using them for four years and
there's been a lot of a rate i would say
a nice race between the and the content
providers and the hackers so the
original cards of course eventually were
broken so the word replaced was more
complicated things and basically there's
always chasing each other so these days
think there's a an edge in favor of the
the content provider industry because
that they have now more power to
diversify the keys which makes it very
much more difficult for hackers to have
business models that will actually work
and something important when you think
about also the these secure limits is
that then not just storing secrets it's
not just protecting them by storing them
it's also the fact that if you have a
very important key it never gets out to
the car some computations are done in
the current you can have a you know with
the obviously java virtual machine on
these cards so the core secrets never
get out so it means you will have
diversified keys going out but the core
secrets never get out and are very hard
to remove from there so the second use
case is mobile telephony
so here now we have a network operator
and it provides network infrastructure
its customers so the customers are
allowed to connect to the network with
their own device though the the network
doesn't own the device and of course you
know without security attackers get
there and for instance they insert a
fake device which is configured to work
as a copy of a real one and what that
does is that you get somebody that makes
phone calls on behalf or being paid by
somebody else so there are other kinds
of attacks but this one has been one
that has been key to in the design of
the of the same guys so here the idea is
to add a secure element on the device
that will be removable but it's mostly
used to communicate to the back end and
the the SIM card is owned by actually
the network provider and it's it's not
really made to make the device more
secure but it's really acting as a
representative of the operator on the
device which means that if a device is
equipped with the same card that is
related to a given operator you can
connect to that operators network and
the operator doesn't have to figure out
if they trust or not the device and that
is very important in areas where the
service provider doesn't have any
control over what kind of devices are
being used and for instance this is
important also if you want to have
something like a bring-your-own-device
thing which is exactly an extension of
this model what you need to have a
smaller subsystem on the device that you
can trust and that will allow for sort
of cooperation to use is employees
devices for doing some operations that
require some trust this is exactly the
same kind of model we're talking about
here
so the last thing is about using the
secure element as a device root of trust
the idea here is to protect the device
integrity so I have not put a name of
that device it can be just about
anything there are at least two ways in
which device can be compromised one is
directly by the end user which will
change the software and another one will
be through an external network attack if
somebody actually tries to tamper with
the device from the outside if you're
thinking about a business model and
which you have many devices that are
connected to a back-end this is actually
very dangerous because the consequences
are very hard to to understand because
the modification they may be big but
they also may be on details so if you
have a meter and the meter only meters
nine times out of ten just get a ten
percent discount that may be very hard
to detect so also because there's
limited access to the device fixing it
directly on the device can be difficult
and in some cases if there is there has
been some compliments confirmation of
the device the remote access can be
disabled so of course if there is a good
level of tamper resistance disabling and
a remote access will most likely lead to
detection of the problem but this is
also hard to to organize so here the
solution that has been that is being
used today and trusted computing is to
use what I call it a TPM word trusted
platform module as the root of trust so
the idea here is that we start from a
secure element which has all the proper
security certifications and it has two
additional properties or different
properties from the other ones who've
been talking about the first one is that
instead of being tamper resistance it's
now tamper evident again because we have
here a maybe one dollar little piece of
equipment that controls while its
controls the integrity of a much larger
device
and if there is a problem was this
little TPM we don't want the big device
to be completely deactivated we just
want anybody will uses the device to be
aware that the TPM has detected that
something went wrong so that's what we
want to know the other one is hardware
integration it's very important when you
use something that is going to verify
the integrity of a device that it starts
first the idea is that when you boot for
sense of pc was it which is equipped
with a TPM when you turn it on the first
thing that happens is that the TPM gets
powered which allows it from sense to
start verifying the colonel and that and
that is the theta the main use case for
a TPM is actually the secure boot where
the trusted module is going to verify
the colonel and then the colonel starts
possibly verifies the OS which starts at
cetera et cetera so you have layers of
of trust so you have the most trusted
thing in the middle and then as you go
out you have more and more complexity
and maybe more and more problems also
but another important thing about TPM is
the fact that there's a possibility to
have remote at the station which means
it's not only local there's also
potentially a link with an external
server the idea being that once you have
booted your machine with the proper boot
sequence that the TPM can you know
provide an attestation to the outside
yes this system has booted correctly
it's been in this configuration with
that in that and I can guarantee it it's
been done right and of course this is
signed with a key that can be recognized
so that the outside back-end can ensure
before to perform any kind of
transaction that the state of the
machine is correct
so to recap on these these three ways to
use the secure elements you think about
the secure store the value here is
mostly for the service providers it is
very well suited for models that are
unconnected in which this the device is
either never connected to the outside
web in which case may not be fit very
well in our original model or in which
the device is connected irregularly it's
sometimes it's connected but most of the
time it is not and the focus here is on
the local security and really trying to
figure out how we can make it more
difficult to steal some sequence
directly or modify the integrity of the
of the device there in terms of using
the secure element as a back-end proxy
once again the value is most divorced
service provider and this is
particularly well suited to models in
which we are connected in most of the
cases because there's going to be some
end-to-end communication and sent when
communication is basically independent
of the device itself and finally the
third thing is the device root of trust
in which the secure element brings this
time the value mostly to the device
providers because it can improve the the
security of the of the device in any
kind of application models because it
works on guaranteeing the integrity of
the device and and if we get back to the
so the smart meter we can try to figure
out what kind of secure element model it
is needed there well it's mostly a
back-end proxy because the main use of
the the smart meter is going to be here
about authentication and secure Channel
that's the main thing that it is used
for making sure that every time you
connect to the back end proxy it's done
correctly
and there is also some local data
management and this local data
management is done really on behalf of
the service provider but if we think
about this this is mostly unconnected
this is between two connections we're
going to accumulate data and protect it
which makes it closer to a secure store
in particular in models where there is a
local interface to which the customer
can get information from the Demeter
directly at at any time and finally
although I'm not sure it's used like
that in many secure elements in many
meters today it could be interesting to
have a root of trust once again to
protect the integrity of the meter
itself against attacks so if we move
beyond the the meters hear how the
examples we had so embedded systems use
a lot of security subsystems like that
and are a few examples but they can
bring here the first one is anything
that uses some kinds of smart cards so
we've seen some of them sort of the
mobile phones a lot of them use sim
cards billions of them every year the
point-of-sale terminals store their
secrets also on a removable smart cards
that is owned by the payment processor
and once again on the media players we
get some smart cards for DRM in
particular for broadcast content and
then we have what we call the BB the
embedded secure elements in which
instead of having a removable card there
is one secure micro controller that is
actually soldered onto the device so
here we have the wireless modules so you
can see the what Centurion has been
building there in which in most cases
there is a sim card for performing the
authentications there are also such the
key elements in NFC phones that do the
mobile payments because the mobile
payment is secured by a secure element
and once again in smart meters
it is mandatory in some countries like
Germany to actually have a secure
element in the meter to protect the data
and there are also some models in which
Princeton prepaid meters well there is
some stored value where most of the
reference design actually include a
secure element in which the stored value
will be stored and protected throughout
its use another kind of security
subsystem that we're starting to see
Laura called a trusted execution
environment and this one is something
that runs mostly on the other main
processor and that basically introduces
some kind of safe execution mode or
trusted execution mode in which we can
be guaranteed for instance at that
startup we first start in that mode and
that it gets some control over some
pieces of the of the mobile device so
we've starting to see that is
particularly on high-end mobile devices
smartphones tablets and main use cases
today our device integrity so there's
been a few devices for instance from
Motorola in which it was almost
impossible to change anything in the
software and then some hackers would be
complaining about it and that's because
they really activated this feature
without any any way to go around it and
that we know so some uses around drm so
for instance if you want to use netflix
on an android device and have HD content
you're going to need to have a device in
which the t is actually working and
where netflix has downloaded their drm
and finally the TPM so that's trusted
platform module which is used mostly in
pc like configurations so this we see
for instance in ATMs and in many cases
so a lot of ATMs verify the integrity
before they start running because this
is know something were they that is easy
to do and that allows them to get good
level of protection and same thing we
have some media players which are pretty
large machine on which the for DRM you
case there is also some control of the
of the system integrity so we get it
where Java is in here so Java is in lots
of smart cards and secure elements and
actually in all the all the examples
I've given here that there are some
significant market shares for for Java
kind so on sim cards on EMV pavement
both on POS ends on cards there are a
lot of them here the system have been
around for a while it's very stable now
we're seeing more and more secure
elements and this is something that is
actually just appearing now we have
secure microcontrollers with standard
iOS that can be easily integrated into
any kind of design of embedded devices
so this is something that is starting to
be to be deployed more widely and we
expect it to grow significantly over the
next year so in terms of the T&amp;amp;T p.m. so
right now they're more closed systems
but we are seeing them opening rapidly
for the TE and it's more octavia
starting to happen for the TPM then
we'll kind of monitoring that closely
from Java card so just to give you there
is more information about Java card it's
very samosa upset of Java it's
complemented with very specific ap is
for crypto protecting passwords or
whatever credentials you may want to
store the interesting part about it it
has been designed from scratch as a
multi-tenant architecture with
applications that are strongly
firewalled because the idea is that in a
single smart card you can get
applications from people who don't trust
each other if you think about mobile
payment you're going to have
applications from a for the network
operator and a bank in the same kind and
these people they they don't trust each
other that they don't like each other
but it took them now five or ten between
five and ten years to find a business
model
but a technical solution has been ready
for much longer than that we're so get a
good dynamic application management and
there's a wall ecosystem about managing
applications for for java cards right
particular about embedded secure
elements now we're seeing that was
something called you know TSM so its
first trusted service managers and as I
said was now available on embeddable
secure microcontrollers and also if you
have are having ass market that there
are some some API is available in Java
to communicate with these elements so
jsr 177 also called SATs are provides
access to secure element from any
embedded device that you can have so you
can have this if you have a secure
element and we also have GSR 257 which
is used if there is a contactless
interface but it's more of a let's say
it's a small use case in that in here so
just try to conclude here on recapping
the important things about the edge to
enterprise security I would like to
really put some emphasis on the fact
that it's very important particularly
when designing new devices to include
security in the entire process from the
very beginning because this is where
some terrible mistakes can be made just
by not thinking about it so the first
thing is to identify the security
requirements what kind of security
features can be required on the edge
devices maybe more importantly what kind
of attacks need to be considered and
this is very hard this is something
where we get surprises every day a lot
of people think about some obvious
attacks and forget about some maybe even
more obvious but not on the same point
of view so this is something that that
needs i would say some empathy with the
bad guys that is to be able to think
like a hacker or bi guy to be able to do
that and another one is about what kind
of assurance level
is required or will be required and this
is also very important because this is
basically how much are you going to need
to prove that your security is correct
well you need to have a security
certification well if you need so if you
need for instance a common criteria
security certification you know that
you're going to need to add you know at
least six months of delay and a few
hundred thousand dollars of budget so
this is something very important to know
at the beginning if you learn it you
know midway through the project it's not
good news and then the other thing is to
really try to identify the security
functions and to think about them as a
security subsystem if you're for that
the security is models everywhere India
in the in any kind of your system but
there are usually some security
functions that are dedicated to that and
it's very important to identify them so
that you can spend more effort in terms
of testing so for instance this may be
the kind of functions what you want to
do you know different kinds of testing
was you know more static analysis more
fuzzing more actions that will most
simulate what a hacker could be able to
do and then where you go for the
implementation there's a choice about
where you're going to put this security
subsystem so of course the the easiest
and traditional ways to put it in the
main code so if you have isolated it it
could be a few classes can be a package
that deals with this security of course
here the assurance level you get is
minimal it's really related to the
amount of it may be testing or specific
testing you can put to this but it's
already much better than just not
identifying and having your security
functions being randomly put anywhere in
your code with without any kind of
specific treatment to them of course
being in the secure element thing i
would consider using a dedicated secure
element what that brings you is really a
way to improve the traceability because
because it is a separate secure element
you know that every use of your main
security functions is going to involve
some kind of exchange between your main
system and the secure element and that's
much more traceable and also you can
reach the highest possible assurance
level some smart cards that have been
certified to the highest level for
common criteria which is fully formally
proven so these kind of things can go as
high as you need and of course what you
get is better protection for your assets
and better tamper resistance it has a
cost I mean these things you know dating
depending on how many you want to buy or
you know it's going to be a few cents or
maybe you maybe a dollar for them for
the most expensive but this is not the
potato not necessarily extremely
expensive in terms of adding such a
secure element here and of course we
know that more options are becoming
available no trusted computing is
already available as really one way to
do a few modest fixed applications it's
now starting to open there's also the
trust execution environments that are
showing up the entire Java card team is
we're clearly following these
initiatives to find out exactly how we
can extend this to all the DS security
subsystems and we believe that you know
we can do that in the in the future but
to conclude I would say that one thing
is important here is really you know not
to forget the very basics of the
security engineering the and the
security engineering is mostly like an
insurance against you know against
breaches a bridge can be extremely
costly we've seen with compliance issue
some kind of payment processors that
there were nice payment processors that
I have a PCI issue they have a breach
then you know Visa Mastercard realized
that they don't comply to PCI remove the
certification then they love to do the
customers and within three months of
bankrupt so of course this is an extreme
case but
it's always very difficult to figure out
how much a bridge can cost depending on
what kind of it what kind of data fences
will be compromised same thing with with
the in the health environment there's
going to be some HIPAA compliance I
doubt it's going to be much easier and
there's going to be some problems there
and going to be many embedded devices
that will need to comply to these things
and the very last thing is that it some
attacks attacks happen and devices will
be targeted as a lot of people were
doing embedded devices today are not
thinking about security I mean I've had
some friends were actually working on
the tax they attacked pacemakers and
they decided I would not publish their
results because was so easy to do it
that I just don't want to give any
information to anybody because I mean
attacking a pacemaker is potentially
killing somebody so you have to be
careful with that and you know these
people today they don't use you know
secure communication authentication so
now you have to be careful and this is
not going to be possible in a few years
from now so we know that the attacks
today then they're moving from you know
windows only what it was before because
of course ninety percent of thing with
windows too we've seen that you know Mac
OS is getting some some attacks the
mobile devices are getting more and more
and if you are putting some devices on
the market you can be widely successful
and if you are wildly successful one
bonus that you will most like to get is
that hackers will get some interest in
your devices and that's when you have to
be ready here thank you
