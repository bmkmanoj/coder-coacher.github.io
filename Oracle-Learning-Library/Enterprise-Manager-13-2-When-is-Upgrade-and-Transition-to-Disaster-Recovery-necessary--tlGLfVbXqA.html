Oracle offers storage replication for
disaster recovery using a single
WebLogic domain under this architecture
the Oracle management server
installation on each server is
replicated between sites the upgrade in
transition 2d our readiness process
enables Enterprise Manager 12c
environments that use standby WebLogic
domain dr architecture to continue to
use disaster recovery in a.m. thirteen
point two after the upgrade lms patching
upgrade will only need to be performed
at one site and plugins will only need
to be managed at one site if you have an
existing Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c
implementation that uses a standby
WebLogic domain dr architecture you will
need to transition to the storage
replication dr architecture before
implementing VR&amp;amp;E m13 see the standby
WebLogic domain dr architecture on e/m
12c installs the software locally on
each oracle management server it has
separate web logic domains at each site
and physical host names the software
library storage is replicated to the
standby site and shared between the
oracle management servers at both sites
only one side is active at a time the
storage replication dr architecture
makes use of a single WebLogic domain
each oracle management server will have
a single software installation
configured with alias host names and
replicated between sites in addition to
the existing software library storage bi
publisher storage is shared between OMS
s at each site and replicated between
sites only one side is active at a time
you need to use the upgrade and
transition process if the e/m 12c
environment implements the standby
WebLogic domain dr architecture if TR is
still needed in e/m 13t and if one or
more of the following conditions exists
the oracle management servers and
central agents are not configured with
alias host names or their installations
or associated oracle inventory are not
on replicated storage or not in a
location that can become replicated
storage without the use of symbolic
links
you don't need to do the upgrade and
transition process if the e/m 12th
environment currently implements the
storage replication dr architecture and
the on masses and central agents are
configured with alias host names
installed on replicated storage and
associated with inventory unreplicated
storage in this case a standard upgrade
is sufficient thank you for watching to
