Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series users can take advantage of
enterprise managers automated compliance
auditing capabilities by going to
enterprise compliance library here the
user will see a list of out-of-the-box
as well as any custom compliance
frameworks standards rules and real-time
monitoring facets Enterprise Manager 12
will ship out of the box with compliance
rules standards and frameworks that
check for compliance against Oracle's
best practices for configuration as well
as any security recommendations for many
different target types including
database instance cluster database
oracle weblogic host and listener among
others as well this enterprise manager
12 compliance framework is hierarchical
in nature in other words a compliance
standard contains one or more compliance
rules and a framework contains one or
more compliance standards there are now
three types of compliance standard rules
there is a composite ory rule a
real-time rule and a web logic signature
rule and a rule is responsible for
validating a specific configuration item
and reporting violations for that
particular valid validation a compliance
standard contains one or more compliance
rules and is the only object which is
associated with a specific target
instance however a compliance standard
is still applicable to only one target
type so a user can take advantage of any
of the out-of-the-box compliance
standards by clicking on associate
targets button and they can choose from
a list of any of the out of the current
targets of that particular target type
and as soon as they associate a
particular target to that target
compliance standard they will be the
score is automatically added to the
compliance results for those particular
targets that were just added and you can
see the compliance count by compliance
standard here on the right hand side a
compliance framework differs slightly
from a compliance standard in that it
can contain standards of different
target types so it can you can have a
single compliance score for your entire
enterprise using a compliance framework
let's take a look at the compliance
results here we will see a list of
results by framework standard or even at
the target level for any targets that
are under any compliant standard
auditing we can see a list of compliance
standards which and what its applicable
do applicable to and on the right-hand
side its average score in the center we
see the number of target evaluations
this means that essentially 32 targets
evaluated in a critical way this is
warning and this is we have 83 targets
in compliance with this particular
compliance standard and on the right
further to the right we see the number
of discreet violations for the targets
that had violations so there were 89
violations in total for this particular
best practice or recommendation here
some of these are out of the box and
some of these are customized compliance
standards so it's very common for one or
more for more than one compliance
standard to be associated to a specific
target and an easy way to gather an
overall score for all of your compliance
standards is to put them into a
framework and you can get an overall
collaborative or across all of the frame
standards
in one evaluation so here I can see I
we've created a custom corporate
application from
Lyons framework that can conduct
contains numerous compliance standards
and gives a single score of 96 in this
case by clicking on show details I can
get some more graphical and detailed
information about the compliance scores
the current score as well as trend
information over time so I can see how
I'm progressing towards my compliance
efforts as I click through the Navigator
on the left-hand side which is
essentially the framework containing one
or more standards of different types in
this case also can contain real time
monitoring rules I can see the results
by either compliance standard or by
target by selecting the different tabs
and if I select a specific compliance
standard on the left I can see the
results not only by target but also by
compliance standard rule and here I can
see the specific rule and whether how
many targets were not compliant and how
many were compliant and the severity
which goes to how the compliance score
is actually calculated so in one shot
now I have an overall score for my
compliance for numerous standards for
database including real-time monitoring
rules as well this is the end of the
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
