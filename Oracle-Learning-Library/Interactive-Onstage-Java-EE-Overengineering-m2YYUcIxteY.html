to welcome to Java one so i have also
lots of fun so i have about I don't know
200 top schedule and no time for eating
actually so I'm what I would like to do
why let's talk intent interactive on
stage a very over-engineering why
because it's an honest title so usually
what I can also show you is hello world
but I cannot explain you with hello
world how configuration plugins and
timers work so i will over engineer on
hello world application to explain you
as much as possible a java 6 and what i
try to do is to gather my most
frequently asked questions and answer
them with working code whether virtual
not depends on demo goats i would say
but in most cases with java is e it
actually should work so um you can ask
questions at any time so i'm happy to
interact with you or afterwards or
whenever you see me at javaone and yeah
so let's start yeah about me it's just
i'm working with javis since 1995 and
the strange thing is i still like java
so I'm I just like the programming
language I'm not feeling that I'm not
productive anymore something so I just
happy with the situation right now and
yeah so Java rocks you can still use
other esoteric things but if you if
you're pragmatic with Java and
especially java 6 you get you can you
can be extremely productive and usually
what happens in my projects the problem
is not the productivity with the
language rather than you know the
business guys domain department domain
experts and all the interaction with the
domain experts this is the real break
not that Java is for both or whatever
and I never had the problems in Indian
tire carrier since 1995 from time to
time I organize workshops oh it would
like to just come to her chops so we'll
heck together something so this book is
rather old one year so I explained
everything what how what you can do with
java 6 i built a small application of
small it works as a statistic for my
blog with Nathan and java 6 actually
real world application and this guy is
new a new book about to
22 weeks old is about best practices
with java 6 okay yeah this was my almost
the last light so I will just show you
java 6 from coach perspective because we
only have one time I would just start
with the coding and this was the last
slide so i'm on twitter and i unblock
this is the very life okay thank you so
now we can kill this guy and concentrate
on the topic so um I was just used in
netbeans daily builds because i use it
the recent days and it worked and i
didn't use netbeans 72 so in most
project as netbeans for the only reason
you can start up immediately if you
download netbeans you get netbeans with
glassfish bundled and you can you all
ready to go it's actually the main
reason if we find some strange things I
don't know so it's special requirements
i will probably use IntelliJ and I'm use
i'm using eclipse if I'm for school so i
will use Eclipse so I have Eclipse
installation I can just use it but yeah
if I had the choice I don't use it so
this is my primary my honest opinion um
so let's start with a project in java 86
project i would create a web project not
mazing i will do maven in the next
session so we have no time so i would
just like to fast develop the
application and goodmorning application
what I plan to do i will submit the
application afterwards to somewhere and
the post a link to it we are Twitter's
we can download it immediately so this
is the idea so glassfish java web
enabled context and dependency injection
what this mean is it would create pin 6
ml so still traffic over-engineered yet
so it creates a project i will start to
try to deploy the time
run it's okay let's deploy so what did
was I created the project and deploy the
application to less so arm now let's
create a GF page file that index
convention and then you would like to
create a backing bean so this is this
guy run little bunny so I look on face
let's seems to work and then i would say
i would like to have a class i call the
class also index and this is thing from
java one dot over-engineering also index
and i can say this guy is named so
visible for for everyone in jsf space
and the 3gs f and g SP s and this guy is
the request scoped this is a little bit
of engine yet already because what you
could do equally well is to say this is
model
model comes with java 6 and what model
is this just an annotation which is
request scoped and thing so let's go to
write so um what I'm reason I just skip
this part and I would say to you a
message and the messages of course 3
turn our this is not therapy personal
good morning so um and now I can say
from my place let's index is the name
conventional configuration message and
where's my browser and just reload the
guy good morning so this was full
Department what we have right now
backing bean jsf and now start with the
oven generic usually what I would like
to have is I would like to have the next
layer is the service layer and actually
an oven generic would be to get rid of
eg bees and say we can just go straight
with CDI and implement the transactions
by our own so and we have no time to
doing that so which is a very tedious
thing so you have to inject user
transaction starts the transaction
committed transaction on each catch
block roll back the transaction so it's
actually boring task so I would never do
that so skip this part because you won't
learn anything new instead of we say
good morning service and the service is
a stateless session bean and the
stateless session bean creates message
and what it does is it starts
transactions transactional good morning
so either you will see that or not this
means transactional so ace it um I would
inject this guy here good morning
service
and I can use ed inject so I can inject
whatever i would like to with at inject
and play JMS message save the guy
where's my browser here reload
transactional good morning so we have
this is a fully fledged application with
this transactional and of course um you
can say these are really bad thing what
you did you hard coded the message you
should never do that so the first of
engineering i would like to extract this
guy how to configure java 6 application
the most common question and the answer
is extremely easy so what I would like
to do is 40 following i would like to
introduce a field what's the name
message and i would like to remove this
guy and say i would like to inject this
from outside now if i will save that i
will get the exception though but you
can imagine exceptions are possible into
our basics and they look like this and
what I saying is unsatisfied
dependencies for type string it means
what I can do I mean where it comes from
so what you can do i can say i built a
configurator be greater and this guy
create strings and the easiest possible
thing is mate the name doesn't matter is
to say this guy creates a configurable
good morning and it produces what do you
what we did we externalized the string
and now the truth drug reload the guy
configurable GM
so um also you'll probably are happy
right now what is the problem with that
some are not that as a problem is you
can only use it once so it's perfect for
for onstage checking but not for real
project so now all strings are the same
so if I all strings about inject the
string someone else it would always see
good morning what is probably somehow
critical for real world so so what I'm
what you can do you can change that very
easily and create a method i would say
configure string and this method gets
injection point and when the injection
point is is actually think of this as
the meter data were this guy going to be
injected and what i would like to have
us a unique a unique identifier of the
injection point if I if I will have that
I'm possible then to configure whatever
I want so how to do that this is no more
required I would say get I think yeah
get the current class so I get the class
back class and then i can say get member
get name so i get the name back and then
can just return return to you the key is
plus plus get name
ah ya name and now I have to say this
guy is the factor and seems to be
deployed where is my browser what you
see right now is the key is from Java 10
virgin good morning service message so
if i create another string here
and we just say blood loss then you see
they are unique so what I not now we are
actually done because what we can do
right now is to create a table with with
two columns the ID and the value and
then just fetch and catch whatever you
can use session scoping caching is
everything already built in and just
configure everything either before the
call after the coil or whatever so this
is what it takes to make fully
configurable java 6 applications the
problem with that is everyone wants to
have that but there is no use case with
that so we build it several times but it
never came to production because if it
was in production mode no one no one
they had to change the settings and
running sister but it is very possible
questions about that so configuration
done right okay so of course what you
would like to say in the real world okay
this is way too simple so we have to
decouple things and build some
intermediary layers so arm i will create
here a class called let's say um
I'm provider and the time provide is of
course an interface because enterprise
developers like interfaces so string get
time or say some architects really
appreciate it debate and and one
implementations and what's the problem
of the lives you cannot named it
properly deep limitations or what I see
in project which is really crazy is what
happens then dimple okay I'm forced to
use interfaces but there is I cannot
name the implementation properly anymore
so I implement the interface and I have
to call that input what actually damages
the whole concept of interfaces but I'm
a timer service timer provider time
program sorry you have to help me
otherwise I won't be able to show you
everything just the eighty percent for
the heck was an so okay um now again
time eight provider get time so and what
we what I can do right now I can inject
the interface
a time provider and because there is
only one implementation it will work for
bunch of a configuration there's only
one choice you don't have to specify
that so if I come back to to my browser
I get exception and why not exception is
incompatible class format error I didn't
save that I guess okay it works so you
have to save often so enjoy six this is
the conclusion so I'm what you see is
too early so what you learned if you
have an interface and implementation you
don't have to configure them right so
this is actually the conclusion I would
never do that in my project actually if
I have the power as semi architect I led
to delete all interfaces such interfaces
so from my point of view it should be
prohibited to use the import convention
because it damages the whole concept of
interfaces you can can name the
implementation properly just go for it
but you cannot you don't get interface
so and what remains in java 6 it remains
the concept of strategy pattern so
whenever you will see an interface then
it says to you it's an api put the
strategy pattern but not just an
interface just for the couple everything
which is somehow suspicious so um time
provider so let's create another time
provide and this would be our sign
writer and now you see the problem the
first name is the time provided input
the second one as another name is no
more consistent so to be consistent I
would have to create one with the name
timer improved to of course this would
be a consistent behavior which goes too
far even for over-engineering session I
would say so arm implements time and
input at time provider if the dangerous
with the other class and this guy does
returns return return new date to shrink
and now it breaks because it says
ambiguous dependencies for time time
provider so convention doesn't work
anymore because I have to implementation
of the same of the same interface if you
inject interface it's ambiguous so um
how to how to fix that there are
different possibilities that the I could
just say this guy is an active and then
i will get i would get this right the
alternative means what you can do you
can disable beans on the fly and you can
really re-enable them in pin 6 ml in
very small xml file which would be empty
right now it is but i could activate
this guy from here okay so this would be
of course strange because i built two
implementations are disabled one without
a reason but this is exactly what of
engineering does
something without having a reason for
that but damn let's say I would make it
a little bit nicer so what I could do is
I could create an imitation and the
annotation our annotation looks like
that and this is a qualifier and the
target is a minute to input implement
this guy import target is I can apply
this annotation on fields and types and
retention is always run time and I'm and
retention is run so now i can even say I
enum exciting this is something like
exactly this is a valid English good
thing yeah ok then low and high ah and
let's say each segments oh no it's not
value so so right what I built is
sophisticated annotation well which the
name is timer with one method or
property called value of type exactness
and for a because of laziness i just
created an embedded in um with two very
slow and high so i can say the exact
time provider as the exactness of ohio
cross
I can use static import to make it
prettier so it will no pork no problem
and now i get an unsatisfied dependency
the error because now I have one
qualified and one which is disabled so
there is no one you know so this is of
course bad situation so we have to
disable that and say I'm Murr timers
this guy so okay don't like that what
what's the keeper wait a minute yeah and
then I can just make readable so and now
in my good morning service I can say
inject timer with I second and it should
work right now
yes exact one and if i come here and say
low then will it work so as I I would
say as a test use case um i wouldn't use
interfaces in Java Java 6 without
qualifiers and what I also not allowed
to have qualifiers which are named after
technical stuff they should have
business names this is not very good
name by primer it should be something
else but they have no time to think
about this it's like it should be very
readable inject timer witches attacked
it will be the perfect case for four
qualifiers okay patient so now the first
the second topic from from the agenda
was target the most requested questions
how to build plugins and in java 6 you
can build lots of plugins but i would
show you the most common one what
plugins means is my understanding is
someone builds a core core system for
application and defines interfaces and
the interfaces can be implemented by
target and loaded at some some point of
time either dynamically or not usually
is on the server we don't have would
like to have something dynamically
because we would like to sleep well we
do too more too much dynamics the
chances are high that you have to wake
up with from jen space problems or
whatever so what you can do right now i
would say time provider is a pocket and
i would like to find all guides so or of
dollars so everyone any
what it means give me everything this
means time provider give me everything I
have and then I can wrap this with
instance and then now can say first I
can ask the provider are you ambiguous
or IO unsatisfied so ambiguous I can ask
proactively are the more than one is no
one would it work but it's still not a
plugin what a plugin actually is it's
the following I can get everyone
and we turn down so what I have right
now message I got everyone and just
returned the message which is no more
configurable but we are now in the
provided space and what you see is too
early and this so what happened right
now however it was implemented from
where the implement or whether they were
qualified or not I got everything back
and what we also do sometimes here you
can select providers which are qualified
or not which have specific type or not
so you can be you can filter from the
set of all known implementation of an
interface at runtime the most
interesting one we did it several times
as plugin mechanism for instance in java
6 and the first idea was to use osgi
okay we're at time we could do that but
we have no time so let's go with one
poly ok questions no questions so this
was the first plug-in mechanism I would
say the discovery based buggin this is
like I haven't interface given your
implementations and how it works in
department timers usually you would have
one maven project which is the war
project and just put it providers into
it into simple jar projects the only
thing you have to know is you have to
fit put the bins in SML into the jar
project then it will burn this is the
only thing to remember because something
without bin 6ml is not a java ee
component so you won't be able to find
that ok the new in word I would have an
empty work not empty some basic
functionality at work and then I would
be able to extend this functionality
with jars which are deployed in web in
flip ok any questions
no patient great audience do whatever
you want but do it right so arm so I'm
the next topic would be so what's the
next topic we have plugins so I could
show you probably a little bit
paralyzation she's probably interested
so it's a lot to ask a lot so let's say
some something is too slow here and i
would say i have to compute the message
so let's do that so i have a message
provider or to store the outcome let's
say so we have an audit department and
the audit department would like to have
all messages
so I'm actually if you have something
like this I wouldn't inject the audit
department to the good morning service
we could use even events which are nicer
for that but um I can show you this this
is very easy good morning service we can
say I send an event not a deputy event
something else events with at inject and
now I can fire the event here so I'm
done here so what happens is probably
subscribe this guy is firing the event
and the audit department can receive the
event but I have to specified it here
say this it absorbs message again it is
time based now all strings are send
would also be received by the bye bye
this observer so what we have to do is
to create a qualifier to qualify none
but does it work it's still good
got message too early so you see the
older department got the message
so this is synchronous delivery it means
the observer would would block yeah good
morning service so let's show you that
so what it actually means is the morning
service now all the department I will
block that this is not a good practice
to do that in production just even
system.out.print does somehow critical
but um
see what happens where's my browser is
lost yea God's others so oh it takes a
little bit you see it takes about one
second to deliver the message so um to
make it a synchronous it it is very
complicated what do you have to know is
it has to be a stateless e2b or a
singleton but it has to be an e gb and
then you have to find an annotation with
the name basically so and now it should
be a lot faster there is no waiting and
you see the events are asynchronously
still deliver ok this is the first
boring case but it's very handy if you
have all fine forgets methods can be
asynchronous just by annotating method
with space in front but the it has to be
a TGV questions are far so um I'm just
thinking about then something new
probably it's your blood and I call the
servlet that's calm so arm no xml we are
enjoyed by six it's a metal ss-sir so
what's interesting this is the the
configuration of the sublet and i can
say pacing supported not not I true
and now
too much methods created by it means I
only need one this guy and everything
else is going to be deleted so we have a
very simple servlet looks like that and
what I often do in fact my lights which
projects does exactly that so light
which is our monitoring tool what the
task pushes in real time via HTTP the
data from the server without without
damaging the server that meet the server
doesn't block and this works with
asynchronous of it so what you can do
you can stay request start pacing and
what you get back is a Singh context and
if I just start the sublet it will block
forever and then after five minutes with
time I'll do it will get as server error
500 but the nice thing is it blocks
without blocking so what it actually
does it parks the connection without a
detail just connection from the thread
button this is a this is why i call that
comment so you can do it right now is
not java 7 java 6 so it works with
glassfish sound gay balls and tell me
whatever
yeah i wrote a condom so this was yeah
just after timeout and but the
interesting part is what i can do right
now is i can just create an event just
ideas and this event is of type a sync
contacts in real world i will wrap it
wrap it in something which is not HTTP
dependent events and we'll send the
event and send event with independence
with fire so now the Soviet is done and
what I can do right now is I can create
a class let's say service this is a
single convened because what it often
does it catches all the events and there
is one method public void on httpd on
request it observes ace in context again
this is just a heck that was usually it
is a really good design to make a
service layer dependent on HTTP so you
should wrap it in something like browser
window request whatever and then I can
say here AC get response get right on
this all also not a very good prospectus
between method this way but at least
there are less lines of code so seems to
Greg
a little bit exceptions and then AC are
complete so let's retry net back that
the drops it means what we did right now
you can imagine we could right now with
two lines of code actuary okay to this
line is a little bit I would say this
can be refactored to this too lightly
coat but usually this is really what we
do in project the singleton put cash
both or requests and or incoming
business events and match them and
distribute the events in real time to
all browsers
ok this is what it takes this long poly
of course web sockets are common or are
coming but this is a long pony and by
the way i think iphone 4 is using long
polling for for email notification so
its case somehow ok questions i think i
would just leave it this way because
just just implemented everything would
be just i would use another event and
just match the events here with a full
loop so you can skip that right ok so
questions ok then you have no questions
then i will just show you something
simple it's um creating aspects so like
interceptors also common question is
possible in java 6 i would say portray
sir and the call trace is a regular Java
class with race invocation context
and what I can do I can invoke the
method here and before in up and after I
can or just grazed get method to our I
would like to see all the methods and to
see something actually there is a method
around involved so and this is a
interceptor which can be applied on all
EG bees and all managed beans what is
managed is what it is everything which
can be injected with men ok so and I
have the good morning service here so I
only have to say interceptors portrays
and
yeah universe Christ so arm when it's
only if you if you would like to trace
performance and built interceptors you
can do it with for monitoring purposes
for it's really hard in practice to find
real business cases who are intercept is
a viable because the cross-cutting
business use cases are very rare and the
next problem is in java 6 is everything
already covered with as a we have
transaction security monitoring
management everything is there so to
build an interceptor for that would be
over-engineering it will fit our theme
but right now i think it is enough to
see that it is very easy to implement
one and by the way you don't have to
hard-coded here you could use
interceptor binding and activate and
deactivate interceptors in pin 6 ml or
even better what you can also do you
could register interceptors on the fly
and this works with system events or
extensions so if you are interesting
about that in the i don't know i think
in one of their recent travel magazines
the Oracle ones which are free I've
wrote an article just small article
about interceptors with code which the
judge does exactly that so there is no
notation and on each department edges of
every all classes I like a annotate I
intercept them the others not okay so
questions
a question yes you could use this for
logging but in practice is a little bit
boring because what you get then is I
was in the method i was in the method i
was in the method and this is not not
what you done done then gap is
Heisenberg so what Eisenbach is it slows
down the system that way that an error
only occurs that's what accrues if you
are logging and if you deactivate
logging it will occur so you could use
that absolutely but what you can get for
logging if you like that is you would
get the method you get all the
parameters you get the target the beans
I get all the context is done and if you
would like to log this is also a good
idea to inject the logger it could be
locked for J laga we have to code
already because you get the name of the
class here so what you can do you can
create logger producer fetch the class
name and configure logging in one place
okay other questions
um mostly its performance measurement so
if we see we have some problems in
development with some facades or
something so we annotate the facade with
an interceptor and it just measures the
performance for debugging purposes is
the most communication in in my recent
project we also did this guy exposes J
mix monitoring data so we see I don't
know how many good mornings per second
are currently active or something so
more meaningful data than just logging
the problem I had was logging is logging
is too generic into low level so you
have to parse all the file to find to
find out what actually happens with
interceptor you can you can compute the
data in real time you can for instance
you can build something like by the way
this is a in the x-ray application I
built for my for the Blue Book you can
just download the applications as github
this is free so I did it exactly that so
what I get slow is method the list of
all slowest map and all methods which
drew an exception which is the most
common exception to assist in real time
very easy with interceptors
but logging is a little bit pity because
you are writing a lot of vlog and then
you have to fire up tail to search for
information in order this in need 2012
okay but it's absolutely doable by the
way also in interesting information
interceptors are managed components so
you can inject things two interceptors
beans at whatever you want okay very
good so I actually forgot about that
Panem yeah cash you could use caching as
well but then you will have to introduce
your own annotation like catchable on
something then you can do that okay
other questions very good question no
questions time I saw you ggb we'd like
to see that time I service talking you
so a time a service kills basically how
it's called words um pillar is probably
too offensive ah so I'm a singleton
startup codes started with the
application server and one method do
something and this is annotated with
what's what's the schedule almost forgot
that and what we can do right now is
every hour every minute
and every second something should happen
here
and let's grow up already save Panem oh
noes yeah exactly this is just my my way
to test was soo listening or no more so
but it works you see every taken
something happens the problem is this
this time they are steady so I have to
recompile that and the most common
question is is not usable in our
purposes because we'd like to disable
enable and reenable so let's do that so
no more timer timer service I can inject
this with resource in method I would
initialize the timer and what there is
there is a configuration schedule
expression ration is the name and this
is exactly the same second let's say
every two seconds minute every minute
and hour every hour
and now I can pass schedule expression
the calendar timer and I get it a link
calendar timer bank stirs Ivan and what
it actually means i can now some other
methods cancel the timer so i could say
this timer cancelled and it disappears
and now adjust think about this what we
could do right now very easily we could
just replace this disorders with
configurable string and configure all
the time is on the file
ok we can imagine that I don't have to
implement that it will be just
repetition of already so on this
actually we used data so and since all
the configuration is stored in the
database anyway so we have the
administration console ready ok I don't
know whether it works now I have to
redeploy everything because now it says
we have two timers right now and because
there was some inconsistency so i would
write Mike doesn't matter questions now
it would work I say just questions I
will have to probably inverse case we
start last week or something but the
problem was I just change our know the
problem list of class which the problem
is the speaker timeout I forgot timeout
and without timeout I go to a deployment
error that is not consistent Everett if
I would like to configure the timer I
will have to I will have to use timeout
on method to tell him use the methods
for for invocation
questions yeah
no on one this is a limitation so if you
would like to have multiple times you
will have to have multiple passes and
probably what's very usable as well as
you can say working somewhere you can
say this persistent of set for system I
thought was here yeah I'm a convict so
what you have to do is create a hammock
on time I convict is actually really
important in production so set
persistent what's new I can decide
whether the timer is persistent or not
the most common ficient are our timers
class tower and the answer is they are
if they are persistent and the table is
maintained globally only one time timer
will fire a time in a pasta if that
timer is not persistent you will get
multiple timers they are bound to a GBM
go to the database and you can configure
that here with persistence to or false
and pass the time a convict here cuddle
yeah you have to configure glassfish
property because dead or jealous or
whatever AJ posters and flat files and
glass using the default is it uses
database data source called jdbc /
underscore underscore default or
something and this is on each domain
node so you what you will have to have
you have to change it to a global
database so this data so will have to
point somewhere to a database which runs
globally is not on every server oh it
works okay thanks for your questions you
to heat my application so I'm there
every two seconds seems to work so this
was configurable timer which is
persistence or not everything can be
configurable with injection of resources
okay questions
ah dependence whether this persistent or
not it is persistently all-timer events
are replied with transient nothing ever
very good other questions then if you
have no questions will show you
something moreover engineered more
paralyzation with futures and how to
start as many threads you like to
withdraw assets or for instance starting
and run about this is actually a nice
thing so let's say ah threadstarter so
actually it is forbidden to start
threads which would be container which
is good because what I see as consultant
is too many applications are dying
because exactly does happen developer
says new thread start and then after 500
times it does because of out of memory
error so I'm
threadstarter start
this could be a stateless session bean
with asynchronous and now we build
something where you can just start
threats if you inject this they're being
somewhere else we can just create
runnable and started the trick is this a
stateless session bean which is
asynchronous but the asynchronous is
managed by the application server
absolutely allowed to use bgb
functionality so it should be any
problem so right now you build a bridge
set of starting a thread you are using
this this is your B and you can start
whatever threads you want and by the way
you can either throttle this red hood
because stateless has makes full size so
you can reduce the boot size it say ok
I'm have on it this amount of beat and
you can assign a thread pool 20gb so
questions of our and you can even go
crazier and say I am observing a
runnable and just send the runnable as
an event and it will pick up but
whatever thread starter is is active and
just and just executed in background
ok so how it would work list in good
morning service i would say um i would
say let's go d not no no runnable right
runnable carnivals checked and let's say
i would like to send you wanna go and
say here
so this should be actually sufficient
have your rebirth so this was the amount
of work which is necessary to execute
something synchronous asynchronously in
a valid managed and monitored way by the
application server okay so we still have
nine minutes so if you have question
does ask the questions so I can just use
the whole hour it can be the timer is
running multiple times because I'm whole
deploying the application sometimes
produces two times or something or demo
mode works in the next session today i
will use maybe so all the scripts
whatever that's the time i did this
everything else is um events so good
morning service and we had all the
department what's very usable is that i
can say i can specify when the event is
going to be delivered and you can say
after success it means at commute time
only Norvik case and in progress i could
even I could even roll back the current
transaction and this is extremely useful
for batch processing so what you can
easily do is to send events and reduce
the to listeners one listens on commit
at the other one world egg and you know
which which jobs in real time are our
successful and which jobs fail and just
imagine that you can expose that in real
time by a disciplined your listeners
this is what we are doing in my current
project we are kind of progress bar
which is which is and the data for the
progress bar is provided by a sublet and
you can imagine the implementation it
was very simple but previously it was a
huge framework with JMS topics and
everything else and whose job I six we
just deleted everything and and and and
and I think three passes you can imagine
how it works right
okay five minutes so I'm open for
questions really all right I show you
that it works so I would just use before
after success and after failure and
throw exceptions in one case yep
these questions yeah problem businesses
spring guys can be really aggressive and
so everything but what's worth
interesting this earth inject comes from
spring it was designed by Rod Johnson
after july six was submitted and then
was reintegrated to java 6 or before
that draw by six had from seen in an out
on a date so what it actually means this
snippet spring Lord would look exactly
the same but it also mean if we have an
application server Java is it capable
application server this every advocate
for the right now is java 6 capital and
you deploy spring do the same
application the questioners or to attack
whom should react to add eject java 6 of
spring by larry the same allocation so
it's really or i can tell you i wouldn't
i wouldn't use spring in july six
containers because it's too much overlap
but I using spring on tomcat absolutely
I'll the decision decisions will be
decided with someone else for business
we can only say look there's application
server comes with this functionality and
this is spring with this functionality
they would everyone depends on your
skills or whatever but what I can tell
you all I wanted the job a six I didn't
miss a lot okay so you can achieve
extremely early on yeah haven't put out
the driver some indie eight but you can
build crazy application job I six honest
and it's getting crazier and crazier and
even very easy you can integrate that
with no signal for instance in tips link
there are food projects on so what if if
I would build let's say a cloud or
something spring is probably more
flexible because Java 6 is server side
fender you can run spring whenever you
want but it's starting to change right
now as well because prince is well from
jboss and or or or or it's called open
web beans from Apache you can put them
outside the application server they can
use the whole dependency injection model
without any application
so it's really hard to answer the
problem is too much overlap and I try to
avoid very use as much prevalence what
it possible so that in my war there is
no external dependencies it's very
important to me get asked diplomat time
so fast turnaround times are the
question and there is us I got yesterday
a thin book like java 6 and I think this
is a very simple it just visible on I
also got some books but my hopes are
probably not for starters or pictures
like problem solution for the other
consistent but the first blue book could
be interesting for you because it will
full application / on top of java 6 and
before trying any book just check out
the java 6 tutorial a look for that
about how to PDF pages with all single
yeah who's actually a competitive and
forensic laboratory will just be
completely and download for free yeah
and there are lots of even kindle
resources from from oracle they can
download and gloriously public comment
so resources is another problem so you
can get lots of lots of tutorials
internal politics actually still the
world of men as other question
I would do it in the next session goody
so okay this was more real-world
hands-on g-unit more detail on whatever
this tutorial loud but I'm just quick
answer unit test j unit for unit testing
or hitter for marking an equivalent for
ten percent of all specification and
graphene this is an extension of our
Killian or you can integrate very easily
selenium versatility when when it is I
am today before lunch I think it's
creates with your opponent wait not this
time I don't know what why not this fat
it didn't happen please fill out the
services has to be to get such such
stretch stretch topic data acceptance or
half our time together so I'm think we
are done here food or other question
occasionally out I will zip there and
clean up clean up it means i will just
clean all the classes and then sent an
ant wit with the OSD hurry you can click
on that and with download desert with
what I can do and when it depends on it
electric grid I try to do today inverse
K is today night padam padam Dean and it
is my twitter ID Adam wait a minute
this is my tweeted Adam p so thank you
very much and see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
