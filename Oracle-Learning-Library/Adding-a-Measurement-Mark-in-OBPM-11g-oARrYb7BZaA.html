hello my name is Rosie pillar and I'm a
principal curriculum developer at oracle
server technologies curriculum
development in this demonstration I'll
show you how to create a measurement
mark in Oracle BPM 11g here is a sample
business process in Oracle BPM studio
let's assume you want to measure
discount values coming out of the enter
quote details activity to do that you
need to create a measurement mark on the
transition between enter quote details
and determine approvals first make sure
the component palette is visible if it
isn't open it by clicking view component
palette the component palette appears on
the right to see the measurement mark
component expand the artifacts folder
click and release the measurement
component and move the cursor between
enter quote details and determine
approvals click again to drop the
measurement mark there if you prefer you
can click and drag the measurement
component to its position on the canvas
once you place the measurement mark
notice it points to the transition
between enter quote details and
determine approvals this is where you
want it to be as you want to measure
discounts right after the enter quote
details task you still need to edit the
properties of the measurement mark so
either double click it or right-click
and select properties here's the
measurement mark properties window since
all you want is a snapshot you leave
measurement type at single measurement
let's name the measurement mark quote
entered you can type a description if
you want to and in the last section you
get to choose which business indicators
you want this measurement mark to store
let's assume you just want to measure
discounts selected from the available
panel and use the right arrow to move it
to the selected panel if
you wanted the measurement mark to store
all the business indicators listed you
could use the double right arrow to move
them all at once you could even create a
new business indicator on the fly by
clicking the new button let's assume you
don't need additional business
indicators so having selected the
discount measure click OK and voila you
have created a measurement mark that's
the end of our demonstration now you
know how to create measurement marks in
Oracle BPM 11g I'm Rosie pillar thanks
