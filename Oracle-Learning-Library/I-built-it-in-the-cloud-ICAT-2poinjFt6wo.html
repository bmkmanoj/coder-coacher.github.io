and I have Joe here from ikat hi Joe
I shot - how are you it's a pleasure to
be here that's great so Joe but I cat
and what did stream three businesses yes
we sell catastrophe insurance our target
markets are small businesses and
residential homeowners from in areas
that are both hurricane and earthquake
exposed we've been in business for about
18 years and have experienced rapid
growth over the past five so I see that
we have the architecture diagram for
ikat here and there are many policy
management applications that I can't use
this which one is this that's called
summit so summit fits into what we call
the middle market it's a kind of a
misnomer because the middle market is
our biggest market and typically the
policies written on a middle market
policy for us start and I think about
ten million dollars of total insured
value so they're pretty large policies
often condo complexes things of that
nature the existing middle market
application we had was not scaling well
it was homegrown it was written 15 years
ago we needed a new solution we looked
at doing it in-house but wound up
choosing and partnering with a third
party and that's what some it is okay so
can you walk us through the detailed
architecture of the summit application
and how it integrates with the Oracle I
can it turns out there's a lot of things
to be concerned about when you're
selling insurance policies one is that
you don't sell too many policies in the
exact same area another one is you don't
want to sell say an earthquake policy on
poor soil so summit in addition to doing
all the policy management in the
database also us to talk to our back-end
systems so when a policy comes in we go
over here and we model it and we get a
number back or a value back to some
it says oh good risk bad risk see what
happens so it was important to have an
application that was flexible enough to
not only work itself in its own
self-contained environment but also go
to talk to our existing infrastructure
databases so Joe can you tell us about
the performance requirements of the
summit application and how does
architecture especially the integration
with org structure addresses some of
those needs yes I can turns out that
summit is a very i/o intensive
application we tested it on premise
in-house it was not working well at all
as we got further into the testing we
realized that because summit is written
to almost a hundred percent in PL sequel
even though it's j2ee application and
this is an application server all of
summits real power is coming inside the
Oracle database for that or because of
that it needs a large system global area
which means you need a lot of memory so
that was a great win for the
infrastructure because it comes with 512
gigabytes of memory out of the box the
i/o solution showed the i/o problem was
solved with solid state disk that's
involved in the Oracle cloud
infrastructure for example in our early
testing we were doing lots of data pump
import and exports but we went from our
on Prem spinning disk solution to the
Oracle cloud infrastructure solid state
solution we saw a tenfold increase in
performance on those tasks very
impressive very helpful made it viable
and I guess it goes without saying the
CPUs right now we bought in at a low
number of CPUs we can grow that whatever
we want we can shrink it it gives us all
kinds of flexibility we are very
confident both myself on the technical
side and the business itself that this
solution will last for years to come
that's fantastic thank you for sharing
your architecture today with us Joe my
pleasure Sean
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
