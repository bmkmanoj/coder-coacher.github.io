two-part demonstration showing how to
create incident rule sets in Enterprise
Manager cloud control 12c so now we have
one rules in our rule set let's add
another rule first click OK this other
rule will have to do with the sending of
notifications whenever the any of these
incidents occur so let's click create to
create our new rule for this rule we
want it to operate on incidents so let's
choose the second option newly created
incidents or updates to incidents and
click continue
so what we want this rule to do is to
send page notifications for critical
incidents to my pager and send email
notifications to my email address for
warning incidents so for this rule we
want it to operate based on severity so
let's check severity on the list of
specific incidents
and then for severity options we will
choose critical and warning
and click Next
so far we have selected warning and
critical incidents and then our actions
will be based on the severity so let's
click Add to add the notification
actions now the first action we want to
set up is to send notification to my
pager if the incident is a critical
severity so we don't want to always
execute the action we want to choose the
second option which is to only execute
the action based on a condition that we
will specify so let's choose that option
and then select the severity for the
criteria then we'll choose the critical
severity
so when the incident is of critical
severity then we want it to send a
notification to my pager in order to do
this we have to go to the notification
section and in the page field will enter
my Enterprise Manager user previously an
Enterprise Manager I had set up my
notification preferences stating what my
pager specifications are as well as what
my email address is Enterprise Manager
will use this information to determine
where to send the page when critical
incidents occur click continue and now
we will add another action ad
this action will send an email if the
severity is warning so as we did in the
previous action choose severity but in
this case select warning for the type of
severity and we'll specify my Enterprise
Manager user for the email to field and
click continue at this point we are done
specifying actions so we can click Next
now we need to specify a name for our
rule so let's say page for critical and
email for warning and we will use the
same for the description click Next we
see the review page showing our two
actions for this new rule click continue
to complete our scenario let's add one
more rule we'll click ok on the dialog
box and then click create to add our
final rule this final rule has to do
with setting up the escalation level of
the incident based on how long the
incident is open so this rule will also
operate on incidents so let's select
option two again for the type of rule to
create this rule will operate on the
critical incidents so let's choose
severity and then select the critical
option
and click Next
now we are ready to add the actions so
let's add our first action our first
action will be to set the escalation
level of this incident to level 1 if it
has been open for 24 hours and has not
been resolved yet so let's choose to
execute the actions based on our
specified condition then choose the
option regarding how long the incident
is open and in a particular state since
the default is 24 hours we can leave the
default and what we want is if this
incident has been open for 24 hours we
want to update that incident and
escalate its severity to level 1 so
let's go down to the update incident
section and choose to escalate to level
1
and we can click continue
now let's add our second action
click Add
and choose the conditional option again
and select the option regarding how long
the incident is open for this action we
want to escalate the incident if it has
been open for 42 hours so change the
time in the state option to 42 hours
will set the escalate option in update
incident section to incident level 2 and
click continue so basically this shows
you how you can automate operational
practices such as setting the escalation
levels setting the priority based on
attributes of the incidents such as
severity and how long an incident has
been open click Next and we'll give our
rule a name let's call this one incident
escalation rule click Next
the review page shows us an overview of
what we have just created click continue
and at this point you can see we have
three rules for this rule set they all
operate on our product argit's click OK
to continue now we need to save our
changes
so click Save and you can see that our
rule set has been successfully created
this concludes part two of our
demonstration thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
