in this session we will demonstrate the
use of database cloud self-service
portal by a self-service user the
self-service user has a special login
into enterprise manager none of the
global menus like enterprise and set up
are visible to the self-service user and
they are exposed to only the
self-service or cloudy capabilities of
enterprise manager to get access to
additional Enterprise Manager
capabilities the self-service user will
have to request additional privileges
from the self-service administrator to
request a database ensure that none of
the coder limits have exceeded and click
on the request database button select
the desired service template by looking
at the description and the details
provided like version memory CPU and
other options by default a unique
request name is generated for this
request select desired zone and click
Next provide a username and password for
the master account this account will be
used to perform all administrative tasks
on your database click Next to continue
select the start and end time for this
database for example let's set the
duration for this database to two weeks
and click Next review the request
summary and click Submit to submit this
request note that a new request is now
visible under the my requests table also
the coder limit for number of databases
has gone up to 2 the memory and storage
coder limits would be updated once the
