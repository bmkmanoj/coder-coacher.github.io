sites beyond the out-of-the-box sba
implementation and the SCA developer
tools simplify the process of
customizing and deploying your SCA site
but before you can do any of that you
have to first set up your local
development environment with the SCA
source code and be SCA developer tools
and in this video I'm going to show you
how to do just that we are going to
installed nodejs and still gulp j/s
download the SCA source files from the
file cabinet and then install the
additional files in the SCA source
directory the first step is to install
node J s and the version of nodejs that
you install depends on which SCA release
you are using take a look at the
installed node J s topic in the suite
commerce developers portal to see which
version of no GS you should install I'm
using Vinson so I'll install the most
recent long-term support for point X
point X version of nodejs
you can download node.js that nodejs org
slash en slash download slash releases
on this page I need to locate the
version of nodejs that I want and click
the Downloads link here you can download
the install package for your operating
system and since I use Windows I'll
download the windows install package
when the download finishes I'll go to
the Installer and run it
and I'll just accept all the default
settings for the installation
next I need to install golf jsni do this
by issuing a command from the command
line or terminal window since I'm on a
Windows PC I'll run the command window
as administrator to avoid any permission
problems during the install the command
to install golf jeaious is in PM space
install space - - global space goal and
it can take a couple of minutes to
finish the install the third step is to
download the FCA source files from the
file cabinet in NetSuite these files are
available as a VIP file in the file
cabinet to download the file go to
website hosting files by posting files
FFP applications then choose the folder
for the release of sta your using then
go to source under source sources to
download the zip file click the download
link after the download completes I need
to extract the files to the location
where I want them to resign for
simplicity sake I've created a folder
named FCA and I will extract the files
to a subfolder and for the SCA version
the final step is to install additional
files in the FCA source files directory
this is done from the command window or
terminal window depending upon your
operating system so I'll open the
command window and change directories to
the location where my SCA source files
are stored
they now issue the NPM space install
command this installs additional no js'
files to my source directory it may take
a couple of minutes to install the files
when that finishes I issue the gulp
command to create additional directories
required by the developer tools the
first time you run the Gulf command it
creates a folder called local
distribution this folder contains a
compiled version of Suite commerce
advanced and that the my development
environment is set up and ready for me
to begin making customizations thanks
