Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series these demonstration is the
first part of a series of two this first
part shows you how to create
administration groups and the second
part shows you how to create template
collections and associate them to your
administration groups administration
groups in template collections are a way
to set up the management of Doggett's in
the section manner that it scales as
your data center grows the idea is that
you set it up once and as your
enterprise grows Enterprise Manager
automatically knows how to deploy the
right management settings monitoring
settings compliant standards and cloud
polices to your target as they join your
administration groups the other benefit
of this is when there are changes that
need to be made to your settings it is
very easy to ensure that your targets
are kept in sync with these setting
changes to create your administration
groups go to the setup menu add targets
and then go to administration groups the
getting started page gets you a
high-level overview of the process
involved the first step is really
designing your administration group
hierarchy in a way that targets managed
and money told in the same way belong to
the same administration group and can
have different levels of hierarchy based
on how you structure and organize your
targets the next step is making sure
that your targets belong to the right
administration groups making sure that
the values of your target properties
which determine that administration
group criteria I'll set the right way so
they join the right administration
groups and the first step is making sure
that you have all your monitoring
templates ready your compliance
standards and cloud policies all in
place so that you can add them to the
template collections and once you've
done all who's pre steps you are ready
to set it up
assuming you already gone through all
the steps let's go and create your
administration group click on setup the
administration groups hierarchy what we
are doing now is setting up an
administration group hierarchy and we
are going to set up the two level
hierarchy the first level is based on
lifecycle status in the second on the
line of business so let's add the first
level click on add and this shows you
the list of all targets properties saved
you can use to create your
administration group hierarchy so click
on life cycle status so the first
organization level of our target group
is by lifecycle status whatever your
development targets or prediction or
staging or test targets our targets may
have different values of lifecycle
status remember this is an
administration group so if targets on
money told in the same way it is
perfectly OK to merge targets that have
different values for targets properties
together so for example if your
development staging and test targets
even though different in usage but all
are going to be money told in the same
way you might want to put them together
in the same administration group so
let's go ahead and do that
so select development stage and test and
then click on merge so what this means
is old targets where lifecycle status is
developmental stage or test belong to
one group and let's do the same for
mission critical or prediction so click
the control button on mission critical
and prediction and then click on merge
so we've put these together what this
means is the second group that we have
will contain targets that either are
mission critical or production targets
as far as monitoring is concerned they
are money told the same way as you
noticed
the admin group is starting to be billed
down below and with some default names
so let's give them more meaningful names
select the most left node move the
scroll bar a little bit this is the
group that has development or staging or
test scroll back and click on that group
name and then you can click on set
administration group detail which allows
you to change the default name so let's
call it
dev underscore group click OK let's now
do the same for the second group this is
what life cycle status equals mission
critical or production so let's call it
prod and the scope group after we are
done with that let's add the next level
in the hierarchy so click on add the
next level of hierarchy in our admin
group will be the line of business so
within each major group for example dev
group or prod group we might have
different sets of monitoring settings
pair line of business and this is what
we are doing now for line of business
notice that it added two values here
finance and sales what it does in terms
of finding these values is to find them
across all the existing targets in the
system if there are any value for line
of business that have already been
assigned to targets it tries to pull all
those values in here and pre populate
the list folder here it found that we
have targets for finance and sales ready
in our system we can add more but for
now we are happy with this so let's just
go ahead and rename the groups so this
group belongs to the development group
where the line of business is financed
so let's rename this dev Group 1 to dev
finance a moment in full name and the
next group should be line of business
sales so let's call it dev sales then
let's rename the other two the first one
will be proud
finance and the other one will be prod
sales once you are happy with your
changes you can go ahead and click on
create to create your administration
group hierarchy you get a confirmation
message click on continue and the
administration group hierarchy is
created
this is the end of the first part of
this demo thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
