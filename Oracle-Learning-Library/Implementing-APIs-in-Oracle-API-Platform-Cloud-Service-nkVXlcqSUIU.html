api's so you can control access to your
service endpoints Bob sure would he gets
too many requests it's slowing down as
workflow it needs to manage access to
the services at apiary so it only
authorized requests can reach them
luckily Oracle API platform cloud
service can help this service will help
Bob manages api's by configuring two API
endpoints one for receiving the requests
and the other one for routing the
authorized requests to his implemented
services the streamlines workflow to
complete the API implementation Bob
needs to create an API configure the API
endpoints and deploy the API to a
gateway Bob's back-end service is
implemented at apiary which returns gas
and electric usage he creates a managed
API by using the API platform cloud
service management portal on the api's
page he can see existing API s and
create new ones
once the API is created Bob configures
the API request endpoint all of the
requests are sent here next he
configures the service request endpoint
his back-end services receive the
authorized requests from here once the
two API endpoints have been configured
Bob needs to deploy his API to a gateway
so it can be accessible for consumers
Bob needs to receive the deploy two
gateway grant for the deployment to
happen without approval he needs to be
issued the request deployed a gateway
grant to be able to request deployment
to a gateway then a Gateway manager can
approve if he's not issued either one of
these grants he won't see the Gateway
and he won't be able to deploy the API
deployment appears on the waiting tab
until it's processed after the gateway
pulls the management service the API is
deployed and begins servicing requests
