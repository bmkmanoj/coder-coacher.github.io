curriculum developer at Oracle I'd like
to show you how easy it is to add tasks
to a process model in business process
composer this is the first demo in a
series of three demos on modeling a
business process using business process
composer let's assume you have created a
process called request quote at this
point it has just to flow objects start
and end to add a user task to this
process start by double-clicking the
component type with your component
palette expanded click and drag a user
task to the process model positioning it
right on the transition between start
and end when the transition turns blue
you'll know you're in the right place
and you can release the mouse now the
task has been added to the process model
notice the transitions have been routed
to and from the new task to rename the
new task simply click it and type the
new name let's assume you want to add a
whole series of tasks of the same type
start by moving the end event over to
make room for the new tasks then toggle
the stamp mode from one to n now you can
add four more user tasks quickly without
having to go back to the component
palette to add each one individually
when you're done just toggle the stamp
mode back to one give your tasks more
meaningful names by clicking and typing
the new names
and voila you've just added five tasks
to your process model that's all we have
time for in this demo but check out the
other two demos in this series to see
how to add swim lanes create roles and
add gateways to your process model I'm
