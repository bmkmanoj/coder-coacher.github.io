solutions architecture at Oracle cloud
today we're going to take a look at
Oracle bare-metal clouds database
systems rack offering you can run Oracle
certified and supported rack database
let's walk through launching a clustered
Oracle RAC database in the upper right
hand corner you click database and then
DB systems to launch a new rack system
we click on DB system we give it a
display name we choose an availability
domain every region in the Oracle
bare-metal cloud has three availability
domains your Oracle RAC database is
highly available within an availability
domain if you want to make them highly
available in an entire region we make it
very simple to launch a second rack
cluster and set up data guard between
the two we choose our shape you know
that this is a rack cluster because the
shape says rack rack is deployed in a
two node cluster and supports Oracle
Enterprise Edition extreme performance
in the Oracle cloud you can scale the
number of Oracle database licensed cores
dynamically with no impact to your
application so I'm going to start off
with 8 cores I could choose any number
of cores here one reason you might
change the core count is when you're
doing switch over for maintenance the
bare metal cloud puts you in charge of
wind light to patch or perform
maintenance choose the level of disk
redundancy so your Oracle RAC cluster
comes with 24 terabytes of locally
attached SSD storage in high redundancy
ASM is configured in a threeway mirror
can normal redundancy it's a two-way
mirror supply your public key
the Oracle bare-metal cloud doesn't
isolate you from your resources you
apply your SSH key so that you can SSH
into the ins
where we give you root access this
allows you to bring your existing
tooling your existing knowledge your
existing third-party products into the
Oracle bare-metal cloud you don't need
to learn a new way of managing databases
you can extend all of your existing
tools to us choose a virtual cloud
network and a subnet and then supply a
hostname
Oracle bare-metal cloud virtual cloud
networks support internal DNS so you'll
see the host and domain URL just below
the hostname supply a database name
choose a database version 11 to 12 1 and
very soon 12.2 supply an oracle DB
password reinforce complex password
rules to help ensure that you're
building the most secure database
possible then click Launch DB system in
this screen we list all of your database
systems you'll see the scan IP addresses
these are the IPS that you point your
clients to you'll see the software
Edition that you're running the port's
that you're running on and a list of all
of the nodes let's go ahead and force
the failure of a node failover takes
tens of seconds failover has completed
you can now see on the rack details page
that one note is stopped the other note
is still available as soon as the stop
node comes back online fail back will
happen
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
