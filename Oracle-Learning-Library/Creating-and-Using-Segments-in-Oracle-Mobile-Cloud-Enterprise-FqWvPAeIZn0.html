users so you can turn cliques into
clients and browsers into buyers to

new segments and adding a date add a
filter for location and select the zip
code to target then add a filter for
technology and operating system the

change the condition to an or
relationship just drag one tile on top
of the other the visual indicator or is
shown between the filters since we want
a segment by OS name and a certain zip
code we're all set now click create the

landing page looks like you've got a lot
of users in the san francisco zip code
who have iPhones but suppose you want to
add a zip code for Los Angeles you can
easily edit your segments to include
that location click the filter you want
to edit then zip code will also rename
this segment and click update your
segment now includes the changes you've
made along with the OS and location data

information such as the segment criteria
