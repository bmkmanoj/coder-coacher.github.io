to develop Java apps and connect them to
your cloud database this example uses
the free NetBeans Java developer
environment from Exadata Express service
console you can do step by step
instructions for connecting NetBeans
Java apps to your cloud database this
example shows setting it up on a Windows
machine as mentioned in the instructions
there are a couple of important
prerequisites
first you must have JDK 8 version 71 or
JDK 7 version 80 or higher install
second you must have the jce unlimited
strength policy files added to your JDK
this enables strongly encrypted database
network connections to install you must
overwrite to specific jar files third
the executing Express client credential
zip file needs to be downloaded and
stored on your local machine we place
this file in a directory called C net
admin in a previous example
lastly this demo assumes you have
NetBeans a 2 or higher installed with
the Java development modules get started
by downloading Oracle JDBC thin driver
and Oracle Universal connection full
jars accept the software license
save these jar files to a local
directory for demo purposes we place the
files in a subdirectory called demo jars
off of local C Drive root in an upcoming
step we'll add these jar files to a new
NetBeans development project
next download a java class called UCP
sample this class contains sample code
to help you get going quickly place it
in a subdirectory called demo class off
of C Drive root
we'll add UCP sample Java to the
development project in a moment
go to NetBeans and create a new java
application using existing source files
this demo creates the project in a
subdirectory called
demo app off of C Drive root make sure
to include the location of UCT sample
Java in project settings
you
with our project thou created take a
look at the UCP sample file
and add the jdbc and UCP jars to the
project
you
now right-click on the project and
update its run settings
make you CP sample the main class
envy em options set important Java
properties you can copy/paste these
properties from step-by-step
instructions shown earlier then edit
them is necessary note the properties
point to our client credentials download
location they also identify certain
credential files that require a password
to open while providing the actual
password this is the same password
entered for client credentials
downloaded in a previous example
lastly make a few updates to the sample
Java code here at the top insert the
correct connection settings set the
connection URL and provide database
schema name and the corresponding
database user password
at the bottom replace these steps with
code that runs a sequel select operation
simply retrieve data from the empty Abel
created in our previous data load
example now click clean and build the
app then run your java application and
verify query results in the output
console
that's it you've created a java
application that successfully queries
our back-end Exadata Express cloud
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
