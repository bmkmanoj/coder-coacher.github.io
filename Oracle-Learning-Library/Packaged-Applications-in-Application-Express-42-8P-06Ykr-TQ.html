here to demonstrate how easy it is to
install and use packaged applications in
application Express 4.2 you start the
process from the home page of
application Express by clicking on the
application builder where we'll begin
the installation process for the
packaged application
the home page for the application
builder shows all the applications which
have been installed into our application
Express workspace we want to go look at
the packaged applications represented by
the tab on the far right in the tab bar
this tab displays all the packaged
applications and sample applications
that come with application Express 4.2
and are available for you to easily
install we'll install checklist manager
which demonstrates the ease of
installation and is also an application
that's easy to understand what it does
who can get the whole concept of the
packaged application easily
clicking on a particular packaged
application takes you to a description
page where there's a brief text
description a screenshot and a button
which allows you to start the
installation process with the simple
click the first step of the installation
process allows you to select what type
of authentication you're going to use
for this packaged application we'll
stick with the standard application
Express authentication and we'll move on
to the next step by clicking on next to
complete your interaction with the
application process all you have to do
is click on install application to
confirm the installation
the remainder of the installation
process looks and feels a lot like
installing an app on an iPhone or an
iPad once the installation process is
complete your application will be in
your application Express workspace ready
to run and use this functionality
immediately and there you go your
application is ready to run
simply click on the blue button to run
the application and see the
functionality in checklist manager
first you log into checklist manager
with your username and password going
through the application Express
authentication as you specified
on the homepage for checklist manager
you can see that you have several
checklists already created listed for
you the ability to create a new
checklist or the ability to run reports
let's just look at one of these
checklists to get a very high-level idea
of what you can do with checklist
manager
this checklist is for IT projects each
row represents a project and each column
represents a task that has to be
completed for that project to change a
completion percentage we simply click on
the cell and move the slider that has
the effect of not only changing that
value but changing the percent complete
for both the project and for that tasks
across projects in addition checklist
manager logs the change that was made
and the person who changed it all of
this with just a couple of clicks and a
few seconds of installation time from
the checklist manager packaged app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
