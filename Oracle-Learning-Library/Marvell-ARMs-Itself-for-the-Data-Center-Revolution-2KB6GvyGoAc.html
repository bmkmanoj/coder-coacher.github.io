and I'm with marvell semiconductor and
marvell semiconductor manufacturers ARM
processors and networking components and
all kinds of things everything from LED
light bulbs all the way to the
infrastructure for mobile communications
like base stations and of course cloud
computing because we have storage
controllers where I think sixty percent
of the storage controller market in hard
drives rotating media we have solid
state controllers and then we have arm
processors for compute for mobile type
applications gaming applications and of
course compute workloads like you find
in the cloud and we also have been doing
ethernet for many many years as well so
we have three of the principal
technologies that make up the cloud the
networking the storage and the compute
and today what I'm going to do is take
you through some of our successes we've
had in revolutionising the cost both in
terms of equipment costs or capital
equipment costs and also the total cost
of ownership through operational costs
by moving to low power application
specific type processing you can save a
lot of power and a lot of gain a lot of
efficiency so I'll start with some
vision and the vision is that we are in
the Milky Way here and the world is
becoming a supercomputer and a
supercomputer is comprised of three
elements storage networking and compute
this won't change this has been the same
since the birth of the computer and when
it comes to these three things you're
going to want to balance them this is
our approach so the kind of networking
io the compute resource and the storage
resource is balanced when we look at
what is traditionally going on in an x86
based approach to compute and storage
and networking you have very very very
high high performance computing one
isosceles triangle here you'll have a
networking resource a storage resource
whether it's dram or other and you
lots and lots of compute and what
happens when you are out of balance like
that is you have your compute resource
your CPU sitting around not doing any
work so when you hear about wimpy core
scale out ARM processors and you wonder
well why is there anything different out
there using mobile processors or
something to do compute against the x86
or intel or AMD world the answer is
balance this is the inside story we just
don't have too much compute so therefore
our compute resource is busy all the
time there's no bottleneck from the
network there's no bottleneck from
storage back and forth to the processor
because we bring the compute down so
this means that our chips are five or 10
watts okay and the networking interfaces
are fully utilized their never idle the
storage interface is fully utilized
never idle and the computer resources
fully utilized never idle this no matter
who you talk to on this revolution of
low power and and what people are saying
the armed revolution it's really just
simple we've just balanced the amount of
compute with networking and storage so
you may wonder well why doesn't intel
and AMD just do that and that's exactly
what they are doing so we started this
revolution and of course they're
responding so that so that everybody can
can approach this new what we call scale
out or or wimpy core approach and
intel's done this with their adam
product so i think the way to see the
rest of my presentation is we're going
to apply balance to the cloud and in
doing that we're not going to have any
of the three principal resources ever
idle now what i see happening and i call
it the arms race is that there are
really two compute architectures there's
x86 coming down but reducing its
performance on purpose to balance
there's arm going up in performance and
they are set to collide and the other
architectures PowerPC mips and there are
other architectures have fallen now by
the wayside in terms of volume there's
more arm cores sold on the planet due to
mobile devices then there are x86 cores
so the the most popular compute
architecture in the world is armed and
it's driven by the mobile ninety-four
percent of all mobile devices are ARM
processors so you really do have this
sort of maturation of the computer the
maturation of the computer is really
coming down to these two architectures
and I believe these two architectures
x86 and arm will prevail for really all
time so this is my kind of funny diagram
to introduce you know what I think
happens the atom is the low the low end
of the Intel the xenon is the high end
arm is coming up and we're number one in
enterprise arm we sold a billion ARM
cores last year Qualcomm and us are the
two leaders in producing arm-based
semiconductor products Qualcomm does
cell phones and tablets and these things
so do we but we are the first to
actually take the arm and say hey let's
apply that to enterprise computing or
cloud computing so I think it ends again
with an intel marvel picture long term
so i want to introduce what i call and
this is the end of my vision is era of
efficiency I think we can all understand
this because it's really starting to
happen the cost of energy is rising and
we see it rising pretty much without
bound slow and steady but rising and
what I've drawn here is I've said hey
nature is going to reward only the most
efficient anything or any human system
or that's social engineering it needs to
be hyper efficient or it'll be naturally
pruned and i'm showing water droplets
here which when they drop naturally take
on the shape of what I have this is that
air force drop tank from the 50s which
is what you put gasoline in for planes
and so nature wins is my message and
nature is balanced and nature is
efficient and if you apply these systems
to cloud computing and data centers then
you'll have the most scalability
possible for the same amount of energy
that you put in so what we know in
trends is that it's it's crazy five
percent of all the electricity the
United States is now consumed by data
centers both private and public data
centers this is profound if you think
about it right you think about all those
high tension
is that you see in five percent of them
were going right into computers and you
know artificial intelligences here right
our whole trading system are flash
trading on Wall Street are two computer
programs that are adaptive they're
writing their own code and they're
attacking each other and the output is
game theory for money right so what we
have is we have this intense curve we
don't know what it looks like but we
know that it's ramping and we know that
the real bottleneck is not our desire to
compute or applications to compute we
know that the problem is actually the
power itself and so this is the impetus
and this is what's driving this
revolution for more balanced and I
believe arm-based cores for compute so I
want to focus on the public cloud at
Marvel we say there's a home cloud
there's a there's a mobile cloud there's
a private cloud and there's a public
cloud I want to focus on public cloud
and sort of tell you how I think that
fits in you know of course you've got
your home in your residential you got
your small businesses you have your
traditional enterprise we sometimes we
call that private cloud and you have
some sort of internet connection which
is going you which is traditional so
it's fiber or its copper DSL or pawn or
traditional traditional pots and stuff
and and then you have of course all
these mobile devices and they're
connected also to now this public cloud
concept of this data center and what is
this well this is a natural shift this
is a natural shift of things being
stored locally or on the edges and in
computing that stationary going mobile
so so so storage at the edge like in
your home or in your physical device or
at your laptop is migrating towards this
Center shared resource and if you think
about it what is a shared resource it's
efficient so we're naturally waxing and
waning now what we're waning towards
centralization that's what the cloud is
it's taking everything where we can
share the resource and what we know
about the cloud is that we can scale it
up and down dynamically based on our
needs in fact we could even rent or
temporarily use those resources and so
it's very elastic and it
matches our elastic economics model very
very well supplying two men very well so
this is what's happening and Marvel is
number one in rotating media and storage
and so we see where are we selling our
hard drives we're going to sell our hard
drives in the cloud where are the
highest value transistor is going to be
toggling doing work in the cloud so it's
shareable it's scalable it's practically
unlimited because of that that
elasticity and of course since we're all
putting efficient processors than
they're efficient storage and efficient
networking now we're going to the total
cost of ownership for for for everybody
is lowest right and this is this trend
is unstoppable because it's driven i
believe by nature saying it's time to be
efficient if you want infinite compute
you want infinite storage you want
infinitely connections between
everything you're going to have to start
centralizing them and sharing them
there's another trend to point out
that's driving this this this whole
cloud and that is structured data going
to unstructured data that's what this
graph shows the structured data is in
blue and the unstructured data is in
this ugly hello and what you see is the
unstructured data is just coming up well
what's unstructured data that's the way
the common person uses storage I have a
audio file i drag it to a folder i have
a document i store it on my hard drive I
don't think about it's not a database
that structured that I'm inputting I
don't have a report input forms okay
it's music so it goes here and then it's
all categorized it's very random it's
very unstructured and we have to
understand that this trend profoundly
affects the the kind of storage that
we're doing the kind of compute the
workloads that we have all of a sudden
things like Google and search engines
and these kind of things are looking at
the unstructured data and being able to
find it and mine it so so this is a
trend that I don't know if it's good or
bad sometimes I think it's bad it means
we're all just storing tons of stuff and
we don't know where it is but the
reality is it's upon us and when we look
at this what you really need is all
these little processors that have real
good storage pipes their networks very
very efficiently and they just have
enough compute to store this kind of
capability you also need super powerful
computers to search and find all that
data where we're focused in my company
is definitely reducing the amount of
processing increasing the amount of
network increasing the amount of storage
so processing comes down and the
networking and the storage is balanced
and this is to try absolutely to match
with this demand coming out of nowhere
so where do all of the costs come from
the data center this is a study that
that we did where we basically look at
okay for a standard data center the way
it's constructed today where are the
costs right so the actual server itself
is very expensive the system power is
eleven percent of the cost cooling power
is another 11 so the power to cool and
the power to power the system are that
are the same that's very interesting
right and I don't know if you've ever
been in a data center but they're very
loud that I and it's cold thank you know
and it's just row after row of boxes
right 19-inch telco boxes and then the
space look at this the space is eighteen
percent this is 11 sorry about the fine
eleven that's twenty-two percent of the
cost is the power and the compute sorry
the cooling and almost the same amount
is the real estate this is a u.s. model
so it depends where you are in the US
but this is us model and then actually
the server itself they're constantly
swapping them out and it's expensive
right so if you can get the total cost
of the actual server space and real
estate and everything down that's the
biggest chunk but power is substantial
as this say its twenty two percent so if
you can save a fifth you know if your
processor does the same work for a fifth
of power and that's that's what our
exact product we have out now is its
one-fifth of power you're taking you
know five percent of the overall cost
out just off the top by that processor
out um good that's pretty much the
summary
this is what i think is evolving this is
what I'm witnessing you had discrete
processing and then you went to a
virtualization model that's very very
important especially how it ties in with
Oracle you know this is what people do
today they have one process this is a
processor with a colored workload
processor with a colored workload over
here we're saying hey there's more
processing per processor and we're going
to do multiple operating systems right
we're going to virtualize what I think
is coming is a completely different
approach where you have very very small
processors with balanced processing
Network and storage and you just have
many many more times right now these can
also be virtualized okay so it can get
crazy you can ask there's actually kind
of a fourth evolution where now these
little processors may virtualize they
may not virtualize you know 5 10 20 30
times they memorized once or twice but
the point is is that they already are
busy all the time the reason that you
virtualize is that you have a processor
that's so powerful it's sitting around
doing nothing and wif it's going to do
nothing you go ahead and you have other
other contexts and other virtualization
to get the efficiency up getting all the
resources working as you bring the
processing down in balance with the
networking and the storage you get into
a model a model like this and I'll show
you some density because the other piece
that we haven't talked about is if you
make these processors small they don't
need big heat sinks they don't need big
power supplies you can get a lot more of
them in the same physical physical area
and remember you know the floor space
itself you know space and management
eighteen percent so you you you have a
lot to be gained you want to fully use
your real estate this is just
summarizing what I'm saying that the old
world has got giant giant
high-performance processors which you
really want is performance per dollar
performance for wat and performance per
area and so we call this the performance
trap because when we look into cars we
look into everything we're always
looking for performance performance
performance how fast can go zero to 60
you know how many
how many d myths can I do you know not
per watt but just total in a chip or in
a server and this isn't really the story
it's you need this ratio efficiency is
not sexy it's not fun to think about in
it just ends up winning it just ends up
being the most important thing in the
end so what we need is we need the
performance per dollar because that's
one measure of efficiency we need
performance per watt which is also
converts to dollars because power is the
real bottleneck and then you have
performance per inch which is very very
important and is actually to be honest
it's just driven by Moore's lot we get a
certain amount of transistors per year
so this is what I want to point out just
to final appetite introducing some
workloads right it's like we believe
that that this product we've built which
we call the armada XP we believe that
it's perfect for Hadoop type structures
for memory caching because your memory
is always always always busy you don't
have any idle and big data analytics and
mobile analytics and of course web
front-end in fact one of the one of the
things that we've done and all I think
it's right here yeah this is an example
of an arm-based server so you have a
seven-foot telco rack with 19 inches of
usable space you can fit 12 of these
systems in this box and you can get 12
blades and every blade has one two three
four of our processors on it and for
hard drives okay this shows an example
of one of the chips and each chip has
ABC or four processors okay so you can
jam just literally thousands of these
cores in a 7-foot rack as composed to as
compared to the traditional type compute
where the processor is very powerful and
there's less of them what this means is
the total amount of I ops on hard drives
or I ops on networking goes up it means
that you have more i/o happening and you
have more processors but each one is not
as powerful so if you think about how
many har
drives you get in here with four per
blade 12 / and how many actual cores
it's it's very its many times more maybe
10 times more processors and it's five
times the total performance for in this
particular example PHP session so web
front-ends so if you run apache on this
our our claim is that you have a twenty
twenty cents per month Go Daddy I don't
know if you know godaddy.com but it's
this is basically it takes the 79 sent a
decent godaddy model and brings it right
down to 20 you know 25 cents to twenty
cents a month depending on how much
storage also what you notice is this
bowl board right here is is 45 watts and
and you know the hard drives themselves
actually end up into burning almost the
same amount of power so you're you're
really bringing and balancing the amount
of power per processor / network to the
to the hard drive now we also i'll show
you these are just so you can see some
more pictures and how they plug in here
is a really this is the latest one this
is that same board but better picture
but now we've put solid-state memory and
so now you have a very of performance
now where the I op operations for the
storage complex are a thousand times
faster than the hard drive version so
your storage goes down quite a bit you
know you know four terabytes or so
whereas you know the other one is a
little bit a little bit more than that
max but you have ridiculous performance
and now you get into transactional
servers and if you want to do something
like manage and handle the kind of
requests and grants that you get out of
a Twitter or some large social network
now this is where we're going to come in
in fact what we learned is we've got to
up upgrade the card now to 10 10 gig to
fully keep up with the I apso so this is
this is a state-of-the-art example of a
super super low power super high
performance arm arm blade computer and
that's the first arm blade computer that
in the world by the way nobody else has
arm for enterprise that's in mass
production yet except for us we expect
to have around six competitors by q2
next year so you're going to see a large
large
increase in in that this is another
example of an arm-based server it's
actually just this section here these
are all hot swappable paddles that can
put in either solid state hard drive or
arm processors this is an example of a
very very small card it's about that big
and that shows our arm symmetric
multiple arm processor and we're putting
the DRAM directly on the board the
reason you do this is these can now
become little paddles in a very very
dense compute so I'll give you an
example an x86 blade looks like this and
you can see the D Rams here and you can
see the actual processor here and the
cooling this is an example of taking the
blades i showed you from before and
jamming them in you can you can get we
calculate we can get 6,000 arm cores in
a in a 7-foot rack with this oh that's a
that's a great that's a green point the
chip we have out now that we can talk
about is a 32-bit or 64-bit interface
and it will run it at 16 800 double
clock Joe so 1600 and and the clock
speed of the processors there's four of
them on the die is 1.6 gig so it matches
nicely so an hour DRAM IP that we're
talking about now is 1600
this is a this is a this particular
product is called the Armada XP and it
is it is really the first arm
implementation of an enterprise class
product so you have everything from you
know all the ECC protections will sell
them in I tip all kinds of things that
you traditionally wouldn't bother with
right and the bus structures inside the
chip are very fast the the number of
stories we have a PCF for pcie
controllers that are by eight MIT I
think it can do this chips like 58 wats
but it can do 10 gig of throughput
there's a full layer to layer three
ethernet acceleration and load balancing
so yeah very very it's a server on a
chip literally everything this is
another example of the first this is I
believe the first commercially available
one are you server they say that eighty
percent of all data centers are still
one are you servers probably because the
low barrier to entry and this particular
shows this module very similar the one I
showed you before a bit different and
they plugged these modules into this
board so depending on how much
horsepower you want you plug in more
boards and again yeah that's available
available now this is um this is the
most exciting thing I can show you today
and I think this is going to change the
world what this is is this is this is a
product that we worked with a Taiwanese
manufacturer called win-win and it's the
densest storage appliance in the world
and the way it became dense is we didn't
have to allocate power or board area to
larger more complex processors so the
amount of integration that we had with
our own storage controller IP our own
networking IP and our processor allowed
us to build this very very small board
this boards about this big in real in
real life and these are five and a
quarter drives so you have six one two
three four five six I've taken this
shelf out and put it on the top so you
can see it if you're twenty four or five
and a quarter hard drives in a tu ru
form factor
and on the back you can't see it but the
back is our networking and we have dual
10 gig networking this box is exciting
for us because we own a hundred percent
of the silicon and one hundred percent
of the silicon is mass in mass
production that means that you can
generate these in very very very very
high volumes right now and this is
exactly designed for what we call big
data or cold storage for unstructured
data and all these are hot-swappable
there's redundant on the power supply
and we we have are what we call
programmable Ethan it in the back so
that we can actually program any
forwarding plane paradigm for any
networking as long as it's ethernet
standard out so this is exciting and I
this whole to are you is only 300 watts
and I'll tell you how this started I was
you know I was in China and I was at a
public cloud customer and I walk into
their data center and their racks are
only full this high so you walk into a
dataset of the u.s. it's loud and it's
noisy and but I walk in and it's just
the racks are empty I'm like oh okay
you're still you're still building
everything and why you're building it
all at the same time I couldn't figure
it out and they're like no no we only
have two point seven to 3.3 kilowatts
per per tile and this is all we can put
in and I'm like well I can fix that
right and so a year later and that's a
couple months ago we we brought up these
we sold them eighty thousand of these
and now you can fill a rack so it's
pretty pretty exciting it's pretty
exciting stuff so it's somewhere around
a 2x of what's about to come out with
the x86 based storage appliance anyway I
can't I can't say enough about this
because it's so I'm so proud to be at a
sippy conductor company that owns all
the silicon because it's a big deal and
and and Marvel started this whole
process way before I joined but it's
exciting because wherever we sell these
none of my competitors will even know
there's something happening because the
hard drive people are our best friends
because we're number one in hard drive
controllers and nothing else shows up
typically in semiconductors you we could
tell what each other are doing because
we'll get
design went on a board and then we'll
know what the volume is this is
literally off the radar anywhere we sell
these my competitors will never even
know it's happening we are in a
long-term relationship with a boon to we
just signed up for what's called
long-term support for five years so we
have a mature operating system that is
enterprise class and this is also the
first you know this is you can run the
same operating system on x86 products of
course as well but this is a really big
accomplishment because it really means
you can build a system that's enterprise
or carrier-class the software ecosystems
the most important thing I'm a hardware
persons I've been focusing on that but
it's the most important thing and I just
want to say you can run oracle java
right now on our products and we're
entering into a partnership right now
we're we're doing certain optimizations
for certain workloads we haven't decided
all the workloads but they're what we're
likely to look at optimizing for Hadoop
together and that I'm that's at an
advanced stage and I'm confident that
we'll go forward together I mean
Oracle's the best and also the canonical
I just mentioned and red hat now is also
moving to so read ad actually as of two
weeks ago has like 40 of my servers and
they've got a fedora on it and Fedora is
the same actually as red hat red hat the
difference is the support level so I
expect this time next year I'll have red
hat on our products as well us again oh
this is this is soft yeah that's a good
question
yeah absolutely a job to be really
candid with you and I always would be I
mean we're birthing a market right i
mean there's been an x86 lock for
decades and in order to do that one
company can't do that i mean marvel is
amazing 7,000 people 3.4 billion
blahblahblah you know doing arm for 13
years billion course old a year that's
you know that's a that's one boat of
many that's why we use the word armada
it's not just armada of our products
we're looking for a whole ecosystem of
arm players that are going to become
enterprise-class and you can look for
announcements i mean i'm proud to say
that cavium is going to jump in they've
moved away from mips freescale's got got
everybody's moving now to arm so we're
getting this Armada together to
hopefully again just balance out the
market and i believe yeah i believe
deeply in balance what else do i want to
say oh we tweet linaro is another one
that you'll see from with us click to i
don't know if you know but linaro it is
is providing a service for enterprise
and arms saying hey there'll be all
these different arm players we're going
to make sure that there's can be one
distribution for the Canonical's and the
red hats at least it with canonical I
you will see us optimizing for our
specific our way you will you'll see
that first because they were our first
partner so I wanted to summarize by
saying you know I mean I am here to say
there is an armed revolution I am here
to save Marvel's leading it isn't
speculation we just happen to be the
first out in production and why you can
you can look to us and say hey that that
companies got it together is this real
Trinity that we have you know we have
third generation network processors and
traffic managers which are what you need
for load balancing these data centers we
have fifth-generation arm core secondary
symmetric arm core we have the fastest
clock speeds of arm we built our own arm
cores that are instructions that
compatible so we're able to outperform
the standard arm offering we actually do
both but every generation we decide and
then we also have seventh going to
eighth generation q1 extra ethernet
which is you know very very exciting in
terms of of most of the interconnect
and then tenth generation storage
controllers a number one in storage so
I'm you know with that I wanted to try
to just have some dialogue with you guys
about what you're interested in and I'm
on the front lines trying to make this
all happen is there anything I can
explore answer with you yeah yeah sure
we very much yeah we're actually my same
business unit I'm doing I was pitching
more the enterprise class stuff today is
number one in network attached storage
in general so yeah we have single core
processors that are in the nausea
forty-two forty-three percent of the
nasm archit almost any nas you buy is
going to probably have have our product
in it yeah so and the answer is there
they range from 200 dollars up to a
thousand like you can get a for a
thousand it's a nicer one right but yeah
yeah most of the time you'll get it's
it's really a us motorola or freescale
us free scale and up try think of the
other one the yeah yeah ti yeah exactly
uh-huh it what if you ever want to get a
whole if you just want to get a single
board computer with these kind of
products on it you can just email me
I'll send you a couple because I be the
amount of processing per dollar and per
watt that we're offering these things
it's it's it's really exciting if you're
an embedded designer I was a better
designer for many years it's so there
are a couple single board computers out
there one of them is by a little company
and main called cogent and then there's
also a German company trying to think
the name of them are out but that you
can start to get these now I mean
there's tons of arms out there you can
program but if you really want to get
you know to gigger two gigahertz and
this kind of stuff and all this fancy
networking all on the same chip we're
kind of the only game in town right now
what else anything else interesting it
do you know why
why why did you come to you was there
something you wanted to specifically
know sure
oh I kick I think I can give it to you
I'm real careful you know just I just
who knows where the slides go but 25,500
d MIPS in a 12 watt envelope is is one
is one is is the we turn turn the clock
up that's that's yeah that's it so at
1.6 gig let me give you a real number if
you want to write them down 1.6 gig is
about 9 watt and that's 1600 600d mips
so there's the numbers and that chip can
range in cost it's about eighty dollars
for that chip I think that's all your
metrics and then if you go start looking
at the the the competition's that'll be
exciting I mean this is this little
product I mean I'm not doing a product
pitch today but it's called the Armada
XP Armada extreme performance Armada
comes from wanting to have a giant
coalition of arm products by us and
others that can balance Intel but the
Armada XP is in mass production and is
is a pretty amazing product it's the
most efficient processor the most deem
it's per watt of any chip that's ever
been built by humankind actually and
that's just half the story because
that's you know there's so much more
capability in there with the networking
and everything else is that it has in a
seventh-generation ethernet networking
built-in so most processors sit here and
then there's companion chips that
connect through pcie and then allow you
to do whatever you're going to do we put
really everything for a full
enterprise-class server on on a you know
on a chip where the die is the size of
your of your fingernail and this means
things like if you're only going to turn
the clock down to burn 5 watt 6 watts
turn the clock up it'll build you know
10 to 12 watts you can adjust how you
run them and then do you don't have
these big heat sinks that are expensive
you don't have fans on top of the heat
sinks you know you can you can just pack
of you know lots and lots of them in a
very small unit volume software wise
there's a lot of
applications that you can just run right
because the whole open community or or
or not but they're all available right
so with the aboon to canonical OSU just
you can literally run whatever you want
right on top of these things we sell
eval boards too if you want to get
yourself you know this go back to this
little picture here we we took this this
is a connector we took this disconnected
this and folded them and we sell them in
a box so you can get a little quad core
with networking with storage in a box as
a reference system they're not cheap
because they're designed for developers
that are not designed for for mass use
if you want to just get a single chip as
cheap as possible we have a whole
infrastructure called plug computing
it's the plug gorg or plug computer org
both those will work and we sell a whole
computer with an arms shipment it for
ninety nine dollars quantity one so yeah
yeah well there's like three generations
of them now a Shiva was the but yeah the
Shiva plug was the first yeah we do we
do have an armada XP plug now absolutely
absolutely if ya if you have any my
email by the way is just Ted at Marvel
so if you want to follow up with me just
I got a card too if you want but I can
help you get through any of the Marvel
what do you call it labyrinth if you
don't have any questions that's that's
all i have for you yeah no hurry
oh you could hear you could you could
yeah you could you could the answer as
you can so yeah the answer is you can do
that why did we specifically do this
this design is actually del so you'd
have to ask them why they wanted to do
it this way right i think the modularity
i think yeah uh the physical interface i
don't know i don't yeah so so so we we
have controllers I don't you can see
this but these are the SSD modules these
are connected these are controllers also
by marvel this takes pcie and actually
drives it right so these i think this is
something we call fray is the code name
fray so I mean that that's this and this
is very high performance that way
because you have a fan out you have a
fan out right the if you take one of
these each chip can drive too but as you
see there's a lot more than two per
processor so we have a fan like a muxing
or a fanning out there yeah cool isn't
that cool ah that's super cool huh where
do you work okay great yeah no problem
we're yet perfect perfect we're trying
to work with you right now because I
want to put Hadoop on here so yeah all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
