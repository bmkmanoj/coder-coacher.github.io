Oracle and I have with me Diane and
Shawn from AI solutions hi Dan
hi Shawn hi Russian so tell me more
about their solutions what do you guys
do we provide services for the space
industry we do spacecraft navigation
trajectory design and launch services
for NASA the air force and commercial
space that's right and it takes many
forms we have commercial products that
are used for simulations we do a lot of
custom software development for our
ground systems and we also do a lot of
data computational services that's great
so let's talk about what you built in
the cloud well it starts with one of our
more recent commercial products called
the deep-space trajectory explore the
deep-space trajector Explorer is a Java
fix application which visually allows
the user to design spacecraft
trajectories to distant targets such as
Saturn and Jupiter and whatnot it does
this by taking allowing the user to
specify a lot of the parameters of the
design space and it sends it in our
architecture up to services that are
running in the Oracle cloud
infrastructure which then computes and
then returns the results back and I use
this tool down at Johnson Space Center
where we're designing the next
generation of manned missions to the
moon and beyond and I'm using the tool
to design transfers in between lunar
orbits and other trajectories in the
earth-moon system
well next man to moon mission that's
exciting it's quite complicated and the
data design space is very dense okay and
so that's where bare the bare metal
services that we've we've employed so
far have really helped so here's how it
works
the JavaFX client allows a user to
specify the parameters around the design
space now all those parameters taking
into account create a very large dense
data space this is a very sensitive
design space we're a tiny little change
to your initial state or to your
manoeuvre it creates a huge change
downstream so it's really hard to design
these orbits yeah so it's not only
critical that we we sample all the space
but we have a very precise sampling
which it means a very even more data so
those parameters are sent from the deep
space trajectory Explorer through a
remote function gateway that is provided
via gluon cloud link and that runs on
Oracle accs that remote function then
forwards the parameters to what a
basically arrest service which is
running in the Oracle cloud
infrastructure in this case it's running
on an Oracle bare-metal standard
compute instance with block storage and
we utilize a 72 core 500 gigabyte
footprint now that's really important
because we often with a lot of our
scenarios have to compute over a million
different trajectories and we have to
then turn around and filter those sort
filter and return just the top 10 or the
top 50 to the client and then I don't
have to manually dig through all these
millions of solutions I can look only at
the top ones that already satisfy my
mission constraints right and the best
part is that the the high-performance
that comes with a Oracle bare-metal
compute instance it allows us to do all
that in seconds and then return those
results to any type of client this has
allowed us to not only have our job
effects visuals on the desktop but we've
begun porting those Java effects visuals
to mobile devices such as tablets that's
very very exciting well thank you so
much for sharing with us what you built
in the cloud it's our pleasure thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
