talking about testing here today you
sure you get the right room right
testing no development testing right so
this is me Sherrod I work on different
technical aspects of testing Java Java
effects right so in particular the UI
testing is my the automated UI testing
it's my baby so I will be showing what
kind of tools we have told her for you
guys to but I make your testing
basically in a nutshell that's what it
is right this is usual stuff don't
believe whatever I say then going on
this is an important disclaimer though
it seems to me relevant we are
developers so the best way we are to our
team qualitative the best way to test
and the only way to test Java or simpler
or NetBeans where FX is to use it
meaning to develop applications with
right hence very developer and then its
place why we have tools right it's
relatively easy for us to have to
develop our own tools and that's what we
do and it displays what kind of tools we
have now I will be talking a little bit
as to how test lives how to create it
how to study the UI for a test creation
how to write it in source code how to
record and play what it how to be more
coding and then some other stuff such as
how to deal with images and how to do
this native UI so this life lifecycle is
a little bit different than any other
software life cycle test is a unit which
is designed to be able to use it
repeatedly and report the status right
paw software as simple as that that's
what we call test at least the terminal
interpreted differently and so an
important thing here is that you develop
it once and use a hearing aid and every
once in a while
it fails right it fails because the
product changes I mean it's normal and
you have to figure out whether this at
this problem or a problem a product
problem and then after proprietary so
the least support for test code is what
what's important that's what's driving
talking actually
so these are the tools which we use we
use a couple of tools for it to explore
you I actually noticed this is needed
for us to be able to create the test
bowl then we don't use recording but I'm
gonna show whatever we have in this
right anyway we don't because remember
we're developers it for us it's faster
to use code completion and that means
they are a tool right then of course
there's the drive error which simulates
user actions such as cleaning scroll it
type in whatever people then there are
test harnesses this is an important
subject for pretty boring and then there
is a much more should you be needing to
use images in your testing for not
problems right and then tested only be
of course and then that means IDE for us
that's the tool to use
so first of all how do we how do we
explore how application is built right I
have very simple application right here
which is basically a file browser and I
can execute it in a second so what I'm
gonna create I'm gonna create a package
call it test right I'm gonna create a
new file with it new Java class call it
longship this is a source tree launcher
right
freedom bank was here and from from from
this thing I want to run the DUI which
I'm going to test that's gonna be up
executor come on computer use echidna
blog and the main class of the
application happened to be named main
okay yeah so this is this is just the
application of diffusion this is not
interesting so now I can I see run
another tool which is called browser
start around Ground Zero and yes it's
through some application identity
exception if this is written is the GG
long ago so this is the application
which with a my plan is write this as a
simple file browser it could do inside
directory it could go back there are
history show fight in files and that
table with that this is it this is a
test application Chen can you be using
for test you I'm gonna resize this guide
and then keep it fresh now so this is a
scene right
obviously it has V box within it it has
four they're playing well similar to see
if you write but they existed long
before Szigeti so it's
excuse it is actually I will talking
about where it resides then there is a
button textual comic books very very
clear what it is right then there is
this guy and that's what we actually
have in the applications we don't know
who that is right what it is it looks
like a table well it is a table and if
you go within it testable your skin
which is probably problem means it is a
table but if we can do better than that
for testing we have this page which
basically says where it's going from so
it extends type of you it is a type of
you will is the Jimmy interfaces for
this table M select something
to box so check box is selected bullet
has values and also show properties at
those properties which we can use in
testing that this isn't these are
properties of controls there's a
properties of our tool in right very
similar we can use scenic view right I'm
just gonna run it this is the pretty
similar in functionality application
coming from our controls development
team and our networks the difference is
it is written in effects and effects
with effects and - it could actually
change the changes in Prague
so if I select radio button and I change
the style plus William okay it's gonna
be different
it should be different work right it
doesn't work it changed right so I wanna
be talking about the called about scenic
view you can try it yourself it's
available as well as it appears the
browser control
okay now now go back to my slides so
this was good browser or this was thank
you we do this to understand how the UI
is built from what pieces right now this
is just exploratory part now we need to
create some tests
this is fairly easy again with no means
I'm going to create an eye test and test
package right I'm gonna create a new
g-unit test we're going to be using two
unit right now I'll talk about it later
a test right so first you need to do I
need to write start application which
you which we already know how to do it
just copy this line
all right right I don't need this one
yes yes right so so we hit the scene
right on the screen we take the name of
the whatever we had on the screen and it
don't work do AC Depot seek aid or the
name is silly I know but it turned out
to be this way and it's too late to
change scene
this is gonna be new scene dog so there
are a bunch of contractors so these
constructors look for a scene actually
not to look but wait for it seem to be
there for the scene performing for a
system saying I'm for mental criteria
which is apply it could be title but we
woke up criteria it could be in this it
could be nothing right like we have one
scene right now so that's good a little
bed bed line with we'll wait for a sin
to appear on screen now we have a text
field there which is dead simple control
doc right field
you text input control duck again we're
gonna within this scene for it
sin is pardons just just what feel proud
and we're gonna click three taps on its
so we're select all the text using mouse
click three times as simple as that but
you may be asking so this is very simple
code right and this is these are all the
separations why should I even bother
writing this code it could be generated
speak yeah and so there is the concept
of record and replay so basically you
run your UI for those of you haven't
heard about it you run your UI almost
normally perform some actions then hits
a magic button those actions are
magically written into some file and
some format and then just you put it
into test harness and then do go go home
take a nap or something and it's writing
for you without your participation this
is good looks good except has problems
of course it's easy in first create such
thing right no coding skills needed but
wait a minute
what if the UI is responsible for
database update how you gonna from you
are from recording play but if right
that the database is updated right your
file created a file system basically in
most cases it doesn't require if a tool
is smart it doesn't require that
whatever however smarter they tool is
right there are cases when you need to
replace something extras such as in our
file browser we would people to find
that the number of files and tape you
and the names of files on a table even
appropriate right it's hard to do it
through life you could go to some other
dialer and check that works such as with
database update but it's not a smart
idea
and the high maintenance cost so the
terms in which the each which in which
the tests are written is important
because that basically dictates how
often you will not be needing to change
that code and I have this article which
I was told came out nice so go read it
basically it I wrote a few years ago it
basically says how they deport that play
in my view should be done and fits the
way we're approaching okay and it's
positive it's not negative it basically
tells how it should be done versus why
not to do it though this way first right
so in something we are not full with the
area but we have something I'm going
back to my code to my luncheon code
I gotta be it they do not mind which is
why it's this constructor start
executing yet again we cannot give the
application in our window solution right
so first and first in our application
what we want to do is we want to type a
new location right I'm my mom's here and
it must go in town and hit a magic
combination complex ship see right now
so what I see right here is that we're
gonna be we're going to be finding a sin
right we're going to be looking for it
by a title title might change if we go
to a now director not a smart idea but
they just pick any sin right then we're
gonna be looking for a text field right
again text gonna change so just to be me
I'll be talking about you pretty related
another examples right then we're gonna
double click tip up later
that's how far we got this you need to
do many so we're going to use text input
control as Mouse
we're gonna click three times okay now
what what I do is this stuff now we save
it into a file first let me do it for me
test test right it's going to be that
means g-unit Oh g-unit I'll play the
difference between any sip of this so
what do we have so far it's real easy to
it so we gonna save it into it while
okay that's cool she would be dead work
so this is reunited and then it's the
difference between Athens GA meon our
simple GA so I'm using that means folks
here to find to hide the actual right
first and first way to start application
into it right whatever you know how to
do that let's just copy this line
yes right now it's like now what so I'll
change the source code I cannot save it
right and it sorts good gonna be source
code cannot be rewritten
well no of course not I shouldn't say
that we actually dealing with that
nicely right now so what I want to do is
I wanna type myself what I'm going to
it's gonna be pissed
Dita right well I'm how to do next again
item instead of this yes I not step I'll
say that we can I use text input control
is selection text and I cannot type
value
I'm a Linux user right is carpet they
have some backslash is just a couple of
days to go for the deal test that yeah
and then what we want to do is we want
to click on folder one double click on
folder one to move into it I'm hitting
the magic combination right and we can
test that this file appears here so I'm
gonna hit me magic combination again
this is relating to them except I didn't
do double
I'm a step we're gonna use the list item
notice that we're going to be using the
list item so this is an object we're
gonna be treating it as a mouse and then
I think we can write 2 times okay now
the quota issue written vs. still here
and actually on the collision is written
between steps it's going to be here and
this the is surrounded by comments
things going to be replaced
this is this code is not going to work
because I made a mistake on purpose
I didn't do and I didn't push enter okay
you could do that through you through
the UI as well but I was going to show
what happens with this face yes
so you got an exception
tomorrow's by exception subject so let
me do bleep right here
oh I was going to push enter sorry
Siebert push T there is an endo
okay right so that's pretty much what
week that except we have a property
verification part so you could add an
hour step and say you cannot verify of
the text input controls that you the
position or it takes that's the two
properties it has right and enter value
you've ever used okay to leave this one
so going back to slides so this
constructor what we can do right now we
can record and replay lookup right in
your HR code we ready our call
appropriately only this table shows in
you can see any information that the
comments supportive G you need some
pertinent means so what we are going to
be able to do we're going to be able to
lower the thing back and this is gonna
be a few days of work because it was
written which there the minor things
over the course which it's not gonna be
too hard to recording recognize not only
little cup information but also he
actually action that may take some time
to implement right tezcan G support this
cleared is just another example their
own integrate risk we browser another
natural to be to want to select a
control input browser as you see of
properties you see all the way out to
see all the hierarchy instead of moving
a mouse on a real UI you would want to
select the pier obviously Eclipse
support I tried really quick I didn't
find a way to implement false then
Eclipse maybe I'm missing something
obvious
so a Eclipse user side in fact and
netbeans plugin integration so when that
means you develop effects vacations
right we would we're thinking about
putting the accordion data as well once
it was completed so the comparables
record and replay when it will have it
through recording first initial creation
yes Napoleon skewness simple cases yes
low penances considers proper playing so
the whole thing is written pluggable so
FX support is actually applied in
to the core of recoil and it's not to be
going while actually
so welcome in Tibet I was doing it this
way
boy I've missed Liam less but I was
doing it right it is flexible as you can
add your own code but they are plugin
maintenance and as we try it we try to
implement this thing for an NP and so
years ago the apply in maintenance takes
a lot so basically you have to develop
your application in terms of your two
main model its library source or test
library in terms of the domain model and
not about that you have to implement UI
for that library it's hard it takes a
lot so Ofra NetBeans we were developers
and so we just rotated after playing
again this article pretty much explains
now Jamie effects the source code which
was there is written with jimmy effects
if you Jimmy Fox is a java library it's
not a product it's not a tool it's the
test harness its jaw library which
allows to simulate user input it is on
open JDK under open GFX it based on
Jamie for such thing as Jamie core who
supports which are effects what is Jamie
poor so the core is a UI library testing
sorry
yes you want any library you ice testing
library which basically does no anything
in particular about any particular
library so I'm going to show some
pictures which may explain that stuff it
has its own API for lookups for control
interfaces we've seen as selectable
Mouse those are control interfaces it
has support for properties and some
other stuff so Jamie pores syntax yes a
little bit which is just one simple ice
right here when I'm you're looking for a
simple control right right here when I
was what I was would be doing if I would
be using JIRA core syntax I would say
you know sorry
root
it's v-0 v-0 lookup force in my criteria
will be cut just anywhere phone you are
seen as parent is this the right parent
I'm sorry yeah this this is a Jamie
parent and again it existed before
JavaFX sorry s parent our four dollars
I'm sorry yes and then again hook up and
here tips bill and criteria for text
field which could be anything
yeah which basically implement a bullet
method which tells whether this is the
control they are looking for or not
there are of course criteria followed by
text by led by these by that there is a
criteria called any and stuff like that
so a little bit clumsy at the end at the
end huh at the end you will say begin as
say word text and this is again Jamie
text and you would say type
more what
I don't know any less were supposed to
be adamant so it looks a little bit more
clumsy it's possible to use but Jimmy
effects its stuff on it which allows
things to work better so in a way you
could use a real think of Jimmy Torres
of stencil right that's the word I
looked up in a dictionary with the holes
cut right so it is its shape it can
function but doesn't know many things so
in particular it does know how to
operate mobs now we have an
implementation for Mouse based on a
nobility Mouse right which can move
generate native events except the
delimitation doesn't know how to get
coordinates of effects now so it has a
little hole within it itself the ADA
would imagine right so there is stuff
how to throw a scrollbar right how to
get children of a parent when in effect
hierarchy all that is not known to check
before all that is provided later
provided by Jamie effects which defines
how to get scenes notes how to get items
so for this title or a text field or
sort of a table were three how to get
organized how to draw a strobe are the
actual scrolling is again implemented
endemic or or Jim FS specifies as
WordPress the mouse and how far to move
it for how long but provides a condition
is actually to which to satisfy which
this thing needs to be moved and stuff
like that get take stuff levels of
course stuff I read there's all
implemented and jemmye effects so we
take the it stencil we flipping the
pieces and that's the gem effects okay
you don't need to know all that
complexity is behind this in parentheses
so as far as Jim effects support going
going on sorry JavaFX support going on
Oh Jimmy effects support transformations
so that they are transparent to this so
you can take the tree view you can flip
it
whatever use transformation and effects
applied to it and then call a method
expanding a note it will click in the
right place
so however its transformative as well
animation is hard because basically you
have to replicate the animation logic on
the side and hard there there is some
support in Jamie but it's general 3d was
just thinking about it I don't even know
how much we need what we need in API to
click on 3d position I don't know maybe
so two things I wanted to show here a
little bit about Jennifer's first of all
and that's where the odium comes out
right first of all we ever find that
there is a particular item in the list
that's not enough we want to check that
there are two files one is named this
way and the other was named this way it
would be proper testing right so we want
to do assert no no asserts in do not
working that view is Malaysia because
everything in UI takes time so you put a
search here and some woman this is gonna
fail because the things just didn't
happen right away okay so we need to put
the waiting here there is a for support
for this which is gonna be so v5 so
rocks are are actually baby level API
genacore and canopy the is trying to
propagate everything into talk about not
everything yet I gotta say wait state
identify state
into sure well for simplicity I'll just
check the number of the items okay just
to save time there's gonna be two items
right and here your return v6 control
which is chipped but is usually of
another 56 five days before control
which is ListView right get items and
this is not right either why because
this code is not an event view so you
would need another runnable and start
but there are shortcuts to that so you
could see if I ever get items so this is
executed on back to you the intern
internally it has the same stuff right
so it does so when you type a text in a
text field the type method only returns
after the tips is there in this
particular case it waits until the
events are delivered but then there is
an event listener which cannot generate
some maybe or fly lower they content of
the directory and that's an application
logic that's not UI library logic right
so if possibly a Jamie could not
possibly know that
after clicking on folder one they gotta
get two items in the in a list okay and
that's where this the JaMychal contains
all this stuff whatever is possible
within it so selecting when they select
an item it waits for it to be selected
when the type of takes it waits for a
text to be there but in this particular
case it doesn't know it could not
possibly know what to expect so I'm
refine how many items is analysts after
I
sir entered a directory very composite
but it's a good question anyway and
stuff like that and now we're talking to
sustainability right this test is not
sustainable so should there should
should just feel better place by a
combobox it's gonna fail and you you
assumed to have hundreds of this right
we have products with this so what I'm
going to do go change your other tests
it's easier and less when a caption
changed you just you just go replace all
of them right but with the logic changes
are going to be done so this all code
roughly this should go into a method and
that is possible if you provide applying
it for the test constructor client which
would work in terms of the application
you're tasting it's what I was talking
about it's possible that API is there so
it was Jimmy effects so this tonics
boring part or you don't act there is
g-unit right we use g-unit for this
development honestly but at the same
time we use another farmers which
provides us with exclude lists known
failures it doesn't it's a separate
conversation distributed execution on
top of that so what would you do if a
test files from one platform and doesn't
file on other platforms and the fix
takes all the time right
would you exclude it everywhere that
could be done with g-unit right we don't
want that we don't do it we want to
visit you did where possible hence we
need an extra load list so all folded
for this heavy heavy stuff we use this
one is called JT harness like the
incidents used but it for TCG as well it
is really a pluggable
you insert three pieces into it how do
you find test how to execute test and
how to load a file environment or test
execution interview test script
just fight them okay and and basically
can do whatever you want so in our case
we through the interview define whether
it is gonna be executed in a standalone
application is in general P is an applet
as swing and Harper ability in ISM is
the village interval ability with one
flip the scientists work everywhere so
this is the heavy lifting which we which
we used GT harness for and I've been
running we are we maintain the test
results at the base so we can actually
say whether the failure is the same or
not for the same reason or not okay
I am NOT going to go there now images
better not better not do it at all
because they are really really really
frigidaire platform dependent with the
very sensitive to source code changes
etc etc so if you re using controls
assist in effects controls don't worry
about it we've done it where we have
thousands of images and the database we
have different sets of images for prism
on different platforms for j2t rendering
police upon it without it but if you're
in there something on your own right
you have no choice so let me show how
the tool which is still available how we
do it
this is again part for tooling so I have
a couple of image sample images right
here so this is this is a real image so
this one it says is different it looks
the same
and this is a caller ID Fred it looks
the same it's black it's supposed to do
while these pixels are wrong okay so
what this tool does it allows for you it
hides all the complexity of loading
images processing the information did
you only do what you have to do analyze
the image you can always the source code
you make it
season is this apart or is this not a
part if this is about you hit one button
or it doesn't create parks for you but
it provides a list right then worry you
just hoping the actual image into the
reference say no it's not about it's
okay copy there that's it you hit one
button from the host of an extra to the
next image and four choose to have some
fun I went to Wikipedia and took spot
the difference pictures elevator really
easy right well there are colorful
intended differences here on this
picture
let me show them so for example this pin
green is here have it there is a little
little something which wouldn't be seen
if not for highlight difference right
there are a few white pixels here I'm
sure you can see that the car is almost
white okay they are not too unit and so
you can you can take closer look this
and you can actually select the
comparator you cannot be using so we're
using different algorithms to compare
images peace of mind XO comparison
that's this one or we can say that
number of pieces of percentage of pixels
could go wrong all the color distance
between two images could go wrong color
distance would would be distance between
two points in 3d RGB space and first New
Britain all things thrown in any time so
that's that now there's the question
what if you eye opens native there what
can happen right so we have solution we
have partial solution I will be talking
about other platforms and I said number
four windows we have
there is a simple application which
simply add open Center in debility file
chooser which is a native file chooser
maintains an answer right and we have a
test for it Jamie windows so what it
does originally we wanted to do whatever
accessibility API could provide and
windows and we discovered this UI
automation framework which basically can
do anything so basically for Windows we
can do just about anything for it we are
actually sort of so it uses the Jamie
for API directly so to extend Jamie
course to support some other library you
just need to write this much code
basically you've got this clumsy API but
it's working so yeah so for for that for
Windows we have implemented their
disability access throughout disability
right through for Chrome as well yes sir
so it's not hard code
yes love this I'm waiting for them oh
yeah
yeah this one the Jimmy Windows was
created with minimal times when you say
no right now so the D the whole point is
we are it's not our primary job to
develop tools right we are testing
that's our responsibility
so the Jimmy Jimmy design allows us easy
to extend or testing some other stuff
and it's already paid off we'll admit so
Jimmy I'm sorry Java effects 1.3 and
Java effects to consider all right if I
don't money that's it it's already
worked and so this is the windows Jimmy
windows the grater just do this way so
that's just all the last white I have
where you can in what you can get from
what our users see right so Jimmy core
is there on show link on the next page
in source of miner view image marriage
image marriage there is an image married
in any Sweden which basically have more
or less the same functionality
what optionality doesn't have is like
this one
yeah so these bells and whistles are not
in this version but other than that this
is a martial arts gym a image merge
effects needs to be polished I have
problems unit code this constructor not
yet and abuse soon as they do we have
something to do something at least being
able to load the test back from the
comments
Jimmy windows approval already Gardner
you need to do first lifting put in the
license that's it Jimmy no same stuff
Jamie mark we have some problems with
native trading I'm Jamie man I I'm not I
will be able to talk more about it
because some other guys is doing it but
if we have we have to resolve that I
don't know how to do that here Jamie
Foxx is there Jamie Foxx Travis Lee in
source again a figure out how to do the
binary we're in trouble approvals almost
so as soon as I get all the approvals to
the violence is gonna be there for now
we have to do it yourself if access
constructor is an tiny piece piece on
top of this constructor of course in
development now the platform works
correct
so the robot is like one of the most
important things in this in this stuff
and now for Windows we use glass robot
reliable for Mac OS X and for leaner
well we have to use a tab let's hear
about learning to do this way for Mac
you've got to be executed in a separate
video
this always transparent for tests you
just write a test code and run it Jamie
decides the best way if you want to
override it you may write but you notify
it's the best way to do produce nations
and Linux embedded videos we ran the
test the same tests which we run on
desktop in that configuration so I'm
very proud and finally how to get Jamie
effects well that's the current way
there isn't written me out there okay
and there it immediately steps basically
these three steps would do it here so
once you run your test after a while I'm
at the screens the windows start
collision on your screen and it's just
the Jemma testing
Marvin almost there
not yet need to figure out how to better
integrated into the existing build
system myself so resources and this is
not a type up so if you want information
on Jamie effects you go to Jamie a Java
net if you want information on Jamie for
is the root
Jamie Johanna right and then Jamie are
examples which is linked from Jamie
Jeanette one of the first lights it
basically it gives you some much like
how to find something how to use text
how to push buttons how to operate
ListView etcetera and that is it should
there questions left yes right we need
to divide what to find what you need
tested for going there so basically if
this Union the testing done by
developers it's not such a complicated
API of course developer can learn it and
music right the truth is and historical
it is the other way around it's us
developers protested conan's the test
and we are premised in our in our work
basically we're using it for functional
testing though sometimes it's really it
was to be interest in nature yes Jimmy
Joe yeah it's Incheon Korea any other
questions
well thank you for coming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
