going to look at the memory tab group
for Java flight recorder so what I have
pulled up here I have Mission Control
pulled up with you know I just have the
general overview tab open here but I've
already opened the flight recording so
we're going to just go ahead and dive in
so I'm going to click on the memory tab
group and the first tab i see is of
course the overview tab will go through
the other tabs in order basically here
this is pretty much a very summery
oriented tab but just shows the physical
memory and heat memory used during the
recording and you can see here during
this recording was very flat we have
some configuration data and as well some
statistics about garbage collections
that happen during the recording so
pretty straightforward information there
the garbage collections tab shows all
the information about garbage
collections that occurred during the
recording so you can see here the main
feature is we've got a graph of our heap
over time and then that's if we look on
the left side that's memory we have that
on the left side of the chart and then
the right side of the chart we have paws
times and so that's represented by these
red lines the red lines these tall ones
here show major garbage collections or
full garbage collections and the minor
garbage collections are very very short
little red lines here you'll see at the
bottom all this stuff is configurable so
once again if you want to hide a part of
the graph you can just by clicking the
check boxes this table here on the Left
shows the number of garbage collections
so I can sort garbage collections by ID
and see what happened or I can sort by a
length so I can see what was the longest
garbage collection so if I click on one
I can look at the details for that
garbage
election I can see that this was a major
garbage collection on old generation I
can see what phases and how long they
took I can look at reference objects
heap data and then permanent generation
data as well so a lot of detailed
information they're all available
sortable very cool stuff in addition we
have some sub tabs up here so for
example we have a graph like this
showing the kinds of references that
were collected and used during the
recording so this is just showing a
number of weeks oft final and phantom
references used throughout the recording
so anyway so that's the garbage
collections tab the GC times tab is just
a focuses mainly on just garbage
collection with garbage collection data
so our graph here or a chart shows as
the pause times once again so we can see
old generation and in young generation
collections we can see the number of
collections there were their average
times for both young and old and then
once again we have a table here showing
us some of the paws of related
information for our garbage collections
the next tab is the GC configuration tab
and this shows detailed information
about the configuration I can see what
garbage collectors were used in this
case i'm using serial for both young and
old how many threads memory all that
sort of fun stuff the next tab is the
allocations tab and this shows
information about memory allocations as
they were made throughout the recording
so i can get detailed information about
threadlocal access buffers you can see
here where objects were allocated both
in and out of thread local access
buffers if I click on the sub tabs up
here allocation and knuth thread
allocation buffer I can see here that I
can look at that data to see what's
allocated by class by
a thread and if I click on one of the
classes here i click on char here I can
see which up you know where the most of
those objects were getting allocated and
what part of the code because we're
showing the various methods here that
allocated those kinds of objects okay
and finally one of the more interesting
tabs here is the object statistics tab
and this one can be good if you're
looking for a memory leak because it
will show you has this nice little shows
which which classes are taking up the
most memory but it also has this nice
table here at the bottom showing the top
growers for a particular session here so
in this case during our recording
java.util that tree maps grew the most
and in this case they grew 190 4.65
kilobytes us that's super huge but you
can see how that could be very useful in
a recording to see which classes are
taking up the most space or growing the
most during your recording so that's it
for the memory tab group for Java flight
recorder
