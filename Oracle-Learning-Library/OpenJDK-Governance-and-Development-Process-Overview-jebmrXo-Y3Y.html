coming my name is Donald Smith and with
me today is iris not Clark and dalla bar
tokage sorry running joke iris won't
tell me her maiden last name because
then she'll think I'll always remember
it over her real last name well you kind
of already have problems with my name
right now said iris I didn't say Irish
and but you did say lorg somebody else
on your team teleport I did I you
Cecilia again did I keep calling iris
Cecilia do I call you iris for a while
no okay all right so we're all working
in the open Jake OpenJDK community we
put together a slide deck over the
summer that describes some of the roles
and logical constructs in the OpenJDK
community so basically we took the
OpenJDK bylaws and we went into we went
in this some diagrams and just basically
explain the various roles how groups
work how projects work just to help
those of you who are new to
participating in the OpenJDK community
get an understanding of how we work what
are our norms and what are the various
terms that we use and this is also a
nice complement to another presentation
that we have which is basically you know
why you should even participate in the
first place so we're assuming if you're
here you've already made that decision
that you're going to participate in in
the open j2k community and now we're
just going to explain the various roles
and so on so first the standard Oracle
sarbanes-oxley disclaimer which although
you know where we're talking open source
here it's probably not at all relevant
but I think we should probably still put
it up there I do like to point out that
i have seen presentation
shins where the Oracle sarbanes-oxley
disclaimer is next to the IBM
sarbanes-oxley disclaimer and ours is
shorter and easier to read ok so the
agenda what is OpenJDK I'm going to
start with that then iris will be doing
the community bylaws section and then
dial bore will kind of bring us to the
end so we'll just start off with a quick
what is open to UK before I get into
this just so you know the OpenJDK has a
governing board and we'll be talking
about the role of the governing board
the governing board will be running a
panel later this afternoon it's at three
o'clock today in plaza AE ok so so this
topic is interesting to you you want to
meet the governing board if you want to
ask them questions I'm hoping that you
have lots of questions for the panel
please come three clock today all right
so what is open G ok so in a nutshell
it's the place to collaborate on an open
source implementation of the Java
platform standard edition and related
projects so there are a number of
communities in our and in the Java
ecosystem right there's like the
GlassFish community there's the Eclipse
community there's all kinds of different
unions so OpenJDK is where we work on
the Java platform standard edition in
just a brief history and so it goes back
to november two thousand six when it was
initially started in 2007 there was an
initial code release there was a lot of
you know a lot of ideas code committers
a lot of things coming online
in 2007 in 2009 then in 2010 Oracle
acquired son and so basically we went
through a bit of a replanting IBM
announced that they were going to
participate in OpenJDK last year to you
you may remember other companies
basically announcing that they were
going to participate SI p then of course
Red Hat has been very very active and
has participated since since the very
early days so basically around 2010 with
Oracle we started to get more momentum
and then last year we came we talked
about a lot of the things that you know
a lot of the planning a lot of the lot
of discussions and started to see some
momentum and then this year we started
to carry forward on that momentum and so
over over the last week you may have
seen a couple of things show up on the
OpenJDK discuss mailing list one of
which is a scorecard so you know with
with help from a number of participants
in the OpenJDK community we took a very
close look at what are our goals as a
community and how are we doing on those
goals we kind of gave herself a frank
assessment of where we think we stand we
asked a lot of other people do you do
you think this is where we stand and
then our expectation is that a year from
now we're going to come back to that
scorecard and hopefully we'll see
improvement in a number of areas so
that's kind of you know where our
history is coming from 2011 into today
so basically you know there's a very
clear commitment to OpenJDK from from
Oracle has not changed at all over the
last year in fact yesterday we announced
that we will be releasing nass horn as
an OpenJDK project so you know the
commitment is still there we have we
have the roadmap we've been providing
lots of updates we
are still actively working on the
strategy of bringing j rocket technology
and hotspot together the pipeline of
interested participants and contributors
is is still strong if you were at the
keynote yesterday saw that Andy is
participating they have a really cool
project that they will work with us on
on GPU basically being able to run Java
on GPUs and heterogeneous computing
environments some very cool stuff there
will actually have a demo about on
Thursday in the community keynote yeah
so basically things things I think are
moving along at a very good pace I know
there may always be people that want to
want the pace to be faster but I think
given all the constraints and all the
technology I think I think we're we're
moving Java forward sorry wrong year I
think we're set to make the future Java
Regina said all right so with that I
will hand it over to Harris virus so
next slide oh I can do that yeah we're
cooking however you want to do it wankel
so so the community when we initially
started back in two thousand seven we
had a set of interim bylaws and that
describe the structure of what we
thought at the time the OpenJDK would
kind of look like and in 2011 we
actually went back and refined those
ideas and we came up with a lot of the
same things a few different changes here
and there we introduced the concept of
groups for instance and those bylaws
were done you know with the input from
the community and they were ratified by
the community in june two thousand
eleven and part of the bylaws includes
appendix b which define how we would
transition from the interim bylaws to
the fully the new bylaws are the current
bylaws
and between the ratification time and
August we put together with the census
which described who was involved with
what you know in terms of not just you
know historically but also realistically
so then we put together this census it
went out for review again by the
community to make sure we didn't forget
anybody make sure that we you know
properly identified people and their
associations and going to look at the
census now it's actually a very
important document it lists the group's
the projects and all the people and
their roles within the community so of
course it does not list participants and
contributors we'll get to why you'll
understand why when you see that later
portion of that the talk but it goes
through and you know lists all the
people who are involved in openjdk we
took those that as the census and we
took our bylaws and they were installed
in october two thousand eleven so it's
been almost one year that we've been
having had those in place and as part of
that installation we put together and
way in the slide it says the summary of
groups and projects but what it is is is
kind of a how-to guide how to do various
things within the groups of the project
so if you want to get a different role
you know there are instructions for
doing that the templates for the various
things you want to do so it's the idea
is to kind of try to make it easier so
you don't have to go through the bylaws
and necessarily understand and you know
know where to cross reference for
everything off of that it's just kind of
all there is an easy one-step sort of
guide so that's kind of what we're doing
for that
back with oh sorry I was looking at the
wrong thing that right yes excellent um
you make a perfect put this whole floor
there I wanna see we're talking about
groups of projects which is potentially
unusual because you may know they'll
move these like Apache or eclipse or get
up which you necessarily have such a
structure like we have in openjdk our
community is compromised for roots and
these groups can do certain things like
sponder projects so basically the stuff
that you really get involved in its
participants a project is sponsored by a
group so there's like a tree-like
structures that are safe and
participants like we are can simply form
a list or them as they progress in their
original reservation started taking more
advanced roles for example the count
committers or actually you know project
leads reviewers or even root boots and
some of them they come for example
governing more lenders so to give you a
bit of a explanation about this whole
group thing let's what look is what it
is so a group is the set of people
participants sharing a common interest
and it opens in EK we have a whole bunch
of groups around different interest
areas for example for people interest
importing context reporting group for
people with interests in say hot
spotlight projects from the game itself
or a lot spot group and just for now
consider participant somebody was
grabbing the main with a group doesn't
actually host and help it you know
weapons the web friends website it can
have a main list but it doesn't do any
development it's to say just a social by
innocence and groups them but the most
important part that will reduce they
take care of sponsoring projects
as filters of the city to what projects
are sponsoring any member of OpenJDK the
special role to propose a group but
actually hoots are being added or
removed by wood of the governing board
and that means at the bar to actually
create new groups is pretty high which
is why we haven't actually a tentative
upgraded since you Milo's and surely
have actually a very wide range covered
right now so an example of a group like
I said is a Porter's group it has a
purpose in this case the purpose of the
for this group is to bundle and eight
porting efforts under the open jet game
villain so a whole bunch of 40 projects
and to integrate them in the open to the
community through such projects and to
help them you know make your way into
for example to hear it has a website so
it's OpenJDK of java yeah that's generic
OpenJDK europe will find all the
information through discussing today /
groups for all groups / quarters for
this specific it has a lead in that case
that's me it has made lists fortress
dash tab where we every now and then the
conversations about general pointing
issues for example whether we should
want to take efforts to you know make
our unique signal better nice circle but
in general most of activity takes place
in the project sponsored by the
supporters group for example the power
for CA export for the country Cavalia
order PSD fourth zero iced tea and many
other projects the photos group is one
of the very prolific groups in that
sense is that we have a lot of interest
in particular important projects and
that brings us to where relativity is in
terms of code to the projects projects
also have a purpose the purpose but
project is not to be a talk shop it's to
produce a specific artifact something
you can actually deliver so that maybe
code and typically is sore still it may
be documentation something like that
projects maybe your whole sizes they may
be
more projects spoke the focus titanium
specific area for example we have an
importance group sponsored project
called zero which is a very focused on
providing an interpretive that came to
hotspot that's cross-platform c'mon
everywhere and that means it's a
reasonably small piece of code focus in
the very very tight area and we have
really huge projects like to gate
reference communication project wherever
do build the next revision platform
projects of course also have web content
and web pages which typically use
documental processes and anticipated
film they also have made lists and
mainly sir a big part of building
communicator in the old software and
most importantly they can have
repositories for Sir Stuart
recommendations typically material and
projects in order to comply with violets
have to operate in a certain manner that
we open transparent and meritocratic and
in order to ensure that the products
follow these rules the governing board
is there to ensure that's occasion to
fix an account issues it short different
an example project is one level 40 block
tomorrow is the jdk 7 updates that's a
project that we use a token judicata the
old updates to JTP said wearily to he
said it last year but we weren't done by
seven was released within kept releasing
updates from develop on these updates is
being done in this JD 7 on this project
in the open open JDK and like I said
over the group's this project folds
hands of webassign openjdk dot java.net
/ projects and then shortening for the
project in this case JD 7 u87 updates it
has amazing list Jadakiss and eshe death
where the development takes place so
this is the central place in this case
where decisions are being made whatever
changes have been accepted we've got it
for example these changes may come from
when we come from affording project
included it has a project lead who is
responsible to the community for
enforcing the rules about experiencing
openness and I gotta think like it in a
bit it has Pacific developing processes
so because we have such a wide range of
projects with different goals in
different purpose different sizes there
is no single purpose that fits all and
that means many projects have specific
reiationship processes a document and
instead of our base case we have
developed this processes as part of
developing project and we discussed them
on the list of improve them this process
are documented on what website that
people to the j-turn updates website of
this URL you'll find a listing of
different rules we have around how code
flows what can choose acceptable
templates for a piratical backports
physical thing and as a seven form of
project responded by groups in this case
the 7up place project is funded by the
Bill group and that's a group of setting
self-weight built tools in so that's one
example project we have I think about
three dozen from us right now I'm going
to need a community so it's it's a very
large area in granbury we've got quite a
nudist probably part of your new
projects this year that have come in
kind of the area where I think we're
we're seeing a lot of growth so beside
decide this general concept of groups
like the build work with a bonus group
and John Kasich local projects there are
two groups it up its paschal their
permanent so while that is the before
mentioned Jacob members group and open
gym member 50 members art yes wheel
within a sense of special participants
because they have additional rights they
get to vote on new projects they get to
vote on
acknowledged governing board members
they get to nominate movies so both
angelica members have additional
relaxing that's it and then there's the
Governing Board of mention before which
is a matter group with specific task to
manage the structure so the Winkies
groups are creating great feature and
the operation that means maintenance of
openness transparency mediocrity and
these rules and development of the
community and this governing board
consists of five individuals two of
which are a point of Oracle and
hemisphere t28 or 01 appointed by the
enemy and two o'clock members which are
elected annually by those of guilt and
JDK members in addition the governing
board gets the sponsor projects for new
religious at the job I see plan so for
example what it's like JT or 8900 those
projects don't get great for a vote of
all the members they get on the doctor
ability by the governing board and in
addition the governing board doesn't as
persistently because it's the poly
mitchell's but also made light of
servers to participate in its
proceedings in the meetings for example
these observers don't have voting rights
but they can inform the governing board
about specific issues for example what
progress on our scorecard orabell which
is like that and some projects are also
permanent that's the jdk are these
projects so the jeddak here these posts
are a special and a project because they
cover new release of the platform in our
kids right over becomes 88 that's a
shitty release project but Ginny said
updates are not your duty here these
project because the junior version has
already released or just accommodating
and JDK early score especially because
they can
proposed by the openjdk leash in this
case market it may only be sponsored by
the government work and the project he
gets the video congenic eight so they're
very special in that sense and serve a
special relationship to JCP seriously
and with these general fictional
projects and groups let's go into roles
with a nice picture no this isn't the
one okay Your Honor I said all pictures
I don't think I want to do all no bigger
than me okay no one well the key point
is is that there's a slide for each of
these walls coming up this is just a
summary of the various forms okay so we
have three major old participants might
you be poor for tutors and then members
so participants participants are
individuals who are subscribed to one or
more open a listing of adjudicate and
that means you get to you know posted
bliss give to recall the email traffic
and so mark email lists with plenty of
em we have more than 70 main let's find
out I think our human traffic officers
best of all then that's your job like
it's mine it's about four to five
thousand emails a month so that's quite
a lot of traffic so you probably want as
a participant to focus your attention on
specific area here about right say seven
updates or zeros of linking now the
things you can post messages to make
small traditions can provide feedback
for example design decisions it's like
the next level is a contributor aqua
jupiter is a participant who has signed
the oracle contributor dream or somebody
who works organization that signed that
agreement park early and that bubble you
can submit patches because if it changed
sense for consideration you can propose
new projects and can participate in
decision-making in groups and projects
so Virginia is probably the place where
most of the open genuine is for this
offense where I feed or clinic code are
and then there is it's the special level
open to the gang members which is for
contributors who have a long history of
significant tributions so people have
been around for a while of the show
experts and good work and have been
nominated and elected by those of
existing members to that sailors and
they get to have the right to propose
new groups new projects and the group
leads and it were to go to vote when you
members as well as to vote in the
governing board elections on the edge
large numbers and that form that we have
the unique role the opportunity me there
can be only one and that person's point
in the Oracle pleats these special did
he release projects and it's also a
member of any more so that's general
rules and then may have specials or
groups is special for projects in group
they're basically two materials want it
to be crew member and the second ones
developer program so group members are
contributors we have a long history
again here of contributing the specific
group for example people have a lot of
austeria community hotspot will be
considered for election ancestral
members of our group you become a good
member same way to become a legit came
every denomination when exist
remember and that election of your what
appears and what's to become a good
memory to get right access to the web
content and repositories and that
finally there's in the unique role group
lead in route that's one member was
responsible for directing and
coordinating a particular securities and
that person gets authority to sponsor
projects for that group so the group
itself doesn't have to vote it's awesome
project to group weeds a possibility but
project that gets to be voided opponent
for duty members and of course with this
privilege come responsibilities so
looking at the content how people eat in
the progress of a group and basically
making sure that the community is
evolving in the right place the right
direction and that means is yes is this
why you wanted me to do the graphic
slide because this one is not a good
graphics nice to project go back go back
to it it's okay so I struggle with this
slide I'd love to have somebody who is a
graphic artist maybe come up with a
better representation but the thing is
is you could go from being a committer
to a project lead but if you're a
project Lee than your you also become a
reviewer so it's like you need some sort
of for cough things that comes back
getting the other way so that's what
that's trying to to note is that you you
can go from authored a committer to
project lead and then as soon as your
project lead if you weren't already a
reviewer you are and your project allows
reviews it means you're yeah that's true
not all projects have the reviewer role
so there will be what i said is only
true if you actually are in a project
that has a
roll wait yeah got it okay they hit just
skip the next few slides I didn't
connect it's it we have authors others
are regular people will forget to also
change sense office get a point about
logically typically after having
motivated you know if he changes already
so we know they're going to stick around
for a project because the project you
want to actually want to grow new
contributors right you want to grow your
participants were able to to help a lot
me development so after a while after
somebody has done a number of the
tribunes say a 410 the person would
typically get noticed by the other
committers as somebody newington
significant work and they get proposed
illuminated to become a committer and
elect that's a main list and the
election process takes about two weeks
adequate us can vote and then calculator
is committer give it freely we will push
your own change sets into their mouths
words as an offer you have to ask a
commitment to push for you and the
rationale being that defendant is a
vivid when you start coughing you
project you sort of have to feel your
way into community of to learn the ropes
you have to learn a non-committal works
and you do that up if you change that
and after say eight through ten you know
but then fine but and very well
everything works of reviews working
there any who's responsible for your
area working on to get reviews from so
that your abuser flows at your red pot
and then in projects like seven updates
or eight we we want to be able to ensure
that the code coming into releases is a
very high quality so we have a review
process the exact way review process
function can depend from the area to
area can depend from project to project
but in general reviews of the phone by
people have a reviewable and those are
experienced players who have done as
let's say at least thirty two or more
significant changes to project
to become nominated and elected
muttering you were fulfilled and they
get to you know review incoming jane
says before you pushed it through both
words and it's part of that process
there's typically a conversation that
happens if there's a been clear and it
often helps us clarify intent and design
anti reviewer radiating change center so
and so as somebody trying to get Cody to
repositories its obligation to answer
question from you or yours its
obligation to make sure there's nothing
questionable of them to change it to
resume and finally the last big blood
Crow is the role of the project lead and
that's committer who's responsible for
basically directing and coordinating the
activities of the project so in some
parts it's a bit of a ceremony in het
practice really is a very very
responsible role we have to take a lot
of here that project you're working with
works in the open which describe the
works in America question that there's a
progression from roles that people
coming in but it's uncomfortable but
basically good things are happening at
the should be as long sad what if it's
part of automatically reviewers on
positive have grave reduce like 52
complex or a a project lead is elected
by the group leaf of the group
sponsoring project so 47 updates I was
elected by the group and he has full
authority over technical matters related
to the project including when to require
reviews for changes and of course part
of that is in the food appoint authors
part of this also being responsible for
informing community what changes what
activity is a project
at a glance all right this is the
picture the dog is looking for old I
spent eight days making this slide thank
you thank you guys all right so there we
go it would be more fun with transitions
but will do so we start off in the upper
left-hand corner there with somebody who
loves Java so that's Duke and to become
a participant and by the way all these
terms are all defined in the bylaws all
right so we've just taken the bylaws the
roles and put them in a put them in the
slide here so as soon as you join the
mailing list you become a participant in
the OpenJDK community then to become a
contributor you either need to sign the
OCA or work for a company that has
signed the OCA and you you have an
employment agree with them that says
that your contributions can englander
that okay and then there's a number of
ways you can go depending on whether
you're going to be more interested in
groups or projects but probably both you
mean more than likely new participants
will probably start off in the
participant on the project side of
things but eventually you may find
yourself going into the group side of
things because groups are just logical
collections of projects from my
perspective all right so projects you
start off as being an author and that
happens just by having a project lead
notice that you've been making
contributions and that you're a
contributor so they would check that
you've signed the OCA or work for a
company that has and they would say hey
would you like to be an author because
you're making good contributions then
presumably the author continues making
good contributions and the committers
say wow this author is making good
tributions he or she should become a
committer and let's have an election to
do that and so there's an election
that's sounds very formal to have an
election but no it's pretty
straightforward simple web email book
and then they become a committer alright
so once you are a committer then if your
project has the role if your project has
the requirement of ricky's the
requirement of requiring reviews peter
piper picked a pecka pecka memory so but
yeah so basically not all projects have
a reviewer role but projects that have
you know have need that extra
verification to make sure that what's
being released isn't going to you know
potentially cause a lot of you know
compatibility issues or what have you
you will have the reviewer role and then
you know if / time you are a really
active committer when the current
project lead steps aside maybe you will
be elected as Project Lead and to become
a project lead requires being elected by
the group lead for the group of that
project belongs to right okay okay good
more or less hi so yeah iris iris works
a lot more with the hands-on of this
stuff so whenever I generalize and
whenever you see me waving my hands iris
usually knows the field my ears well
sort o except when it's fine yeah okay
it is consul feel something fun alright
so then a contributor can also get
involved with groups so they can become
member for which happens by being
elected by other group members and then
one group member is the group lead and
that group lead is ratified by the
governing boards and the governing board
says yes that person should be group
lead and group leads have the power to
sponsor new projects then on the group
side of the world there's actually two
special groups and one of those groups
is the OpenJDK members group and so
again you can go from being a
contributor elected by other OpenJDK
members and OpenJDK members vote for
more the at-large seats on the governing
board and then the OpenJDK members one
of them is appointed by Oracle to be the
OpenJDK lead and as dallimore mentioned
that is Mark mindful all right and then
the other two special group is the
governing board and the governing board
has a panel at three o'clock this
afternoon in Plaza a B if you would like
to meet them we will have a panel of QA
please come with lots of cube and again
there's basically five seats on the
governing board and I'm now noticing
noticing we should update this slide
although i don't know if it's in the
bylaws directly in the violence but
there isn'ta parts of saying that's not
so maybe I should just shut up now but
there are observers on the governing
board just to point that out so there
are like for example Mike Milankovitch
is an observer mike is from the Eclipse
Foundation he was an at-large member and
he has stayed on as as as an observer
and prior to that actually Andrew hailey
was an observer
he's been elected to one of the at-large
members so all right and with that we'll
talk about some of the norm some
processes Holies want to pull it a
little it up you know perilous and all
these things so there's everything about
you liked it and all that buzz elections
work well I've okay so do a lot of
voting communities wait when you want
transpo decision-making you want to have
a lot of us for this way so many actions
canal by lowes actually require a load
of what is available parameters or
members or in a row and get chillin
method depends on what you're going on
to some decision or more severe and
others and the role that's been voted on
it is typically one thing us say
inclusion decisions in a group appears
they me but appear consult our going
forward periods are typically two weeks
in order to allow everybody to have a
chance actually have a look if you want
to avoid stration where you saw the vote
right before Christmas and then you know
nobody sees anything until they arrive
and it's too late so it's two weeks do
you um you also get to change your votes
is it will record the voting period it
for example during the conversation and
throughout their population growth of
course it turns out Michael major shows
up in I'm changing or both and both of
his parents they found the main list on
the relevant eggless for click vote so
for example in the if you want me to do
being nominated a committer community
seven updates then the bills were they
related news and updates is being done
by the computers of gdp 7 update project
all DJ q 7i think they should have a
list so it's politically constrained and
these votes of transparency
looking up and see what stays footsie
with photos except from potentially for
some government work what you do is
usually consensus-building so for
decisions not requiring the full
attention all the eligible voters they
vote for email saying vote Yes or you
staying or you Anna meto is pretty loads
18 it will be too then you have to be a
reason for each other so it can't
discuss so it can be potentially
whatever it's going to be the result and
there are two kinds of these votes lady
consensus there are no meters that's for
example when you're elected a new
committee or 300 consensus we're
Victorino vetoes at least three yes
votes in that case that's per example we
like a new reviewer to project like I
said the events of the relevance of the
decision and then it can some decisions
for Harlem decisions views majority
voting and that's when we require the
full attention everybody who's eligible
to vote those affected by the decision
in that case the potential outcomes for
the hood or at yes no probs thing and
you don't have to justify a no vote for
a yes vote for attention but you can do
it ofcourse and there are two kinds of
his votes simple majority this pays more
yes votes and of those for example when
we're looking to repent if I propose new
group leads for the governing board or a
two-thirds majority in this case twice
as many yes votes as no votes for
example when for whatever automotive
increasing our group leads should be
forcibly removed but potentially boss
collection and it's a very
may have major ebook improve it has a
diverse majority most votes in this case
of based on the number of go through the
cast so in some rare cases we also have
half-smoked boats which are based on the
number of eligible voters but that's our
for things like provisions of Bibles or
technical needs to go inward for really
moving high levels and with that some to
Iris for nice little things requiring
civil litigation and we have to have a
done this yet but great any open with
universal proposal groups and groups are
we must be approved by to the majority
govern work and it's not just the
group's creation and also you do believe
in every board would be approving once
we have it relieved they be asked for
what their initial web page content
would be mailing list I think are
appropriate for the room and they'd be
also we value the initials of group
members of course we have also must have
some ESEA organ contributors that's how
good patient's work occupation will the
more common we've had about half a dozen
villages is this year alone so any
contributor yes penetration of the
project at one Ruby Wisconsin topic so
the positive relevance of multiple
and the project has been with the
reviewers and all the others or I would
indicate a publix because in it there is
a section and it basically describes all
the steps we just went through for a
conference profit what needs to happen
for for the point of initiating
discussion the project all the way point
specify the temporal details of how the
project is what you've done
also need to think about how friendly
with new participants so he and you want
to also document with your casa these
are going to look like after some things
what to talk about things respect and
project is Brooks was great you want the
other projects burner maybe there's more
complicated it's best to document what
it is
and of course these make sure you really
would not put you to fire loss and
documentation it's on that pocket cake
helps you kind of walk through some tech
stuff does so make sure make sure it
make sure that all computers are
provided ITA so just to keep everybody
warning possible time can vary depending
on circumstances I think about
documentation if you say that yeah and
I'm the circumstances usually no it's
usually and we do have Lincoln sorry
alpha particle page you need to notify
the registrar they census changes so the
changes are offered you later he
remembers if you go to those the
document pages of the project who let
their templates their personalities who
said the Registrar will bcc just do the
chocolates you'll be perfectly registrar
that if they do not do you know about it
what we're doing is everything okay we
notify the opportunity if you're a place
sex change that is the employment status
changes your coverage for us agreement
with a let second among you and
questions be asked
how
yeah so when we say or equivalent what
we really mean is that you may work for
a company that I signed on RCA and in
that case you would you would know this
by trust or you would ask you could ask
the I guess ops but ultimately it would
come to me and I would be able to
connect the dots for whomever needed to
ask
yep
yep so we do publish the list of OCA
signatories and as I process those that
list gets updated or as the netbeans or
glassfish or my sequel or other
communities process the they also update
that one and so you can you can check
there and then it's a matter of when the
contribution comes in you knowing that
that came from somebody that links there
if you're not sure you can
I mean one when interesting case of or
equivalent is of course when you work at
Oracle oh yeah work yeah exactly Oracle
we don't need to sign OCS because the oh
yeah it's an in frequently asked
question but it is yeah actually I i do
get you know what once or twice a month
on OCA from somebody at oracle there is
no yes it's a reasonable assumption to
make
paper structure all do you want to sit
them about this is the right pontius
upstanding yeah so let's see so oh I
mean basically what we're going to hit
up here is things from the from the
scorecard really although this slide
predates the scorecard but basically so
website maintenance has not been
externalized yet which i guess is a
polite way of saying only whoracle staff
at the moment can do this and so you
need to send it unless you work for it
but you need to set up dates the web
pages to ops at openjdk content without
net and I apologize for the obfuscation
of the email address there just that
it's just a habit you're getting your
writing email address that makes show up
on the web okay and then in the sodo so
the Winkies we migrated for wiki stead
oracle com from wikis that son calm and
sorry Delabar actually can you talk a
little bit about that I know there's yes
so so basically if you need to have
write access to it you need to have an
Oracle ID and you need to let me now
typically only web discuss main list but
of course it can also reach out to me
over email and I can arrange for you to
have write access a frame involving all
the projects for example groups ok and
then on the JIRA migration those of you
that may not know where in the we're in
the process of migrating to jira the the
bug database if you're familiar with the
history of Java you know that Java has
been around for a very long time and so
there's a very large code base in a very
long history of data and so the
migration effort
snap your fingers on it's done kind of
effort so we have completed the first
step of that migration which is to
internally switch over to be using JIRA
and our intent look our intention is to
open open that up and make it the way
that the entire OpenJDK community uses
issue trackers or but systems whatever
you want whatever you want to call it
and so we don't have any dates on that
yet but we are working on that and
hopefully we won't have that we have a
few minutes Eid questions yep
you wanna so did you hear the question
so the question is what about the bug
database and specific projects right
let's say pedimos for example or the
porting project the safety and IBM over
so if you read Joe's blog Joe wrote a
blog post I think a week or so ago about
emigration effort announcing that we
have now switched over internally pajara
he also says that you know rapoo has
done all set we plan to work on making
the whole thing read write as well and
also to make it retry for open dedicate
projects so what are they doing in the
meantime actually but you know the spots
and what are you guys doing with Penrose
and your port project with Volker what
are you guys to impress you tragedy or
are you not right so but how are you
working around it just email wiki right
so you're yep
correct not yet yes so basically what
you're saying is is you're working
you're working around that but you're
not using a different system and you
need this as quickly as possible yeah
yep
yeah so can't remember I know so the
issue with the wiki is that there's
terms of use the terms of use for the
wiki is oracle com terms of use whereas
the openjdk terms of use are friendly or
four of the open 10k community work and
I honestly can't recall if Ricky or we
discussed that on mark you have anything
he cannot hear like this might be a
great question by the way for the
governing board if yeah that's true
night it's not the top number one thing
is the bach database right and then yeah
and i have to apology by the wikis it
was really a kind of a in the middle of
a knight's move from the old son wiki
system to the new Oracle system it
happened pretty much during the
Christmas vacation a thing or something
like that so I think it's one of those
completely innocent things where it's
like oh the way to work says ski is
awaking Oh different transit use that
for a lot of people is really not a big
deal right it's it's really a big deal
if you work for a big company that you
know analyzes terms of uses of websites
that they might interact with but for
most people it's really not a big deal
what the Terms of Use are but but i'm
not trying to use that to diminish your
concern as i get like i got a issue but
it is it's just one of those things
where it's like oh yeah some some of the
companies might not like that term of
these terms of these and since the
partner yeah no I
yes yeah absolutely and in the wiki case
we you know the hard was being
decommissioned and there are very few
things in life you can't avoid you know
Texas Oracle Harvard commissions so we
had to act quickly to rescue to the
content in movie to with you server
yeah so at this point I'd like to
introduce the person I keep confusing
iris with Cecelia and they say there's
this is cecilia works with dallamore and
iris and I the Cecilia comes to this
team from the sustaining engineering
team so she's she's very familiar with
kind of the internal how oracle you know
dust dust ugly on the inside and is is
working with the community on those
types of issues concerns challenges all
of the above and so we've been working
with the london java community in
particular who have people that want to
be able to make those kinds of
contributions and and the fact is that
there are some tasks there that are
internal needs before the patch will
make its way into the into a branch or
release has to go through those tests
and their insurance only they can do it
and it looks like maybe they're busy on
something else and it's so we're aware
of that we're looking at how to manage
that given all the other constraints
that we might have and Cecilia is kind
of like the perfect person to do that
because because she's been working in
lab world for for a while and so so I
think we're going to see some some
benefits of that
yeah yeah actually it's oh yeah so I
mean well I mean I'll be honest you know
it's like whatever works it would be the
answer but the right thing to do is I
think to improve the process and if it
requires trying to bribe something
through the system and in short term so
be it but hopefully hopefully the
solution is to you know find the right
path for these kinds of things so that
some of these concerns are you know
there's there that like those checks are
there for good reason and it's it's just
finding the right process to make sure
that the transparency they think is
what's needed
yeah there's a couple of overlapping
openjdk yeah I think about 20 this year
so
right so I'll talk quite a bit about the
sausage-making aspect of seven updates
in my session tomorrow because if you
know what you typically end up with is a
user is a nicely packaged binary
downloading and the way the code flows
is necessarily trivial to understand for
somebody who's into people with the
processes simply because we develop
ourselves very in a very distributed
fashion across multiple projects for
example so like as much before hotspot
changes typically go to through hospital
porter is first which has its own
separate project and then get integrated
say into JDK 8 and third are generated
or backward into seven updates and that
means that if you say our want to fix a
an issue in hotspot you have to go to a
different place first work with with
their process and their rules and then
backported say yeah right
what
