I will show you how to view pipeline
revenue Oracle sales cloud makes it easy
to monitor the current opportunity
revenue amounts in my pipeline let me
show you I'm going to analytics as an
individual sales person my pipeline
revenue is revenue from all
opportunities where I am on the sales
team the pipeline report shows me all of
my opportunity revenue by sales stage I
can see closed revenue to here for
example I have nearly six hundred
thousand dollars in revenue for
opportunities in the qualification stage
my closed revenue is nearly 500,000 in
my total revenue is about four and a
half million I can pick from whatever
financial quarters are available to hear
I've selected the first quarter the
pipeline report has a table view as well
in addition to revenue totals the
reports table view shows me the number
of opportunities in each stage and the
percentage of total revenue by sales
stage the great thing about the table
view is that I can drill right into the
opportunities by sales stage report to
see information about the actual
opportunities in my pipeline I can drill
down even further into the opportunities
themselves where I can quickly make
updates if I like Oracle sales cloud
makes it easy to monitor the current
opportunity revenue amounts in your
pipeline you can find additional
learning resources in your Oracle Fusion
help application as well as in the
Oracle Learning Library and at Oracle
University thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
