that by now this is the last in a series
of eight videos about upgrading Oracle
BPM suite to version twelve one three
there are just a few more things to do
to complete our upgrade and those things
are the subject of this video recall
that when we installed the twelve one
three Fusion Middleware infrastructure
we established a new Oracle home for 12c
this new directory structure includes
administrative tools such as tests to
production utilities and composite
deploy compile and package utilities
however the domain was upgraded in place
that means the domain related components
such as the scripts to start and stop
WebLogic server are still found under
the original domain folder as you may
recall we reconfigured the node manager
to be domain based rather than host
based so the startup and shutdown
scripts for the node manager are here as
well although the domain location hasn't
changed all of the domain components
have been reconfigured to point to the
12c Oracle home the specific tasks
you'll need to perform after your
upgrade vary according to your
environment and which components you
have installed we've listed a few tasks
that are pretty common you may recall
that in there performing pre upgrade
tasks video we suggested that you
preserve copies of customized scripts
and configuration files here's where
you'll use them the reconfiguration
wizard doesn't preserve customizations
to scripts or configuration files so for
example if your 11g startup scripts set
the value of Java options class path or
JDK version you'll need to reapply those
changes to your post upgrade startup
scripts one quick way to handle this new
with 12c is to use this
user overrides file to store all of your
custom startup settings for details see
the document shown on screen you'll also
want to tune your Sowa infrastructure
applying the settings you determined
during the pre upgrade tasks the upgrade
process also does not preserve file
ownership and permissions so you'll want
to review them and modify as necessary
remember the background process that the
upgrade assistant kicked off after
upgrading active instances to upgrade
closed instances depending on how many
closed instances you have that process
might not yet be complete the unlike
rated closed instances won't be visible
in Oracle Enterprise Manager and won't
be available for reporting at this point
you have two options if what is most
important is minimizing downtime then
it's fine
to restart the servers our very next
step even if the upgrade of closed
instances has not completed as soon as
you restart WebLogic server the
background migration process of closed
instances stops you can then schedule
the data migration during off-peak hours
and monitor its progress if you would
rather wait until the data migration
completes you can monitor its progress
as we'll see shortly
remember we advised you to purge unused
data before starting the upgrade now you
see why the more closed instance data
you have the longer the data migration
process will take to monitor and
configure the upgrade of closed
instances said Oracle home to your
database home set the value of Oracle's
Sid and navigate to the folder you see
on-screen under your 12c Fusion
Middleware home then when you run sequel
plus supplying your sewin frsky m'a
owner and password you'll have easy
access to the soá--
upgrade menu sequel script which
displays the upgrade administration
options the first six of
those options are shown here you can use
one to determine if the upgrade is
complete and number five to schedule
when the background process runs for
more information see the administering
and monitoring the upgrade of so in
instances section of the upgrading so a
suite and Business Process Management
document with the migration of closed
instances handled either by allowing the
background process to complete or
scheduling it when it's most convenient
it's time to restart our servers and
make sure everything's working properly
first we start the admin server recall
that the startup script is in the domain
folder which is in the same folder
structure as prior to the upgrade but
now points to the 12c oracle home we're
using a node manager for each of our
hosts and during the upgrade we
reconfigured these node managers to
reside in the domain structure so that's
where you'll find the startup scripts we
can now bring up the WebLogic server
administration console to start the
managed servers notice that the console
displays the correct release number we
can start the managed servers from the
control tab of the summary of service
page we log in navigate to the summary
of servers page then to the control tab
select our manage servers and click
start
and voila our managed servers have been
started then after starting the Oracle
HTTP servers that were using for load
balancing users can start accessing the
applications again here's a task from a
process that was in progress prior to
the upgrade and is now available for
end-users to perform finally we can log
into the Enterprise Manager console
verify that the version number is
correct here - and see all of the
instances that were migrated from 11g
along with new instances as they occur
it should be possible to recover faulted
instances you can additionally use the
Enterprise Manager console to verify
that the migration of closed instances
has finished and with that we can be
confident that the upgrade was a success
we hope you've enjoyed these videos and
we trust that they have given you a high
level understanding of the process and
that they'll serve you well
as you read the documentation and begin
to plan your own upgrade project as we
have stressed throughout the series
these short videos are by no means a
complete description of what you need to
know we urge you to read the
documentation carefully prior to
starting your upgrade I'm Rosie pillar
thanks for watching and I hope your
upgrade to Oracle BPM suite 12 one three
go smoothly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
