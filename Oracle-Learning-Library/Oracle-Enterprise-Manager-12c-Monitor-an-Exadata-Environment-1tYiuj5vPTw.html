Enterprise Manager cloud control 12c
demo series this demonstration shows you
how to monitor your Daedalus machine
using an apprised manager Enterprise
Manager now includes a new type of
target called exadata
that allows you to register your
database machines and their agent
monitoring you no longer need to install
separate plugins to monitor your
database machine the discovery of all
the different components is now done
automatically by the agent running on
the compute nodes you can go to the
targets menu and then click exit data
the Oracle Exadata database machines
page shows you all registered database
machines click the one that is already
registered here this home page shows you
the database machine schematic there is
also left around that page that is
currently Eden let's show these by
clicking on this arrow icon on the left
this now shows you all the components of
your Database Machine that you can
administer you can also resize data area
on the right hand side at the top you
can see various important statuses of
all the database machine components like
Ethernet switches compute nodes KVM
Exadata cells IP switches and PD you all
of them are currently up you can see
these components status also on the
schematic here they are all green on the
schematic you can click on the
temperature to look at the temperature
of the components this is indicated in
centigrade if you right click on the
schematic you can item these slots the
machine that we use for this
demonstration is a quarter rack
so not all slots in the rack are used
and we just want to show the ones that
are occupied
these schematic gives you a one-stop
view of your database machine status at
the bottom of the page you will see the
incidents that are associated with your
machine now let's look at the resource
utilization go back to the target menu
and select resource utilization
then select compute resources that page
shows you the CPU utilization of the
different compute nodes by database
instances if you put your mouse over the
different zones on the graphic you can
see what each instance is using for
example DBM one is taking up 58% of the
CPU here the free zone is a negated by
the red color at the end of the bar you
can change this deal to look at the DB
instance placement for example this
gives you the placements of each
instance on each of the compute node
now let's have a look at the storage
utilization go to the target menu then
resource utilization in storage resource
on this page if you pass the mouse over
the graphic you can see the i/o
percentage done by each database you can
also look at the disk group space
allocation by changing the metric type
at the top and here because only one
this group is allocated all three cells
are using that one now let's go back to
the database machine schematic page go
to the target menu then home
from there you can click the grid link
to get an aggregated representation of
all the sell metrics on just one single
page on that page you can see some of
the performance metrics like the flash
and hard disk IO load the average CPU
utilization on each of the cells then
the total network utilization and
finally the average response times for
both flash and hard disks another
interesting chart you get on that page
is the workload distribution by
databases here you can see we have five
databases and the last one is using most
of the i/o utilization you can also see
the ASM this group summary section which
shows you the various important data
about all of your disk groups last
section on this page is about the
incidents try to your cells
you can reel down to individual cells if
you want let's have a look at cell 4
here you see the same information as
previously but only for that particular
cell the i/o load on the hard disk is
much higher compared to the flash disks
what you see on this page is the
instantaneous view of yourself but you
can look at historical data to go to the
target menu then performance this page
shows you how the cell performed in the
last two hours but you can change the
scale than used a for example you can
select scale to 15 minutes to have a
more granular view here we can see
graphics mobile flash and hard disks but
you can select for example only the hard
disks let's go back to the two hours
scale the Alpha review section shows you
the availability of the cell throughout
the time scrolling down the page you can
see the CPU utilization as well as the
flash cache usage the workload
distribution graph now let's have a look
at the InfiniBand Network like for the
Database Machine general schematic page
there is also a switch schematic and
this schematic can show you what are the
poles that are being used as well as the
available ones the gray ones are
currently used and when you pass your
mouse over one of those sports you see
where it is connected to as well as its
through boot another interesting view of
the switches is their topology go back
to the target menu and then select
topology this view shows you how the
InfiniBand switches are connected to the
different targets like cells now if
there is a bad part these green lines
will become red these helps to quickly
identify the root cause of the
performance problem for example in
addition to the topology you can run
administrator commands to manage your
switches directly from an uprise manager
from the target menu select
administration on that page if you want
to administer your ID switch select IV
switch in the comment section you can
select the operation you want to do for
example enabling a port
then you can select the corresponding
port and click Next so basically this is
a workflow that guides you through the
administration actions instead of you
doing it through the command line
another important feature you can get is
the integration of the Exadata
performance statistics directly in your
database home page so here is the
database performance page for the DB em1
instance there is currently a high level
of activity on that database now let's
look at the AO performance statistics
you can find some exadata specific
information if you scroll down you can
see the exerted a system elf if it is
green that means the system is in good
condition you can also see the I Omega
by per second for values called layers
here smart scan our predominant
scrolling down further you can see the
i/o request per second by IO function
here the database Rider is the most
active now let's not look at the excel
data system elf this page shows you the
hard disk IO load you can click on the
elf overview detail to get more details
let's conclude this demonstration so
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
