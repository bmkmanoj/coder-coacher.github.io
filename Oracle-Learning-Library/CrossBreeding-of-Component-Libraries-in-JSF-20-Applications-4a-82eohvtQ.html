or how to mix different J's of two
daughter libraries uicomponent libraries
and guidelines on that it it's more
based on experience of other guys or
other teams who used RJ's of 2 dota 2
dot or libraries different libraries to
build their applications so let us get
started safe harbor statement from
oracle give a glance so agenda for our
today's session we'll start with
introduction and we'll talk about
revolution of the ace of popular J's of
the strain works then interoperability
and challenges interoperability
guidelines and somebody followed by q
name let's chattered so the web-based
application development strategy or
scenario has been changed drastically in
recent past I remember like years back
maybe a decade back when we talk about
web application almost all applications
were focused on specific a specific part
in the sense exposed specific
functionalities through the web and
there was no concept like rich Internet
applications or rich enterprise
applications because the technology
limitations and infrastructure
constraints and lot more so in case if a
enterprise decides to build a huge
application then they may go for
declined for exposing set of
functionalities and a very limited set
of functional functionalities were
exposed through whip it was more or due
to the technology constraints Ajax was
not there at a time and lot of other
staffs bandwidth limitations and things
like that this has been changed in
recent past and if you see a transition
you would see that a paradigm
in web application development in years
back we are using HTML JSP and asp s
sort of stuff but now we are more on
ajax and later things very high five ABY
you can see and even the functionality
wise they are moving to its rich
internet experience and even not not
lynch rich internet experience as such
again one more level above which enrich
enterprise application it means that the
application may need to talk to
different applications to get data and
provides desktop sort of experience and
more interaction within the application
itself so it is more like a huge
end-to-end enterprise application so all
the web applications are moving towards
that direction so what we are going to
see in next few slides are I am trying
to set up a context for a jsf to doto
crossbreeding like why do we need a wide
why do we need to mix libraries and very
very viously so the rich enterprise
applications are more focused on high
interact you hi interact you are high
interactivity in the sense it interacts
with the user a lot and it interacts
with other systems and gets data then
displays the data back to the user so
there are a lot of interaction happens
under the cover and it actually exposes
functionalities through different
channels not only through web it can
data can be exposed through mobile
devices or other terminal terminal
devices or through other channels so all
these things are supposed to be
developed by developers so there are a
lot of challenges involved so challenges
in web develop applications development
can be sick cross-platform compatibility
in case if you are working on a desktop
application then you are sure that's
going to work on specific platform and
specific configuration but for a web
application is not guaranteed at all it
can be accessed by any a
here from anywhere in the world and it
can run on any platform any browser so
you should make sure that your
application works on all browsers on all
platforms the implementation complexity
in case if you are not using right tool
or right framework then it is you're
responsible responsibility to make sure
that it works on all platforms so there
are a lot of complexity involved and not
only the complex complexity part the
state maintenance as it is happening
through HTTP protocol accessdata stuff
and you should write down piece of code
from your side to maintain the state
without sacrificing cycle scalability
aspects so in case of your concurrent
number of users increases or user base
increases then your application should
scale to meet that requirement so there
are a lot of complexity involved in
development and highly dynamic business
model it changes your business model
changes drastically and maybe like a
couple of weeks before production your
manager may ask you to change the
functionalities functionalities as it is
required by the business so there are a
lot of complexity involved and
time-to-market is another aspect where
you should you may not get much time to
focus on business functionalities so our
technology complexities you should focus
on business functionality and time to
market is very important for any product
so these are the high-level convexities
involved so how do you all come this
kind of complexities by keep picking up
the right framework all right tool and
tools should be the framework should be
durable to label means it should be ID
friendly like you should get a chance to
use a popular ideas like eclipse
NetBeans or something like that instead
of doing coding in text pad so the
framework should be I to label and it
must be simple complete and addressing
all layers of the application and it
should of course run should hide the run
time complexity from the developer so
these are the common solutions what you
should look for
look for and in case if you look for a
framework that means this kind of
solution you may see had lots of things
around you like Jaso could be one
candidate along with that use you may
see a tapestry we could read in GWT
Grail stats &amp;amp; lot more so how do you
pick up the right staff amount from this
crowd you may go for some sort of proof
of concept implementation you generally
guys may pick up some specific use case
from their application and build some
proof of concept then see how a
compatible how how close that framework
meets your use case requirements then
see the popularity of the framework
community acceptance then other aspects
like easier to learn the learning curve
part in GT Vanessa means by looking at
some specific tag if you can guarantee
that the tags going to work in this way
then that is tim laz intuitive NH into
to our indigenous of the framework
that's a very important and standard in
case if you are going for some standard
based framework then advantage would be
like it can run on different platforms
provided the platform supports the
standard then there are a lot more on
top of this couple of things are the
resource availability increase if you
are a manager or an architect who is
responsible for recruiting folks for
developing this something then you
should pick up a framework which has
enough developers available available in
the market then out of the box features
instead of building something from your
side if the framework provides those
features that would be that would save
your time then scalability and
reliability aspects your application you
are a framework your application is
going to work on top of the framework so
framework should be scalable and it
should be liable in the sense whenever
user community check user base changes
your product may have thousand uses at
present and maybe like one year a couple
a couple of years down the line it may
increase to 5000 or 10,000 so you would
application not not fail at that time
you should scale it's should scale to me
the user base so all these aspects of
aspects are very important while
choosing the framework now in case if
you are going to choose the s of us a
framework then there are a couple of
reason for you to choose that one is its
standard based then very active
community if it offers multiple
standardized implementation then
pluggable architecture and support for
internationalization X accessibility of
accessibility part a lot more serviam
but these are a couple of important
points that I am going to discuss then
evaluation of GS of yes oh this is
important when we talk about clothes
bearing of component libraries because
when days of standard normally talked
about mixing different component
libraries because that was literally not
possible at all now let us see like what
was objective behind say defining a
standard like Jays of and where we are
currently the S of when we when Vince
chanted it were easy it was we had a JSR
called jsr 127 and the yessir objectives
were standardized the web UI at that
time we didn't have any standard
framework like yes of a couple of
component or into frameworks were there
one was tapestry and couple more a
couple of things model so 10 BTW
objective objective was to standardize
the web UI and the second one was so I
provide simple Java representation for
pure user interface like you should get
a chance to access the rui as components
from your class and manipulate that then
our automatic generation of output the
output generation should get the couple
from your framework stuff the sense
later point of view if you if you want
to generate output for 10 terminal
device or some other channel then dug
from the developers side it should not
be an issue it should not be an issue in
the sense it should be handled at
framework level one level below so
developers should focus on his business
logic rather rather on the technology
side then Java being modeled for even
handling it's more like
or say the way your desktop applications
works java suing application works where
you if you hit on a button then you may
write on the action action events in
your Java plus the same way why can't we
do that in for a web UI that was the
that was the oddity behind going for
this specific item a couple of things
more validation support support for
internationalization and accessibility
but these were all these were good but
that was not good enough to build huge
enterprise applications so when we when
you see the history of days of started
in 2004 it was based on jay's of java
server jsr 127 and the fire first
release happened in march two thousand
four and later there was a patch set
release which happened in May 2004
because of some bug figs and other stuff
just a minor release without any major
changes the feature then there happened
one more release close to that it
happened mate 2006 that release worm was
more focused on something called the
view handling part and eel expression
handling but again those things were not
enough to meet what community was
looking for or what developers were
looking for so later what happened to us
Jace of two dot or a happened it
happened in 2009 so that was a
breakthrough in industry of jsf in other
words say if you build a day or if you
build an application by choosing Jace of
10 to 1 or 1 dot to I don't think you
would use courgettes of stack as C's for
building huge enterprise applications
you may end up in choosing other
frameworks on which is which is
available on top of GSF because the cold
days of thing what what is available out
of the box were not enough to meet your
requirement so though guys well
there are a lot of smart guys so what
they did was they built a component
things component libraries on top of jsf
and there are a lot of open source open
source libraries were available on top
of years of like say which races for
example icefaces later say a recent past
primefaces came into picture so those
things were actually a jace of one door
to based component labour libraries were
missing one important piece they went
ahead and implemented there on ajax
support their own resource handling
there on CSS handling so what happened
was in case if you if you want to build
some applications by mixing components
from different families it was literally
not possible at all so nobody actually
tried that later in Jace of two dot or
we standardize the Ajax part be in the
sense of the guys who who who is behind
a jace of this standardized a Ajax part
and resource handling part so that
change it the specific that that change
it the development strategy on a waste
on jay's of in the sense you could you
would get a chat you you you can you
could easily pick up components from
different families and try mixing up
still it's not a well proven solution as
such but it became a reality at least
you could give a try so in in the next
next few slides we are going to discuss
where we are like while mixing component
libraries where we are and what are the
possible issues you may see and what are
the force what are the possibilities on
mixing the libraries so jess of 1 dot 0
is the first release and one word one
was a bug fixes and minor E minor
improvements in one dot to like we could
see lot of a few a few few enhancements
like you handling an eel expression and
J steel support but the ace of to doto
is considered as a major breakthrough in
the history of JSO so it has support for
phase late Ajax support then more memory
scopes you
handing his improved a lot more so
that's what we are seeing here and among
these important up say features built in
Ajax support is very important because
till till that time all jase of a based
framework swear go away doing their own
Ajax or cooking their on ajax solutions
so which faces had their on HX solution
and primefaces has they're not primal
primefaces was not there that time and
say I stress has had their so they're on
solutions and like that it goes in jsf
to doctor what happened was all guys
when they hadn't implemented the
standard part so if Ajax became part of
if a colon ejects the that tag became
part of the ace of years of component
library and it has been supported by all
component uicomponent libraries which is
our job now let us see the challenges in
interoperability like in case if you are
trying to mix yes of two dot o based
libraries and what are the challenge
challenges you may face so there are a
lot of Jace of two door based libraries
one is jboss which phase which faces and
ice faces then primefaces urban faces
and lot more n 1 is oracle ADF faces
which client I belongs to that team but
we are not going to you our discuss
oracle ADF here we are focus would be on
open source stuff now why why one
request to mix jess of libraries or why
do why should i look at other libraries
in case if i decide to use say library x
then why should i look at why one reason
is your business use case is very
complex and one specific component
library doesn't provide the things what
you are looking for it provides
partially and partially partially the
rest of things are available by our
available in other frameworks you really
want so you really want to mix those
things and get the best out of it
use case could be say you you have set
of resources available who are will
waste on frame work X and set of
resources available available who are
actually fine with framework why so you
want to make both the teams happy which
may not be practically existing but
still happens then certainly refuges are
better than one framework like that
maybe one more use case then skill set
of developers so how many of you have
happened to or tried mixing different
kinds of JS of libraries so very
successful yeah moving on to our things
yes of 1 dot x 1 dot of 1 dot x based
component libraries were not really
interoperable means you cannot or you
cannot mix those things and make it work
even for simple use cases mainly due to
the custom solution for Ajax and
resource handling it is in other words
when you when you run a page this one
specific library would try to initialize
specific set of Jaws scripts and other
live other components other set of
components from different library would
try to initialize other set of Java
scripts and if these guys are based on
same set of JavaScript libraries say for
example primefaces and which faces use
jQuery us underlying stack the line
JavaScript library let stuff and in case
if they are using different version of
jQuery then you are in trouble so little
it was not possible at all then JS of 20
to put forward an idea of component
library in trouble interop
interoperability by standardizing the
following like Ajax and resource loading
you can see that resource loading means
the style sheet and JavaScript things
which is now actually come Center your
resource folder end is getting loaded in
the order in a standardized way so i am
trying to i'm going to explain a couple
of five or four or five use cases here
we're mixing of component lab libraries
were used these are purely based on my
experience by working with different
say teams with Nora cooler outside
Oracle so these are very basic use cases
but what I am trying to show here is
it's possible and it's not a it's not
i'm not going to say that this is a well
proven solution as such rather it's a is
a first step in the right direction and
maybe like later point it would be a
reality but as of now it is it's
possible but you should be very careful
while doing or while mixing different
component library libraries that's a
disclaimer so client-side validation
support by adding a rich validator which
validator is from which faces it has
certain advantages saying that say it
validates some contents on the client
side so it has a support for that so let
us see like whether let us see whether
we can add the rich validated to any
other UI components so in this example
we are going to use rich validator with
primefaces component say I'm using input
text field from the prime face a
component library and it's getting
validated against which well dated so it
works I will show a demo like how to
discussing these five use cases so it
works so this is 1 this is one use case
where people may go for mixing say tanks
from different component libraries
another use case is lay outing you I
steph layout EU i means many when you of
build you I you I ideally you should not
use any any absolute positioning or HTML
staff for layout in your page rather you
should try to use the layout in
components provided by the framework so
there are a lot of layout in components
available in primefaces and which way is
another other other components so in
case if you feel that a layout in
component from the frame of what you
decide to use is not enough and you
started looking at other
in works then probably you can give it a
try you can get the layout in component
from a components from other framework
and give a try like try mixing different
things that's what we are going to
discuss in this use case so here i am
using panel grid from the pine faces
component library and it's getting mixed
with this is this it doesn't contain any
other component lab component tax it
just contains yes of text but it works
with richfaces components as well so you
can the child components can be from
which faces or from any other component
library so panel get from primefaces
header and footer and load more other
features then one other use case what I
have a notice was a table data table
from one component library and while
clicking on a specific row or specific
button they want to use or the specific
team want once you display the selected
data in a pop-up so the papa could be
coming from a different component
library could be from primefaces or some
other stuff so this also works and the
derivative as well the sense you could
use table from primefaces and pop up
from which faces that also works so
these things are working for a specific
different teams so it doesn't mean that
it may work for like is instead of
instead of following this strategy
blindly you should you should give a try
before before implementing in your
applications because that is there are a
lot of if and else conditions here other
and few things you may need to not not
down our 11 important stuff is while
mixing different components on a same
page you should be very careful and you
should evaluate the strategy before
before implementing in your real life
application get a get a use case from
your application and try out on the use
case by mixing by picking up components
from different
and implement that then run the
application and see the runtime behavior
then see do a performance test and it's
justice before deciding deciding on that
so this use case also works I do how a
demo for this a table from which faces
and a pop-up component from time faces
so this pop-up dialog will display
selected rows detailed value on the pop
on the dialog part then partial view
processing like the Ajax update on a
page so even generation component can be
from a family one and the target
component could be from family too so
that also works then there is something
called so here if you see the input text
from prime phase component and which
panel from which faces so while key in
something in the input text field the
child component into which spanner gets
updated with a kid in value so this also
works this works based on the Ajax part
and so here the point is Ajax source and
target doesn't need to be from the same
family then another common use case
would be how many of you used pretty
faces pretty faces for formula I mean
for what front yeah but so pretty faces
is one component it's not a component
library asset rather it is meant for
beautifying your URLs and other
controller related aspects like you
could provide you are you dynamically
and you can even change the URLs based
on your use cases sajs of creates some
you are like / faces / something dot
Jessup or dot XHTML so if you don't want
to display like that if you want to
provide your own URL then pretty faces
provide a feature for that it is easy to
use it works with all almost all days of
to doto based component libraries so you
just need to configure pretty config dot
XML file in your project that's enough
so i will give you a demo on all these
pieces
so this is a symbol of JSF to DOTA based
application this application has time
faces in place which faces in place and
the pretty faces so the use case 1 it
was while if you remember in the use
case 1 we were discussing about using
which validator along with a non
richfaces component we were using
primefaces component over there
so let me refresh this guy
so this this page contains the layout is
done with primefaces and the inner
components department ID and department
name they are which faces components so
I'm going to end I I have added a
validation for department name saying
that the name should be between 3 and
the minimum number of character should
be three so I entering one here or say
let it be ad tabbing out so you can see
the validation gets fired and if you see
the source code
so we are importing richfaces components
primefaces component and a forge a fold
Ajax so this is the prime faces stuff
and it has a rich message this is from
which faces and a valid validator added
so this gets triggered on completion
completion means on tabbing out and the
validation is minimum minimum number of
character should be three and maximum
should a maximum should be 12 so this
works and if I select that mean and
enter 10 saved now we will go to the
next one
this all about mixing components and
container elements container means
layout in containers so in this example
I am using a outing components from
prime face and that's mixed with or H
faces component so this is the source
for that
so there is a panel grid this is from
primefaces and you could see I have not
added any rich phase component here but
it it was you can try adding that and
this has Ajax Jeff as well it uses Ajax
for updating which span which families
from which faces look as key in value
here
phone number could be say
so we could be those center so you could
see that when I here in term here it got
updated on bottom the first name part so
the Ajax part works and the component
container is through I mean the layout
is done through time phase component
which is panel grid and which provides
it has a header and footer part i'm not
using it here but that would be an added
advantage of using this part and even in
gso has abandoned it but it doesn't have
these features provided by the Prime
faces a panel grid and if you save it
it's saved you can move to our first
thing then the next use case was how to
use which faces table along with or a
dialogue from Prime phase component so
let us go ahead and use it so this table
is from rich faces and let us select a
row here then view Department this table
displays Department Department details
and I want to us a view a specific
department in a pop-up so this girl
displayed so these dialogue is from time
phases and the table is from which faces
so that works and the other way around
we let us see primefaces table and which
faces pop-up let us select the second
row here view employees so here the
table is from primefaces and the
dialogue is from which faces I will show
you the implementation part as well
so this was for let us select this guide
lists so this is for the first one these
tablets from rich faces and on selection
it triggers an AJAX event and it renders
something called dialogue or let us see
where the dialogue is defined it is
defined here and the dialogue is from
primefaces so on selection of the road
this time phase component gets updated
so it means that which phase things
update the prime phase component and
that walls and the other the next thing
was triumph a stable say you have data
table here and this is from primefaces
and the pop-up is from which faces that
go that is getting updated through this
guy the command button from the
component control so this updates the
pop-up panel so this also works this new
shooter now let us move back to our
index page
if for GI now tried that uh it it it
should have worked i guess it i should
work you can give a try have you faced
any issues on that i have you tried that
or yeah I should work at other laws yeah
you may not require that but here the
reason for me to use that was purely
because there was something called while
selecting here oh I just need to update
couple of things which is actually
working with the a forge Ajax and it was
not working with the default what's
called a days of Ajax part and what I'm
trying to say here is a all these things
when I say it works here these are these
were really working for me it doesn't
mean that everything will work out of
the box because there are a lot of
catches here and there and it's not well
through and solution has such whether
it's the first step towards the right
direction because in future maybe likely
sometime sometime later if you are
getting a chance to mix all these pieces
and work other works means that would be
that would be really great because there
are lot of libraries available and and a
few components are actually good in one
library and few components are very good
in other libraries so if you can get
best out of after four then that would
be a good thing to have for the
community that's what we are trying to
see and in case we are if you are
deciding to I do have some guidelines
towards the end in case if you are
desiring to mix the mix the components
then please make sure that you did or
you did enough study on that part and
build a built ap you you you are
supposed to build a POC before before
finalizing on that call because the
peers in POC or proof of conspiracy
means proof of concept that may give you
the caches and the other flaws as well
like it's as I said each component the
major issue here is if you see if you
take pine faces or which faces or
anything any other component libraries
if they re most of the most of them are
using jquery and under the cover and
preferences could be using jacob ish now
jack or evasion or something something
one says XX and which pressure could be
using x dot y or something so everything
is going for going for a toss and the
primaries are put
using jquery UI and other libraries and
which was I may not be using those so
those things are actually like bit
confusing are making putting us in
trouble a slave I mean I'm talking to
you as a developer so we may need to
have some standardized way of doing it
so we do have some guidelines on it i
will talk about these pieces during our
guideline discussion now towards
component update this again i think we
have seen that anyway i will show you
one second so here if I click click on
this thing that you can see that the bid
happens and say at the bottom part under
0 for the first name if i enter say Alex
here it gets updated so here this is
this component is from primefaces and it
updates the rich cases part let me open
the file this guy use f HX and you can
see that it's from time faces and these
parties from which faces so it this
component could be anything this the
part is i'm updating the rich panel the
parent panel
sorry
yeah much all right right it comes with
the netbeans stuff i'll show you one
more demo part demo in the sense in case
if you are trying to build some POS
there is an easy way how many of you use
netbeans for building gaze of based
applications great and have you have you
ever tried using the component part
which is available as part of Azad where
you can pick up primefaces which faces
icefaces tried that ok there is actually
like I think other folks are not aware
of that i will show you like in case if
you are planning to build some proof of
concept and it as an easy way so that
may save a lot of time and you can
directly start working on the POC proof
of concept if you use netbeans that
wizard for building building yes of
based applications so the last part was
the pretty faces where the URL changes
if you see the create I'm going to click
the Create new departments there you can
see that / faces / department / create
dot XHTML so there's you don't have any
control on the URL part if you want to
change that it can be done through
another component stack it's not as
pretty faces so here I'm going to click
on show all departments items so you can
see here the you all URL it comes us or
say demo web app / DPT it doesn't have
faces or doesn't have any other door
text HTML stuff it's done through pretty
faces and if you use pretty faces you
can configure the URLs in web.xml file
saying that for this URL pattern for
this view ID displayed this pattern so
that is what you are seeing here here I
said that / faces / department / you
start exit steam it should get replaced
with / dep t that's why you are seeing /
dep t on top on the you are part so
that's about the use cases now let us
see how to build a simple pio's in case
if you are going to use or if you are
going to try out the component breeding
like
if you want to build a POC and see
whether mixing of the component
libraries works for your application
then there's an easy way download
netbeans and go to the new project
select java web at java web as a project
type project template to ends like the
first one web application so let us name
it as chase of them or something and
here sorry these are default things so
don't change anything just leave it as
is on the next say on the fourth step
select javaserver faces there you may
see something called components go to
the tab then it lists all the components
love primefaces icefaces and which faces
so primefaces actually comes along with
it beans so other than other things you
may need to download and create
libraries I do have libraries created so
I could i'm using that say which is away
which is actually exposed through the
visa through this dialog otherwise this
dialogue would give me a chance to
create library and while creating
library library you are supposed to
provide the jar file so you should have
these jar files locally in other words
say you should use the Prime faces three
door to door jar or something and create
library by click on it clicking on it
and class libraries and select this then
if you click on OK it will allow you to
pick up the jar folder and pick up the
jar for would-be primefaces three todo
treat dot-to-dot jar file so that's it's
very easy once you downloaded the jar
file from the Prime faces folder
primefaces site then it's easy for you
to create a library and provide the lab
I'll say then provide the library
library name here click OK so that's it
you are done with that so I am selecting
primefaces icefaces and which faces and
if you want to see the libraries i am
using for the demo
so they are available locally in my
machine so I am using a birdie faces yes
of 2 3 a 2 dot 3 dot 3 dot gr then try
emphasis so 3 3 1 dot gel and which
faces it has two types one is uin
framework so you should download all
these pieces and provide the names while
building libraries library is actually
one way of grouping all these jars into
one logical name and associating the
name with the project so it's another
way of adding jar files into the
classpath so once you are done with the
library clear creation and ZZ like just
select the components that you want
include in your project click finish
now I do have a local database running
the sens local Oracle Exadata be so i am
going to create n it is from database
let me pick up jdbc demo for example
yeah
so it displays all the tables available
in the schemas let us select departments
and employees and don't include this
kind department's toys next
provide a package name sir demo dot Java
one click finish
so it is generates all the JPA class has
required for getting data from database
now the next step is building jace of
pages there is something called a sub
pages from in dt classes so let us let
us select the ngt classes finish
so that's it you are basic the template
stuff is in place and now if you see the
web pages it has almost all credit
things are created for you like red
means create retrieve update delete
functionality so for all these entities
so you just need to run the application
and test those things now the next part
what do you may need to do is select
that is there the appropriate page and
try out or try combining multiple you is
the sensor components from the different
libraries you can easily do that by
entering the what's called the other
appropriate component part here enter
the stuff what you required now you can
see it fine phasers welcome page
displays buying phase welcome page it's
created by ID then these things are
basic JS of stuff doesn't have any any
framework mixing concept but it's the
next party is actually now ball is in
your court you are supposed to try
mixing different components and see
whether that works for you moving on to
our discussion
now the guidelines always pick up the
best component libraries that meets your
use case that meets your application use
kiss requirements try to stick on it in
case of you there is no common right and
wrong in picking up a component
libraries say it all depends on your
application all the applications are not
unique each applicant has its own use
cases its own functionalities so pick up
the best component library available not
available in the market and try to seek
on it in case if you want to mix
different component libraries then don't
listen to anybody anyone build a proof
of concept and see whether that work for
you if one of mixing of component
library of make worked for one person
doesn't mean that it's going to work for
you it's it's because this no there's no
guarantee that all these component
libraries are following the same pattern
there's no guarantee on it because still
the skinning aspects and other things
are different for different component
libraries so these are first step the
Ajax standardization was the first tip
and it works for a lot of use cases so
you can give it a try check the support
in case if you are running into issues
then the best thing is get a support
from the community and you can don't say
sleep on the issues instead speak to the
component on its like each component
each component as a framework framework
component has their own discussion
forums post your queries and they're
quite active on it they are quite active
so you would get response from them and
if there's something needs to be done
from their side means they would be more
happy to do that so please try on it in
always make sure just keep keep it in
mind one plus one equal to note too when
you mix components because it could be
again lead to one there are issues but
it may work for lot of use cases and may
not work for some use cases so always
build a boc and take a take a call and
posterior is inappropriate discussion
forums then avoid teaching code if you
are not sure
what you are doing like in case if you
are running into issues and if you feel
that some javascript error is happening
then you may end up in writing some code
from your side if you are sure that say
this is a way it should work and go
ahead and do it otherwise don't click
the code instead try to build a page
with components from one family and make
another page from another family like if
you are if you are having components
from one family means it initially I
mean under the cover each user's same
JavaScript library it doesn't count it
doesn't conflict with other components
libraries so there are chances for that
to work there are good chances do it
will work for sure but if you have milk
the moment you are mixing different
company different JavaScript things are
actually getting mixed up into one page
and they may conflict so in case if you
are running into issues and if you have
if you had liberty of changing the UI
then try to segregate the UI into two
pages and then pick up the components
and make sure and build a homogeneous
page in the sense components from one
family put put put those components in
one page and then build the second the
second page by keeping picking up
component components from the second
family that work then check whether if
you hear you I break stick whether it's
related to JavaScript that's a very
common issue I have noticed so gasket
means as i said the jQuery issue because
different component component families
are using different theories so that may
again put you in trouble so just try to
debug that and I find out whether it's
later jquery and there are little crowns
provided like in each lies a specific
specification oj equity by using the
resource tag and all so you can go for
that if that work for you otherwise see
as I said stick on some specific
components for a page and build another
page with different components so I
think we are pretty much done with her
session in summary like in tripura
interoperability operative
interoperability was not easy in Jess of
one dot one dot X based component
libraries but it's possible and we
it was it works for lot of applications
so jess of two daughter is a first step
in that direction and mix the component
libraries judiciously so don't listen
again i repeat don't listen to anyone
try out in iran and make sure that that
work for you so any questions yep is
right
right
the idea is there are the basic basic
and the design architecture of yes of is
decoupled the rendering part from the
you from the UI design from the UI
template in the sense even if you are
building something for a BBY say later
point is a theoretical concept at a
point if you want to target another
device then it should be possible by the
coupling or by by adding one rendering
part for each component so the idea
behind jsf is or one good point about
jay is a feast days of d couples that
are say the rendering part from the
actual component logic so we are
actually by default it renders are such
tml tax so each component are getting
rendered as HTML tags so the moment you
are introduced HTML raw HTML in your
HTML page you are actually bypassing
that rule since you are mixing HTML njs
of so ideally you are not supposed to
mix a J's of tanks and HTML tags
advantages as I said it's a theoretical
advantage in case if you are applying if
you are targeting and the different
different device later on then by
changing the framework component you
should you should get it you should be
able to generate different output for
each component so while generating
different output if you have eh if you
get HTML has say some raw HTML tags
which cannot be interpreted by our
entering logic then you may run into
trouble so that's a one one reason and
another reason is the moment you are
right or put some style sheet then you
are responsible for to make sure that
this works on all browsers now the other
otherwise the underlyings chac say it
takes care of the compatibility
compatibility issues because your
application is supposed to work across
the globe on different process on
different operating systems so the
moment you add custom JavaScript or
custom CSS then you should make sure
that is compatible with all the browsers
or upcoming those waves or went down
better compatibility as well so these
are the things actually what
what I have not used this yes area over
here EDF actually uses Trinidad filter
and that creates a rendering context
which conflicts with conflicts with the
other stuffs other component library so
when I tried I didn't work for me so I
guess we have the Trinidad stuff needs
that taking and once that taking can be
I mean it took means Danny to work but
as of now out of the box it may not work
its area faces here if s is on top of
Trinidad library so that has a genetic
data filter which is configured in your
web dot XML file and when a request
comes it will create a rendering context
which would be used for entering each
component so this guy actually puts
other folks in trouble
ah
sorry
okay oh is it okay okay oh right all
right i think i read that that is
actually tubed by the one primefaces guy
and he provided jar file right so yeah
correct so the story yeah the story
remains same yeah correct hehe what he
did was actually he intercepted that
part and added is something is some
chicken yeah yeah yeah thanks for the
input here when I think it's available
if you google for it I everybody I mean
we would be able to yes yeah right right
correct yeah
I sorry bitch ways from jQuery there is
no nothing like jQuery but what I have
seen is primefaces has in case if you
are running it issues one workaround
provided by Prime emphasis box where I
use a prime faces specific jquery by
using the resource stack so that was but
there we cannot specify the version as
such but we could at least would be able
to download primefaces specific jquery
stuff so which may work I never seen
that any I mean version later things
because the Prime faces needs other UI
plus the core jquery stuff and that is
actually a conflict with richfaces the
urge faces j correlated that's a major
is and maybe like it would be great if
they can communicate and come up some
common stuff but as of now this is the
stage yeah aha
okay it is not okay uh-huh
okay so that worked okay great thanks
for the input here so which I mean is
for actual application you are trying or
okay this for the sake of okay right
which come when you work with which
company you work right okay so so thank
you very much for any more questions
yeah please
Yeah right and that's actually one good
thing yeah I added that yeah yeah
accurate so thank you very much for
joining me i hope you guys found it
useful interesting thanks a lot for your
time and patience here thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
