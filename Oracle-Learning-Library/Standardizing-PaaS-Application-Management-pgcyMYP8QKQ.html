that we are standing between you and the
beer or dinner so we certainly
appreciate your coming for this session
if you don't mind do you guys mind
moving forward so we can have a more
hopefully livelier discussion if you
don't feel comfortable that's okay so up
Thomas was opposed to talk into the
microphones there's really only one
there's I need to talk in there if you
ask a question or whatever we're just
gonna you know the cables like two feet
long here if you ask a question I'm
going to repeat it so that's you know
it's on the recording yeah everything I
think I recorded so no no cursing right
mind your language I believe so yeah all
of it will be available go anish good
stone so I'm as Tobias has been making
fun of me for my oracle t-shirt that's
me and each car marker and dubious
consume and we've been working together
for the last 18 months or so on aspect
call camp we could have chosen a better
name but for better or worse it's camp
its cloud application management for
platforms and we would like to talk
about it today we are pretty excited
about it but you know it's above so we
have a set of slides and we have a
prepared presentation on camp but we
really want it to be more interactive so
this is about standardizing the past
application management but we can talk
about you know all kinds of cloud
standards related issues you know what
should be standardized work shouldn't be
what your pain points are so interrupt
us anytime you know depending on where
you want to go we'll take it from there
so that's the agenda we created you know
for for an outline will do the
introduction and the y wat where and
hopefully we'll have lots of questions
and discussions but we don't have to
stick to that well
wherever you want us to go right so let
me do this and you can start talking
about camp so before we go and we just
wanted to get a idea of you know where
you guys are coming from so by show of
hands how many are using pass in
production now 10 great can I ask you
what what platform to use ok yeah all
right how many how many are testing
kicking the tires one two three four oh
okay that's great so I assume everybody
are almost everybody are familiar with
issues around application management and
pass and experience with a few platforms
right okay so this would be fun yeah so
um it's a fairly small group of people
that have worked on the understand and
so far it's just about to enter oasis so
there's going to be a larger TC formed
around it so we just you know submitted
the draft spec to joy races and there's
a lot of legal stuff around it but that
is past now so or go read at Rackspace
missing board AG software and what way
cloud soft cloud bees and the spec is
you know you can look at the spec if you
look go to that URL that's here clouds
bekstaarr org slash pass it's a fairly
small speck but if you flip to the next
slide I think we can just really like go
through them it's really about creating
a simple as possible api to manage any
application on any pass right because if
you think about it you go to Heroku
google app engine you know dot cloud
jelastic you know whatever it is
cloudbees and um what you know shift
Cloud Foundry wait and so forth
everybody kind of does the same thing
and every time you have to create a new
CLI and you you know you get used to the
interaction it is slightly different
manifest your
approach to manifest and so forth so
it's supposed to be simple and it's
really about managing applications not
about specifying applications right we
include a life cycle model and a
resource ontology really just so not
we're not prescriptive about what kind
of services there should be on any
platform or what kind of what an
application is how many tears is you
know it has or so it's really just about
expose everything as a resource and we
have a list of types of resources and
then you can subclass them you can do
whatever you want afterwards but also
include portable packages so we can have
a an artifact that everybody you know
kind of kind understands as far as camp
is concerned not as far as the
functionality of the platform is
concerned that would be enclosed and
everything clearly heb based we're using
Jason we do not use JSON and XML because
we always feel that's going to be lowest
common denominator we don't need more
than Jason so that's that's what we did
working on extensibility good yeah yes
happy but only one you know Jason is
kind of kind of everybody's favorite
scan sterilization mechanism you know
today but you know if you actually look
at XML you can do a little bit more
victim le validated you can easily
transform it and you can easily extend
it you can manage but you know why Jason
why not XML and is it just because
everybody loves Jason everybody hates me
or do large extent I think that's true
right i mean we are whether we like it
or not a little bit fashion driven right
suddenly something comes on the scene
and and the strange thing is I'm now
beginning to see things like hey maybe
we need it we need a namespace spec for
JSON maybe we need a schema maybe we
need so you know people are starting to
build everything that XML hat right and
pretty soon
too complex and somebody will come
around and say hey I got another really
simple thing why don't remember that so
maybe that will happen but the
interesting thing is in the
collaboration of those seven companies
we had exactly that kind of discussion
and when it goes to oasis that we'll
talk about we'll probably have that same
discussion again you know whether it
should be XML whether it should be JSON
both and our our consensus was that look
regardless of what our biases are the
thing is people are going towards JSON
right that's what they use and so we got
to provide that right now if you say the
one advantage to Jason hands if you have
a JavaScript client it's very easy to
persist that is the one thing well
language bindings are just easier just
executed in the I've got your model
that's and so that's the interesting
part that if you if you so you got to
provide JSON because well that's the
current fashion that's where everybody's
using it and it's not bad and so if you
try to provide XML and actually the
interesting part is the spec allows xml
you just have to define your own binding
right but what we didn't do was define
an abstract model that is sort of as he
said lowest common denominator then you
have XML mapping and JSON mapping and
both those mappings look a little odd
and everybody's and a half you're
totally free to do young format but you
can also do any other liquid yeah it
doesn't matter right we really try to
make this as simple as possible in human
readable this point as possible in yeah
you can it's easy it's trivial to
convert to join XML and validate write
your own you know schema all right next
so the management part so what do we
meet mean by management it's really
getting the application deployed get it
up there then you know the lifecycle
deploy employ start/stop snapshot
suspend restored delete really and it
enables monitoring in the sense that
we expose what's going on in form of
resources and those are inspected all
right if that's a word during the life
cycle but you can always see what's
going on and the component is free to
update what's exposed overtime right so
that's really where monitoring comes in
and okay architectural II kind of it
looks like that you have a bunch of
clients not necessarily computers but
clients right past customers there's an
there's a self-service API then we are
only talking to the platform we're not
directly talking to the application
right so there may be runtime can
contain as firewalls you know whatever
your platform offers it doesn't matter
everything will be exposed by the
platform as a resource very very simple
this is kind of what we're thinking
about right you should be able to use
the same tool the same clients the same
scripts that you've written you know
across whatever your platform is so if
you use your logo isn't there I don't
know it's company you work for but this
was just it is okay okay okay yeah it
was meant to be representative of the
major things all right next one actually
don't know what's next okay
so that's what it just said right
everybody has their own little
management API it's still in command
line interface and they typically have a
web-based console and everything is
unpublished and can change at any point
so we just wanted to you know define
something that that can serve as a
baseline next one motivation why did we
do that do you want to sure talk to that
right so obviously there is no existing
past application management standard at
least that we are aware of there are a
few IAS management standards there is
one on for managing your data CD mi and
so there are few standards at the lower
levels but nothing at mass right so what
is happening is you know as the one of
the previous slides indicated that
proprietary api's are glorified
proliferating because there's no
standard so everybody tries to do kind
of the same thing but in a very
different way right so you can't without
that you can you know bill common tools
or even scripts that will do the same
thing in every place and really it
creates friction and that's sort of the
standard argument for stand it's why our
standards good right the idea is that
you know if you standardize and on some
of the things that our customers pain
points and that would create an
ecosystem then essentially you grow the
pie and every vendor gets a bigger piece
so everybody's happy and the customers
are happy right so that's what sort of
our thinking behind this and we believe
that customers will prefer those vendors
who adopt these standards early so you
know they there are lots of concerns I
mean there's a lot of innovation going
on in the clouds cloud space right and
maybe that's the discussion we should
have there are some areas which aren't
quite ripe for Standardization there
we believe this is one of those areas
low-hanging fruits where you can
standardize and and we think that those
who implement the standard or whatever
comes out of the Oasis TC would would
stand to benefit the other obvious
motivations the typical motivations that
you have for standards are
interoperability portability I don't
want to overstate it I don't think this
spec or any spec is going to make
everything interoperable and everything
portable I mean we have lots of
standards experience and that never
happens so it's more of it will be more
interoperable and more portable rather
than the Silver Bullet right because
when we look at java ee right if you
write to jie api's and you stick to that
yes your portable but you know you run
your production application for three
years on jboss awls and you start using
those specific features then well
obviously your mileage may vary hey one
thing I would add to that is like
typically um camp is a very humble
standard it's very small it tackles an
area that's typically left out but you
get a lot of standards around how does
an application look like you know what
are the sexy things that I could
standardize on but you know these kind
of things how to talk to the platform
it's often just simply left out so it's
very much done with a with an eye on
being complementary to other you know
other efforts and we're going to get get
to that in a in a few slides I think but
the java ee right so there was a lot of
work done on java ee standardization but
Nicola the optional not confirming
features over
wls those actually is nuts to crack when
you were trying to you know can make
some people from the other
he one of the reasons that
the Jewess back was his the beginning
stages was lacking in certain
into a deployment or management and then
I think they try to rope it that
overlying but within the market leaders
are already taken over by ghana yeah I
think that's a good point
well I know the dangers of creating the
exact things that nobody's gonna care
for look like so so I don't know what he
was thinking but if I made quickly up I
think there's this in any standards
effort right you have to figure out
where to draw the line between standard
and or creating a standard so that you
know there is there is consensus around
it and people are happy with it at the
same time allowing for innovation right
I mean you don't want the standards
handcuffs if you will to limit
innovation right so there's that line
there and and I think it's no cloud not
just passed all of cloud is is evolving
and so we have to tread very carefully
and at least that's my perspective right
since he used the phrase I actually like
the phrase humble spec I'm going to use
it really what heinous like the scope is
very narrow and it's a non sexy field
but it's like how do I I mean there's a
there's a consensus in the industry
right now the gate is a good way to get
your application out there it's really
mostly used for the different test case
but it doesn't really cover nicely as
staging a production promotion and so
you still want to keep both but who is
going to standardize on these things and
everything is a little bit different
right because it's not just kid it's
also wears you made it attic directory
and which directories are going to get
wiped out which you're not ready is a
lot of pain around it and if you try to
write an application that runs on pass a
and pass be you're going to be it's
annoying right so that's really what I
meant with humble create a standard
that's not tight to any other standard
right so the you don't have to consume
the whole thing you can get step-by-step
incremental return by just adopting a
small piece and by the way you can read
it in like an hour and it's it's very
easy
avoid winter looking lap swimming and
I'm am kappa you should yeah yeah
exactly and that's actually one of the
discussions we want to have you know
what else should we standardize what
else we should not stand it right right
and that's a discussion that needs to
happen in the community as as we move
along in cloud space because there's a
lot of concern amongst garments among
the industry that you know they'll be
locked in and so it's it's it's
something that will have to be addressed
as we move along yes I think it's very
hard to stand arises because the bus is
such a general word bus is just a
platform so it can mean anything it
doesn't have to be jolly serving can be
regular Java 7 can be for example alas
TV star from amazon which uses tomcat
servers and never use their specific
infrastructure they have like they
recreate new virtual machine so on but
other prop
why my plots do it this way so they can
do it differently I don't have the
virtual think they might have existing
infrastructure and just use just just
rewriting I think that's a good argument
for humble specs right and we will will
I think let's let people get to that it
allows for how it looks like because
we're actually not really prescriptive
about how the pass is structured so if a
vm is part of the platform so be it
right then you you can require a vm but
it's just depends of the always we're
not solving that issue right that would
be this is nostril solution to
everything right and that's why i really
like the phrase humble spank i'm good
i'm certainly going to use that much but
i think that's a really good point and
all the seven companies were acutely
aware right well we all have our own
agenda right we have our own offerings
and we want to make sure that it this
would work with our offerings and we
were also acutely aware that you know
there are vendors that are not in here
and this spec has to work on those
platforms and i personally have you know
i've used various you know including
beanstalk and an Heroku and Google App
Engine to make sure that you know what
we are doing isn't like completely left
field stuff right yes
and in to operate within the law came in
the capital unicity actually helps for
example son application can be run on
openshift another one can be honest
absolutely absolutely yeah and making it
a little bit more portable just takes
the pain out of it you're still gonna
have to port because services only exist
your choice right but you you it makes
it much easier to specifically you know
address the advantages you know the
benefits all right I agree I my personal
hope is that once camp is standardized
at this point it's spec created by seven
companies right and will be
standardizing it this in Oasis and once
that's done my personal hope is that
java ee will and other platforms will
look at it and then adopt it and use the
extensibility framework off cam and put
in what they need to to make it
compliant with camp but that is my
personal opinion all right so why don't
we quickly go through we still on wise i
do want to get into the watts of you
know how things work so this is I think
we're pretty much covered this slide
it's simple restful JSON extensible so
these are some of the use cases that we
were considering do you wanna talk to
the use cases yeah i think we touch the
most of them so you can move from a to
be a big bursting clearly right from
private or public important aspect of
that managing the lifecycle consistently
across these things as you have the
applications on Heroku for applications
somewhere else but
you can have the same kind of you know
tooling around it but it's very
important you know monitoring support is
not clear typically you're going to look
at logs and you know how you get at them
is different it's a you know a
consistent way to you know look at the
monitoring information doesn't preclude
this is not meant to replace logs at all
you still logs is very valuable but but
it's just a different view on what each
resource does and then you can also edit
these runtime parameters right so as you
monitor them you can reset them put some
service in a different mode or whatever
right so that's that's an enabling thing
so use case here it's just a little like
reference architecture if you will we're
on the left side you of an application
development environment and this is
roughly how we think about an
application and the meta information so
you're going to have sources right and
then a bunch of metadata which we know
we're starting to talk about terminology
right essentially we break down an
application which is a term we mentioned
this earlier that we don't use an
application two parts one is like pieces
that you bring to the table and the
other part of pieces that the platform
offers and brings to the table and the
combination of both it's what we call an
assembly we just kind of like the word
that we use instead of application right
and so we have application components
and we have platform components both of
them for men assembly right so before
the assembly gets instantiated and
services in San Shi ated stuff deployed
right and started up everything is a
template in the resource scheme but it's
like brunton parameter is not filled in
yet right to the template so meta data
consists of assembly templates
application component templates and
platform component templates and then
there's another column of pieces that
you may have you don't need to you it's
not required by the Senate and that's
that's a requirement capable
the mechanism where you can say i need
python i need ee 6 i need whatever you
know CDI i need you know whatever you
want but in the labels you use for that
or the specific parameters are the
attributes but that's entirely left to
the platform right also the language how
you talk about it whether you just
request Rubio Ruby 18 or ruby lowercase
Ruby dash 18 or whatever totally up to
the platform right everybody has
different add-ons different services
exposed right um but that's how you
would request them right and then you
could also if you have an application
that can collaborate with other
assemblies but you can expose
capabilities as well right so I'm I'm a
node service or whatever right I can do
web sockets right and that's that's how
you how you connect to me but so another
application can then you know discover
that then it gets packaged in the
simplest case but the most simple case
where all of a sudden my sources became
become application components same
metadata and that gets imported into the
platform where it's being unpacked
nothing changes but platform components
being plugged in essentially in
dependencies resolve right at that point
the platform can say hey Oh hold it
these requirements I can't do that but
that's really the that's that's the
extent of it right and there are other
efforts that take over at that point
where they say well how I didn't how to
describe an application it's a fourth
way so it's very very simple a very
simple model right next same thing you
could also you know to develop the
application in the cloud it's the same
diagram nothing changes except you're
going to have application sources and
components and the same platform right
if you have a platform like cloud piece
has where you can develop online or you
use cloud 99 te or
helios or whatever you know that would
be the there are the diagram so we're
not looking at topology and
orchestration right there's no
description how the application looks
like it's just requirements capabilities
and we are in particularly not talking
about what exactly this database
services or this add-on or this language
thing or you know what kind of modest
motor so load it this is totally up to
the to the platform yes hold that
question we have a diagram for that
doing it yes oh yeah okay we do yeah
okay so yeah so we're not prescriptive
that doesn't have to be a message bus or
you have to have or go to be or you have
to have real or whatever right it
doesn't matter as long as you expose it
as a resource and people can inspect it
yeah next slide it's not managing the
IaaS layer that's below the pass if the
pass has to be deployed on an air is but
we don't care it's totally up to the
implementation of the pass and we also
don't manage the definition of platform
services so we don't tell the service
let's say the postgres service to do
something specifically right we only
deal with the assembly as a whole right
all right next
that's the life cycle very very simple
there's an upload you register an
application so you know the resources
being created right now can inspect it
and of course their failure scenarios I
rounded then it you know can be deployed
it can be customized if you edit it
delete it and Sanchez suspended and
fairly straightforward and you can
anybody can extend this life cycle model
next that's a package we had this
already yes absolutely yeah yeah it's
just you need to support these states
and you cannot in I mean for instance
from deployed to instantiate it you can
have put another state in between there
because that would you know compromise
that operation I think what if it says
if you you can you can you want
explicitly anything else here you can
from deployed you can have a specific
editable state function but whatever no
no cuz the users incredibly cuz then Oh
suddenly now poison or it's an opt-in an
optional state that would be possible
you need to keep these points could be
an answer transcript so packaging format
very very very lightweight we touched on
this already basically our thinking
right now is it's just sit it's a zip
file with a special place where the
metadata in oversized and that's it yeah
so you could have another year file in
the if you if needs be right next I just
want to brush through so so we can talk
about stuff that's more interesting yeah
any security we talked about the first
button bullets already number five is
like we don't specify an authentication
system everything is just based on till
SSS all right and
here examples do you want to talk to the
sheraton okay yeah this is this is where
the humble spec part comes in it I put
up a we put up a few examples they're
really simple so this is this slide
assumes that you already uploaded the
package either you're developing in the
cloud or you took some step to upload it
and what it doesn't really have to do
the AB let me back up let me explain
what this is trying to do so it's trying
to deploy an application right and this
my pass thing is your entry point that's
the URL of the platform so that's all
you have to know to begin with right you
know the URL of the platform it's / my
past and to deploy an application you're
going to do a post pretty that's what
most people do and you're going to
through JSON you're going to say PDP
stands for platform deployment package
that's what we call our deployment
package you point to the URL now this
URL may be relative so it's already
there or it could be somewhere else and
it will just suck at it right if the
platform allows so you assume that you
use yeah so if there's a get URL here it
will just if if the platform supports
that right it will just some platforms
may say hey I'm not going to just
randomly pull something that you
appointed me to write so but the
protocol itself doesn't assume anything
it says you you you point me to the URL
and you say we haven't talked about that
yet because upload is a separate step
but that's something that that could be
that could be done right you could yeah
that's a good point that why not allow
my multi-part and have the package in
that sure might be there yeah you have
right thing that's a good point right
now it's not in there but that's
something that could be considered by
the technical committee so all right so
we are getting close to the end so I'm
going to rush stop me if there's details
you want to know also I think we are the
last session so maybe
and stay long it was that there's one
more okay all right so you do a post you
point to the URL that's the request if
it succeeds it's going to send a request
response back it says 201 created and
the reason is you ask the platform to
deploy so it's going to create a
resource that represents the deployed
application and the location header
right here it's a standard HTTP header
for 201 it's going to point you to the
location of the application okay the
deployed application so now once it's
deployed so this thing that it sent you
back is my path / template / one it
could be anything and once you get that
you can now start that application by
doing a post on the URL that you got
back right here right in the previous
slide you got back my pass / template /
one and that's the one that you use to
post so you basically close to URL but
you could also do other things we might
multiple deploy oh sure sure sure no
this is just an example right so the
example I'm going through is ok you are
going to deploy you're going to start
and you go to monitor but you're right
instead you could apply and say yeah I
don't like it I'm going to underplay
sure indication of what the action is
that you want to post and so you're
assuming that's the only thing that this
next is to start why would you that's
the life cycle diagram right at least
those things you can do now see some
major points in time I want to
another atom action after the after
after the you upload the one is out no
no via our time is not up yet the lights
yeah I still got time go ahead my point
is it might be useful to add a secondary
verb to this post that says what you
actually want to change what does so
let's say you have a custom stage that
you added yourself yeah that goes oh
that's custom are you talking about
customization time you add additional
stage to respect like what whichever at
which point in time it might be useful
to actually specify in the post what you
want to do rather than simply say
potions URL but see this is one state
machine transition so at the end of this
one you're going to be in deployed state
now everything's open again the next
request will transition to the next date
so this is wait am I not understanding
this is an example right I picked an
example of okay let's yeah maybe we can
talk weekend sorry or you can do a get
on it and it will tell you right oh yeah
yeah so this you know this is just an
example you can do so we really wanted
to stick to the usual get foot-post so
if you want to do if you want to create
something you do post obviously if you
want update something you do a put so in
the previous so go back there so when
you deployed you got the URL back right
you may decide yeah this template i want
to tweak it right so you can do a put on
this and say instead of this
configuration i want to change to
something else you can get get it back
and see what you actually did you know
maybe few days later that supports get
for instance right once it's deployed
once you know once the application is
there you can change it you know
api and the state transitions because if
you only in this example we only see the
posts and they go like one yes you'll
see some gifts you don't see some gets
yeah just just two more sign alright so
you started and and what i want to show
here in my example is that you post it
to the template right and you started it
and you get back the resource URL of the
running application which is separate
from the template right so now you can
use that URL you know oops i went too
far ahead hola there we go so you can
use this app / one and you can do a get
you want to monitor what's going on in
the running application right so you do
a get on the same URL you got back and
this is a few things that we define but
it could be anything in there it could
be some resource utilization data
whatever you want it to be right so in
here it just you know says what the URL
is named what application components are
the thing I wanted to show was that
basically we we are trying to follow and
encourage the model of you you do get on
the application or the assembly rather
and you can see you get an array of
application components that are part of
this assembly right so now you can go
drill deeper these are just your eyes
the hf so you go say oh yeah i think
this application component is of
interest to me and i'm going to go get
more data you can do that you can look
at what platform components are in this
assembly and you want maybe this points
to some database component you want to
see what's going on there so you can do
a get on that and get some more
monitoring data perhaps right so that's
that's sort of the idea it's just an
example i just want it i put it in there
because it's sort of you know sort of
the standard pattern in in Haida ways
where you sort of have templates and
that's the container for all your
templates and apps is container by eight
that's up to the platform right so if
you go back you never
rely on any knowledge when you start
right all of that you got through this
location header and it can be whatever
the platform want seem to be you just
walk the tree maybe there's a query
parameter yeah very impulsive is a not
very important we are not prescriptive
the URL space all you have clue is no
the platform URL and that was one of
your questions right and two more slides
and we'll get to that how do you
discover things yeah so you just know
the platform URL and you can do a get on
the platform URL and it will tell you
what assemblies are there what templates
are available what platform component
templates are available so if you want
to customize your template maybe there
are two platform component templates
right one a database template that's
tuned to oltp another one that's tuned
to data warehousing right and when you
deploy the application you might want to
say oh yeah this is a data warehousing
so I want to use this particular
platform template right and so you can
customize all that also keep in mind
that it's not a finished standard
there's an issue action actually against
like how would we do the start
specifically but it's not defined today
right there's some people on a more
restful other people and have a command
in the URL you know whatever there's
like philosophies maybe you have a start
and like a whole load there's something
that's loads exactly exactly but that
isn't that's the extensibility pointer
if you define this hot load you well
there's there's actually there's an open
issue that we inherited to the to the TC
that's being formed right now that talks
exactly about this how we're going to
return this full head OS in the body
right and then you know there's like it
typed transitions basically so there's a
create length and there's a hot load you
know a hot deploy link or whatever we
that's not sanitized today right
mechanism ain't the vocabulary right we
just need something like that right so
this is briefly this is like the kind of
resource types that you can walk
the in the and the platform api it does
not show lifecycle transitions right
it's just resource models so you you
come in through the root URL you get a
resource for the platform that links to
a bunch of assembly templates and
running assemblies modulo of course the
no permissions then you sorry then from
there you're a Mac no yeah y'all leave
it there no the other one the simpler
one yeah why am i pointing over there
again so now the blue errors really
instantiations right you can discover
the assembler templates you can look at
the application component templates that
consists of you can inspect requirement
and capabilities from there you can see
what kind of platform component
templates would that link towards you
know what are the candidates on the blue
side and then later on of course what
kind of platform components is
instantiated with that it that allows
you to see okay how did the platform
match my requirements up but end you can
also then link to external components
right at dns service or another
application running on a different cloud
these kind of things and add on but
that's not not exposed as a platform
component yeah we're getting we have one
more minute so maybe so this this is the
slide that I wanted to show you but
maybe we can talk offline basically
these red arrows are the red arrows are
you navigation points so all you need it
all you know is the platform URL and
then it's going to it has all these
arrays it's hard to kind of read from
there but these are Jason arrays to
which are really pointers to all these
things and you can navigate this graph
without any pre-existing knowledge of
how the platform surfaces things for you
so it's all dynamically discoverable I
think this is the important part I do
want to say before you're done with the
session which is all the seven
participants have
agreed to contribute to the Oasis TC
there's a new technical committee in
oasis that has been formed and this is
really a call for participation you know
help us standardize this there are you
know it's not done it's a v1 and we
expect that more companies and
individuals will join to help us refine
this back and make it a real standard
that's widely implemented and specs
specifically I want to call out that
there's a lot of work to be done in
defining the extensibility model and
packaging and testing so it's it's very
transparent very open all mailing lists
are public so even if you don't want to
necessarily contribute because of you
know company obligation so whatever you
can still monitor and find out what's
going on and the first meeting is 23rd
of October so if you want to help us
join before that all right so we have
had lots of discussions some of the
questions we thought would be useful for
structuring that but you guys have been
very interactive so we didn't really
need this light but I mean if there are
things that you think should be
standardized or should not be
standardized and we are certainly happy
to hear that before before you continue
let me make my lawyers happy the things
I was thinking about it and this is like
I know that the the kind of the IaaS
level is outside other scope and so you
certainly would expect expect to be able
to create new instances but a lot of the
things is really
is to be able to discover other
instances because you are basically
working on the particular level you're
working with this rest api and your kind
of fully going to the employments and
all that kind of stuff it might be
useful if that API could actually tell
you what platforms there are so rather
than you talking to your I ASAP I is to
figure out what firms are you staying
within this API if we do list of all the
platforms and what what do you mean by
that i mean it's super rude you oh right
yeah can use various techniques to to
just to discover so you might be able to
i guess the platform is what I consider
a vm a clown p.m. okay yourself correct
instead of trigger um I wouldn't I I
didn't define it that way yeah so if you
had the capabilities requirement
requirements Callie they are on their
work way in battle during and because if
you had a list of the say images that
could satisfy the requirements that are
given up casement us you could start
spinning of those I guess to have a say
one where are you going to spin it with
with weblogic that could satisfy the
requirements are in that case and they
could be cobbled and you could start off
the correct the correct word room I
think it's um it's very important to see
that this kindness isn't does not say
what are the Laura what are the items
that make a platform right it's totally
reasonable to assume for instance if
your company that sells wordpress drupal
and let's say sugar serum or whatever to
a bunch of other you know and users
right then your IT department could have
given you a pass that you know you can
use to stand up individual VMs put every
single application
in that case the vm is one platform
component and they're they're going to
be four of them 33 right so it depends
but the platform what is what is the
priority of the platform yeah and I get
this is of course something that is in
the lair from that is something about
how the fastest actually implement it
may be implemented until then yeah and
then the past would decide to expose
this to you right right and vendors
currently do that if you look at amazon
Beanstalk they're all about exposing is
layer because they're in the business of
selling that right so they expose
everything if you look at Google App
Engine right up you don't see anything
you can say things like okay if you're
paying customer you can say things like
I want minimum of five instances up to
max of whatever and you deploy your
application and then you go CEO I got
all these various instances you do not
know what's underneath and you don't
care right so there are lots of
different models that that people are
using it'll be interesting to say see
how it was right so you you had a sorry
you had a question earlier and I thought
it wasn't fully address and it was going
to be addressed later I can't remember
what it was can you remind me what it
was did I did I answer that later and
they're plenty by the way i should say
before before you go on when we finish
the spec we when i say finish the
version 10 we still had a list of issue
we still do and when we contribute it to
oasis we're going to contribute the spec
and the issues both so it's you know you
don't think of this as the final finish
right cuz so branch person
so the whole point that allows you to
scale but again with Amazon you kind of
manually say like when this special is
out over the limits Internet to another
virtual machines but for example will
happen don't do that you know you don't
have know it but it's also affecting for
example the Amazon site they consolidate
all the infrastructure infrastructure
resources and then then they put the
stomach yeah I mean that's something
that we are not you know this standard
is not going to solve right maybe what
we can think about is maybe in your
package when you deploy you have some
sort of policy right and there's well
there's no standard for a policy maybe
there's something we could think about
that you know when you deploy you you
stayed up front what the policy is with
respect to how the elasticity works or
it doesn't work right but let's well the
idea is that you wrap this into a
requirement right if you deploy to a
platform that does not have a notion of
VMs or notes or whatever quite then you
just say I need but it gives you
abstract computer units or whatever
right and you say give me this service
may be big table or whatever in not
computer units but storage units and up
to that many storage units right so we
kind of like think of it think about it
and there's a place to put this into
your apt descriptor but we're not
prescriptive right again it really
really depends what what are the
elements what are the different little
animals that in you know Paz exposes to
your application whatever knob so that
it can tweak
like a push kind of thing so like use
web sockets or something like that too
no comment or post show anything like
that but the monitoring so the resource
would be also the place for monitoring
these kind of things right so you see at
this point for instance in my database
service my David database component is
ninety-eight percent full or whatever
now the spec doesn't give you a channel
where you can say give me a call back
here but because if that's a desire it
could go into the boys a spec at this
point it would be a self-made solution
and I nagios or whatever you're going to
you right now we only have put set a
trigger on that we don't have the push
model we only have pull but that's
actually a very interesting thought
maybe that's something we should include
now that web sockets is available to do
a bi-directional communication right so
yeah iiii think that's a really
interesting time because you and you
should be able to set triggers right
that hey if it goes about you today she
knows about whatever ninety percent push
right so you know
yeah that's going into actual platform
component mallet management that we are
trying to stay awake sure absolutely
absolutely key point is that the
standard enables that right we're not
going there but it enables that I mean
coming from a place where I've worked
for founded a company that had
application management pretty much at
its core it is immensely tricky to get
this right threshold sounds super simple
initially and there's so many cases
where people just get fed up because you
it's too low level and the root cause is
always much more high level but yeah I
think the key at this point is to get
enough input and make sure we don't you
know lose sight of something right you
should join the TC and help us do that
no I'm very serious one thing I wanted
to ask is I know your redhead but um
which companies do you work for if it
matters
insurance ok ok i danmark
university okay research okay good yeah
cool well thank you very much and
hopefully you go have a beer or dinner
bank job we really appreciate you coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
