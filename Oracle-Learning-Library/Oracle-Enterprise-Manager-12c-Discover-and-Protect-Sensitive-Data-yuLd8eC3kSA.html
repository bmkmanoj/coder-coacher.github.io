discovering and protecting sensitive
data using 12c we will cover the steps
required to build your application data
model with automatic discovery of
sensitive columns
as a first step we will navigate over to
enterprise menu go down to quality
management go down to data discovery and
modeling the following page shows you
the graphical display of the various
processes that can be followed in the
data discovery and modeling we will then
go over to actions and identify
sensitive columns let's hide the top for
better visibility under actions will
select sensitive column types this page
lists all the out-of-the-box sensitive
column types that have been created I
have gone ahead and created additional
sensitive column types as you can see
for the purpose of this demonstration we
can either create from scratch or we can
select by clicking on a particular
pre-existing sensitive column and select
create like once we do that we can give
it a name in this case for example tea
PCH seafoam and provide a search pattern
criteria for the sensitive column type
that will allow our data discovery and
modeling to pick up any sensitive
columns as we will show shortly since
this has been pre-created we will cancel
this as the next step we will now
navigate to the home page of data
discovery or modelling true now we will
go ahead and create our application data
model we'll give it a name select the
database to introspect RTD M in this
case let's click on continue we will use
our store name credentials log in and
select our sample schema to create our
ADM on and click on submit
at this stage automatically the system
is interrogating I'm building an
application data model
once it is complete we will see the
succeeded we can go ahead and select and
edit use our name credentials and notice
that the TP CH schema has been
introspective as we had selected in our
discovery in our creation phase our ADM
the referential integrity is also being
gathered we will now discover sensitive
columns by clicking on the sensitive
columns tab under actions we will create
a sensitive column discovery job click
on the application that we would like to
select from and select the columns that
we would like it to be interrogated we
will select 3 in this case
and click Submit let us save and return
to see the status page as you can see it
has succeeded let's go ahead and go into
it to see what columns have been
discovered select the ADM and edit
continue let's navigate to the sensitive
columns under actions look at the column
discovery results we noticed three
columns were set to be discovered let's
mark the columns of interest is
sensitive expand scroll down and set
status as sensitive repeat the process
for the next two clicking ok and we'll
see three columns have now been
identified and marked as sensitive
should we need to add a column as
sensitive manually we can do so as well
search for the application name search
for the table may identify the column in
the table that is to be recognized as
sensitive associate that column with the
sensitive column type click OK now we
have four columns save and return this
completes the discovery of sensitive
columns for an identified application in
the data discovery in the modeling
section as a next step please proceed to
the screen watch on data masking
including real application testing
integration thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
