for the osgi solutions with Hitachi in
particular hitachi here in america which
were young the CTA division the
communications in tech communications
telecommunications division here and i'm
going to talk to you about doing
enabling smart data on m2m gateways and
aggregators so this is kind of the
agenda will run through this feel free
to stop and ask questions at any point
if you want to also give us some time at
the end ask questions will give a brief
emblem overview talk about aggregators
why we think they're kind of important
what role they play some of the
developer challenges with those and then
looking at how osgi helps to solve some
of that and then we'll I'm going to show
you a live demo of a of the NFC demo
that's being done here in the demo
grounds over at up the hilton on the
third third floor fourth fourth what
other for that is and so y'all could
start here so I'll show you that so it
kind of put some of this stuff in action
its first quick mm overviews most people
are people familiar with them down in
general so you know this Internet of
Things the idea of having all your
applications talk upstream you have a
bunch of devices small devices devices
that are becoming more and more
intelligent there's a big push with the
Java embedded conference going on now
push intelligence down to those devices
most of the time it's going through a
cloud pushing up the enterprise out into
the the cloud click and global analytics
making decisions about what's going on
and we have everything from telematics
like connected vehicles now you know if
your washers and dryers are becoming
connected to stuff you have light
switches there's all kinds of devices
smart meters for smart energy that are
out there
a general architecture of it kind of is
layered out is here and the key here
without going into every layer of it is
one of the things at oracle and hitachi
or are pushing and building the
ecosystem around is is it is java from
end to end java from down them to the
devices all the way through java on the
back end of the system as that gets
pushed as the data gets pushed up into
the servers and as we make smart
decisions down on the client-side device
for this talk we're going to focus on
that client-side device the back end
piece is they're probably talking about
that down the street at the moscone
center here i'm going to focus on on
this piece and what we need to do down
on this up the aggregator site of it so
what are aggregators with all these
little devices and all the sensors and
all the various things are out there
kinda think of an aggregator is a device
to control all the other devices you
have various things running around in
these in these networks everything from
Wi-Fi Bluetooth zigbee z-wave deck IP
with other protocols over the IP how do
you talk to all those devices how do you
collect the data how do you make
actionable data and smart data out of
the things around there and that's what
an aggregator will do for you in the
network the picture before had one big
kind of cloud that first picture that I
showed here what you see is you had a
house over there with the blue roof you
have an aggregator there collecting some
sensor and some data from the the house
that may be being pushed up to the cloud
down here in the orange roof you have it
might be industrial it might be big
medical where you're also collecting
sensor data and data from all these
devices sending them up to the cloud if
you're a car there are tons of sensor
data on a car I don't know if how much
you're aware of it
side of your little LCD screens now that
show you infotainment they are now
putting the ability to gather the sensor
data from all the stuff that they use
when you go and plug into the mechanic
now when they plug into the computer and
tell you everything that's going on in
your car so you can know your tire
pressure but your latest gas mileage is
everything else so their aggregate all
that data now on vehicles and then of
course into the cloud from the back end
you've got people who want to use it to
see the data to make decisions about the
data so these gateways these aggregators
are kind of forming a dual role role
first one is how do you control this
myriad of sensors that you have out in
the out in that loca loca larrya or the
locale that you're in you need to be
able to aggregate that data grab it from
them yuba need to provide local
management how do you know whether yours
it'd be device went off for online all
right it's a local low-powered RF signal
it may only reach from here to the back
of the room that it doesn't match to go
to the next thing how do you know
whether one of those things went out not
and some models that you see people from
at well maybe that's all gets pushed
directly back to the cloud but if you
start thinking about the numbers of
those devices that's a lot and how do
you manage that from back all the way up
in the cloud for those individual
sensors and a house or a hospital or a
car so you're providing that type of
management ya'll said Friday management
of what i like to call local analytics
we can call it edge analytics which is
can i be smart about what i do with the
data in particular think about
communications industry if i have a
truck that's carrying as a refrigeration
truck is carrying food on it I'm
monitoring a bunch of different things
on that truck including its gas mileage
it's you know how the truck is working
them also measuring the refrigeration
and I might be measuring did something
tip over in the back
how far did it drop so a lot of times
I'm collecting that data and I really
don't need it for anything right now I
can afford to wait till I pull into a
state docking station somewhere get
Wi-Fi uploaded over or fast Wi-Fi local
network and push it to the cloud that
way but if I'm carrying strawberries to
walmart they happen to be peculiar about
how far a pallet can drop before they
reject that pallet of strawberries what
if you find out they dropped that's a
decision I might not be able to make
locally I need to crank up my 3g network
fire off something to the cloud so that
guy can make some bigger decisions those
might be it's a thousand dollars for ten
thousand dollars with the strawberries
and you've got five million dollars
worth of stuff on the truck take it all
we know they're going to reject it it
could be though that you know what we've
dropped too many pallets already
Walmart's going to be upset if we
deliver another pallet of dropped
strawberries stop the truck turn it
around don't worry about the other stuff
on there right that's making it a
different business decision based on
global knowledge instead of local
knowledge but you want that ability to
do that local analytics you want the
ability in the Gateway side to say hey
what if I need to arm change the
temperature in the back of the truck
what if I can sense what the Sun
temperature is outside right so I know
my lead time on cooling the inside of
the truck so as I feel the outside
temperature getting warmer I can
automatically start raising you know
cooling the temperature inside to be
ahead of the game by especially sure or
truck driver through the Mojave Desert
so that type of things but the other
things you want to be able to do is to
change that behavior dynamically based
on global analytics you will the bigger
picture so that guy's taking pictures of
the trucks driving through the deserts
all over the place and they may now
determine that you need to start sooner
of cooling the truck
the back to keep things from perishing
right because they're noticing a trend
you want to be able to now download to
that aggregator just a locally change
your decision making start sooner right
and that's something that the the local
guy couldn't have known he has to get
that from the global so that's the rule
that we see those are kind of the two
major roles that receive these
aggregators playing in the MDM space so
what are some of the developer
challenges of building one of these
aggregators typically there are a lot
being done by embedded development right
now in the indian space and so they
follow kind of a traditional development
model which is I have my Hardware
usually has some sort of Linux kernel on
it I go do my appt get for GCC crank up
my VI start writing my C code maybe I
maybe I'll use Eclipse and download and
compile with no and download it and I'm
writing basically C code directly to the
colonel that's the way the majority of
the embedded development is still done
today here's the big problem with that
which I virginity which aggregator
device you pick to run your application
on because when you do that as you know
I have challenges depending on which one
of these guys I picked depakote you know
if I'm doing a home application is it an
actiontec home routers of his eyes L
home router am I going to use a plug
computer you know plus my processor arm
was it nips what's a PowerPC is it an
Intel box all those things start to come
into play when you start to write your
application for that guy right so as we
know if I see you're going to be tightly
coupled to the CPU it's hard to change
the apps and mainly running on other
devices becomes complicated so you might
have had a good solution for a
particular market on a particular
gateway but you now can't take it to
another gateway the same application
that can monitor
temperature on a refrigeration truck
could do the same thing in this room
here right you could sense what in San
Francisco you can't just go by time of
day right as we've noticed the past
couple of days it can start out in the
week we're at seven o'clock in the
morning it's 45 degrees and by now
yesterday I think it was like 80 by nine
o'clock if you're standing in the Sun
right that same map could work here and
do the exact same thing you did with the
truck with some slightly different
parameters but unfortunately you go
truce with the aggregator that they use
on the truck right not the one that they
would put in this building which might
be on a standard Wi-Fi router inside
here obviously one of the main solutions
of that is you put Java on the device
right assuming since everybody's here
your Java programmers so big push and
the conference starting today with Java
embedded is you can put Java embedded on
that device that ranges everywhere from
very small Java ME CLD c and java card
all the way up through java java SE
embedded if you don't know a lot about
the java embedded that's the embedded
direction and what's going on Bob been
daddy's is doing to talk tomorrow he is
a duplicate of one that you did
yesterday where you kind of gives a road
map of what they're doing with Java
embedded and the different profiles and
it's the size you can get that down too
but there's still some challenges what
about lifecycle management so I want to
do this dynamic loading and updating
still have that issue now with with Java
what do i do right I want to be able to
install uninstall start/stop update
these applications on the fly without
impacting the other behavior of the box
just because I'm going to change the
temperature thing you know dynamic on my
truck doesn't mean but I want to stop
monitoring the gas mileage or the brakes
or other stuff while I change it out and
reboot the JVM to load in your applicant
to load this new application on it you
may have the need to run multiple
versions of the same app at the same
time
just based on sensor data other stuff
you may have old sensors new sensors at
the same type you may have things you
need to run and again dynamically
changing that behavior is one of the
things you want to be able to do but
worse than that is what is the sensor
environment that you're going into first
you got these blue things which are the
protocols do I have zippy do I have
z-wave is it x10 is it bluetooth is it
lo pan maybe maybe it's using deck maybe
issues in my bus by using profinet
there's just a gajillion of these sensor
protocols out there and once you solve
that then you gotta figure out what what
sensors are talking to is it a
thermostat is a glucose monitor right is
it a blood pressure monitor is an
accelerometer you know a motion detector
what what am I talking to so when you
look at that that device problem that we
solved originally with Java becomes
magnified now because you have the every
combination and permutation of that was
it an intelligent smart plug connected
to X 1004 zigbee if you know anything
about the protocols you'd have to write
a different different application to
talk to those three different plugs so
now just imagine you're doing that for
every device and you're trying to work
in a bigger environment so as then they
said in the keynote the Java keynote
never talked job-embedded is you know
they're trying to get the nine million
Java developers to focus on the embedded
space that's not going to happen if
every java developer has to learn this
type of information every time right
because we don't have the time to learn
that you want to write the application
you want to write the intelligent piece
the piece that's determining what to do
with all the sensors and when to upload
the data and doing the smart analytics
and coordinating with the global
analytics most people really don't want
to go learn the gory details of zigbee
or so
wave there may be a few in here but now
that's most of people that's not what we
want to be doing and that's not how you
get nine million developers talking to
the embedded space because that's going
to be a small percentage of those nine
million that want to get down to that
level so our solution that is we put OS
Jain now on top of the Java and I so the
combination of Java with osgi gives you
these smart data aggregators for the MDM
space so how many people are familiar
with osgi or know about OS John wow
that's cool those usually don't get that
many hands people of either just barely
heard of it but well good so if you
notice on that first slide where Java
fits in its fitting in above the job
embedded is providing container services
etc actually few know anything about
glass fishes up here that they also
Oracle now also has a product run glass
official in some of the embedded space
it runs on top of Java osgi it's an osgi
enabled application container for it and
so I don't have to hit this hard because
I think most of the people raise their
hands were being familiar with osgi you
know you have the dynamic loading I can
load bundles in and out dynamically I
can start and stop them I can Emma
little versions of a bundle I can group
bundles into deployment packages so that
I can have a kind of an entire
application suite that's deployed at the
same time that managed as a group
because of that I can run multiple apps
on that same device I can kind of take
the apps in and out will come back to
this a little bit more in a minute that
they shared services services make what
we're going to talk about this
abstraction and being able to make some
of this stuff vanilla to everybody
possible the micro services that it does
where you can publish you can track you
can go query what services are available
that services dynamically come in and
hour
scope you can listen for the services so
that you can really in a dynamic way
especially in the sensor environment
leverage pieces underneath so that you
don't have to worry about some of these
details of sensors and then because of
the dynamic loading another so if you
can do remote management so this can
actually be connected to a cloud server
or management server up in the
enterprise that downloads the
applications to do your dynamic updating
of your business logic so this is what
the picture looks like that we showed
earlier once we add in the Java and the
OSGi so you have your Java it could be
se embedded or any your osgi framework
on top of that you have these
abstraction bundles this is where you
can think of also is where the
compendiums would sit if you're familiar
with osgi you get all the compendiums
everything then you start adding layers
in this blue of applications and
applications on top of applications
right so now I can come up with energy
control application it gets abstracted
from the zigbee and the z-wave and then
I can then go write an application
bubble that can take care of energy
control but then it can also go look at
appliance control and start to figure
out oh I can delay the start of the
washing machine based on the energy
usage in the house right or any other
device that may be a heavy load device
for that so you know this new model
while it looks like there's a lot of
heaviness added to the embedded device
turns out not so much this can get down
into you can get java SE embedded coming
in java 8 we have a version for java 17
that you can get into about 10 mega
flash the osgi framework full-blown with
compendiums is only about another 1.5
Maggie if you just need the framework
itself it's you know a couple hundred k
if you go Java ME you can get that over
light for mag
flash for CDC if you need cldc you can
go even smaller for that so on top of
that and this is just kind of another
view of it is adding these abstraction
layers so what we're showing here is as
you get into that what was kind of that
purple blue area I now start to add
abstractions and add abstractions on top
of abstractions one of the things we're
going to show here is ABS igby Z and Z
Wave running on this device over here
and we have a another layer called pan
services which abstracts the zigbee and
the z-wave interface so you could write
just a zigbee if you wanted to or you
can just talk to our pan services and no
i won't i want to thermostat is there a
thermostat out there is there a smart
switch is there something that's
measuring humidity right and I don't
care how it was connected zigbee z-wave
x10 right don't care i just want the
device we're also doing that with the 3g
4g cellular networks as if you've ever
dealt with that you know a modem is not
a modem is not a modem it's supposed to
be all the 80 command set but it's not
all the same 80 command set and whether
you're using the wall way or the
erickson chips and antenna depends on
what kind of 80 command set and
sometimes it comes on who you're
connecting to again your application
just wants to send an SMS message right
it doesn't want to have to know the 80
command set of the wall wait ship to
send an 80 commands up so then you build
your applications then on top of that
and one of the things I'm going to show
here in a little bit is this java one
NFC demo that we built on top of these
pants services to do this one of the key
pieces of this and and one of the the
main areas that that makes this possible
we saw that earlier was is the osgi
services
I don't know you've probably used them
if you've used a less GI they are
extremely powerful I know last year at
javaone there's the guys that wrote osgi
in action did a whole talk on how to do
osgi services and some of the cool stuff
that you can do with them you know and
the big thing is is that they're dynamic
so with OS giant services when I
abstract that USB port so the way our
code is actually written and we take
advantage of it so we kind of practice
what we preach for this we first
abstracted a serial USB actually what we
do is we abstract it a serial interface
then there's like a serial USB interface
alright once you have that when you plug
in one of these dongles they show up as
a USB serial port it's the way they show
up in lenox you had to work through some
complexities are figuring out whether
that shows up is dev TTYL us be 0 or dev
TTYL USB / 0 or dev because
unfortunately Linux is not linux is not
linux when it comes to that but again
that's some of the complexities that
these abstraction layers are taken out
of the taken out of the equation for the
then developer right with that though I
can now listen and say at my higher
level say hey let me know when something
plugs in then I can discover what that
is and you discover by using some
metadata because all the USB devices
give you metadata so the zigbee and the
z-wave can now listen to the USB
services with a service tracker and say
hey just let me know when stuff plugs in
if the USB if the ZB plugs in he can now
go connect to that dongle and start to
say what devices do you have then he now
publishes those the services upstream
from him so that people that are just
listening for CB and z-wave now knows
something happened that gets pushed up
to the pan services are now from an
application developer you could listen
at that higher level and just say let me
know when a thermostat comes online
right exactly have a thermostat
application and I don't that's what
want to know so that's how they're
really being used and also allows you to
use them in ways that the original
developer didn't expect you can start to
do mashups of these things that other
picture before where I showed no now
suddenly somebody who just thought they
wanted to do the summer stock they now
realizes that they could start talking
to the washing machine decides that can
oh I can combine these two services in a
way that neither of the original guys
thought about or the original developers
thought about so that starts to expand
what you can do on these gateways and
aggregators and making intelligent
decisions and controlling controlling
everything or download the device since
we're a job with one I think everybody
has to put code snippets and the slides
so this is not to meant to be a tutorial
on the best practices of how to use osgi
services if you want that I do recommend
that book osgi in action there get it
they'll explain it good details but this
is just kind of an example here where if
I just wanted to buy a smart plug which
I have a couple of them over here I can
just go out and basically query the
service and say hey do you have a
service that's a smart plug I get my
reference now I can go turn the smart
plug on I really didn't have to know
anything about zigboo z-wave x10 to do
that from an application standpoint as
kind of another example which is pretty
standard to osgi comes with one of the
compendiums as an HTTP service so one of
the things you can do is listen for the
HTTP service right this is just kind of
a standard way so you can know you set
up a service tracker because there's
some you know the reason you want to
your personal service tracker here is
when the HTTP service comes up online
you've now have servlets and stuff you
want to register with it right to
provide an interface to the outside
world so that's you know kind of some
examples but again for gory details i
recommend OS giant action there's a
whole bunch of other ones but about us a
good book for
learning osgi and how to do that are
there any questions on that on that part
yes yeah so hitachi provides we work a
lot with telecommunications group and we
have actually a back-end server that
will also provision bundles down to the
system there are other ways to do that
too with and if you're tracking
standards the broadband forum is working
with the osgi Alliance to add some stuff
so that an ACS system can do it the
latest versions with PD 194 allow some
of that for kind of more standard
provisioning systems to do that hitachi
provides one of those to provision the
apps onto the devices and we take
advantage of taking bundles and putting
them in deployment packages as well so
you can wrap that wrap a bundle a set of
bundles inside a deployment package to
make it easier to manage down to the
device yeah Ashley super Jay framework
is just our marketing name for OS Jack
for our osgi framework so if itachi has
a commercially available osgi framework
that's for dot to compliance them to be
four dot three super Jay is kind of the
whole family that we have so we have a
SDKs you can also licensed the JVM
through us we have a source license for
the JVM from Oracle so we can port to
various devices and chipsets that Oracle
doesn't pour to it also includes the oci
framework then it also includes the
management system that you can get and
we license them independently they're
all written so that you can you can kind
of plug and play which piece you want
out of that now as our own
that's our own we are yeah it's not
based on Felix or Equinix it's our own
pure implementation of it that's been
enhanced for the embedded space so for
those time people you know that osei
started as an embedded now open services
gateway initiative of course now it just
stands for osgi right and the idea was
to provide this type of services own
home gateways home routers those small
devices in the early 2000s with the
clips and somewhere in there right he
got is started to move into the
enterprise space and the enterprise
space sucked a lot of the wind out of
osgi in the embedded space hitachi
actually focused on osgi in the embedded
space so part of what our framework does
is it's been optimized for a smaller
footprint startup times we try to take
things into account that you're running
on a resource-constrained device so
that's how we differentiate from whether
you're going to get Felix or equinoxes
that's what that's the value add that
we're adding to that framework is to be
optimized for these types of devices and
smaller good question any other
questions
cool so I put some extra slides in here
in case the demo God's what and working
for me either lie they didn't work for
mark you know yes yeah such you got a
fine approach it and say that in here
but it's up if it can happen at the Java
monkey knows then you don't feel bad
about trying anything in a session right
because at that point you'd okay look it
can happen to anybody right so I'm going
to switch over and make sure on the
internet connections the other thing is
is whenever you're in a building and I
don't know where the Oracles using their
own network we're going through the
hotel network do your basic plan Russian
roulette if you ever have to go outside
okay cool that's not working then we'll
switch back and I show you kind of what
the what what the demo looks like so I'm
going to use the same diagram that I was
showing you before so I'm sure you kind
of the different pieces that we've put
into this demo and I'm going from the
bottom up so we have both zip Ian z-wave
devices two of the things that we have
is a z-wave multi-sensor it actually
senses temperature the light intensity
and the humidity it also does motion
detection we're not using that for this
one that's not an accelerometer it's a
your standard kind of motion detection
so we're not we're not using that for
this device then we also have a zigbee
smart energy switch it allows you to
turn stuff off and on but it also
measures your your electrical pull the
amperage pool for that so we're using
those two types of on sensors that at
the bottom we built it on top of a
global scale mirror box this little
white box up here you can come look at
it afterwards it's basically if you're
familiar with a plug computer Senora
chip small form factor low power running
linux on it it
can't remember if they're actually
available now or they're going to be
available very shortly it has linux and
os GI Java on it on top of that we have
our osgi framework we're also using jazz
Java embedded suite that was I think
announced last week this week we're
showing some interaction between those
two where we're making some local
decisions local analytics and collecting
the data primarily the osgi is
collecting all the data and controlling
all the sensor data and then we're
passing some of that information over to
jazz they're making some local business
rule decisions and then talking up to
see control which is a company that
collects sensor data and displays it and
then they're collecting it at a global
cloud level so those are kind of the key
pieces that with that went into the arm
into the demo so I can show you now so
one other piece that we added to it to
make it interesting as a contest so we
added an NFC Near Field Communication
reader so you can scan it will keep up
with your stands we also added a little
fidgets LCD display this is a headless
device it doesn't have any real display
so we are we added that piece to it I
don't have fancy gooeys to talk to the
back in peace said this is a cent
there's a simple web service running on
top of the device thats collecting all
the sensor data so that you can see the
sensor data that we're collecting
locally so put this guide right here I
think you did that earlier and I think
he loses enough light that you'll be
able to see it I just let you know
because people ask we're not kind of
cheating with the USB cable it turns out
that this particular device says it can
be battery-powered so you can carry it
around but when you put it on battery it
only updates every four minutes that's a
long time to wait and a demo to see
something happen so we are we
you see the lights going down so we
changed it to how we're powering it with
the USB because then you can configure
it we can update every 10 seconds so we
can get a lot more data as make makes
for a much better on much better
reaction time for presentation you me
and as you can also see we're doing the
energy management we're pulling the
dance from here so that's what's
happened kind of locally on here again I
have that Smart Switch this is another
just simple app that we have that allows
me to turn off and all my laptops
plugged up to it so it's going to blink
and we'll see that the power will change
and the timeframe that we're waiting for
this and put together data for that all
this data is being pushed up to see
control and they are collecting it there
are 13 of these stations out in the demo
grounds so the tachi one right here
we're overloading it so you can see now
my power went down over here my light
went back up to 165 some of the nice
things that they do for this this is
kind of that global analytics versus
local analytics as I can look at trends
I can look at I what's happening with
the the power regularly all kinds of
reports they're collecting all this
global global data for us so here's some
the power trends that we're putting in
here you can see the different hob light
trends over all the sensors versus like
there's a NetBeans booth out there and
where its trends are so all of this
state is being collected now if you're
interested if you haven't been out to
the demo ground you can actually play
that the game and win a kindle you can
also wear prizes
locally so the other thing that we tied
into together just more sensor data is
you cannot scan with the NFC reader we
now read that we report that information
upstream locally jazz is making some
decisions about local winners collecting
data it's also doing checks like oh you
can't if I scan if I try to scan too
many times just back to back to back it
will up that'll give a warning it's also
checking things for alarming of how fast
how close things are together for that
and just collecting more data when you
get one of these cards you get a user ID
and a password that you can log into the
sea control site and take a look around
at that and also see what stations
you've been at and some of your own
personal data from your scan card that's
been pushed up there not to worry Oracle
being the having plenty of lawyers none
of your information from your Java one
conference is available to this that's
why it's tied to this user ID and stuff
so we were not able to end time get it
worked through we wanted to try to do
some other social social media things
around this we're standing so you would
know over the people that attended this
session also the same people that
attended other sessions with you
together and you can kind of go see that
but they were concerned about too much
of your private information going out so
we don't have that so that's why you get
your own user ID and password that just
a couple of other things real quick
since we have this up we also have a web
interface that if you were developing
the apps you can push down your bundles
or services then you can see on here
these are the bundles that we have
running these are services that were
running so we have like a z-wave
controller we have the pan service
running and NFC reader is its own
service so you can detect whether it
comes in and out and we listen for
whether we detach it or attach it in our
booth we have a booth up right by the
demo grounds we also have a demo
of where you can unplug and plug in the
zippy and the z-wave and it will
dynamically show you whether the device
is there or not so you can you can play
around with that as well as a connected
home demo and then one of these NFC
stations that you cannot scan out if you
scan here you'll also be registered at
IG booth too so I'm kind of over
overloading that particular piece of it
it was just the scan for the card any
questions on that so where this is
actually using the the same techniques
that we talked about for the aggregators
and using that mirror box as an
aggregator of the different sensor pipes
and we could connect more sensors to it
continue to aggravate that data and then
make smart decisions down locally so and
that's why we put together the demo for
javab one was to show that capability in
the embedded space and then in a space
any questions if you want to before I
have to take it down start planet time
you can come grab a card and sky yes so
becomes really interesting with all
these things are using wireless and
battery operated and all that when their
recipes are looking around right yes and
i'm just curious like if you have such a
small device that runs java how long
typically will have rental whatever
standard battery yeah yeah hate say it
depends but the one of the things that
they are doing with the new cldc
versions of Java that would run down on
a lot like a small battery-powered
device is taking that exactly into
account is what do I need to do to
minimize my my pull on the processor on
this guy we're running the SE embedded
so we assume that you've got that you're
not running out from battery power for
that guy and these particular sensors
don't run Java so yeah that should
probably
we have two they're just pure Zibby and
z-wave so they're not yet running java
down at the sensor level which is
another potential issue i know that the
push is to try to get java down as close
to the devices as possible and when they
do that they do have to take into
account the battery yeah and that's
where it becomes interesting of what
where do you push Java now how far down
there are some controllers and in some
especially if you're sorted into factory
automation and some things like that
where you're going to want more
intelligence even closer or the ability
to change things even closer for sensors
like these moving it up to that
aggregator level where you just let the
sensor manufacturer do whatever they
need to do because some of them are very
simple right just measuring temperature
doesn't require a lot of intelligence
right measuring humidity doesn't so a
lot of those things don't you don't need
the intelligence at the device there are
some other devices that you might with
the way the way the accelerometers and
all that other stuff is working there
might be some reasons that you'd want
some actually some more intelligence on
that guy to make some decisions for you
or so you could tweak it and change it
change sensitivity and stuff easier than
you could good question yes
for gsm what are you doing for data
compression to keep the bike usage down
the supercapacitor to see control yeah
so in this particular demo what we're
just using we're just using broadband
connections but when you're using GSM
and you're going out that way so right
now and our current stuff we're not
compressing it to optimize that that is
something on our roadmap to look at how
we can take so as we provide that upper
information to you that it could be
compressed but it also then need
somebody on the other side that's kind
of taken some of that off one of the
main ways we see in limiting the GSM
usage etc so unless you're liking a a
vending machine where you might not have
access to anything but gsm or you're on
a truck on the road when you need to do
that is is trying to be smart about when
you send the data i think there's a very
big danger in the emden space that
you're going to get dirty data or just
cluttered data and it's just going to be
data just that that's not actionable
right i think some of that is how you're
going to need to limit so why you need
to let you know you can make smart
decisions about when you send the data
and do i really need to send it or can i
do smart things like if my temperature
didn't change for 30 minutes or an hour
I didn't need to send a report every 10
seconds I could have just reported it
when it changed and let you know that it
changed for the last that hadn't know
that the last hour it was this
temperature so those are some of the
things that so that intelligent part
we're doing now the actual trying to
compress it over the line we're not
doing right now it is something that we
are looking into yes as part of that it
part of the abstraction layer in there
and to help developers not have to worry
about that piece but so that we can help
compress that and optimize the network
yeah
portion any other questions
cool well thank you you can come up and
grab a card and scan and then if you hit
at least six of the other of these scans
stations they look prettier than this by
the way they're all mounted and stuff up
in the demo problems if you hit at least
six of them then you qualify to register
for a kindle that I think they're
raffling off at four o'clock so feel
free to do that if you have any other
questions you cannot talk to me
afterwards you can also my contact my
slides will be uploaded so you can
download the slides and also I was going
to go my contact information is on the
is on the last slide so you can all I
will pull that up for you yeah so if
other questions come up or something
comes up or you have any ideas feel free
to email me I'll be glad to get your
information or answer any other
questions especially if other stuff
comes up for you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
