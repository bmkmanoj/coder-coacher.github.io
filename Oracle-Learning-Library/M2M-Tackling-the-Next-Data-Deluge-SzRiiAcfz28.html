c control our company offers a cloud
platform for machine-to-machine data
collection organization and analysis in
fact actually if you were on the exhibit
hall floor at javaone yesterday we had a
there's an NFC reader some temperature
sensors that were at the Java stations
and if you entered into that contest
that was there at the exhibit hall floor
like our software was managing that
contest in the back end taking all the
data and presenting and showing it on
display and I think these the exhibit
hall closed today s'alright so fun I
think ok so if well this is going to run
up till noon maybe but if you want to
see you know any of our stuff in action
will show a little bit today it's also
going to be alive for a few more minutes
on the show floor my background I've
been in the machine machine business for
over a decade starting with RFID which
we consider if you're familiar with
radiofrequency ID tags and Internet of
Things application the great thing about
RFID from our perspective is that it
forced us to think about scale which
we'll talk about a lot today around
machine-to-machine communications right
off the bat because RFID was originally
meant to be deployed and is deployed
into retail environments where you're
doing you know thousands of transactions
per second visa V what really happens in
EM damn today which is not nearly on
that scale but it's coming so that's my
background I've worked in I've had a
couple of companies that I've that I've
had and sold to other larger companies
and I've worked across a lot of just
different domains i mean bottom line is
I wouldn't say I've seen everything but
I've seen quite a bit ranging from
defense to biosensing to rfid and supply
chain logistics and then my partner in
crime here is part test shasthri maybe
you can describe or talk about your
background real quick so similar to
Brian up in and the space for a little
over ten years now started out managing
devices in the medical space so because
most of the value proposition or the ROI
made sense in the medical space whereby
we were remotely monitoring devices and
doing predictive failure analysis and so
on and since then have moved on through
various different verticals so same as
Brian's seen a bunch of different
mainstream telematics applications and
also some esoteric
applications and we'll talk about some
of those in this session and given the
smaller nature of Orangemen nature of
the size the audience today feel free
even just midstream during this
presentation ask questions maybe can
make us more of a conversation if you'd
like I mean well offer ourselves up as a
couple of grizzled desert veterans who
are really really excited about what's
going to about to happen next but we've
also you know have got some bumps and
bruises from the marketplace and more
specifically between the two of us each
of us have actually been in companies
that have owned everything from PCB
level sensor design and manufacturing
all the way back to large-scale custom
web software in fact my DNA is more on
the software and I like helped build
some big systems back in the day such as
I hope to be big eyes out and couple
other big big companies get get their
big consumer grade internet products out
to scale so the Internet of Things in
2008 and I don't think anybody noticed
this because the recession and sort of
global catastrophe that was looming kind
of took center stage but in 2008 the
number of things machines this accounts
for a lot of different things so to
speak big we're connected the internet
actually exceeded the number of people
on the planet and you know it really
kind of forced a lot of people typically
IT industry to take notice and say well
you know is this new what's going to
happen next and the reality is is that M
machine-to-machine communications or the
Internet of Things which is its current
moniker has actually been around for
quite a long time it's just it's not new
it actually a lot of it there were
things that happened before this born of
though the watershed moments and
machine-to-machine was during World War
two with all the intense technological
innovation going on during during that
conflict both the Germans in the British
almost I imperiled the same time
developed the International Friend or
Foe system which was a fairly
rudimentary but it's still used today
way for a remote ground station radar
station to identify whether or not a
sensor on a plane is a friend or a foe
it actually can't detect whether it's a
foe but it definitely knows if you're a
friend it basically since the
acknowledgment back and forth that says
are you 123456 part of our Air Force and
then the planes supposed to respond with
an act that says yes so that was really
generally considered one of the first
machine to machine systems then the post
World War two
with barcode scanning which took about
25 to 30 years to be adopted in mass
that was really the kind of next thing
management application that they gained
wide sweat scale adoption but these iff
systems actually except for something
electronics they've gone into him the
fundamental architecture of them hasn't
even changed that much since world war
two if you talk to be a your lock heat
or some other guys like this is the core
remote sensing application you'll see me
talk a little bit about the defense
industries role and machine-to-machine
because it's been fairly significant and
even even in our world the big hype
right now and the reason why judson
altough you know set up this job
embedded conference is because the
economics of doing machine-to-machine
communications and monitoring anything
on the planet are finally in line with
with what people can afford to both
experiment with and also there's some
proven case studies out there around how
both enterprises and even just
individuals can benefit from m2m and the
economic are the economics of all things
in technology are definitely just that
the sort of reaching this crucible point
where everything is starting to make
sense the big thing is in our business
an m2m module which is really just a
cellular modem stripped of a keyboard in
a display that you would typically put
into an iphone or a Nokia phone etc that
module itself has dropped from a price
of well over a hundred dollars in two
thousand eight to twenty dollars or even
less today in fact it's something that
the analyst firms are now tracking on a
near quarterly basis probably within
three to five years we'll have true
throwaway radio modules / you know
assuming there's enough spectrum out
there on the cellular networks but true
throw a radio modules that are dollar to
3 2015 2016 that's a game-changing type
of economic development in parallel the
wireless plans that get attached to
those modems are certainly at a point
where people can deploy them
economically so I have some jokes that I
tell a lot about our team we have a
number of folks in our company that have
been doing this for a long time in been
doing field deployments where you know
in order to sim card for a remote
machine somewhere like Germany for
example will be in a project I would
actually have to send somebody into a
convenience store like a spar and Europe
or somewhere buy a sim card for machines
that are being deployed enterprises like
Audi
or BMW or sensing systems are being
deployed it there or in North America
have to call tmobile or AT&amp;amp;T convince
him I was buying blackberrys throw the
blackberry in the trash is to get the
sim card the data plan because they
don't understand what I was doing with
the sim cards that I was going to go put
them into a machine that was going to
report so that basic plan you know back
in those days and even still is about 35
40 bucks a month so that the bottom
floor for actually doing remote
monitoring over a cellphone network was
forty dollar a month charge plus the
hardware you're buying which is going to
end up costing one two three four
hundred dollars and it basically made
remote machine to machine management
which is where a lot of the ROI is only
achievable on certain classes of things
or assets and things that people want to
manage that's all changed today you can
go right to sprint's website I think 18t
might have their pricing published but
there's definitely whether it's Vodafone
18t or some other guys they'll give you
a plan now for like a hundred dollars a
month they'll give you I wouldn't say
unlimited Sims but as many as soon as
you can handle you can pull the minutes
on one plan and your machines all have
one cell phone plan just like you're
starting to see from verizon with
pulling a whole family's plan it's I
cannot understand the importance of this
and white how this is going to catalyze
the market the wireless carriers have
run out of people to sell cell phones
too it's a journey game so they're
competing on data and LTE etc there's
just no more there's no more customers
out there so it's a market share fight
machines on the other hand represent
customers that in some cases consume a
lot of data but pretty predictable
they'll they'll lock themselves in
they're not going to switch networks
over the next five or ten years and
they're going to be consistent you know
piece of the revenue stream now today
depending on who you talk to it's only
half a percent or a percent of their
business but you know for a
trillion-dollar industry that's a fairly
significant and it's growing in all of
all the carriers globally you know
whether it's a big carrier or small
carrier we just talked to Saskatchewan
so wireless carrier they're starting to
deploy like wireless plans we've talked
to thailand's wireless carrier they're
coming up with with with wireless plans
for this all the way up to eighteen t
which you know if you're here in North
America and you watch television they
have commercials about this just about
every third hour now where they're
talking about machine-to-machine smarter
planet in intelligence society etc so
you know this is a game changer in our
world so i can i can now
our chess can now call a wireless
carrier on behalf either our direct
customers or indirect customers and get
a workable economic communications plan
for remote machines and they also have
armies now it's gone from 10 to 50 to
200 people on an annual basis from the
sales and account management side to
deal with companies like ours so this
this this along with Moore's law making
sensors cheap and throw away is the big
thing that's making everybody really
excited right now I don't did everybody
hear attend the keynote yesterday that
Judson on the floor so I'd probably
don't need to belabor the point but
there's just a lot of things out there
it's billions you know by any measure
some of it when you see some of the
marketing alamos just know that some of
the marketing analyst will will bundle
in tablets and cell phones and some
other things in there but it's still
that the numbers are so ginormous that
it's it's undeniable that this is the
next wave of computing that extending
you know a nervous system out to the
edge of your enterprise or your personal
life etc is what the future be holds its
star wars the D amount of data that can
come from machines is totally the things
that we've seen and the things that
we've had to deal with is absolutely
massive no one into the spectrum you'll
have something which has basically
always been a role in computer like a
heavy vehicle there's already federated
computer networks on board a heavy
vehicle there's already as standard that
the Society of Automotive Engineers has
on vehicles called Chi 1939 or canvas
you can tap into over 3,000 standardized
data points on any given you know heavy
vehicle that's out there in the world
this walls consumer vehicles have a lot
of the same data it's just not remotely
interrogated if you go into your
dealership you'll see a guy will have a
large box of your car and plug in that
something you really to port well now
there's remote modem based things you
can plug into your ovd to port as a
consumer which I'll talk about a second
and and get the data off their
selectively and this is so the kind of
things that we typically have been
managing your very industrial all this
is changing and their range from that
heavy equipment where we have a roach
footprint we do some variation things
there two forklifts containers that was
touching a little bit in the in the
scenario yesterday although our
container the container things we do is
really around refrigerated containers
and doing deep monitoring the
refrigeration unit and making sure it's
not going to fail some load of produce
doesn't go bad refrigeration units just
in general are a big area there in
restaurants and commercial settings that
people wanted for a lot today remote
tanks believe it or not I mean most the
tanks in the world are managed by a guy
driving out there with a clipboard and
writing down with the tank reading is so
most the tanks in the world are sort of
going through a three to five-year
process of being remotely monitored with
tank level sensors robots we do a lot of
work with abb who's like the leader in
in producing industrial automation
robots and their quarter-million-dollar
half-million-dollar workers that get put
into plants to build things ranging from
cars to one fund your examples I've seen
as I've seen these robots is a stream of
water to actually cut like prepackaged
sandwiches in half as we wanted sure you
monitor all that with machine-to-machine
communications and data and make those
those robots more effective and can
prevent them from coming down so across
particularly industrial universe there's
nothing new here this has been going on
for a long time at a higher level and
this is gelling we're see control we do
a lot of businesses and sort of mixed
weird strange you know groups of assets
at a higher level the the Big M damn
market that everybody's familiar with is
long-haul trucking most long-haul trucks
particularly North America have at least
a GPS device on them and they're being
monitored for where's the driver located
what's the ETA and is he complying with
our service regulations and not driving
20 hours straight he's actually taking a
nap the value that did yeah good yeah
oh this would be a medical device yeah
medical device actually partition you
talk about this person you've done a lot
of medical devices send a medical device
space typically most of the diagnostic
devices are pretty much cost anywhere
from 250 k upwards two million two
million dollars and traditionally these
have been sold as capital expenditure to
the hospitals where you sell it for that
money and then you layer on top of it a
service contract so in the old days that
scheme work because there was a lot of
money in the health care system they
could afford it but in the over the last
ten years that is drawing up so both the
hospitals and the device makers are
looking at figuring out okay how do we
maximize the utilization of our asset so
with that in mind what they're trying to
do with m2m is how do we provide three
nines or even four nines of uptime how
do we from a manufacturer standpoint how
do I minimize my workforce to support
that so in the traditional word if like
a general electric sold the imaging
equipment they would typically have
teams of field engineers within
different geographies and that's
expensive with m2m what they are doing
now is they are constantly monitoring
those assets they will have people on
the ground but they don't have to be
specialists they can be generalists the
specialists are setting back in the o my
office they are looking at it and saying
okay this particular laser on machine X
is going to fail based on their power
curve and he would say okay you go ahead
and fix it so instead of reacting to a
outage in the hospital now we have
people going out and fixing it the other
thing that's happening is they are
extending the life of the asset so in
the past to maintain the 39 of time they
would typically have a service guy do
the rounds of the hospital every three
months he would go and rip out the
consumables and put in brand-new ones it
doesn't matter whether that consumer
will still had eighty percent of its
life remaining it was just the process
and that's how they're better but this
now they are looking at okay am I really
using that asset and when that asset is
towards its end of life only then do I
go out and fix it so from a market
standpoint this is
both reducing costs and also driving new
service service stream so now what the
medical device companies are doing is
can we now move away from being a capex
type business two more and our PEX thing
so instead of you paying me a million
dollars up front how about I sell you
the equipment like Ali's you pay me a
down payment and then you pay me based
on the number of operations you do and I
take care of all the service and support
and then now there are companies forming
around doing these type of things for
devices from different vendors so from a
hospital standpoint they don't care
whether it's just GE or a BB or some
other company they say okay you know
what someone take care of this whole lab
floor and you are responsible for
maintaining 99 up time on the whole
fleet of equipment and that's a huge
polar of go ahead answer technicians and
doctors within the in a hospital
image MRI cat scan into x ray that
getting that image 30 through the
hospital is taking a lot of time I was
curious about use of this type of
technology to transmit those images I
have a lot of today
is that possible it so he yes and no
technically as software engineers yes
definitely it can be done it's an easy
problem to solve the challenge with the
medical spaces there are so many rules
and regulations around it around patient
privacy what information you can send
you could but then you you're becoming
part of the medical device right now the
service part of it is not necessarily
bound by the they call it 503 k or those
filings so if I make changes to my
diagnostic the machine diagnostic
portion of it I don't have to go through
the whole recertification process but
now as soon as you're intermingling
patient data with diagnostic data
machine diagnostic data now we are
becoming a medical device and that opens
up a charm the other thing is within
hospitals getting data out of the
hospital itself is a big challenge the
IT systems put in place are such that
they won't allow you to go beyond they
are even within from this room to the
next room unless it's going through
their limbs the lab information
management system so what vendors are
offering is to simplify things and speed
of deployment they're saying you know
what here's my device it's fully
functional with its own IP connection
and they are bundling cellular devices
in it and we'll see where that trend
goes and but most of these type of
equipment typically you'll find them in
small offices like like a doctor's
office where he's doing the lasik type
of treatment and he's got that lasik
equipment and the big labs it's still
you're dealing with the bureaucracy
you
but so I I should rephrase it so jeez
been doing this for a very long time so
when G emerging came out back in the
early seventies they have been doing
these type of things but it's focused
primarily on the GE equipment now what
they're doing is the technology already
exists to do these type of things now
they are turning it around and offering
it as a commercial service and driving
value out of it up to now that was kind
of hidden behind the G service support
center now they're kind of pulling it
out and saying okay mr. customer why
don't you become a partner and you have
access to it or the guys who are
managing the lab they have access to it
and they take care of some of the things
could it be I don't I haven't followed
them in the recent past but I have done
work with them and I know they're doing
it well so the m2m by nature in today's
word m2m is kind of clubbed with
cellular m2m and at a broad level m2m
doesn't necessarily have to be set it up
it's it's m2m is essentially it's any
sensor any device connected to an IP
network or not necessarily when an IP
network to a remote network where a a
brain thrust in the remote location can
monitor and manage it without having
boots on the ground sure sure but but
definitely in the mpf questions party
she spent some time at a company that
has software the very similar to us that
pretty much owns that space and that was
their first wave of customers the recent
activity to move at least from my
perspective because i have a little
broader or a perspective these we've
seen is its you'll hear a lot about
health care but there's we already
touched some practical problems but the
way that I explain to people is if you
want to look at a hospital it's a castle
with a fire mode around
and it's very difficult to get in and
out of there in fact actually within a
hospital just procuring the internet
connection is an ear act of God so if
you wanted to play again I've deployed
some systems have been hospitals like
you wait five months just to get an
Ethernet jack so we talked about like
trading image from even from you know
business unit a within the hospital
business unit be it's it's a fairly
significant I honestly don't know the
answer that question I'm amazed at like
our city morgue he's a sneaker did it
goes somewhere image in their way yeah
why you're running around hospital to
 you're saying yeah yeah it is
there's a we probably shouldn't get
started on health care data Helen Carrie
United States or anywhere else for that
matter but it does it does Lee do an
important point it's been touched on
here which is that the punchline all
this is that the amount of data is
massive so when we start talking about
imaging just in our like the traditional
sort of sort of day-to-day market that
we're in a lot of times which is heavy
equipment we have four partners in the
space that go off and deploy our
software solutions and heavy equipment
if you monitored all of North America's
heavy equipment which is only five
hundred thousand pieces you get roughly
15 petabytes of data so it's 200 years
worth of HD video it's a lot as if you
want everything and that's something
that we'll talk about soon which is do
you need everything but to this point
and this is a moderate Oracle pitch
although we actually offer some of these
key posts their own platform but the
idea is that whether it's service
maintenance making of all just keep you
something up and running or just knowing
how its performing at the end of day you
wanna give this data back into one of
your central corporate systems so
customer service can be there on the
phone and CRM system with a customer say
you know let me check your machine ping
it oh it turns out you've got trouble
code 3515 when you send a tech out
ideally you're proactive and you've said
hey wait a second there's a trend how
being on that piece of equipment and
let's get a technician out there ahead
of time or then your supply if you're
even better your supply chain can say
let's get the technician out there and
then let's get the spare part that we
know is going to fail out there at
exactly the right time without having to
sit around and hold on to like let's say
a medical device is an average spare
parts $20,000 item like for an MRI
machine or cat scan you want to be
sitting on top of a hundred extra of
those spare parts so if you can do it
just in time almost del like a like a
dell like supply chain around
maintenance you can do amazing things
both from a cost-cutting perspective and
your service operations but also you can
start developing real competitive
advantages and I can't tell you who is
doing this today but we're working with
a lot of companies that are absolute
wiping out the competition by developing
next-generation service programs where
they're offering to come in and give you
for the first year essentially an OnStar
type of service if knowing North
Americans from Arizona start is raging
piano is planning for a second basically
an OnStar type of service for your
assets it's free the first year and it's
just a monitoring service so they're
making sure that you're the thing you
bought from them is up and running all
the time well with some of our early
adopters you know in our business those
big OEMs that sell that product are now
taking over their competitors equipment
by attaching aftermarket sensors to it
or aftermarket monitoring systems so
it's we call multi-vendor so
multi-vendor service management where
you know you might have maker a you know
prod maker a managing as a third
outsourced managed service all of your
stuff so to speak all of your assets in
your enterprise as a as a big service so
interesting ly enough pioneered this is
the Department of Defense most aircraft
carriers and other large defense systems
are actually typically managed by
Lockheed under a giant performance-based
service contract and so Lockheed even
though they made out of me this aircraft
carrier will manage every product and
thing that's on that aircraft carrier
and so that large-scale problem actually
just bring that down to virtually any
product out in the world and so what
you're seeing with them to em this will
take a while to fully develop but it's
sort of with medical devices a long time
I think there's some market challenges
there in almost every industry we're
seeing it this is becoming you know
cost-cutting first competitive advantage
and soon it will be a pure competitive
requirement you just won't buy products
that don't have a remote service
attached to it and as a consumer in
particular you probably are going to
want to pay extra out of your pocket for
it today most people are asking you to
pay a couple extra bucks but tomorrow
that's that's just not going to be the
case especially when you look at as I
mentioned earlier the cost of these
whole system's declining then you're
starting to see a living with automotive
although automotive you know cars have a
long product development lifecycle years
but you're seeing how much stuff is
actually on a modern car anymore and
it's all coming with monitoring services
which particularly young people just
don't even blink twice at you know
they'll buy a forward you know sync
system or they'll buy the four because
it has the sync system in there so on
that point I'll just do a quick survey
in a turnover part test real quick list
this is kind of random things that we
see we now that everyone's a set of an
MDM we get a lot of you know interesting
people calling us recently we had a
group out of the Rockies call and there
they've got a National Science
Foundation grant and they want to track
Grizzlies you know walking across the
Rockies their migratory migration
patterns they try to reintroduce you
know Grizzlies back in the North America
and they've kind of gone gone gone gone
by the wayside so blood glucose
monitoring the kinds of things you
actually see an M health you know that
that along and actually yesterday I I
somebody somebody notified us that some
researchers out of a the University of I
think it's the university of bern in
switzerland have developed a sensor
that'll tell you when the cows are heat
because apparently the problem global is
there such a high demand on milk they
can't tackle and cows are actually ready
to to reproduce anymore so they
developed a sensor so that you can
completely know who you know when when
the win the cows ready to go
for the multiply so that's just the tip
of the iceberg there's some other really
interesting things now that sensors are
virtually throw away their happening out
there if you're even moderately
interested get on Kickstarter which is
the crowd-sourced funding platform
that's out there and there's so many
projects where what we call hobbyists in
their garage or creams is the coolest
sensors for all kinds of things that we
can't even think of and dream up in a
vacuum in our in our own office the kind
of cool things that we have seen you
know tickling the revenue side as well
as we'll talk to big companies about
especially in retail about pressure
sensing systems or putting an infrared
system on this you can detect foot
traffic and figure out you know ship
with diet coke on the top or put on the
bottom what sells better that's that's a
fairly emerging trend right now and that
happens that you know end caps and it's
starting to happen we've seen my
companies like Unilever build sensors in
two fridges where they can do this
actually I was just in Paris at a
high-end hotel and I had took a beer out
of the mini bar and an hour and half
later door knocked and the pressure
sensor told central central room service
that that I was down a beer which was
very nice for me usage-based insurance
is another emerging you know application
this is where exchange for willing to be
monitored and potentially tracked via
gps there's different programs the
insurance carriers know what your risk
level is going to be how many times you
hit the brakes how many times you get
the accelerator how many good and bad
things you do and they can reach on a
scale actually we can reach you on scale
we have an algorithm a couple of our
applications for you used to fish
insurance that does this and then you
get either a break on your policy or you
qualify for some lower policy tier or
also the other model is you literally
pay for my litter event based on your
risk rating this isn't taking off in
North America so much because we have a
lot of privacy sort of concerns baked
into our and our deal
but in an emerging economy is
particularly Eastern Europe parts of
Southeast Asia this is really starting
to take off from from auto insurers
right right yes it's not in the media
feedback loop yeah this is literally you
have your premium adjusted every 30 days
progressive here in North America has
done a really good job of a pioneering
accession of a lot of patents in space
there's there's some regulatory issues
with it North America though that's also
happening you know an emerging economies
around bikes getting back to the
disposable sensor idea you can put a
ten-dollar GPS tracker on a bike and so
there's actually you know in other
countries bikes or bike so much there's
actually insurance for them so the
insurers will pay for a tracking device
you know on a bike so that if it gets
stolen like an recovery or moves outside
of let's just say Paris's Paris has a
share a bike program moves outside of
Paris's radius then you know it's kind
of a LoJack type of system for theft
recovery subprime lending you know this
kind of opens up new markets for for car
dealers to sell more cars to people who
otherwise can obtain credit you can go
to a car dealership and they'll sell you
a car based on what you can qualify from
credit perspective they right they carry
the note and exchange for doing all that
for you they're going to put basically a
tracking device in your car so if you
don't make a payment the repo guy will
be there in about 30 minutes we talked
about imaging digital signs this is
coming this is one of the ones will be
excited about but I don't know if the
infrastructure and the cost levels were
quite there yet but i always call this
the Minority Report application if you
ever watched that movie it's a great
movie because a lot of very well-known
global futurist got together and said
what will the future look like and this
is one of the things that came out at
movie which was personalized advertising
and signing on digital signs and there's
a lot of there's a lot of excitement
around this right now but the data is
you know massive you're sending HD files
out but I'm starting to see in different
parts of the world that I've been to
these signs are popping up tickling
airports all over the place that that
are doing with advertising as well as
just information you know tickling
airports you know here's your gate has
changed a lot of dynamic videos here's
how you get from you know here to the
the train around the airport
this is one that people don't notice as
much but it's really starting to happen
residential and commercial property
management if you particularly you know
with this real estate crisis there's
empty buildings and again in north
america until there's a lot of examples
that we've seen and there's like a
squatting problem where people are just
going to buildings they shouldn't be
into it's a real nightmare for property
manager so you can put sensors
temperature humidity light sensors into
buildings to know is somebody there then
also on that same same level is if you
have made maintainer supposed to be when
I'm checking these buildings you'll know
if you're meeting us guys showed up and
checked on the building's for people the
other end of the spectrum who have
second homes you can do things like if
you have a mountain home make sure that
the the pipes don't burst by having a
temperature sensor somewhere in that in
the plumbing fixture or put put sensors
on your doors which are fairly throw
away and cheap right now that just tell
you if somebody actually open the door
so those sorts of applications are
coming as well and they're also I mean
they're both security applications and
sort of safety applications but they're
also starting to become revenue
generators for property management
services for a larger scale vending is
ATM machines oddly enough there's a lot
of intelligence and ATM machines and
well ATMs for the most part are almost
all monitored remotely on some level
there's some it's not as good as you
would think it is particularly the cash
cassettes but vending machines there's a
lot of a lot of intelligence out there
in vending machines law over the place
but but oddly a lot of them aren't
entirely connected to the central brain
so to speak yet so that's still sort of
an emerging space and the problem there
has been that the borrower's control the
distribution of the vending machines and
there's some market issues but this is
definitely taking off in some areas
where particularly in Japan and some
other places you can sell anything from
vending machines so the cost of the
product in the acid and there's pretty
high and you want to manage it better
than before particular from a supply
chain perspective now I'm already
mentioned defense we built our
technology around like a lot of really
complex defense scenarios this is
something that we monitored years ago we
don't do as much of this today because
we kind of passed it off to some NSA
other types of systems but our whole
platform which part ash will talk about
here in a second just to kind of do our
plug is built around the idea of having
you know federated sensors at every
level of a thing that's out there and
being
interrogate you manage everything at a
component level from a product the
defense guys have been doing this with
very expensive systems for a long time I
mean they know with ninety nine point
five percent accuracy if a tank treads
going to fail tomorrow and a helicopter
comes out in the desert and drops off a
brand new tank tread spare part and we
keep going towards wherever we're going
we're not stopping the mission we're
certainly not gonna get people killed so
they invest invest a lot of money into
sensors and what we also call
prognostics where you take data crunch
it through an algorithm and you predict
what's going to happen whoops track I
see similarly with defense this isn't as
pervasive but it's in field trials
they're dropping sensors on battlefield
they know the composition and makeup and
strength dynamic force on several
different levels so the big data
challenge here is that you know the
types of sensors that are out there
they're coming from everywhere now
anyone that even has a toe and
electronics business the types of data
that can come off sensors is you know
from a technology development
perspective is virtually infinite I
mentioned that you know vehicles can
have already you can tap into a data
stream of over two to three thousand
different data points the problem is
today it's still a little early adopter
in most industries the amount of data
that you need to get to figure out
what's important is it kind of amazing
in some cases like you might have to
interrogate a vehicle for a full month
to find out like what's the really
important thing I should be a paid
paying attention to here is it oil
temperature is that the alignment of the
wheels you know you just don't know
until you have all this data and kind of
start becoming scientific about managing
things so the amount of data that's
there to actually actionable things as
fairly high particularly the start of an
em down project which creates a an even
bigger big data challenge when you get
started with these projects and from our
perspective and this is a bias that we
have but from from doing you know real
ROI and business projects is that this
data in our opinion needs to be
transactional needs to be structured so
the idea of putting you know millions of
temperature readings for building is
knock you assess that sounds into an
unstructured notice to l database is for
us not a good idea because if you want
to
an increase in say this hotels you know
heating bill for the day or cooling bill
for the day you need to trust that this
transactional data point that sit you
down that path of making that decision
so we believe that sensor data you know
at least the real-time data that you're
acting on needs to be transactional in
nature and it used to have the same
level of integrity as you would tribute
to a bank transaction I have to trust it
that much because I'm going to make a
financial decision off of it the other
thing that makes designing systems
really complicate is that everything
needs a unique ID and so from anybody
who here who's a software developer
knows like if you're going to create
data data ski model a unique ID whether
it's a serial number your social
security number of then a license plate
whatever it is you're going to have a
sensor reading it as a row you know for
each one of those unique IDs and when
the real problems out there is the
unique IDs vary from organization
organization for the same thing so this
projector here you can probably calls it
a 35-17 a but the nikko body they've
given its own asset tag they were at the
ABC 45-17 be be that small difference so
globally identifying things and making
them truly unique is a major data
modeling problem for machine machine
applications and the other thing that
makes this hard is if you're not going
to just say that the sensor is the thing
that I'm managing you want to put
multiple sensors on a thing like a
building the sensors themselves have
unique IDs so I've got a unique ID
management problem for sensors and have
a unique ID management problem for the
things that I'm actually tracking and
monitoring um we we you know this really
great company you talk called monett I
mean if you want to will give you a card
afterwards will point in the direction
of a few sort of just off the shelf
cheap $67 sensors you can just play with
in fact actually somebody who's in the
audience here is a partner of our
company is kind of obvious to put he's
done a lot of things with there's
raspberry boards or do we know there's a
lot of low cost if your if your software
developer you like electronics there's a
lot of low-cost hobbyist sports we can
actually design your own little system
and people do great things with these
boards think abduct guys who developed
like automated dog
dogs water bowl dispensing systems to
BBQ monitors to all kinds of fun stuff
so so you know from our perspective when
we had to think most people from the
defense orientation I talked about
earlier is I have to model from a data
modeling perspective a thingamajig
that's got a hundred plus discrete
components on and each one of those may
have one or several sensors so how do I
have I'd created a data scheme around
that and people in the military one of
the reasons we really had to focus on
that front we designed our own product
whether the military's mandated and this
will probably filter its way out and the
rest of the world soon that if you want
to sell anything to the military took
leave it's worth more than five thousand
dollars get to put one of these tags on
it and this tag says part number serial
number and the company that came from
that makes it globally identifiable so
they can always trace back the supply of
that thing to its original manufacturing
source and this is done for a lot of
reasons it's for high speed supply
chains it's also mainly prevent
counterfeit electronics from entering
the defense supply chain so that you
don't have a bad circuit board show up
on a 35 million dollar aircraft so the
military and they don't just put these
on as barcodes they actually look in
some cases laser etch these into
components and things so that's you know
the military again has they've driven a
lot of this a lot of the thing cleanness
world and it's just now filtering out to
the kind of commercial sector we we
actually have helped some of these
military organizations get into the
commercial sense commercial sector into
commercial sensing which is why we've
designed our platform the way that we
have and so with that I'll turn it over
to parkchester talk a little bit about
what we do do for a living thanks Brian
so as Brian pointed out there a bunch of
different m2m applications that are
coming to market now haven't been in the
space for little over ten years at say
starting two thousand all the analysts
would predict that Oh in two years
you're going to have a billion devices
on the network and every year since I've
seen those reports and I'm a bit
skeptical but in the last year or two
when you look at all the changes taking
place
technology space in fact looking at the
Oracle announcements around the Java me
for microcontrollers looking at all the
hobbyist boats that are happening out
there you will start seeing a lot more
intelligent devices out in the out on
the edge these devices are generating a
lot of data they are sending information
they are capable of sensing and reacting
and doing things but there is there's a
lot of development taking place on that
side but very little if solution
development being done on the cloud side
whereby okay if a sensor is saying
something how do I make use of that
information processor turn it around and
make it something more valuable so if
you take a look at the evolution of
machines in the like talking about
medical devices the first generation
medical devices were basically
mechanical devices then you had the
electromechanical devices and then
network devices but all these devices
were meant to work within a facility
within a lab within a building within a
campus they didn't have a need to go out
and talk to someone else but if you look
at the newer generation of devices
they're all ip-enabled like we look at a
car the car has a computer built into it
and it has a physical interface where
you can tap into it but the physical
interface is a diagnostic interface it's
not an interface meant for monitoring
it's a onboard diagnostic interface for
a technician to take his hand or
downwards take it in and find error
codes but the new generation of gods or
for fusions the Tesla's they are all
being built from ground up with IP in
mind with the understanding that
customers will want to bring their
ip-enabled assets and make all these
things work and talk together so the
challenge is you're going to get assets
of different types coming together how
do you collect information from that how
do you make sense of it and how do you
bring value to yourself or to your
customers so that's a problem that she
controls trying to solve we are trying
to be the Google of thing data we are
going to collect data from different
types of assets pull the information
together and give our customers the
ability to rapidly build prototype and
create new services and as we speak when
customers start out doing these type of
applications no one has a clue as to
what
going to do they know that they have to
do something they know that they need to
get data out of it but what do you do
with that data no one has an
understanding so example when you take a
look at a piece of equipment in this
case a lift rock it has a bunch of
intelligent microcontrollers on it each
one of those is sending out pieces of
information now it's easy for us to
collect all that data and send it over
to the cloud but what do you do with
that information who cares if the bucket
is up or down how do you make business
rules around the information that you
have collected so one of the things
we've focused on is a SE control we
understand that m2m applications are
going to be evolutionary in nature
customers are going to start building
applications and on a day by day or even
a month by month basis they're going to
learn new things and they're going to
figure out okay yesterday it was
important for me to know whether my
fluid levels were high or low but today
I've learned that it doesn't really
matter it or what matters is if my food
levels are low and my engine RPMs are
high that's a problem I need to stop
something so we have built a platform
ground up using a bunch of different
Java technologies now Java an Oracle to
build a platform which allows us to
unique to seamlessly collect information
from different types of assets so we've
solved the modeling problem that Brian
was referring to earlier if you look at
some of the other m2m systems they're
typically custom-built they're built
from ground up to do one thing and one
thing alone and the challenge with that
is as soon as you build it those systems
are obsolete because by the time you
come to the end of that cycle either you
have learned something new or whatever
you're working on is obsolete and
something news come on the market so
with this platform what we have is we
have the ability to collect information
from a bunch of different type of
sensors bring that all that information
together into our cloud and from there
we have created a kind of plug and play
analytics whereby either a program or
one of the
business analyst at a customer location
can quickly model waters real-world
scenarios are and take them out for a
pilot spin and see what's working what's
not working and it's essentially falling
an agile model on a monthly or quarterly
basis they look at it and say okay we
figured this out and we need to put a
new system or application around it and
let's roll that up so systems will
evolve over a period of time so from a
sea controller standpoint we've created
a platform the tenants are the same but
using that same platform we can rapidly
create vertical solutions for different
markets so from a solution standpoint
here's a quick peek on what does the app
platform really look like essentially on
the left-hand side you have the
visualization or the model of the data
that you have collected you can get
real-time information of what you're
collecting and then on the right hand
side it gives you a quick view of how do
you how does our customer take that
information and create intelligence
around it you're collecting raw data how
do i take that raw piece of data and
make it make it intelligent it does in
this in different conferences you go you
will see a lot of demos around
temperature went up humidity went up
white went down but that those by
themselves are from a customer
standpoint not of value what do you want
to do is you want to kind of bring those
elements together and the combined data
set gives you more information which is
actionable which drives either a
cost-saving or additional revenue for
you from a presentation standpoint our
platform is built in a way whereby we
can pretty much take that information
that you have collected and without with
you should say zero programming create
vertical solutions or applications so we
were talking about you bi application we
could essentially take a gps-enabled
2g or 3G cellular router plug it in and
clear widgets which pretty quickly
cleared you bi applications the customer
takes it out runs a couple of quick
pilots and along the way he'll make
changes in two or three months later he
has a production solution as opposed to
trying to sit down to a market analysis
though you put the solution in the
market see what's working latch onto
that keep improving on it and move
forward yeah it says on there this is
the application of our no coding but is
simple applications you don't have to
know any coding but if you want to do
something advanced like I mentioned
earlier that part Gnostic algorithm for
figuring elements that they might break
you can just paste that right into the
system or if your java developer we
expose Java expression language to
developers make extremely robust
application if you want to do on your
honor or all team our team will do it
for you so it's a powerful tool that the
the most distribute on strongest java
program would still appreciate use it
would save them the time of how to
develop the UI but the simple level kids
actually approachable way business
analyst who we can define are usually
the first people involved in an dem dem
projects until the developers and
central IT get it get put on the project
time check so from a technology
standpoint this is the stack that we are
running on its as you can see it's a
full article stack and we essentially
chose this for the speed at which we
could build our applications on top of
it and also the flexibility of allowing
us to scale as a business grew so using
the stack we believe it gives us the
lowest total operating costs and in our
marketplace we can offer our solutions
to our customer and rapidly scale up as
time goes by so this brings us to the
last portion of the demo or the session
which is the demo that we created for
oracle so about two months maybe three
months ago or who came to us saying hey
we are doing this session here do you
guys want to participate and add as part
of that we might
together a quick demo that showcases the
benefits of m2m and how oracle
technology has been used to build the
whole thing so and at a very high level
the demo is essentially about think
about it as a electronic Easter egg hunt
there are 13 to 12 about 13 demo
stations sprinkled throughout the floor
you as an attendee you get an NFC tag
you walk around you can yourself in and
as you're scanning yourself in you are
getting entered for a grand prize
drawing and in addition to that there
are instant draw winners as well so you
scan it and the system immediately
respond saying you want something you go
you pick it up in the background we are
also collecting a bunch of environmental
data since you are in a conference floor
we couldn't bring any of the machinery
or anything but from an environmental
standpoint we are collecting the
standard temperature humidity light
power consumption data and putting it up
on the laptop so using that information
we were able to create a quick dashboard
which allows the conference floor
organizers to figure out which one of my
stations are more popular based on the
foot traffic people are walking by
scanning they are bad isn't so using
those people can see what which boots
people are going to what boots people
are avoiding and so on and so forth so
as time goes by you might in future
conferences you might have people doing
some real time changes to drive traffic
one way or the other quickly jump
through the other neat thing is looking
at the information that we are gathering
we also have a quick view of what's
going on on the show floor so this is
intuitive but the show starts at eight
o'clock and probably ends around three
or four so you can start seeing activity
taking place if we look at the
environmental sensors you look at the
light sensor which is the bottom green
one during the night it's pretty dark as
you
they've turned on the lights and then
eight o'clock the show floor starts up
you can see the sensor we can go up now
in itself it's just a demonstration of
what the capabilities are but from a
application standpoint an application
could be as simple as putting a la an IP
enable light sensor into a cargo
container or a DHL box and ship it
across the word if the box is opened in
between you would pretty much get an
indication that okay it got opened on
this location and you can figure out
whether it was for official reasons or
was it robbery or some other thing going
on so in this demo we've kind of bought
together machine data through the
environmental sensors we have got people
data together and put together in a
month to two months a conference
tracking application which makes the
whole experience a lot more interactive
and showcases the different type of
services you could bring to market when
you start pulling information from
different sets different type of assets
and build solutions together there's
going to do a quick demo on some of our
other heavy equipment stuff but here is
a this is a left or slide so with that I
would probably end the session and open
it up for any questions that are there
and will be around here if you guys want
to come and talk to us one on one and if
you do want to get hold of us those are
our email addresses
do more questions believe it permanently
talk about love
I think eventually
yep
any kinda dialogues
students
two
yeah we absolutely have you might think
on it the part fish can talk about as
well there's a lot of consumer stuff
happening out there I mean a tremendous
amount ranging from the ipod nike
pedometer solution which people don't
even know in a lot of cases their their
ipod nano as a pedometer that it's not
wireless but you can limit you plug it
in it will report back to nike if you
look if you let it your wireless weight
scales the coffee makers that are aware
of you know when what you want to do tip
of this new range of courage we can have
multiple varieties in it and then want
coffee maker and maybe I'm Tuesday's you
like a certain when it figures that on
and so on and this stuff is showing up
everywhere there's a company actually if
you guys are interested looking locally
here in the bay area called electric amp
an electric imp is doing an awesome job
of basically getting this it's like it
looks like an SD card but it's a it's
yeah you from you've heard of them so so
basically it's it's a it's a Wi-Fi card
you could slide into a consumer
electronics employment it'll figure out
a way to get cell phone to a Wi-Fi
network and just start reporting you
know backwards doing so without spending
hours talking weather's like the
consumer worlds alive with it and we are
talking to some of those companies we
tend to actually run into when people
find us which is relatively hard we
actually are our primary customer that
we work with today as a systems
integrator and those ranges the high-end
from like a PwC type of organization to
most the business and machine of
machines of 5 10 15 person shop the
really large companies call in to help
them design their programs we tend to
work with those guys but increasingly we
have what i call hobbyists who are
usually like exile to say like x siemens
or they come from some fleshly
engineering or samsung company who've
got a new product and we're a great
platform for them to come to and
prototype and sha here's what my thing
does then they can go sell it from which
lies it etc we do have a couple
conversations going on larger consumer
electronics companies but it doesn't
move as fast as the things that we're
trishna doing industrial in the more
industrial setting but it's clearly you
know this is going to affect every age
lives you know and our technology is
just it's a better than to see you I
that's equipped with that
your AT&amp;amp;T service
so forth so AT&amp;amp;T has their own developer
program so you can sign up for that and
as part of that you will get a data sim
with I think it's a one gig or two gig
account and they have some pre can boats
that go along boards modems that go
along with that yeah and yeah and the
same thing applies to other carriers as
well so if you go to board a phone or
verizon for that matter you've got a
similar service of them yeah they've
gotten really me to my earlier points
they've got a really professional about
this i mean the programs that are in
place right now to stalk and certify and
treat sensors and other aftermarket
devices just like a either cell phone
are there so instead of a retail store
they've got like warehouses across the
country where authorized devices are
stocked in the shelf and if you want to
hear one you can 18t is really the only
global provider that's gotten that far
where there's a full for distribution
capability around it but it's the
everybody else is going to have the same
we have partners they handle that on
their own as well by the way is since
you actually kosher about SIM card
instantly enough there's a whole segment
with it are called MVNOs or essentially
virtual network operators that get you
sim cards that can run on multiple
networks including even satellite you
know they can bundle up and give a
satellite device so you could track
something anywhere in the world you want
to across multiple networks not cheap
but it's there so the capabilities to do
virtually everything you're there just
you know it's always again like an
economic MVNO mobile virtual network
operator so these are resellers of
existing AT&amp;amp;T Sprint t-mobile Vodafone
orange air time they get a special like
Tier one rate as a wholesaler and then
they packaged it up as it's usually a
niche application thing like I think
we've touched on container management a
couple times like that's that's
something where containers moving
globally it's got to have one universal
communication mechanism so there's
there's companies have sprung up to fill
that niche the big guys just aren't
focused on right now and they're okay
with it and there's examples of those
around the world
perfect we love to talk either so we
have a couple of large property
management companies that we're working
with that they're starting to some good
stuff so we have some I mean even beyond
the demo that we've done here we've got
some some interesting smart building
things there they're going can you look
oh the class of sim provider that I was
talking about is called an mvno mobile
virtual network operator if you want an
example this there's a company North
America called core telematics KO ari
telematics really easy to find on google
search in Europe there's one called
wireless wyl ESS through in the bay area
we have one that resells Sprint's called
eres AER is and by the way we are
headquartered here i don't know if i had
mentioned that earlier but if anybody's
in town and wants to meet with us we're
around conference yes we're based here
in San Francisco we also have an office
down in the peninsula
any other questions well thanks so much
for every time the questions have been
great so far really appreciate it and
enjoy the rest of the conference and by
all means you have any questions let us
know or drop us a line when you want
happy to talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
