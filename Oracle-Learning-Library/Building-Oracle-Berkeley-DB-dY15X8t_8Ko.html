going to show you how to build an Oracle
Berkeley to be components for java sun
publication you can download both oracle
berkeley DB and the Java sample program
from Berkeley DB so DM website the
sample program requires JDK 7 and at the
time this video is recorded Berkeley DB
does not support a TK 8 so make sure you
have JDK 7 installed on your system the
sample program uses Berkeley DB Java and
the JDBC API s so we need to build a
core sequel Java and JDBC interfaces for
Berkeley DB the process to build these
libraries is different from system to
system you can find detailed
instructions on how to build them in the
documentation shipped with every release
package for example this is the Berkeley
DB release package 6.1 at 19 in the
darks directory you can find a home page
of the documentation index dot HTML open
the home page and scroll down to find
the build installation and upgrade gas
section in the section you can find
links to each platform Berkeley DB
supports take the UNIX platform as
example there you can find a link to the
process of building the JDBC driver
please refer to the documentation for
your platform on how to build the
necessary interfaces here we are going
to show you how to build the interfaces
on a UNIX platform this is the root
directory of Berkeley DB release 6 1019
we use a build and scorer UNIX directory
to rebuild I've prepared a simple build
script
to make the build process easier in this
build script we first start our home to
point to the JDK seven home directory
and then we include JDK seven binaries
in the system's path to build the
necessary components we use the
configure script delivery in the release
package to generate the makefile
to build the necessary components we
need to set in label Java and enable
JDBC options to make sure the compiler
can find the correct JDK header files we
also set the CPP flags to include the
JDK header file directories after the
configure stand we run make install to
build the components and install them in
the directory specified with the prefix
option now everything has been built
successfully let's take a look at the
install directory
in the lib directory we can find the
core sequel in the drama libraries the
native libraries for the Java and the
JDBC API are also installed in the Lib
directory the JDBC API itself is
installed in the jar directory after
building libraries you may choose to
copy them to the sample programs
directory the to jar files are copied
under the lips directory and the for
native libraries are copied to the root
directory of the sample program it is
not required to copy them but it may
simplify the configuration steps after
your imported sample program into her
IDE
the next step is to use one of the
project files included in the sample
program to import the run it in IDE we
have created separate tutorials for the
IntelliJ Eclipse and JDeveloper ad years
