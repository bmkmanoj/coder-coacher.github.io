instance allows you to keep it current
with the latest updates to the system
passing is a simple process that I'll
launch from the Oracle Java cloud
service console first I'll select the
instance I want to patch the
administration tile shows me how many
patches are available for this instance
it shows information about its most
recent backup to supply a patch I'll go
to the patching tab here I can see a
list of approved patches that Oracle
periodically makes available the line
item gives a brief description of each
patch including which component will be
patched
for example WebLogic server or the load
balancer I can also click this icon to
see even more details and now I'll apply
the patch from the patch context menu I
can either patch immediately or run a
pre-check a pre-check looks for issues
prior to patching that might cause the
operation to fail for example disk space
shortage missing database connectivity
if the servers are running and any
storage access failure while patching
also performs these checks doing a pre
check would let me address the issues
before patching in this example I've
already run a pre-check
so I'll just proceed with the patch
this tells me that the patch operation
is underway be aware that the server
instance continues to run during
patching just to ensure that the patch
is on track I'll check its progress if I
take a few moments for the patch should
complete so I'll refresh the page at any
time during the process if I need
assistance with patching I can find the
appropriate links here in the help
drawer
the patching operation creates a backup
of the service which I can track here on
the backup tab if necessary I can use
this backup to restore my instance now
I'll go back to the patching tab and
check the patch history when the patch
appears in the patch history with the
rollback button enabled I know the
patching operation is complete and my
service instance is up to date rolling
back the patch restores a service to its
previous patch level if the patching
operation fails on any server rollback
occurs automatically but if necessary I
can do this manually here on the
patching tab I can roll back any patch
except a load balancer patch and my
rollback is underway I'll check my
rollback progress here now I'll refresh
the page when the patch appears on the
list of available patches and the
rollback button is disabled I know the
rollback is complete I can now reapply
this patch is necessary to learn more

aspects of Oracle Java cloud service
