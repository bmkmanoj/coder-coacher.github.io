welcome to enterprise manager 12 cloud
control today we're going to take a look
at some of the exalogic management
features and enterprise manager
following the login we find ourselves
here at the enterprise summary home page
in order to navigate to the exalogic
dashboard we select from the targets
menu systems from the type drop-down we
then select X logic elastic cloud
followed by search we can drill down
into any X logic elastic cloud simply by
clicking on the name that corresponds to
our exalogic rack instance for each of
our target types we can see clearly the
up and down status in addition to any
incidents that may have taken place this
exalogic view represents both hardware
and software from our high level
application status through the weblogic
stack and corresponding coherence
clusters all the way down to the
hardware that they're running on from
this high-level view I can drill down to
any incidents that come to my attention
for further investigation for this
weblog domain we see three critical
incidents I can drill down into each
target type simply by clicking on the
corresponding link to that asset here we
are at the high level summary of our so
a domain each of the summary regions
provides us information on the state of
our application the high-level submarino
main provides information on the host
that is running I can drill down further
into management consoles whether it be
the fusion middleware control console or
the weblogic server console I see the
state of all my servers of which three
are up and the deployed applications in
their corresponding state for the
deployed applications I see that two are
unknown and 18 are in the Upstate I can
explore to see which of these
applications are up in an unknown state
from Arcilla domain target we have a
number of options for monitoring and
control from the weblogic server
drop-down menu I have access to
enterprise managers lifecycle services
from monitoring I can take a look at the
performance summary of this target the
underlying JVM performance view all the
metrics available for this target to be
collected take a look at the status
history alert history manage incidents
and blackout this target for maintenance
if the metrics I'm viewing indicate a
problem i can drop down further into
diagnostics here i can look at JPM
diagnostics with information on the
underlying jbm consult with the
middleware diagnostics advisor and open
support cases directly with my Oracle
support using Enterprise Manager support
workbench other lifecycle services
includes starting and stopping servers
revealing remote log files managing
configurations and compliance if
additional action is necessary i can
drop down into the weblogic server
administration console or the fusion
middleware control console this
represents the lifecycle services
available for each of the targets in my
exalogic dashboard thank you for taking
a look at exalogic management with
Enterprise Manager 12 cloud control your
single pane of glass for application to
disk management software and hardware
engineered to work together
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
