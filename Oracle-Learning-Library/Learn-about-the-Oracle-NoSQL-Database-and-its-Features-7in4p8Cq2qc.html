Oracle no sequel database can be used in
a very interesting distance use case
I'll be going through the installations
and data process of the no sequel
database software
then I'll be showing a demo on how no
sequel database can be used in the
specific business use case so on this
line I'm telling the story there is a
guy in somewhere sometime in a some
state he's running a local pizzeria and
he deliver pizza to his customer daily
and the way he keep track of his
business is on paper so he started off
his business small and later his
business grew and grew and so he's now
I'm delivering a lot of pizza to his
customers and the next thing you know he
has the whole world in his mind he lied
to deliver more pizza to more customer
around the world and he plans to deliver
15 he planned to open 15,000 stores in
100 countries and 17 billion pizza a
year which means 500 million deliveries
a year and it rounded up to about one
point three seven million delivery a day
which means 57 around 57,000 deliveries
per hour now his wife is no longer able
to keep track of all these activities
using paper so he would need to hire
more assistants to help out I'll figure
it out anyway my next slide shows some
of the challenges requirement that he
need to run his business for example he
needs to deliver a very high quality
pizza that means customer satisfaction
is very important no soggy grass
lukewarm cheese co
Pizza or crash Pizza it has to be on
time delivery and also a very friendly
customer service and his driver is going
to encounter traffic challenges in some
cities and metro areas in some countries
also he need to ensure his driver safety
good compensation and well-being of
course he need to run his business so he
need to increase his profit year by year
and also he need to support a fast
growing business locally and globally
next slide show some clinical challenges
he faced running his business first the
volume of data think about 1.3 million
feet every 15 minutes
so the number the database operation
needed is about average about two
thousand eight hundred fifty-three
average operations and the repeat time
he would need about fourteen thousand
operations for the sudden spike in
orders during the day and also the
database he needed need to capture
real-time data and do real-time analysis
and also there's a variety of different
data and he needs some sort of flexible
schema to run his pastori's data as well
and the system would need to skill out
with his growing businesses so remember
his plan was to open 15,000 store in 100
countries and delivering 17 billion
Pizza a year and we can read the rest of
the number that I presented before that
means 1 Pixar probe vehicle for every 15
minutes delivery let's make that a
assumptions there so he needs about
fourteen thousand two hundred sixty five
vehicles delivering pizza every 15
minutes let's say 10 second between
every stream Li feed 90 total number of
stream poha vehicle every 15 minutes
so Tim during the day he's a guy a pizza
during the night you like to surf around
the internet and he found Oregon no
sequel so he is going to give it a try
he's going to download some software and
onto his desktop and run some testing so
what I'm going to show you my demo is
the download of the software and test a
single no store the downloading process
and setting up a store and be able to
start testing is going to take about
five minutes and productions let's say a
three by three note store it's going to
take about 25 to 30 minutes to setup and
ready
so in short is very easy and fast to
show the download and setup process I'm
using a virtual box here and it's
running Linux first I open up a browser
then I go to the Oracle download site
since I'm you I use the 4.2.1 version so
are we used that previous version to for
downloading so it's right here download
that file save it
then open where that file is located
I'll copy that file that put in the
directory Cardinal sequel which is a one
of the directory that we created then
I'll use terminal to run the unzipping
process
so let me find that pile is right here
so first I would unzip that file
and I would tar dad
so I'm done with the unzipping process
so I've done with the unzipping and
download process so it took actually
less than five minutes there so we're
done with step one
now next is to start a no sequel kV
store so here is the command to start a
kV store so let me go back to the
virtual box here I'm going to open up a
terminal let's look for that directory
kV 0.9 so here I'm going to run the CLI
that I show you I'm going to start a kV
store we call it the KP like store which
is a one-note store kV store and it's
great for testing oops
spell here
so is starting the KB store I'm going to
open up a nother terminal and I'm going
to ping the store to make sure the store
is running fine here's the command to
ping so you have to define is the this
is called a KB host what's the host and
the port Singh
as you can see is running this life and
showing a one-note store so next I'm
going to show the aiming module here is
the command
so we're in the KB store prompt here
a reset terminal so now it's clean you
can see a kV CLI from there so from here
you actually can do a lot of stuff and
I'm just going to run through some a few
administrative command and for the rest
of the commands you can look at the
administration guide for example I can
show the version running so it is
showing version 4.0 9 I also can show
the topology as you can see there is
only one note here KB light is the name
running FD 1 partitioned there are 10
partitions in here verify is to verify
the configurations and a history it just
lists out all the history what I've
typed before and again there are tons of
other commands and you actually can load
data here export data and other commands
are available here so I've shown these
command set up the KB like store run
through some administrative commands
next we should talk about how this
database can be used in the use case we
talked about earlier the pizza delivery
business so we know these are the
numbers and there will be 57 thousand 83
deliveries per hours and these are like
the kind of data I need to capture and
the operations need it okay so now
let's get back to this guy this picture
here we talked about before there's too
much data to track on paper so now team
would need to come up with that
application which he is going to monitor
the business all the way from oil
consumptions the location of the
vehicles the condition of the pizza and
also his business the the profit and
what not now before everything was on
paper now he can use Oracle no sequel
database to do this he can start out
small as the business grow he can expand
to multiple cluster all right let's talk
a little bit about the kind of data
model is going to use so imagine all
these are tables we're going to use the
table data model there will be a
customer profile the customer order the
vehicles profile and the the trip
informations here as you can see these
will be the child table of the parent
table customer and the parent table
vehicles for the demo purposes we'll be
using the vehicles and vehicles trial
table for the demo let me set up the
demo next so here's a JSON format of the
feed coming in it has the VIN number the
drivers ID the type of vehicle and the
feed the feed is an array of Records so
it has the timestamps it has the
location he has a speed and the current
time stamps for the next record you know
we keep track of all these locations and
fuel use so all these are running to
this application
and there is a no psycho driver on the
client-side
which talks to the back-end server it's
a key/value database so the key will be
the VIN data time and the feed object
will be the value so that's how we are
displaying the data so here is the demo
application setup and flow we talked
about the feed coming in from here the
format is going to be like these a whole
bunch of JSON records all right and
there will be a process for loading the
data into the store and then we're going
to show two ways of loading the data
then there is a process of creating
schemas before you load the data
actually and then reading the data and
then present it in the dashboard let me
start setting up the demo so here's the
demo flow from the perspective of
developers so we will create a no sequel
table schema and then interact it into
the no sequel table retrieve the record
from the table using Java private show
two example one using Java the other one
will be using sequel step one is to
create table schema before we talk about
we'll be using two tables one is the the
vehicles table the parent table and the
child table as you can see here the
parent table the profile has the VIN
number which is a string make ma know
the all string year field type it could
be diesel gas electric vehicle type it
could be SUV van truck car
and you look at the child table these
are keeping record of the other feet if
you look at here the current time the
locations the feel use the odometer so
these are the variables in this table or
the item now here is a sample code a
Java sample code for creating the table
as you can see here so you make then a
string make a string model string then
here we'll create index all right and
here is the command to execute the
creation of PS schema all right
and also the second command here is
creating index this is for the parent
table now we look at the child table
similar process code line a quite
similar with a few more lines here
especially this one here creating an
array of records within the racket is
the current time the locations odometer
you get the idea and these are some of
the indexes created for searching and
the same command here is use for
creating a schema
next the example will be load data so we
talk about this data feed here it will
be a file that I have it on the computer
and we'll use that file to load to kind
of simulate the data feed into the the
database so this is a very simple JSON
right kind of data item I'll be using
two different way one to to write the
data
one is to use a put table from the KB
store command line remember I share you
near the administration's CL line prompt
we're going to use that then this is a
way to insert data using a Java program
as you can see here you need to first
get the store kind of connect to the
store then here's the process of
creating a roll feet row put each row of
the item here into the database and then
get table API put if EPS and meaning if
there is nothing in the database added
so that's how you put a row of item the
piece of data into the no sequel
database and the same process for
loading data for the child table is it a
JSON simple JSON format and so here is
the data example data we are loading
here is the code same thing here you
create the first kind of put it all
together then adding to the
to the array adding to the array and
then use the same command get table API
I put straightforward there so we talked
about creating schema two ways of
loading data and we're going to show
that right now going to run the demo I'm
now back at the VirtualBox so let me
show you the sample data that I talked
about earlier so here is the file which
consists of all the records all the rows
for the parent table then here is the
file for the child table the current
time stamp the pin number and the
odometer let me close that file there so
here is the script I'm going to run so
it's running through this script here
the JavaScript so this is what it looked
like actually run the run em in command
remember the first command that Iran was
the administrative CLI command by show
topology and and verify stuff like that
so within that prompt CLI prompt you can
actually load data so that's what I'm
going to show so is a load - file so
it's going to load this file which is
the fire I'll show you that's the parent
profile data source next I'm going to
create the schema and load the data
you see start to load the data the JSON
file that I show you before just for the
parent and the trial so it's going to
continuously loading those data
so we are back now at the VirtualBox let
me get to the directory that I need
first
so this will run the dashboard here
here's the dashboard I show in the slide
deck let me start the feed so now is
reading from the database um one of the
program that I show you is loading the
data while the dashboard is reading the
data so as you can see here these are
the different data and the dial the mile
average miles per gallon right for this
vehicle this VIN number different VIN
number different vehicles here does the
average mileage per gallon and I can
show the fuel consumption that's the
number of gallons use for traveling that
speed finally is the distant travel
here's the distant roll miles all right
all right so we have seen how the
dashboard read the data from the JSON
file that we load into the database that
ends the demo for this portions the last
demo I'm going to show is a new feature
we release Oh
during Oh W 2016 is the sequel query
feature allows you to use standard
sequel syntax to query the database here
is the way to connect to the database
and here are some samples of the sequel
syntax as you can see it's very standard
so what I'm going to do is to just show
the last statement here to make sure it
worked and you should see this kind of
result so we are doing a select on bin
number driver's ID date mile per gallon
total distance from the child table
where the driver's ID is this and order
by date in descending order we are now
back at the VirtualBox so I'm going to
connect to the store you should see a
sequel prompt now we're going to do the
select statement restore before so you
should see this result just like what I
showed in the slide deck all right that
concludes my presentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
