Cloud Control 12c demo series in this
demonstration I'll show you how to
upgrade JVM diagnostics and application
dependency and performance or adp
engines and agents in enterprise manager
cloud controlled 12c this video is
applicable to enterprise manager cloud
control version 12.1 point zero point
three if you're on an earlier version
consider upgrading using self update the
steps to upgrade an ADP engine and agent
are not shown in this demo but are
exactly the same as the JVM d upgrades
except for the addition of one step when
you upgrade an ADP agent you also need
to specify OEMs credentials that is the
whose credentials of the OEMs host and
the domain credentials for the
enterprise manager WebLogic domain from
any page in enterprise manager will go
to set up middleware management
application performance management on
this page we can see icons indicating
that one JVM Diagnostics agent in one
JVM diagnostics engine are out of date
and should be upgraded to upgrade the
engine simply click on this upgrade icon
here we can see that the JVM diagnostics
engine that we want to upgrade is
selected it's collapses pain and now
we'll specify the host credential where
the engine is deployed and we'll use
named credentials as we already have
those set up and now we'll specify the
credentials for the administration
server of the enterprise manager
WebLogic domain and again we'll use
named credentials
and let's click apply and then upgrade
now we'll click OK confirming that we do
want to upgrade this engine and let's
look at this job to view the job status
and we can see that the upgrade jvm
diagnostics engine job has succeeded so
let's return to the application
performance management page and now we
can see that there's no longer an
upgrade icon next to the jvm diagnostics
engine so we know it's up to date and
you can see the new version number here
so that's it for upgrading a jvm
diagnostics engine to upgrade the jvm
diagnostics agent we can either go to
manage diagnostics agents or click on
this upgrade icon for operation ensure
that upgrade is selected now let's find
the agent that we want to upgrade and
you see here there's a more recent
available version and that it's already
checked by default so we can go on to
the next page now let's set the
credentials for the target first of all
collapses pain so we'll set the login
credentials for the host where the
enterprise manager agent used to
discover this target domain is running
will use named credentials as we already
have those set up and next we'll set the
weblogic credentials for the target
domain like those used to log into the
weblogic administration console and
again we'll use named credentials let's
click apply and go on to the next page
now we'll select the jvm diagnostics
engine that the agent reports to
see which ones are available and we'll
select this one then we'll click apply
and go to the next page now we'll check
our settings are correct on this review
page and click upgrade the job is
submitted and on this deployment status
page we can click this link to see the
status of the job here you see the job
performs the different operations
necessary in order to upgrade the jvm
diagnostics agent let's refresh this
page and now the statuses succeeded so
upgrade is complete let's go back to the
application performance management page
and we conceive is no longer an upgrade
icon next to the jvm dajun count so we
know it's up to date so that's it for
upgrading a jvm diagnostics agent thanks
