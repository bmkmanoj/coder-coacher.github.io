work as product manager for Oracle
sequel database here at Oracle and I
welcome you to this webinar on oracle
oracle database setup and run oracle no
sequel cluster in less than 30 minutes
so let's look at the program agenda tree
so I start by giving a brief
introduction about what Oracle no sequel
database is all about and then we'll do
a hands-on lab so in this hands-on lab
they set up a nine no sequel nine node
no sequel faster and you'll see how easy
and simple it is to do that so let's get
started with what really is oracle moon
sequel database oracle no sequel
database is simple fast reliable and
flexible data management solution so it
is simple you can really set up a nine
nodes no single cluster in less than 30
minutes it's fast we have tested our
epsilon sequel database with 1.25
million operations per second internally
it is flexible it provides a variety of
data modeling options so you can either
models as a rocky value pair a table
format as well as there is an option to
model as a JSON data type so depending
on the type of the application that you
are trying to put you can pick the model
which is most suited for your app and of
course it is extremely reliable so
before we actually do the lab let's just
spend some time understanding some of
the key concept in article on sequel
database so what you see on your screen
is the full key space or the set of keys
that you want model in the sequel
database is hashed into multiple hash
buckets or six set of partitions for the
college auditions now the Oracle new
sequel drivers are aware about this hash
function so given a key it will return
as the the partition ID now the set of
partitions are grouped together and what
we call as a shot which is really a
logical contain
for subset of the data and all of this
is managed by Oracle no sequel database
the distribution of partitions in a
shard is even so for example if you have
three shots and 30 partitions
each heart gets ten partition inside the
shark there are one or more replication
nodes or RN these are really the Java or
multi-threaded server process for high
availability and reach scalability
reasons we recommend you know having
three such are ends inside a shot the
each the the replication nodes are
actually deployed on storage node which
is really a physical or virtual machine
you can think of storage node as a
single unit of failure so now with this
as introduction let's look at the
overview of the hands-on lab so in this
hands-on lab we want to focus on you
know how one can go about downloading
and installing Oracle known sequel
database and then what is it take to
really deploy or no sequel cluster so
download and install so it's pretty
straightforward
visit our ot n page Oracle technology
Network page on the download tab you
will see the links to download different
editions of electron sequel database
you'll also find links to download the
drivers we support multiple drivers
Java Python no chairs and so on so forth
so depending on the track that you've
Chetan so if you are really testing and
evaluating Oracle no sequel database we
recommend you can set up a single node
no sequel and can be really done in less
than five minutes or if you are doing
production or performance kind of thing
we recommend setting up a multi node no
sequel is clustered or a three by three
store and that can be done in less than
30 minutes
so let's look at the lab so in today's
lab what we really want to do is we want
to set up a data center we called the
Houston data center and then here we
want to set up a three by three no
sequel clusters three hearts each having
three copies of the data so you can see
there are three shots shard one shard
bouchard thing and inside the shard
there are three nodes there is one node
which is elected as a master node and
the other nodes are what we call is a
replica node so before we actually do
the hands-on lab let's just understand
the cluster deployment step so at high
level these are steps what you really
need to do to set up and deploy an OC
2000 the first step is to bootstrap the
storage node that will be used in no
sequel deployment so this step creates a
config file in the kV root folder the
second step is to really start the
storage node agent which works as a
listener you have to really perform both
the steps on each of the storage node
that will be used on the deployment of
no sequel database having done that the
final step is to really run the set of
admin commands a the commands are first
we create a store or we name the store
then we create a data center then we
assign the storage node that bootstrap
to our data center and finally reply the
no sequel cluster so this is all it
takes to really apply the logic
professor so before we actually start
doing a cluster deployment
unless look at a utility that we provide
which can assist in the deployment so
it's called as a make put config command
so make book conflict mind is it utility
that Bishop and which can assist the
deployment so let's look at some of the
parameters the route is where the kV
root full is pointing to the capacity is
you know how many number of disk that
you have for the storage node the H a
range both memory you know what is kind
of memory that you want to allocate for
the replication node so if you don't
provide any
the system automatically takes a
depression of that the hostname and the
storage node so so let's look at the
handle lab now so I have a virtual
machine and what I'm going to do here is
I'll quickly jump to the folder where I
have written some script which can be
useful
today's deployment so I am at this
folder called you want no sequel scripts
and I like I said I have some scripts
written which we can use further for
this hands on that so if you remember
correctly the first step was to daily
run the make boot command
so let's open the make good concept so
mind you I am simulating the situation I
am running this lab in my virtual
machine so we are really simulating a
situation of a storage node each having
you know capacity of 3 so in this is all
done in a single virtual machine in the
production environment you can do it in
a single traditional so the so the first
step is really point to the data folders
on each storage node so I create three
story tional sn1 sn2 SMT and if you look
at the make put concept so the route is
inside each of solution we don't want to
set up the security so it's set to none
the capacity state we want we we
assimilating a situation where each
storage node has three director - disk
the H arrange port and then the memory
we are allocating 200 MV for its
traditional the kV host is I've created
multiple hosts and in my ET c oz file
and therefore all pointing to the single
machine the storage node directory for
each of the storage node I'm calling it
as a u1 u2 and u3
and likewise I do it for each of the
storage node so remember we are setting
up a 3x3 store so we are good strapping
three stores not so let me come out of
this command and run the script books
app stores node it is done bootstrapping
the next step was to start the storage
node agent or listening let's look at
the script 14 that so as you can see I
am calling the start utility and I am
passing the root of each of the storage
node to the Cavey store start black so
let's start that na okay
it returns pretty quickly and if you
recall the thread step was to run those
series of edwin commands so i in the
interest of time i have scripted those
so i have written those in a file called
three by three KBS so let's look at that
so if you recall the first step was to
name it so we call we are calling it as
a kv store we are creating a data center
we named it houston and we are saying a
replication factor of T or number of
copies that we want to keep as 3 and now
we deploy our first storage node in this
data center and we do it and we said the
port is 5000 likewise we can do it for
each of this storage node and finally we
create a topology we call it as 3 by 3
we have created 120 partitions and
before we actually go ahead and deploy
this we do a preview and as a final step
we deploy the topology so this is all it
takes to set up and deploy no sequel
cluster so if you noticed about 15 or 20
lines of code that can give you high
availability your applications and all
of that how simple it can get so what
I'm going to do is I'll run this so
let's see what happens
this is going to take some time what I
have done is I open another terminus and
I am entering that wind pork and win
prompt so in this problem we can see
this topology so so I run the admin
shell script okay so we are the Dedmon
prompt and I would use this command
called short of logic it can show me the
status of the deployment so it is still
doing so as you can see on the left of
the screen what we are asking is three
shots nine are in sanh 120 partitions so
in my introduction I mentioned we evenly
distribute the partitions are called
fish oil so there are t-shirts and 120
partitions which means each art catch
for the partitions so let me fire the
show toca logic man again so if you can
see the output the three storage nodes
are deployed it is it is running the
plan to deploy each of the audence into
the chart so let's give it some more
time before the command returns
once it returns you should be able to
see all the three shots each having the
three replication note and the
distribution of the partitions
let's look at where we are so let me
expand the screen for you so to shards
are deployed so we'll give it some more
time
you
let's see where we are on the topology
all the three shots are deployed as
again three all the audence are deployed
as well so now in this command another
done in any time as you can see you know
we also show some you know you know the
status of each other n in what is the
latency you know so this information can
be very useful if you are trying you
know some issue on so just wait for in a
couple of more seconds and then we have
our no sequel 3x3 no sequel deployed and
running so now you see the partitions
are distributed so like I said each hard
catch the 40 partition and so the
command has returned it successfully all
the status of each all in process is
running right so so so with that our no
sequel topology is deployed so we can
come out of of this Advent prompt so
that concludes this webinar I hope you
found it easy and simple thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
