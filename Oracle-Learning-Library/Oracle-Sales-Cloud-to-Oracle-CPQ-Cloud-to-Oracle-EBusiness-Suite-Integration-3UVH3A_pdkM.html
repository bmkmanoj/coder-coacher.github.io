has decided to modernize their sales
ecosystem by subscribing to oracle
salescloud
for their customer relationship
management requirements they've also
acquired Oracle's CPQ cloud to reduce
sales cycle times for their quote to
cash process now they need to integrate
this data with their on-premise Oracle
e-business suite they've chosen Oracle
integration cloud service or ICS as
their strategic platform for this
integration ICS will be used for
bi-directional data synchronization
between oracle salescloud cpq and EBS
this demo illustrates how an opportunity
can be converted into a quote and then
in order with just a few clicks
using ICS after Gabriel the sales rep
logs into Oracle sales cloud he creates
a new opportunity he enters information
for the opportunity and adds the
Associated products to complete the
opportunity configuration next Gabriel
creates a quote for the opportunity this
will seamlessly bring up the CPQ cloud
data exchange happened automatically for
example you can see the customer
information an opportunity name are
retrieved from the sales cloud also the
transaction name and transaction ID are
populated automatically the current net
revenue looks good so Gabriel submits
the quote he returns back to the sales
cloud to check the opportunity list the
summary of the quote is sent to sales
cloud automatically the quote
configuration is complete Gabriel
presents this quote to the customer and
after negotiations the quote is accepted
a new sales order is created an
e-business suite Gabriel can check the
details of the sales order now when the
customer calls Gabriel for details on
where the order is he calls the order
management team and quotes the order
number in e-business suite with that the
details of the order can be retrieved
immediately now let's take a look at how
you can build this integration using ICS
quickly and without any coding Bob the
integration designer of vision
incorporated logs into the ICS web
console this console is the one-stop
shop for designing monitoring and
managing all your integrations from the
landing page
can perform one of the following tasks
create connections to various SAS and
on-premise applications build
integrations between connections or
monitor transactions through the
dashboard Bob starts with the
connections Oracle integration cloud
service provides a number of pre-built
connections
these include connections to SAS
on-premise social applications and more
you can also review all existing
connections to various applications as
you can see the configuration is simple
specify the URL to access and the
account credentials this configuration
is consistent across all other
connections all three connections for
e-business suite CPQ cloud and sales
cloud have been configured Bob moves on
to the integration the landing page
shows all the integrations that Bob and
his team have created Oracle integration
cloud service provides pre-built
integrations to integrate between
various SAS and on-premise applications
Bob uses the pre-built integration
provided by Oracle for the sales cloud
to CPQ cloud integration connections to
CPQ cloud and sales cloud are set as the
source and target of the integration
data mappings are configured for data
exchanges bob activates the flow in one
click now messages can seamlessly flow
between sales cloud and CPQ cloud then
he activates the Save quote details in
sales cloud integration synchronization
of quote details into sales cloud is
enabled next bob creates a new
integration from scratch to enable the
creation of the sales order any business
suite when the quote is accepted in CPQ
cloud on the right is the list of SAS
and on-premise connections he's created
previously since the order information
is sent from cpq to e-business suite bob
drags and drops the CPQ connection to
the source section
he enters basic information like name
and service definition method and
specifies service details next bob
configures the target of the integration
ebusiness suite bob is securely
connecting to metadata from the
e-business suite instance in the data
center ICS enables you to do this
without punching a hole in your firewall
the next step is to create the data
mappings between these two endpoints
typically this is the most complex and
time-consuming part of delivering the
integration
however with the simple data mapper in
ICS Bob can easily drag and drop to
create the mapping also ICS has a
mapping recommendation system that can
create the mapping automatically the
time and cost required to build and
deliver mappings are significantly
reduced bob has completed the
integration and he hasn't written a line
of code or worked on an XML schema XSLT
or other artifacts he activates the flow
in one click messages can now seamlessly
flow between CPQ cloud and ebusiness to
create a sales order when the
opportunity is closed
Bob can now monitor the transactions in
real time by clicking on the monitor
section it provides dashboards for all
key performance metrics of the
transactions Bob can also perform error
management and troubleshoot failed
transactions in one place for more
