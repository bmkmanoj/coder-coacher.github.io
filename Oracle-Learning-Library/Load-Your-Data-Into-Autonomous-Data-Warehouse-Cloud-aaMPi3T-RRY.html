from an Oracle object store into a
database in autonomous data warehouse
cloud
if you have small volumes of data to
load into autonomous data warehouse
cloud you can load data via sequel net
if you have large volumes of data the
preferred technique is to load from
files stored in a cloud-based object
store such as Oracle object storage or
Amazon AWS s3 this video shows you how
to upload data to Oracle object storage
and then copy this stage data into
database tables in autonomous data
warehouse cloud
you have signed in to Oracle cloud
infrastructure
you have selected object storage from
the storage menu
and you have created a bucket in a
compartment of Oracle object storage
click upload object to begin selection
of the data files you want to upload to
the bucket
navigate to the location of the data
files on your local computer
drag and drop each file or click upload
object to upload each file in this
example the data files of the sales
history tables from an Oracle sample
schema are being uploaded alternatively
you can use curl commands to upload
large numbers of files
the data files are uploaded to the
bucket these files stage to the cloud
are ready to be copied into the tables
of your autonomous data warehouse cloud
database to load data from an Oracle
cloud infrastructure object storage
objects store you will need to create a
swift password for your object store
account the communication between your
autonomous data warehouse cloud database
and the object store relies on the Swift
protocol and username password
authentication click user settings under
your user name at the top right of the
object storage console
click swift passwords under resources on
the left of the console click generate
password a pop-up dialog appears set the
swift password by performing the
following steps in the pop-up dialog
enter a description click the generate
password button copy the generated
password to a text file it will not be
shown again click close next store the
credentials of the object store in the
target schema of your autonomous data
warehouse cloud database open sequel
developer and connect to your autonomous
data warehouse cloud database as your
target user
in a sequel developer worksheet use the
create credential procedure of the DBMS
cloud package to store the object store
credentials in your target user schema
create a credential name you will
reference this credential name in the
copy data procedure in the next step
specify the credentials for your Oracle
data infrastructure object storage
service the object storage username and
swift password generated in the previous
step after you run this script your
object stores credentials will be stored
in your autonomous data warehouse cloud
user schema in a sequel developer
worksheet use the copy data procedure of
the DBMS cloud package to copy the data
staged in your object store to your
autonomous data warehouse cloud user
tables for credential name specify the
name of the credential you defined for
file URI List specify the URL that
points to the location of the file
staged in your object store the URL is
structured as follows where you specify
the region name tenant name bucket name
and file name
after you run the procedure observe that
the data has been copied from the object
store to the tables in your autonomous
data warehouse cloud database
all data load operations done using the
PL sequel package DBMS cloud are logged
in to tables the DBA load operations
table shows all load operations the user
load operations table shows the load
operations in your schema this example
queries the user load operations table
it shows that five rows were loaded into
the channels table with no failures the
log and bad files are accessible as
tables for detailed steps on performing
the example shown in this video go to
the Oracle Learning Library and open the
tutorial named loading your data thank
