an Oracle cloud service login as an
account administrator for your Oracle
cloud service upon sign in you'll see
your services registered for your
identity domain so in this example
there's database database to and Java
service to see the details of that
service you can either click on the
magnifying glass or click on the service
itself so the overview tab this database
service tells me subscription ID order
ID e tells me about the data center one
very important items here is it tells me
the identity domain so when you sign
into your services you'll need that my
services URL so if you're adding users
you want to make sure that you also send
them the URL to login to the service
there's service SFTP details here which
is very critical if you do secure ftp
transactions with your service and
here's the username for that and need
that information and the house
information identity domain has its own
SFTP user information and host as well
and this service happens to be
associated with the Java service so when
you sign up for Java service you also
need to have the database service to
support that okay so this gives you an
overview of your services or for a
specific service i should say if you
click on the utilisation tab and you get
more details about the service itself
so there's a history section and there's
an object section at least for database
service areas it tells me about the
amount of storage use maximum storage
use and so on so you can get some
breakdown of your service usage here
it's good status okay so here's the
calendar view it's basically saying it's
been up one hundred percent of the time
the last four days and I have other
button buttons here you can scroll
through so if you wanted to see previous
month's utilization I sign up for the
service back on my 25th that was the
start date click on the administration
tab now here's the opportunity if you're
an account administrator you can
actually add additional account
administrators to help you in getting
users up and running in the signing
roles and so on so you just click Add
and go ahead and fill out that
information about those users and send
it to their email address and click on
the resources tab
so here are some additional resources
for you that you might want to review
including documentation and tutorials
and videos skirt status history status
history which what's nice about this
from the account views it shows me all
three of my services and the history for
that usage so i added database to after
database one as you can see a breakdown
here that didn't come online too much
29th this is a daily view you can change
that to a weekly view where it breaks it
down the week of or a monthly view okay
so this basically tells me system was
this service was up and running one
hundred percent of the time for this
time frame so status is free page
displays the uptime percentage of all
your services this information is the
same as that displayed under status tab
of a particular service except that this
view lists all your services and allows
you to select the time frame by clicking
the daily view weekly view or monthly
view okay so that was a database service
and we're going to have a slightly
different look for a java monitoring
let's take a look at Java services okay
so view here is fairly similar statuses
you use the same administration still
the same resources are saying other than
that these are specific to java service
click on status history again same view
tells you utilization for all your
services and gives you the option for
different views whether it's daily
monthly or weekly B's key difference of
java and that's captured in a separate
video is that you have a Java cloud
console to monitor your Java Java
specific cloud service
well that's in another video so in this
video you learn some of the key tools
for monitoring your Oracle cloud service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
