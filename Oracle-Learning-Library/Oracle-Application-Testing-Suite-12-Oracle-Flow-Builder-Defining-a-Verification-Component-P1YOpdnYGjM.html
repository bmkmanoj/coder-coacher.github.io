component inaudible flow builder we are
going to define a verification component
for the purchase order form we are going
to verify for field supplier status
amount agreed and released now let's
login into Oracle flow builder provide a
username a password and click on login
navigate to components link navigate
with the release product family product
and the feature way we would like to
create the component right click on the
feature and select create component
provide a name for the component we are
going to verify a purchase order which
is of type BPA so we are providing the
name as verify BPA header details we
would provide the relevant tax which
would ease the search of components
provide a relevant description to verify
the header details for a purchase order
which is a BPA click on save now we
would update the component right click
on the component which we have created
just now and select the option attach
code add the number of rows the first
keyword would be set appt type depending
on the application type now we are
working for the forms application so we
would select the object as forms next
would be set window display name would
be the window name purchase orders the
attribute value will be picked from
forms Diagnostics we will see how it can
be picked in the further steps first we
would write a line for verifying the
supplier here it is an edit field so we
would use the keyword verify object
would be added
displayname would be the label of the
field that a supplier and attributes go
to help diagnostics examine you would
concatenate the block and field values
to get the attribute Pio headers vendor
name this would be our attribute value
next we would verify the field status
which is also an edit field verify edit
and the label would be display name that
the status in tribute value will again
be picked from diagnostics next we would
verify the amount a grade field keyword
is verify as it is an edit field we
would use the object as edit again
display name would be the label amount
agreed
and attribute value will be picked from
Diagnostics
next we would verify released field it
is also an edit field so verify edit
display name would be the label released
and we provide our attribute value from
Diagnostics now this is our verification
component which would verify for fields
in this form
next we click on save the component is
saved we click on submit well the
component is ready for use in any flow
now let us see how to use it in a flow
navigate to flows we have a flow here
which creates a requisition creates a
purchase order and queries for it create
VPN forms we will update the flow with
this component navigate to the scenario
where we would like to do the
verification if we notice here the last
step is snabba gate forms and the last
component to search pio summary common
it opens the purchase order form and
queries with the p.o that is created we
will use our component which we have
created to verify these four fields
highlight the release enter the
component name which we have created
verify BB a header details and click on
search we are using a percentile for
wildcard this is the component which we
have created we are going to drag it
into our flow now the component is added
in the flow we need to add test data to
it the test data should be the expected
value from the application we would
enter the expected value supplier would
be General Electric status should be
approved amount agreed here we should
enter the data exactly how it appears in
the application and released click on
save click on close
this is how we can define a verification
component and use it in a flow
please contact us on these email ids for
any further queries or additional
