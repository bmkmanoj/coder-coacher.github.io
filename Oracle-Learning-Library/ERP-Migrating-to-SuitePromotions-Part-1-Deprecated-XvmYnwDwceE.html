introduce you to some changes that come
in soon to promotions in NetSuite in the
second video in this series we'll
provide a demonstration with how to
migrate to the new Suite promotions and
take advantage of their new features
NetSuite promotions are undergoing a
change that will provide you with a new
leaner faster and enriched promotions in
this video we will take a look at the
new features that are being introduced
in suite promotions and their benefits
explain the migration process step by
step for users who have existing
promotions and clarify exactly how suite
promotions will integrate seamlessly
into your NetSuite environment let's
begin by taking a quick look at some of
the forthcoming new features of suite
promotions stackable promotions or to
apply best offer a new improved user
interface and improved scalability and
performance the stackable promotions
feature allows you to apply multiple
promotions to an order or transaction no
longer a customer's limited to one
promotion per transaction you can
combine a number of promotions as
desired you also have complete control
over which promotions you want to be
able to stack in which you prefer to be
exclusive and not combined with other
promotions
furthermore when exclusive promotions
are eligible on a transaction the system
will smartly choose which promotion or
promotions should be applied to ensure
the customer gets the best offer we have
an improved user experience thanks to
new intuitive promotions forms for each
promotion type making it easier and
quicker to create sweet promotions no
matter how complex
finally we are introduced in a base
engine that provides a solid foundation
for promotions engine that is both
functionally rich performance and
scalable do you start taking advantage
of these new promotion features first of
all it's important to know that if you
have existing promotions they are not
compatible with the new features we are
introducing so we recommend you replace
them with sweet promotions as soon as
you can you can start creating sweet
promotions that take advantage of the
new features and use them immediately
while you can still apply standards and
advance promotions if needed to a
transaction until you arrive at the
point where all your promotions can be
stacked and automatically applied using
the best offer logic so how exactly will
the migration work you can continue
using your standard and advanced
promotions without enabling sweet
promotions but remember you will not be
able to benefit from the new sweet
promotions features when you enable
sweet promotions you can benefit from
the new features straight away you can
create sweet promotions that can be
stacked and automatically applied to
transactions and you will use a new
promotion form for each type of
promotion you wish to create while
standard advanced and sweet promotions
will be available for all transactions
in the new UI you cannot stack standard
or advanced promotions and you will only
ever be able to add one of these
promotions to a transaction by default
the first promotion you apply to a
transaction determines if stackable can
be used if you apply a standard or
advanced promotion to a transaction new
features are disabled
continue using your old standard and
advance promotions until you no longer
need them or they are no longer valid
replace them as soon as you can create
an equivalent in sweet promotions soon
you will only be using sweet promotions
and will it seamlessly migrated to the
new promotions engine please watch the
next video in this series where we will
demonstrate how to set up and take
advantage of the new sweet promotions
