hello and welcome to the screen watch
for sybase ase plugin for Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c today we will be
reviewing the updated 12 10 30 plugin
including its new features and
monitoring capabilities throughout this
video we'll see how the Oracle
Enterprise Manager sybase ase plugin is
such a great individual solution for
monitoring your sybase ase environment
its integration with Oracle Enterprise
Manager makes it an ideal solution for
any heterogeneous database environment
before we get started let's quickly
review what we will be covering in this
video
we'll be going over the plug-in support
capabilities core features some of which
are new to this release and finally the
plugins integration with OEM the sybase
ase plugin is compatible with the
current OEM release of 12c are for it
has been updated to include support for
sybase ase 15 7 and 16 you can see i
have already logged in to an Oracle
Enterprise Manager 12c Cloud Control web
console and navigated to the enterprise
summary page from here or any other page
in cloud control you can navigate to the
all targets page by selecting targets
all targets once at the all targets page
we can find and view our sybase ase
targets you can refine your search by
selecting the sybase adaptive server
enterprise target type from the left
navigation pane this will filter the
list of targets to only targets relating
to this plugin clicking on the deployed
target will bring us to the plugins home
page the first thing we'll look at on
the plugin homepage is the summary
overview the summary overview provides
details of the database status up time
server name and sybase version at the
bottom of this view is a link to the
analysis page clicking this link will
bring us to the analysis page will visit
this in a moment next to the summary
view is the database instances table in
this table each database associated with
this monitored sybase ase will be listed
as a row with status size and space
available
if you click on a column header the
table sort by that metric type
more detailed data about the sybase ase
database is displayed in the second and
third rows of this homepage this data
includes the memory statistics and top
processes by cpu usage in a bar graph
line graphs for the worker process
memory connection utilization data cache
hit ratio and device io metrics hovering
over the line graphs and bar graphs will
display call-outs with details on the
specific data points
at the bottom of the home page you can
find these standard OEM incidents and
problems and job activity views here you
can quickly view any incidents that have
occurred from metric thresholds and
other problems mousing over the incident
will give the full description while
clicking it will bring you to the
incident manager next we'll navigate to
the all new analysis page by clicking
the link we looked at earlier in the
summary panel
this analysis page is broken into two
main sections the top 5 sequel statement
and the top five wait events the top 5
sequel statements can be organized by
cpu time wait time or memory while the
top 5 wait events can be organized by
weight time or weight count after
selecting the metric to view each graph
can then be filtered to show different
sections in time by day week and month
hovering over different points in this
graph will display detailed information
on that metric point
the table below the graph offers
detailed information about the top 5
sequel statements for the given graph
selectors mousing over the query in the
table will give a more complete view of
the query moving down to the top 5 wait
events graph again we are able to hover
over these lines to display detailed
data points
the two pages we have just covered
display some of the most critical sybase
information however to view all of the
metrics collected by this plug-in we
will navigate to the all metrics view
here the metrics collected are organized
into metric groupings the most recent
data collected can be viewed as well as
some of the historic values that are
stored by the plug in these metrics
explore the breadth of the plugins
ability to collect data from the sybase
ase environment to explore metric
further expand the metric group in the
left column and then select one of the
specific metrics you wish to view the
values collected for that metric are
displayed in this table on the right as
you can see the right portion of this
page is split horizontally into two
sections the top section shows all
collected values and the bottom section
graphs the historical values of the
selected row over time
the time frame for the graph can be
changed by selecting the view data drop
down menu above the top table
now that we have a good understanding of
all the metrics that are collected by
the plug-in let's review the available
incident thresholds that we can utilize
to alert us in the case of a failure or
problem setting instant thresholds and
collecting historic data on these
metrics can prove to be a very
beneficial aid in alerting
administrators of potential issues to do
this we'll navigate to the metric and
collection settings page this metric and
collection settings page is already
predefined without the box thresholds
for some of the configurable metrics its
desired you can fine-tune these
thresholds for each of the metrics in
this list to a specific value
the last thing we'll look at are the
information publisher reports the sybase
ase plugin is shipped with over 26
out-of-the-box reports for easy and
quick reporting of key metrics
for an example let's take a look at the
report for sybase ase performance
statistics
as a report loads you'll see the data is
logically organized for quick viewing
and easy prints ability these sybase ase
information publisher reports are also
great for analyzing trends and data and
finding stress points in your ASE
environment before they occur
that concludes the screen watch for the
sybase ase plugin thank you for taking
the time to watch this brief
demonstration hopefully you have found
this demonstration to provide good
insights into the updated sybase ase
plugin and how it can add value to your
infrastructure
