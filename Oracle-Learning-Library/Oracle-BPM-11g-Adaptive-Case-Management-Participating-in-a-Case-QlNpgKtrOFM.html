curriculum developer at Oracle in this
video I'll show you what it's like to
participate in a case using Oracle BPM
11g this is the third in a series of
three videos on adaptive case management
in Oracle BPM 11g all three videos are
available in the Oracle Learning Library
at the address you see here in the first
video you learned what adaptive case
management was and we compared it to
conventional business process management
or bpm we also described the types of
processes that benefit from adaptive
case management in the second video you
learned about the components of a case
in Oracle BPM 11g in this video you'll
see what a case looks like from an
end-users perspective let's take a quick
look at the scenario that we'll be using
in this video a credit card company
wants to manage their complete
management process when a customer
registers a complaint that complaint
typically goes through three phases
initial assessment investigation and
resolution these phases are defined
using milestones at any point in time
caseworkers may have to review documents
add stakeholders to the case make phone
calls check the agency's protocols send
emails talk with several people and even
create brand-new tasks that cannot be
predicted ahead of time in other words
it's hard to predict exactly what will
be needed to investigate and resolve the
issues and by nature the process is ad
hoc Oracle BPM adaptive case management
supports this kind of unstructured
process giving caseworkers the tools
they need without constraining them with
a predefined process flow let's take a
look at what a case looks like from the
perspective of caseworkers in the credit
card company
assume a customer goes through her
latest credit-card statement and notices
that the reward points earned don't
match her spending for that statement
period she calls the diamond credit card
company to get this fixed
the person she reaches creates a new
service request using the application
form you see here customer details are
here the request type is complaint and
the sub type is missing rewards points
there's a brief description of the
complaint and then the service request
is submitted let's say James Cooper is
one of the case owners responsible for
reward related complaints the service
request shows up on James's task list in
business process workspace he can see
certain details of the complaint and he
can accept the task thereby claiming the
case he'll be the main person watching
over this case but as you'll see he'll
get a lot of help in order to manage the
case James navigates to the case view
and selects the case in the navigation
bar here at a glance James can monitor
case progress access case artifacts
initiate new activities and so on the
audit trail shows that the system
automatically started the case completed
the preparer complaint case activity
based on data submitted in the original
service request and started the initial
assessment milestone going the data view
shows the data for this case so far and
there are no documents yet James can see
which activities are available or have
been completed what the milestones are
for this case and who the stakeholders
are by role
let's assume James notices the
credit-card information is missing this
is important for resolving the case so
he initiates the review complaint
details activity to request that
customer service reps supply the missing
information he clicks that activity puts
in a brief comment and clicks initiate
based on how this case has been
configured this task is routed to all
customer service reps Charles Dickens is
a customer service rep he sees the task
on his task list adds the credit card
information and clicks ok as soon as
Charles does that the case view which
James is monitoring shows that the task
has been completed James takes a look at
the data and sees that the credit card
information has been entered
perhaps he finds other things that are
missing he could reinitiate the review
complaint details tasks if necessary
until he is satisfied that the data is
complete depending on what is necessary
he could create an ad-hoc task or add
tasks from the add activity x' list he
could raise a previously defined user
event and so on there is no prescribed
flow
once James is satisfied that the
necessary data is there he initiates the
conduct initial assessment activity
after a refresh the case view reflects
that the conduct initial assessment
activity is currently running James can
even check which role has been assigned
to that task by looking at the task
details and expanding the history
section in this case those with the
analyst role have been assigned to this
task william faulkner is an analyst he
sees the task on his task list and
selects it to complete the initial
assessment he'll have to specify an
outcome and recommended actions William
can navigate to the case view to see
what has happened so far and to examine
the case data more closely
after looking at the data let's say
William decides he needs more
information from the customer
a little while later he receives the
document by email and uploads it
Oracle BPM case management is integrated
with content management so in addition
to uploading one or more versions of a
file William and other caseworkers can
check out a file as you see here
after viewing the file they could check
a revised version back in
or they could cancel the checkout
notice that the system automatically
initiates a review document activity for
the complaint management case this is
defined to happen when a document is
uploaded and is an example of how
content which is a key element of any
case can drive case progression in other
words content can change the behavior of
the case when the system initiates the
review document activity that task
appears on Williams task list the
document has been attached to the human
task if the document isn't legible
William could send another request to
the customer and upload a new version of
the document all of this is supported by
the case view and tracked in the audit
trail here we assume the document review
was completed based on the data and
documents William concludes that this is
a valid complaint so he completes the
initial assessment tasks indicating that
the complaint is valid
James is notified takes a look at the
case view and sees that the initial
assessment is complete and that the
investigation phase start milestone has
been reached again at this point
depending on the need he could create an
ad-hoc task or add a task from the add
activities list
he could raise a previously defined user
event there is no prescribed flow what
he does depends on his assessment of
what is needed at this point in time
assume he wants to notify the customer
of the status of the complaint he adds
that activity to the list and then
initiates it
some time passes and in response to the
email the customer calls with a
clarification the call is routed to
James the case owner who then logs the
call by raising a user event
as you may expect the audit trail now
reflects this latest event in addition
based on rules that have been configured
for the case a customer feedback survey
is automatically sent out because we
want to collect feedback on the customer
experience this too is noted in the
audit trail now let's assume James
decides no further investigation is
needed but first he wants to give
additional reward points to the customer
because of the error and inconvenience
to do that he creates an ad-hoc task
note that this is not something that had
been anticipated when the case system
was designed James is making this up to
meet an unforeseen need this task is
routed to Charles Dickens who will
perform the task in his task view in
workspace
when that task is done James goes ahead
and marks the investigation completed
milestone as achieved
he doesn't feel there's a need to do
further work on this case and is getting
ready to close it he initiates the
notify customer activity again to let
her know how the complaint is being
resolved
and he closes the case indicating how it
was resolved
let's review some of the benefits you've
seen in the demo case workers can be
more productive because they have a 360
degree view of the case at all times the
only constraints on task order are those
that are absolutely necessary
caseworkers can read update upload and
share data and documents in a wide range
of formats and compliance and
standardization are assured through
reports audit trails and rules so you
can measure and manage knowledge worker
processes the way you've been managing
your more structured business processes
and with Oracle BPM case management
cases are easy to update providing the
agility you need as business needs
evolve that's it for this video I hope
you have a better understanding of what
it's like to participate in a case using
Oracle BPM 11g I'm Rosie pillar thanks
