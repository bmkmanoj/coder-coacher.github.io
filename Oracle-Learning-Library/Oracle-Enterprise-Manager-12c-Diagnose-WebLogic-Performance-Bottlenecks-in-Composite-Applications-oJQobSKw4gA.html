Enterprise Manager cloud control our
composite application allows you to get
a broader view across a multi domain
application possibly made up a solo
components portal components and
application components so now I would
take a look at it's the actual status
region we have 69 different members
different types associated with each of
these we have JVMs
we have WebLogic servers as well so
application and so web components all
have different statuses associated with
them
below that we have the heap usage
percentage a customized region that I
went ahead and created showing both solo
server one and server one and the actual
heat memory associated with it if we
mouse over one of these we can see that
the critical the warning thresholds
associated with their servers as well
looking at other regions with an arc
appositive application we can see the
incident region beneath that that we
showed the different critical and
different policy violations associated
with the different members within our
composite application we also basically
have a service level agreement status
where we can see service levels in this
case we can see basically that we have
some downtime associated with this
particular service that's been breached
above that we have different services
that could be shown in this case and no
services are actually down but we can
see the different server statuses if we
go ahead and show all the services we
can get a state of all the different
services running with a composite
application how long they've been up the
overall health of those services and
above that we have two critical regions
showing different performance metrics
and Diagnostics associated with it the
one on the bottom shows the active
sessions in the pending requests
associate of the server so we can see
for a server one the pending requests
have been getting pretty high we see
them roughly around going above 10 so
we're actually getting a violation
associated with those above that which
they see something even more alarming we
can see that there's database locks
associate with one of our servers so
with that let's go ahead and actually
drill down into that particular problem
and see what's going on with the actual
threads in server one by clicking on
server one we can actually drill down
into the jvm associated with this
particular member now if we go ahead and
look at this we can see a variety of
different states the first
see the CPU utilization the heap
utilization the garbage collection all
look fairly normal for this particular
JVM beneath that we have the red-state
we also have the top request so we can
see one request in particular add item
JSP associated with a shopping current
application is being impacted we can see
the method calls associated with those
we still lock status of sequel let's
being that we're trying to call you can
see the actual state of the database as
well this is a top database from a
standpoint of this particular JVM if we
had multiple JVM so we'd probably have
multiple database listed here we can
also see the state of that database
right above it the table lock contention
in this case which is certainly a red
flag associate of this particular JVM in
addition if we want to see the
relationships associated with this
particular JVM we can easily go ahead
and just click and look at the
navigation tree where we can see the
application deployments so what
components the WebLogic domains and
other different services associated with
this particular JVM in the group of Jai
BMS which represent in this case the
WebLogic domain that this JVM is a part
of so let's go ahead and actually
analyze the thread state if we go to the
top here we can see the thread states
mostly in a database lock which
indicates that we probably need to go
ahead and actually drill deeper into
that we have a couple different options
the best option in this case is probably
to go ahead and drill into the live
threads but we do have the option also
to go ahead and compare time periods if
we want to so let's go ahead and click
on live thread analysis to drill deeper
live thread analysis gives us a live
disability into all the different
relationships associated basically with
the threads within the JVM itself
looking at the threads we can see a lot
are associated with our add item JSP you
also see a variety are also associated
with the soft reserved method call that
we saw on the previous screen now below
that we have a lot of different details
associated with the different threads
were highlighted the first thread at the
moment so we're looking at that
particular one we can see that what's
holding the lock we can see the sequel
that's basically waiting on sequel hash
as well as equal ID and we can also see
the thread state in this case a database
wait by clicking on that we can take
herself directly into the database
session associated with this particular
thread now the database sessions can be
a lot more information about what's
going on in the underlying database in
this case we knew there was threadlock
attention before we knew there was table
lock contention we can see that
represented here in the wait state
associated with this actual sequel
session in addition we have a couple
different pieces of visibility we can
see the user the database user
associated with it we can see basically
the lock command we could go ahead and
execute the sequel again if we wanted to
but we can also see the sequel session
that's actually blocking this one which
is outside the application clicking on
that will bring us into that sequel
session allow us to have visibility into
the root cause in this case another
sequel statement kicked off basically
outside the application by sequel net
from the sequel net client that's going
ahead and blocking this which is likely
a PL sequel statement or some kind of
maintenance routine that's actually
going in and blocking this up we do have
the capability at this point if we
wanted to to actually kill the session
cleaning this up and getting our
application basically back up and
running with that I'd like to go ahead
and wrap up the demo and thank you once
again for watching this overview of
