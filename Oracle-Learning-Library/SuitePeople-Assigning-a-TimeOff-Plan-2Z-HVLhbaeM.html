enables employees managers and HR to
easily request approve track and report
on time off activities through a
centralized system without the need for
manual entry in this video I'll be
giving you an overview of the overall
setup required for the time off
management feature and then I'll go into
detail on how to assign the time off
plan to an employee each of the other
required setup steps are detailed in
their own separate videos I highly
recommend watching them in sequence
starting with the creating time off
types video before we get started you
should be aware of the following
prerequisites for using time off
management you will need to have Suite
people available on your account as well
as how the time off management feature
enabled you'll also need to have the
time off tracking Suite app installed
which enables employees to submit time
off requests from the employee center
and provides an approval workflow that
routes requests to employees managers
for approval you'll also want to make
sure your administrator has given you a
role in that suite that has access to
the time off management feature and
lastly employee records must be created
in that suite
before you begin setting up time loft
management for your company you should
review your company's time off policies
for example you should think about the
differences between employees with
regards to the amount of time off they
are entitled to take how unused time off
is dealt with at the end of the year and
how time off is accrued let's now take a
look at each of the steps involved in
setting up time off management the first
step is to create time off types for the
different categories of time off
employees can take for example you would
create a time off type for vacation and
another for sick leave the second step
is to create the time off plans the
third step is to add time off rules to
the time off plan time off rules reflect
your company's time off policies they
define how to handle time off
eligibility entitlements accruals and
carryover during an employee's tenure
with the company then time off rules
need to be associated with a time off
type next time off plan needs to be
assigned to employees on their employee
record as well as a work calendar work
calendars determine which days are
working days for the employee this is
used to calculate the number of hours to
deduct from an employee's balance when a
time off request is submitted
and lastly a supervisor should be
specified on the employee record this
person will automatically receive any
time off requests and submitted by the
employee
before we assign a time off plan to an
employee we'll want to make sure that
we've already created our time off
Flynn's and to find our time off types
and time off rules when the time off
management feature is enabled in your
account you'll notice a time off sub to
have on employee records it's from this
sub tab that you can assign a time off
plan to your employees and look up their
current time off balances employees
assigned to a time off plan are able to
submit time off requests and look up
their balances from the employee Center
and the next part of this video I will
demonstrate how to assign a time off
plan to your employees which will
include how to assign a work calendar
and a supervisor and at the home page of
my net suite account to assign a time
off plan first navigate to lists
employees employees this will take you
to the employees list page click Edit
beside the employee you want to assign a
time off plan to
from their employee record scroll down
and click the time off sub tab from here
select the time off plan and specify
when to start time off calculations the
date entered here determines which time
off rule currently applies to the
employee based on how long they've been
with the company for details watch the
companion video creating time off rules
next we'll assign a work calendar to
this employee click the Human Resources
sub tab and select the calendar where
calendars enable the system to determine
which days are working days for the
employee which it uses to calculate the
number of hours to deduct from employees
balance when a time off request is
submitted
now enter the name of the employee
supervisor supervisors automatically
receive time off requests submitted by
the employee
and to finish click Save I hope this
video has given you a better
understanding of how to assign a time
off plan to an employee I highly
recommend checking out the other videos
