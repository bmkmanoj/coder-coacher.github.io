deploy management agents using agent
gold images you can use an agent gold
image to provision new management agents
on a large number of hosts there are
four steps to deploying a management
agent using an agent gold image step 1
create an agent Gold image this is the
reference image you want to use to
deploy new management agents step 2
create an agent gold image version this
is a version of the agent Gold image
that you want to use to deploy new
management agents each version can have
a unique configuration and you can use
any version to standardize your
management agents step 3 set the version
to current here you set one of the many
versions to current so that it's used to
deploy new management agents step 4
deploy a management agent using the
current agent gold image this is the
final step where you deploy a new
management agent using the current
version of the agent gold image let's
take a closer look at each step step one
creating an agent gold image to create
an agent gold image navigate to the
manage all images page
you
in the create new images dialog enter a
unique name in a short description for
the agent gold image you are creating
you
select the operating system of the
reference or source management agent
that you want to use
once the agent gold image is created you
can see it listed on the manage all
images page step to creating an agent
gold image version to create a version
of the agent Gold image select the agent
gold image and create a new agent gold
image version
in the create image version dialog enter
unique version name and a short
description and select the management
agent you want to use as a reference to
create the agent gold image version
you
confirm the compatibility of the version
you're creating with a subscribed
management agent
once you confirm enterprise manager
submits a job to create an agent gold
image version to view details about this
job
navigate to the gold agent image
activities page and select the job name
you
step 3 setting the agent gold image
version to current a newly created agent
gold image version is always set to
draft status to use a newly created
version set the status to current do
this by navigating to the gold agent
images page and selecting the draft
version of the agent gold image and set
to current step for deploying a
management agent using an agent gold
image now that we've created the gold
image it's a version and set that
version to current we can use a current
version for mass deployment of
management agents to install a new
management agent using an agent gold
image select the agent gold image you
created navigate to manage image
versions and subscriptions and add a
host the Enterprise Manager takes you to
the host and platform wizard in the
agent software options of the host and
platform wizard the with gold image
option is selected by default and the
image name and the image version are
Auto populated specify the destination
host and the platform on which you want
to install the management agent and
navigate to the installation details
page of the wizard
on the installation details page provide
the agent-based directory where you want
the software binaries security files and
inventory files of the management agent
to be copied
the instance directory is where all the
management agent related configuration
files are stored Oracle recommends that
you maintain the instance directory
inside the agent based directory the
named credential allows you to set up
the SSH connectivity between the OMS and
the remote hosts and for installing a
management agent on each of the remote
hosts use the privilege delegation
settings to validate the settings to be
used to run the route scripts ensure you
do not leave this field blank otherwise
the route scripts won't be run by the
wizard and you'll have to manually run
it you can enter a custom port value or
leave it blank Enterprise Manager
automatically assigns the first
available free port within the range of
1830 to 1849 navigate to the review page
of the wizard and review the details you
provided and deploy the management agent
you can monitor the progress of the
deployment session until the management
agent is installed thank you for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
