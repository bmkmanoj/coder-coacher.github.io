experience cloud if you are an
administrator you have two things you
need to do to get up and running you
need to configure service two faults and
quotas and you need to configure users
including adding users to the domain and
assigning roles once your service is up
and running you can also monitor usage
and you can manage users as they change
their roles or leave your organization
you do these tasks in two different
locations one using my services at cloud
oracle.com
and two from the administration area of
the Oracle content and experience cloud
web interface to do these tasks though
you need to be either a service
administrator or an identity domain
administrator you can do these tasks in
any order but if you add users before
configuring defaults then someone may
use the system before you have it set
correctly instead it's a good idea to
configure defaults first and then add
users to configure service defaults and
quotas you must sign in to the web
interface sign in information is sent to
you in an email when your account
administrator activates the service and
specifies you as a service or identity
domain administrator after signing in
select administration from the user menu
preferences are organized by category
and accessed through the administration
Preferences menu some of the available
options let you set the default storage
space for each user limit the types and
sizes of uploaded files control if and
how public links can be used whether
content can be embedded in other domains
and whether to allow virus scanning and
what to do with files that can't be
scanned in some cases an individual user
may need more or less storage space than
allowed by default under the quota
section you can raise or lower the quota
allowed for each individual also if a
person left the company or is no longer
an Oracle content and experience cloud
user then their name is too
blade in the deep revisions uses section
select the user in the list to
reallocate their storage quota and also
to transfer any content they have left
in the surface to another user or to
delete the content managing users is
done at cloud.oracle.com
you can easily go to the user tab of
your service by clicking manage users on
the admin user preferences page of the
Oracle content and experience with cloud
web interface to manage users you must
be an identity domain administrator to
add a single user and assign a role to
that user click Add on the users tab use
the form to enter the contact
information and select the role or roles
you want the user to have from the list
of available roles note that everyone
who uses the service must have the user
role including the service administrator
if you don't have the user role you will
not be able to log into the web service
and configure defaults and quotas so
make sure you have it to add a group of
users you can import multiple names from
a CSV file but after you do that you
need to assign each user one or more
roles you can also assign roles to users
in a batch also using a CSV file but the
users must be added first that way a
unique user identifier is created which
is then used in the CSV file
after a user has been added use the menu
to the right of the users name to modify
contact information reset passwords
change for all assignments or delete the
user you can monitor your service using
the dashboard at cloud.oracle.com the
dashboard shows you information about
metrics used to monitor the service
clicking a service name opens a page
specific to the service with additional
information thank you for watching for
more information visit cloud.oracle.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
