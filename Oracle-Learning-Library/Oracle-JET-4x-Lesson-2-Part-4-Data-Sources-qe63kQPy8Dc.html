second of the three weekly lessons about
oracle jet so far during this week we
have explored components that deal with
data visualization and with data
collections in this part you're going to
learn different ways in which you can
access data in jet applications and how
to integrate data into jet components to
which you have been introduced
throughout will be using json encoded
data made available via rest services
which is the standard way in which data
is made available in modern applications
what our rest services rest stands for
representational state transfer in the
rest architectural style data and
functionality are considered resources
and are accessed using meaningful
resource identifiers your eyes the
benefit of rests is its simplicity and
the fact that it is a standard for
example you can expose json encoded data
via rest services from all the typical
programming platforms including java ee
spring boot and nodejs
once you have exposed json data via rest
services you need a way for the client
in this case an oracle jet application
to access and integrate the data into
jet components when connecting to rest
interfaces from JavaScript clients you
must be aware of how JavaScript security
is based around what is called
sandboxing by default javascript does
not allow you to interact with
JavaScript resources outside of the
domain that the application is currently
running in the current standard for
allowing JavaScript client applications
to talk to each other across different
domains is called cross-origin resource
sharing or cores for short enabling and
configuring cores is done completely by
the rest endpoint server if you try
connecting to your rest endpoint and you
get an error return saying something
like no access control allow origin
header is present on the requested
resource you will need to request that
the rest servers in able its core
support there is nothing that can be
done
the client to work around this as that
would be a security hole if you could
jQuery is a widely used JavaScript
library that is part of Oracle yet it
includes a range of features to make you
perform common tasks including JSON
document traversal and manipulation
using jQuery to handle tasks relating to
jason is supported in jet by a helpful
utility classes enabling the conversion
of data from one format to another for
example here we see an edge a table as
before it has its data property set to a
property named data source that is
read-only and it has three columns with
fields left as name population and
capital looking on the JavaScript side
of this module we notice immediately the
usage of get JSON here from jQuery if
you're familiar with jQuery and you have
used get JSON be aware that you can
integrate that directly into an Oracle
jet module as you can see here you start
off by defining a KO observable array
that we named data at the end of the
block of code we pass that data into an
LJ array table data source which is an
Oracle jet utility class that converts
that observable array into columns and
rows for display inside the table in the
middle section here we have a plain
normal get JSON call from jQuery calling
out to a rest endpoint where countries
are found and inside of the JSON that is
returned from the rest endpoint we have
a name population and capital that are
pushed into the observable array which
in turn is converted into a table data
source via Oracle jet what we get from
this in our Oracle jet module is a table
with data retrieved from a rest endpoint
there is a small problem with this code
that people frequently make every time a
change is made to the observable the
push in this case an event is generated
and all the elements bound to that
observable or notified of the event this
can get really chatty
if you have a large JSON result
therefore we need to change the code to
use a temp array to push the results
into instead of pushing to the
observable directly the jet common model
is an alternative and more idiomatic
Oracle Jack mechanism for working with
data it is inspired by a similar
mechanism provided by the backbone
library in particular the jet common
model ój model and OJ collection
constructs allow applications to perform
crud operations create read update
delete via rest services in the context
of crud functionality using the jet
common model rather than jQuery is
recommended the jet cookbook provides a
number of comprehensive and complete
sample scenarios for your reference but
the starting point in each case is to
work with a giant model
extent and OJ collection extent which
come from the background syntax in a
separate file which typically you would
refer to as a factory you might have a
folder called factories where you would
have a number of these collection
oriented Java Script files which access
your rest endpoint in a centralized
manner and via the LG mono extend has a
way of referring to entities and by OJ
collection extend a way of referring to
a connection of those entities once you
have set that up you would go to the
module where you need to refer to that
particular rest endpoint and load that
javascript file into your view model it
is here at the fourth reference which
means as always the fourth reference in
the function callback must be that
country Factory and then you refer to
the method that provides the collection
of entities and then use the initialize
method within your view model to load
that collection of entities into the
converter
so this is the Oracle jet utility class
collection table data source and pass
that into the data source which is
referenced in your view final eco fetch
and the fetch is done and the data is
made available to your view this is a
very simple starting point which only
provides the read functionality of your
crud application for more details and
comprehensive step-by-step guides for
setting up crud functionality by means
of the Oracle yet common model please
refer to the cookbook what you will find
in the Oracle jet cookbook section on
the common model is that the sample code
doesn't make use of the factory approach
introduced during this part of the
course the main reason for using the
factory approach for the common model is
that it can be much cleaner and better
in terms of the code structure
especially in large implementations of
Oracle judge in the end for larger
applications the factory approach makes
for easier to maintain code it is
certainly not mandatory but based on
experience of several jet developers in
the field making use of the factory
approach can be very useful especially
when implementing changes in the future
since it makes it easier to navigate
through your code you are not limited to
JSON and rest when working with data in
your Oracle jet applications however
these standards are most widely used and
if you are not using these standards
already you are recommended to explore
these mechanisms however alternative
approaches that work equally well with
jet applications include technologies
such as XML and web sockets for data
transfer protocols in this part of the
second of the three weekly lessons about
Oracle jet you've explored the
mechanisms made available by jet for
working with data and for connecting
data to jet components for your homework
for this part implement the a jet table
from the cookbook into your own jet
application and try using both the
jQuery get JSON call
and the Jets common model approaches try
both of them and see which one works
better for your specific business
requirements as always thank you for
participating in the course on Oracle
jet we hope you're having a good time
and that you're learning a lot and we'll
see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
