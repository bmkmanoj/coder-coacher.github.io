feature in enterprise manager 12 104 up
until now we have had the concept of
user preferred credentials preferred
credentials eliminate a login prompt
from being issued to the user user
preferred credentials have to category
target specific preferred credentials
and target type preferred credentials in
target specific preferred credential
user a as an individual credential for
target one to access target one
preferred credential to to access target
two and preferred credential three to
access target three in targets type
preferred credentials user a will have a
default preferred credential to access
targets of a specific type database type
in this diagram global preferred
credentials have the same concept of a
target specific preferred credential and
a target type preferred credential
except in this case a preferred
credential is set for all users with the
operator and a target privilege to have
the same preferred credential global
preferred credential one for target one
global preferred credential to for
target too and global preferred
credential three four targets or even
target type preferred credential all
users have a default preferred
credentials to access all targets of a
specific type of the default global
preferred credential as preferred
credentials can now be set for all users
and by each user a user may have
multiple preferred credential set in
order to determine which preferred
credential is actually used the system
always checks in the same order level
one the users target specific credential
level to the users target type preferred
credential level three the global target
specific credential and level for the
global target type credential if a
global preferred credential has been set
for a user and is that user then chooses
to set their own user preferred
credential that a user perverted
we'll always override a global preferred
credential for the rest of this
demonstration which we shall refer to
level one as quadrant one level two as
quadrant 2 level 3 of quadrant 3 and
level 4 as quadrant for now let's
proceed to the console for an example to
navigate to the preferred credentials
page select set up security preferred
credentials we're going to select to set
the preferred credentials for the host
target type then select manage preferred
credential on the host preferred
credentials page we can see two tabs my
preferences and global preferences my
preferences relates to the upper two
quadrants in the diagram and global
preferences relates to the lower two
quadrants in the diagram my preferences
tab is highlighted in this instance
because that is the page that I last
visited on the mic reference page we can
see the settings for the target
preferred credentials and the default
preferred credential target preferred
credentials relates to quadrant one in
my diagram default preferred credentials
relates to quadrant two in my diagram
before we leave the my preferences page
I want to highlight that no preferred
credential is set for the first post
target on our list so let's navigate the
global preferred credentials page and
set up a global preferred credential for
this target on this page we also have
default preferred credential settings
just the settings for quadrant 4 and
target preferred credentials which are
the settings for quadrant 3 let's set a
target specific global preferred
credential for all users select our
target and hit set were prompted with
the named credential box I'm going to
select new i'm going to pick a name pick
a valid username on that box and save
that named credential and it shows us
the target user name the credential name
and the credential owner let's go out to
the my preferences page to see what that
looks like
we can see under the effective value
call Youm which indicates which
credential is being used by the system
that the global target preferred
credential has been set and it's been
inherited from the target level global
scope which indicates that this
credential has been set for all users
for that specific target which were
forced quadrant three of our diagram as
I mentioned a user's preferred
credential always overrides a global
preferred credential so let's set this
user's preferred credential for this
target we're prompted with the named
credential box let's select an existing
credential in this case my preferred
credential select save and save again we
can see that my configured value is now
set but we can also see that the
effective value has changed to my
configured value and that the inherited
from information has changed also to
indicate that it's now been inherited
from target level we can enhance the
menu items further by selecting
credential hierarchy the credential
hierarchy displays four levels in the
preferred credential hierarchy the green
arrow indicates which credential is
configured currently and the green are
within the circle indicates which is the
configured effective value or the one
being used by the system for
completeness let's login is the new user
of the system and view their preferred
credential settings we have logged in as
a newly created user let's navigate to
their entitlement page to see what
privileges they've been granted to the
entitlement summary and we can see
they've been granted the operator and a
target which allows this user to use the
global preferences set by the privileged
administrator now let's navigate to the
preferred credentials page to set up
security preferred credentials select
host-type and managed preferred
credential going down to the appropriate
target we can see that the effective
value has been set by the privileged
administrator this allows this user to
default those credentials this concludes
