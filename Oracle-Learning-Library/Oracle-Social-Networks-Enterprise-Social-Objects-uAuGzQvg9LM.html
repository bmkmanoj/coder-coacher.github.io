business application such as Oracle
sales cloud can be mapped to Oracle
social network with enterprise social
objects for example opportunities and
sales accounts with my CRM system are
mapped to Oracle social network as
opportunities and accounts I can open a
detailed view of an opportunity to view
record data any changes made will be
posted to the wall in addition I can
hold as well as preserve a conversation
about it adding messages documents and
references to other Oracle social
network objects directly to the objects
wall in addition to accessing record
data social objects provide the ability
to share the opportunity in Oracle
social network when I click the social
icon I will see one of three things if
the opportunity has already been shared
in Oracle social network I will see the
conversations wall if the opportunity
has not yet been shared I will see a
share button which creates a
corresponding wall in Oracle social
network I can add a set of members that
defines access to the collaboration
around the record as well as create new
related conversations
if the opportunity has been shared and I
have not been added as a member i will
see a joint button i can then opt in to
become a member of the opportunity wall
