principal curriculum developer here at
Oracle in this demonstration I'll give
you an overview of monitoring solar
infrastructure components using
Enterprise Manager grid control you can
monitor these components and Enterprise
Manager grid control when you purchase
the solar management pack enterprise
edition this is the Enterprise Manager
grid control home page which shows a
summary of the availability and alerts
on all of the targets that I'm entitled
to view here you see a pie chart showing
the status of the monitored targets and
here we see that one of the targets is
down we can also see alerts on all
targets as well as policy violations and
security policy violations if you click
on any of these numbers you get more
information let's look at critical
alerts this brings us to the alerts page
where you can see all the critical
alerts for all targets if we go to
targets then Middle where we see a
collapsible expandable and searchable
view of all the middleware in my
environment this view shows the
availability status of the middleware
targets and columns with customizable
summary metrics this gives you a single
entry point into large-scale multidomain
management and allows you to search
filter and navigate into weblogic solar
and Oracle Service bus domains across
your enterprise let's look at the solar
infrastructure target on this solar
infra homepage you can get a quick
overview of the health status and
performance of the sower
main here you see a summary of the whole
soul infra summary metrics for the
service engines and summaries for the
deployed so accomplices you also see a
graph of the throughput for both
messages and errors you can hover your
mouse over the line in the graph to see
values for individual data points on
this false and rejected messages page we
see summary metrics for the faults on
each composite during the time frame
covered by the last metric connection
and if there are any faults there's none
in this case but you'll see details on
individual faults on this lower area
let's return to the soul infra homepage
and will click this mediator link the
mediator engine home page shows general
metrics for the service engine as well
as metrics on each of the mediator
components and these are across all the
solar concerts there are analogous pages
for all servers engines in the solar
sweet now let's look more it's so infra
and we'll expand the solar fusion
ordered demo and look at this so a
composite the order booking composite
this page shows summary metrics for the
composite you see metrics for all the
services and references defined in the
composite and for all the components
within the concert if we click on a
number in the table let's look at the
average response time for the storefront
service this brings up a mini graph with
the recent values for that metric
and this graph summarizes the throughput
on the composite and again hovering your
mouse over the graph line shows you
individual values so we can see things
like what time the spike occurred so
that's it for monitoring solar
infrastructure components using
Enterprise Manager grid control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
