and target already defined I'm going to
add a mapping between the two
when I open the mapper you can see I
have the source data structure on the
left and the target data structure on
the right
I'll start by mapping the name field in
the source to the organization name
field in the target by dragging the name
field on to the organization name field
the green line joining the fields
indicates that they're mapped
because my data structure is fairly
large I'm going to perform a search to
find the employees total field in the
target
from the source I'll drag the number of
employees filled and drop it on the
employees total field in the target now
i'll search for the currency name field
in the source and map it to currency
code in the target
when accounts are created an oracle
salescloud
i want to indicate that the account was
created by this integration so i'll open
the mapping builder by clicking the
created by module field and I'll enter
the identifier that was associated with
this integration when it was created
finally I'll save and close the mapping
builder and then save and exit the
mapper now my map is complete and the
mapper icon is green
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
