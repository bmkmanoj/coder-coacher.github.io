for oracle server technologies this is
the second demonstration of seven demos
about in memory Colin store in new
feature introduced in oracle database 12
10 to this one illustrates how in memory
priority can be certain objects to
define when current data population
should take place in the IM colin store
there are different in memory priority
levels non value means an on-demand
population when the data is queried only
this is the default when no priority is
defined on an object are the values are
low medium high and critical if one of
these levels is specified in memory
objects are populated in priority order
at instant startup the population tasks
are acute to smc or background processes
for execution and thus may have to wait
for available work processes the skewing
is initiated on the next imco cycle thus
the population really starts at the next
imco cycle rather than after instant
started the imco background process
queues population tasks for objects with
priority other than none only the queue
is drained in priority order from
critical to low let's connect under the
SSB user and set the data population
priority in the IM colin store for the
line order table so that the table gets
populated in the IM current store on the
next imco cycle right after the instant
starts up different in-memory priorities
can also be set a
partition of a partition table we create
a partitioned table with two partitions
the first one with no priority and the
second one with a high priority insert
data in both partitions and verify the
priority level set in the data
dictionary we now create a non
partitioned table test with no priority
insert data and verify the priority
level set in the data dictionary restart
the instance right after the instance
start up there are no segments populated
in the IM colin store we have to wait
until imco background process wakes up i
am CEO woke up and started to populate
the segments with a high priority the p2
partition of the tab part table is
already completely populated into the IM
colin store because there is only one
value for each of the two collins to
populate whereas the line order table is
not it has 17 collins and nearly 700
megabytes to populate IM 0 asked six
workers to populate the line order table
each time you reselect the vedala i am
segments the number of bytes populated
in IM current store increases as long as
there is a nonzero value in bytes not
populated column the segment is not
fully populated in the IM colin store
now the segment is fully populated in
the IM colin store but the test table is
still not populated because it has no
priority set
we have to select the data to force the
population whereas you can specify
different in-memory compression levels
for different subsets of columns in a
table this is not possible to set
different in-memory priority levels for
different subsets of columns in a table
you can set default in memory attributes
on table spaces storing in memory
segments the main difference is that you
will have to specify default before the
in-memory columnstore clause note that
the default only applies to newly
created tables and does not apply to
existing tables let's take an example
the example tablespace has no in-memory
attributes by default two tables are
stored in this table space with specific
priority attributes we modify the
example tablespace with a new default in
memory priority attribute we verify that
the existing tables kept their original
priority levels we create a new table
with no in memory priority specific
attribute and you can check that a new
table is assigned the default in memory
priority attribute of the example
tablespace this is the end of the
demonstration and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
