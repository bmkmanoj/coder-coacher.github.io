about two particular sets of attributes
or fields in other words in the oracle
enterprise data quality customer data
services pack and those two sets of
attributes or fields are the UI DS and
the e IDs so what are they and how they
used well firstly they're both used in
ed queues matching services both for
individuals and for entities you I d
stands for unique identifier so you can
use the UID fields to ensure that if a
particular piece of data in two records
is the same those two records will
always match regardless of any other
data so clearly in your uid or unique
identifier field you must have data
which is really trustworthy we're
talking about data like social security
numbers perhaps passport numbers text
numbers if it's fur entities and so on
so if you've got a piece of data that
you're very sure of the quality of it
you're very sure that it's going to be
correct data you can use it as a UID and
you're saying if this piece of data
matches it doesn't matter about anything
else in the record the two records are a
match now the Eid the Elimination ID is
if you like the complete opposite of
that what we're saying with the Eid is
if two records do not share the same eid
the same elimination ID they cannot be a
match so in other words for example if
we had different social security numbers
in the Eid in two records they cannot
possibly match regardless of whatever
else is in those two records so you need
to be really careful what you use for
your you IDs and II IDs passport number
would be a good unique identifier but
not a good elimination identify why not
because the same person can have two
different passports if they have dual
nationality for example so not a good
elimination identifier but
really good unique ID a really good you
ID okay now you can have up to three you
IDs and up to three eid s and the nice
thing is that all of the configuration
around the you IDs and the Eid s is done
for you already in the customer data
services pack there already match all
set up for the you IDs and the IDS all
you have to do is to arrange for data to
go into those attributes to go into
those fields and then the naturals will
kick in if the you IDs and the ids are
empty then the match rules pertaining to
them I just ignored nine used okay so if
you want to use the you IDs and the IDS
just put data into the fields and
they'll be used I'll demonstrate how
they work in just a moment let's look at
how the you IDs and II IDs are used then
I'm in the director user interface and
I've got a copy of the match individuals
process here from CD s the original is
running in a job so that's why I've got
a copy because you can't open a running
process so let's have a look at the
match individuals processor and we'll go
directly to the match subprocessor and
we'll go to the match rules tab so here
are the natural groups at the top and
you can see the second group down is for
you ID matches so remember these these
these groups and rules within them fire
in order ok so right near the top of our
list of Naturals we've got the UID
matches the only group above it is to
eliminate records which are both
candidates both basically so that's
going you one above it now let's just
have a quick look then so remember we've
got the three uid attributes uid one two
and three use for things like social
security numbers passport numbers as we
said and let's just take take a look at
the match rule for one of them uid one
and if we just go down the comparisons
on the right you can see that we've got
a word match countless what WM c stands
for a word matching our comparison at
least one word must be the same within
the UID so you know within a UID
potentially we could have let's say two
or three different pieces of data one of
them has to
so if one of those pieces of data is the
social security number one of the social
security numbers must match within this
particular uid okay for the Eid s the
elimination rules here again we've got
the three eid s there the three fields
for Eid and if we just take a look down
there we've got again it's word match
count rule comparison used here and none
is set so in other words if none of the
words if you like within an elimination
ID match then the decision is these
records cannot match so effectively that
means that if we have elimination IDs
which are social security numbers if the
social security numbers in two records
do not match those records do not match
regardless of anything else and for the
uid it's exactly the other way around if
we're using let's say passport numbers
for the you IDs if two records have the
same passport number then they are a
match regardless of any other data in
them so let's take a quick look that in
action I've got the real time processes
are running including real-time
individual match so I'll demonstrate
using the web service tester first of
all let's go to the web service tester
and in the web service test drive called
the individual match service within CD s
and I put in some data on the left so
let's have a look at the two records so
candidate 0 the driving record there
I've got a UID of two three four dash
435 dash 3 4 5 45 so that's in the
format of an American social security
number going further down in the first
record then first name p last name
Webster okay and further down in the
address details I've got an address of
103 edward street city luton and a
postal code of lu 75 HQ okay an odd mix
of data cuz i've got an american social
security number and a bridge address but
it doesn't matter just to illustrate a
point in the second record
and the right one so the candidate
record that I'm trying to match too I've
got the same unique identify the same
social security number as in the first
record two three four dash 4 35 3 4 5 45
okay further down though I've got
somewhat different details rather than
first name p I've got first name Peter
the last name field is not complete
there's nothing in that is empty and
I've got a different address instead of
Dunstable street I've got 72 chandon
sorry Edward Street I've got 72 Shandor
owed instead of City luton I've got
Birmingham as the city and further down
I've got no postal code this time so you
know this is an incomplete record this
person is moved to a different address
but we have the same unique ID the same
social security number in both of our
records so let's its end and let's take
a look at what CD s does with that so
we're going to see the output here on
the right let's its end and see what
happens and you can see we've got a very
strong match match score 100 so the
match schools are between 0 and 100 100
is high so that's the highest score you
can get and the rule name there look
match uid one so that's a really good
demonstration of how the uid works
despite other data in these two records
being different or incomplete this
person has moved address we haven't got
the last name one of the records because
the you IDs Social Security numbers in
this case are the same then they are a
match ok now I could do a demo for you I
won't because I don't want to take too
long but I could do a demo showing you
that I could put exactly the same data
in both records but with different
elimination IDs as long as I didn't fill
in the you IDs and those different
lumination IDs would mean that the two
records would not ever match ok so
remember you need really good data in
the UI DS and the
the IDS so there's a little demo of how
they work i'm going to show you them
working in siebel you see em in a moment
but before I do that let me just stress
I've demonstrated with individual
matching here but equally you have you
IDs and the ID for entity matching as
well so you could have a company's v80
or tax number as a UID for example or
perhaps registration number or something
like that so in a minute i'll show you
how these work in siebel you see em
hooked up to CBS here we are in siebel
you see em then now we said that all the
configuration in CDs for the you IDs and
the e IDs it's all done all you have to
do is push some data into those fields
or one of those fields if you only want
to use one of them so let's have an
example of how we push that data in in
siebel i'm not a siebel expert but i'll
show you how I've done it in this
instance of UCM so if we go to the site
map and then we go to administration
data quality and then we go to third
party administration and bc well let's
just start the third party
administration actually and here we've
got the settings for ed Q so this
instance of Siebel is already integrated
with ed Q using CD s that's done alright
that's a given we go down a little bit
you can see the various effectively
these rcds services so account data
cleansing account deduplication that's
in CD s speak that's entity matching
that's calling and the one that we are
going to demonstrate with is contact the
duplication which is individual matching
in CD s speak okay so let's go to the
bottom and let's have a look at the
field mappings now so this is for the
individual matching or contact the
duplication and sleeper calls it and on
the left in these field mappings we have
the business component field that's the
siebel name of a field or attribute if
you like on the right we have the mapped
field
that's the field or attribute in this in
the CD s service ok so the siebel field
birthdate is mapped to the CD s
attribute in the service do be ok and so
on the siebel field cellular phone is
mapped to the field in the CD s service
called mobile phone and so on if I just
go down this list of mappings you can
see a little bit further down there we
go there we've got the social security
number so the social security number in
siebel is mapped to uid one in CD s and
to achieve that all I simply had to do
is type in uid one in the mapping there
on the right that was it ok and then
save the record so that's mapped the
social security number to the first you
ID field and that means that data we
push through to that uid natural first
you ID match rule and that match or
should work and become active ok I'll
show you an example of that than in
action we're not going to see a great
deal but I show you anyway let's go to
contacts and let's go to the contact
list and just note we've got a contact
here called frederick blogs ok if we go
down a little bit look at these details
his address is 502 LOL dorado bulova
boulevard brimfield etc colorado USA but
crucially we've got a social security
number or SSN set for him it's the same
one actually but I demonstrated within
the web service s earlier two three four
dash 4 35 3 4 5 45 ok so Frederick Bronx
has that social security number now that
record exists let's create a new record
and our new record is going to be for
someone called blocks the LX o BL 0 X so
this could be perhaps the right spelling
and perhaps blogs was the result of a
data entry clock miss hearing or
misinterpreting our
the name was spelled and first they will
put in F ok now we'll say that this
person works for Oracle again and sorry
let's just do that properly this time
there we go so they work for Oracle we
won't put any any address details for
them the only other piece of information
we'll put in at the bottom here is the
SSN the social security number let's
paste it in same one two three four dash
435 dash three four five four five ok so
we've got a record that's pretty
different f blocks as opposed to Fredrik
blocks different address or no address
in this case and then address in the in
the Frederick blogs record but the same
social security number which we know is
mapped to the first you ID field so
let's go up and let's in the menu let's
save this record and what we should find
and we're seeing it here is see blurs
gone off it's called the ed Q web
service which has run this record
together with the drive the candidate
record through the CD s matching rules
and because the social security number
of the UID is the same it's come back
with a match for frederick blocks and
it's saying do you want to use that
record in step because the SSN is the
same now actually won't tell you the
reason it won't tell you because the SSN
is the same it doesn't tell you the
natural so you have to take that on
trust but that is what's happening it's
the fact that we've set the UID which is
causing siebel to our all CD s really to
identify this possible match and it's
giving us the operative if you like the
chance to actually use the existing
record rather than create a duplicate
I should stress by the way there are
other ways that edq can find matches
when the data is not exactly the same it
can do fuzzy matching without using the
you IDs but the UID is ensuring that two
records if they have the same you ID
will always be a very very very strong
match so you always get a match where
that is the case so that's how the UID
is used and go off and explore that and
explore the Eid as well they can be very
useful fields you just have to supply
the data or the configuration is done
for you already
