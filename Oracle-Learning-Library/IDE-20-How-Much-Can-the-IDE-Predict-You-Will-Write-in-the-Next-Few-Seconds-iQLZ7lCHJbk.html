Toledo how much can you predict of what
you're writing next few seconds I'm
sorry for the voice I'm character codes
so it's a little bit about anyway I hope
you get the most of the stuff here first
a few words about me so I'm through the
deed of the Eclipse Cobra Commander's
project and I'm a researcher opposed to
get down to the University of Technology
and also eclipse for trainer and a CEO
of coach ray is a company that offers
some commercial services behind Cobra
Commander's but before it's planning on
Cobra Commander's actually is how many
of you know what Kovac Menace is about
who knows Kovac vendors okay so this
will be exciting little bit of history
the project started itself in 2006 under
the name framework understanding to a
fruit for short so have you published
that stuff 2009 as Eclipse Cobra
Commander's on the Eclipse marketplace
and became an eclipse project in 2011
and in that year we made it to to the
first one that o release so we graduated
in 2012 and now have our own research
incubator so the whole project and all
project ideas we are evaluating it's all
research brought to to eclipse and into
your ID making your ID much smarter than
this today since jun liu for the two we
are part of the java and the RCP
developer package so everything or most
of the things you see here is ready to
use but then all part of that so there
are a few things you see some incubator
egg of eclipse somewhere on the slides
it's a project we are currently working
on for 2013 so for eclipse for the three
Kepler and well yes we received the
Eclipse community award which is the
most exciting about in the past we have
as the most innovative the tips project
in 2012 and now let's introduce you to
the idea of Cobra Commander's by an
example I guess you all are familiar
with which is Amazon who of you have not
bought a book and Amazon before one it's
amazing as always one person room that
never bought a book and Amazon that's
funny okay well for those that already
bought a book they should be familiar
with the process so what you do if
you're looking for a book you enter some
keywords
amazon comes up with a list of books
that might fit your in your search terms
and my pre relevant for ya for what
you're looking for and what I like about
Amazon is that and there are also
reviewers of customers that route
reviews and give ratings of the book so
if you read through the rate through the
reviews you get a pretty good feeling if
this book is actually what you're
looking for or not and so it's it's like
having the bookseller behind you
whistling a new year and telling you in
answering your questions so it's pretty
much very efficient and helpful so when
I start programming in eclipse on job or
I basically ran for the same process so
i entered java eclipse and finally came
up with the book with the best ratings
and it helped me quite a lot that you
know at some point of your development
history you get into areas where which
are not covered by books anymore so if
you if your package name start with la
la la internal whatever you know you're
simply lost at least in eclipse work
because there is no documentation there
are no books that describe how to use
that stuff and you you have no idea but
there are people using these api's who
actually wrote these api's and they are
used somewhere wouldn't it be cool so
then you say if you lean back and say
wow wouldn't it be cool to have
something like Amazon but just for code
so it to like like this one here saying
it clips Cobra Commander's saying okay
this is your code you've written and I
can tell you that you probably want to
invoke the cell layer method on the
textured here because every other
developer did like this before in
similar situations right or you want to
call at text because well many people do
so or if you extend the preference page
you want to override the preference page
create contents method because this is
the way how the framework API designer
intended you to work off the framework
so which methods to cooperative efforts
are all right and all that stuff and
that's the idea of Cobra Commander's so
if you only take away one frame from one
one thing from the presentation its
Cobra Commander's is basically amazon
but just for code well let me show you
this in a small example code completion
when you that's the same example from
before so when you trigger code
completion here on on this text widget
here
what is your IDE or what should your ID
propose to you now any ideas what would
you as a developer whose whose family of
the sfg framework api okay just a few
whose swing programmer in here who's
already Java programmer okay well that's
it will change it in your future I guess
okay so what you let me put it
differently what is the ID proposing to
you now what you get is this and these
are oh well 104 say 164 methods of text
so they're all kind of methods in there
like Trevor's to control set data way to
notify all that stuff right and but
actually in your current situation you
don't need that you just need to know
how to configure that object you created
it and now you have to configure it
somehow that it fits your needs and your
IDE in your UI and well this swing
developers might say well it's the SWT
is ill-defined API so this is for you
this is jay button and you see this is
really a problem that that's coming too
many AP is so it's not in particular one
API but many different AP is and if you
look in customer api's their classes
they look pretty much the same here okay
but let's go back to the example so what
do you want your idea to propose to you
now so if you don't want to see all that
stuff what you would like to see is this
and are either tells you okay come on
developer you want to call the cell
layer data method we will like yuh tuff
ninety-three percent because as I said
every developer did like this before or
you want to call set text or you might
add a modifier listen to respond to some
user events and that's it you want to
get rid of all these 160 other methods
who don't need them you just want to
know what's to call on this mesh of mail
on this object here and I would like to
show you how this works and in practice
so that's the same situation as before
and if you took a code completion you
really get all that stuff here is 164
methods so it's really huge huge number
of proposals if you trigger code
completion twice you get a proposal
you've seen so far before so let's just
use that say okay you want to call say
layered item effort you enter a star
THX widget no subtext and to some text
here you trigger that stuff and now you
add modify this near here and let's do
all that stuff here and what you see if
it's working instantly so what it does
in a background whenever you would
trigger code completion it performs an
on-the-fly NL analysis of your ast and
checks which method you have already
invoked on the text widget and its
updates its gory commendations based on
based on what's already in your code and
you see it doesn't take longer than than
eight to ten milliseconds it's pretty
fast so it's not slowing you down well
so let's go to another scenario here we
are now in it in SW team modified text
method so this is a framework callback
method that's called by the framework
whenever a user enter some text in here
when you trigger code completion
standard code completion you get again
all these 164 methods in here but it's
pretty sure that you Priam obvious that
you don't need all of them here right
because the only thing you want to do in
this context is calling get text and you
see the contribution is aware of your
current context don't you wish methods
you invoke but where'd you invoke and
trigger code completion and it learns
that by by analyzing source code of
other people I would get to this in a
few seconds well we made a few
experiments with students and ask them
to try the tools and give some some
feedback and they say well this is
pretty cool tooling but what they liked
very much are these code snippets code
templates so you know that from from the
Eclipse world if you trigger a code
completion on on say a type name like
like button it Clips has some predefined
templates for you how to use in SWT
button and it defines you three or four
important lines and you can go through
that stuff can enter some text and all
that stuff you and they said well this
was actually pretty much helpful for for
us because we saw the whole picture how
to use the API not only just a single
recommendations but a bunch of them the
only problem with this code snippet is
that
they are handcrafted so there's some
developers there was some developer in
the past who wrote these snippets and to
make this explicitly available to you in
your IDE and if you for instance try to
trigger code completion on a table
viewer which comes from another
framework like jphayes swt basically
says oh I'm sorry so there are no
templates i can recommend to you because
no one has spent some time on defining
them for you but if we can recommend you
single methods you want to invoke on a
text widget how far are we then away
from recommending you just not one
method but a set of methods so something
like this saying okay you want to use
the table viewer then you probably want
to call the constructor you want to call
at selection listener set content
providers it in put a label provider all
that stuff and it's in that this just by
clicking enter and that's well it's it's
driven by basically the same tools as
you've seen before we just analyze how
people use the API we identify these
snippets and put this in our in our code
completion and this works generally for
for every API we have some example data
for so imagine in your company when you
have say a few million lines of code and
you want you to developers that are new
to your team want to learn how to use
these ap is you just have to run the
tools on your code base and you can
expect these patterns integrate this
into your IDE and help you newcomers and
your team to get effective more more
fast or quickly so what I would like to
show you is these templates are also
context-aware say you want to use that
table viewer stuff again and remove some
lines and you took a code completion now
it updates again its recommendations
nonsense well you've already called the
constructor net selection listener I can
tell you that you want to call the set
content set input on Labor provider with
a likely of forty percent so again it
checks what you've invoked on the
template on the variable so far and it
also updates its template completions so
it's truly dynamic and context-sensitive
okay so so if you have any questions
feel free to ask them in between because
I like a little more interactive how
does it work it's a first Gretchen well
how do we get from from this example
code to some models what we do is we
have your example codon in your
workspace your idea where you have your
main repository and we essentially
create a huge table with all the data in
their stored how you use this very and
perils of type text for instance and for
instance we extract information we are
you currently are so you are in create
contents and you created a text widget
you called set text and you put ones in
our in our table and your own remaining
positions are filled of zeros if we run
another method like the former k we say
okay you aren't performer k and you call
the get text method and that's it and
that's what we do with all your examples
with the whole huge coach base or
eclipse june release trained and well
how do we get now from this model of
this data to recommendations let's
assume this is no real code so you're on
the create contents method and you have
created a text widget and you're
tricking now code completion on aunty so
you see this incomplete vector you're
saying okay you are here you call the
constructor and now you ask the system
okay what should I do here should i call
the text set phone or get texts tell me
and what we do is we compare this to our
database and say okay let's look how
others in a similar situation did like
this before you see okay there are three
examples in our database which we call
the best matching neighbors and two of
them called set text one of them called
the set for method but no one called the
get text method and in the bottom line
you get the recommendation say okay
sixty-six percent and one third of the
people did so and that's what we feed
through to the code completion which
come calculates the person the
percentage value in the back so in
reality it's not a huge data table we
have in there they're based in network
so we do some post processing on the on
the data to make it fast but that's the
basic concept behind all these
completion engines
yeah another example that's an incubator
project I want to make you aware of this
edge here which is in cooperation with
Shanghai University so Cobra cornices
international Shanghai Beijing
universities from Canada in queens and
then Germany working on this project
style boots who uses familiar of the SWT
class ok not that many but I think you
know about style boots so let's assume
you at the stacks with it again and your
edit a net listener a call to to that
code and the apps listener method takes
an integer value and some of the snare
in behind when I your IDE gives you is
basically well it has no idea which
where you to fill in right so it just
tells you ok the variable name is event
type to give you an idea or a sense of
what you should enter their and our
default value of zero and well that's
what it leaves the rest of lives to you
to figure out what to put in there in SF
UT there's one central class that
defines almost all style constants you
can use and if you know that you would
enter as the booty trigger code
completion and what you get in there is
this so these are let me count no I
already counted five for 154 m style
constant plus minus way I might make a
mistake there's so many different things
you can insert in there and you have to
know which style constant to take from
where it's up to you as a framework user
to figure that out and that's pretty
much time consuming and annoying if
something's not wrong i'm working as you
want it to work well so what can you do
it's as simple as learning which methods
to call you just have to look how people
used what what they filled in in in
their code completion and learn with
side constant they have put in there so
for instance you could learn that if you
call that method most people call the
swt modify or use the modify parameter
so I concerned and maybe of one of these
just simply by looking on on the source
code how people you did it before and
just to show you this and in a demo so
again this is a future coming for for
Kepler
so next year's eclipse juno release
there will be preliminary versions
available so starting from I guess the
end of this year but so this is really
really bleeding edge here okay so if you
have that addlistener effort you trigger
code completion that's what you get
right even type and zero that's it if
you took a code completion twice well as
I said you get the recommendation system
that tells you want to call the add
modify modify flag here or use that and
well in certain all here and that's how
it works for for a text widget now let's
look at that stuff on a tool items so
these little small buttons in in Europe
in your screen and so it's completely
different again you get the same
recommendations by via clips but here
since it is basically a button there is
system learns that modify doesn't make
any sense because you typically don't
modify that you just respond to
selection events or maybe two men UD
text and to dispose events and that's it
yeah so just take that stuff in here and
learns again from examples so let me
take this one step further if you
trigger code completion on a method call
like said enabled and it takes a boolean
value okay Jesu okay it's enabling it
might be true or false so slightly
better than before but really not
helpful but let's imagine that you have
learned so there's a browser in there
you see that on top and someone has
before it combined these two objects a
tool item and a browser with each other
what you can do that is you can write
the code completion that basically well
tells you that it has seen people before
tying the values of browser get back is
back enabled with this tool bar tool
item and other things before and you can
take this further to standard api's
typically give some objects you have to
fill in passing there and over there and
whatever so this is something option
graph you can learn that so there is a
pattern how to use the API and you can
simply put this into your code
completion it is that simple okay so so
far for parameter completion I could
have named this talk code completion on
steroids so what you will see is a lot
of more cocoa
engines but they also a few other things
I will show you the next minutes our
annotations who is they ee addicted or
use of je okay so many in here this
annotation style programming that's
that's so its overall in in java
enterprise and it's a pretty much a
helpful thing but again it changes the
way how you how you have to program what
you have to know about an api you have
to know which annotations are there
we're to use them in which situations
you have to know what i should use and
all that stuff so it's really again up
to you and to learn how to use that and
as it's not using inheritance anymore
it's a completely different thing so
with inheritance you had these abstract
methods and all that stuff that showed
you the compiler help you to figure out
what to do next this is gone you just
have to run that stuff and execute and
how it works and if it doesn't work you
have to define your yourself on how to
fix that and just to give you an idea in
Eclipse oh I'll just show you that so
let's let's assume I'm coming for
eclipse eclipse world so I make all
these examples and eclipse in eclipse ii
for you have the ability to define all
your stuff that you have in your codes
in a so called it gives application
euphoric semi so you can define handlers
menus all that stuff by just registering
here and saying okay this is a class
name and all that stuff if you look in
the code and if you try to execute that
stuff and so that's that's the pure
implementation that you have to to write
well nothing would happen the problem
here is that you have to annotate in
this case the method with some
annotation to make the framework aware
that there's some some call back it
should call so there's no extent there's
no implement it's simply gone like in
j2ee enterprise stuff so what you can do
now is well you can trigger quick fix
saying you okay I have seen people that
define somewhere in your configuration
file and handler or this class as being
a handler and I can tell you that you
must have one method with an execute
annotation in there with the likelihood
of yes eighty-eight percent are pretty
sure that
this method should do it or for instance
for parameters it might have learned
that typically you name the shell
variable by something and it might have
also learned it use an optional
annotation in here so we're going to to
Jews and dependency injection now but
these are all information you can learn
also the parameter complete parameters
of annotations the same thing in here
which parameters do you typically use in
annotations things you can just learn by
looking unknown source could how others
use the API it's it's amazing okay two
completely different topic who is using
camelcase completion come on who's not
using camera are you programming at all
I don't know okay well so Kevin case
conclusion is pretty nice I i agree but
it's well I think it's like it's
recorded right it's not that nice so we
can do better and yeah so you need you
know that so we have learned we should
use speaking and speaking names and all
that stuff and we came up with pretty
long names and tracking them as is
sometimes really really a mess what you
what you have to do is now okay you want
to have this new annotation type member
Declaration and the camel case what you
can do is enter say new ATM the trigger
code completion and it completes
automatic automatically to what your
ventured there and for me it's a real
her life I have to understand I have to
remember all these upper case letters
stuff in a mixed things up it is simply
doesn't work and it's it's not not nice
but what I can remember it has something
to do with member declaration or tying
them I don't know I say oh ok or
annotation meant whatever and it
everything completes to the right term
you see it's completely different what
what the camera case matching is
supposed to do and if I only know it has
something to do with type well I enter
type and maybe Declan and it filters all
that stuff that you need just to make
sure that you get it this is a simple
that that's not an intelligent code
completion it's just a code completion
that's relaxing how
how ID completion is supposed to work
okay so this works for every API no
learning involved and who likes that ha
there's more than camel case measures
via that that's excellent okay so as I
said that's a simple pretty simple one I
found especially for this torque pretty
exciting new completion engines so we
are the swing programmers again what
does this term complete to if you assume
something similar like sub routes what
is the end result of all these seven
lines in here tick tock tick tock tick
right it's swinging invoke you till
later and if you trigger that code
completion let me show you the demo here
if you trigger it there well it makes
swing utilities and woke later new
runnable and even if you hit didn't get
that it's working just yeah try this
ekla a invoke later there are no 2 a's
in there so what this code completion
does is basically it learned what you
might have set or wanted to say and it
totally ignores what you have written
isn't that amazing I mean okay I find
this pretty amazing that well so what's
working behind the scenes is the our
markov change that even right from learn
from your spelling mistakes and try what
you might have guessed it's it's a
research project from another university
it's currently not implemented but if
you say afterwards you would like to
have that um cannot chat with me i think
so suppose was a weekend programming
code protocol that weekly exercise and
maybe we'll do the same for four with
that stuff I think it's pretty funny and
it would be interesting to see how this
works anyway let's get to do something
completely different no not completely
different culture and completion how
many ID users IntelliJ users are in here
okay so you guys already know that so
it's has been a while and in IntelliJ so
support is coming now to IntelliJ
so we're changing features in here but
yeah so this is well if you won't have
an instance of an I status line manager
the problem here is it's not just the
one method call which returns you and I
status line manager it's something that
goes over four different objects so the
problem now is you have to figure out
how to obtain that instance and it will
take you if you're not family live
update API it will take you 30 30
minutes to figure out what you need to
know is that you want to call the get
viewsite get action bars gets down with
lineman a tool to get that stuff here
and that's well I think it steps on that
grade because you typically want your ID
to do all that work for you and let's go
to to this example here say you trigger
code completion hear what you want to do
is well yeah let let it search for you
instantly so just by traversing the API
graph checking all paths available so
it's really making a brute-force search
for for every path available in here and
it just gives you the slipper that you
you're looking for and this also works
for completely different things like
help system or whatever yeah and it
works for for java standard library so
if you trigger that for an URL so what
you would like to see is a snippet that
brings you from a file to an URL to all
drama standard library pros is this a
right or a good solution calling file to
URL who says no I say no okay get me
more why is it so well let's see if you
enter that what I clips tells you oh wow
that's that's deprecated you see that
deadline in there it says oh that's not
the right way what you want to do so
always finding the shortest path is not
necessarily always the best solution and
well but again couldn't you learn how
others use the API and improve also
these chain completion stuff so let's
get back to an example here you're not
supposed to read that stuff but you see
that there are some variable and
completion or chain completions trigger
on that and you see that the fourth one
is selected and the other ones are not
the interesting part here is and now we
get away from source code analysis to
just looking on how you interact with
your IDE we could learn something from
this example if you select the fourth
example but skip the sir the second of
the first and all the others it seems to
be a valuable information because for
some reason you decided not to use the
first three ones but only 24 for
instance 52 URL might be deprecated or
and you know that so you typically might
do it something diff differently by
calling to URI to you are and this can
be learned by just if you share the
information how you use the day p IM
your ite and if you do that well it
looks basically like this saying okay
you trigger that Coco Malaysian stuff
and now you see that sometimes you're on
top so what we've build is a system that
tracks how use code commit how you use
the code completion which changed you
select communicates that River say an
in-house server in your company and
enriches your API or your code
completion of this information to
prevent you from doing these mistakes
yeah and if you internet well this looks
like you expect it to your right or URL
it's fine okay so go to the feds yeah so
this is a the Queen's University and
mostly active on on this project and
it's also a Google some of co project of
a guy and in Beijing and some yeah so if
you if you look on on eclipse and I
guess in IntelliJ is more or less
similar the number of code templates
eclipse comes with 42 Java templates and
35 templates for four swt and that's it
so that's the whole knowledge of eclipse
redirects so the knowledge developers
spend on on seven years of development
so the number of code snippets pd
finders is pretty low and it's only swt
it's not je fais not eclipse you I it's
not java standard library it's not it
really just air bases on the other hand
we have a huge raise of our eyes
of code snippet repositories you have
sniffler github co-driver j examples and
all that stuff so up apparently people
want these code snippets and they want
to have that i think they want to have
that in their IDE so what they would
like to have is a code completion engine
that is searchable and enjoy all these
templates in your IDE and just to show
you how this works I say you trigger
your code completion and I said I want
to do something of files but it just
looks up that stuff and you can get
refine your search into that stuff in
here and work on this so what happens is
in the background there is a code
snippet repository you can you can query
for for these code templates and you can
insert this simply in your IDE you can
search that you can refine your search
and all that stuff you can rate these
templates and yeah reason here but this
gets more interesting when we get to to
mining code snippets I will get to this
inin in another second and documentation
while now we laugh documentation do we
of course we do love good documentation
but probably no one of us is key on
writing it it's the any documentation
writer in the room expected that so no
one who loves writing documentation well
it's an obvious question so no one likes
that but well we know good documentation
on me see it and this one I think is a
quite good documentation for protective
method called do unload it says this
method rolls back a transaction clears
different lists and I should know that
note that super do unload is not caught
and i think it's it's a good in because
there are some inverse undesired and
brewers remove operations and things
like that so it's really a good
documentation good example for for that
but if you look at the implementation
what you see is that they say oh oh damn
ah ok i noted super do one load is not
called for whatever reason but if you
look at the impatient it's still there
so what happens is the documentation i
assume at the time this documentation
was written super download was not
called i'm pretty sure but over time
things change it guys change things are
differently generated or whatever
now it's okay so what you see here is
you get an outdated documentation and
then we have many examples that really
they kill you if you so it is
documentation of course what's not a
good documentation anymore because it
just making mistakes in your assumptions
and flow working as to expect it to work
so what can you do I mean we've learned
that before you write outdated
documentation the optimal on a better
solution is not writing documentation at
all I don't know how many team needs are
in here but I guess if you try to
propose this to your team lead he's
probably knocking you out and saying oh
guy you can't write without any you have
to write documentation and what I think
we are smart I was small enough they are
and we develop tools that can do that
for us we means we all and we can
generate high-quality documentation so
for instance there's a tool out there
basically if you give it a piece of code
what it does is on field number of
questions it generates the comment the
number of questions they said well not
bad and for a set number of questions it
generates the comment sets the number of
questions I said well my paper my my
personal favorite is throws
illegalargumentexception shows the Eagle
argumentexception and say wow I mean hey
that's great right so that's really oh
no no really it's it's not high quality
anymore it's just documentation it's
just generated and it satisfies maybe
the root of your boss that you have
enough documentation in there so don't
get me wrong if your bonus payments
depends on this kind of documentation do
that I don't want to be the reason why
you get less money and of the year or
for Christmas or whatever but be aware
this is not helping no one and what was
was what was really say annoying so hard
word but but confusing me was the use of
feed bag of that tool and what people
said about that too was Wow exactly what
I needed well you remember the bonus
payment stuff that's that's that's
probably yeah this guy the second one
said thank you this plugin rocks whoo ok
and my personal favorite number three
said works perfectly smarter than I
expected
say come on guy I mean let me compare
that yeah so throws in your argument
receptions roasty you can automatic
section that we okay no I just don't
want to to go further on this yeah so we
start no we give you can't leave it on
the on this number we have to improve on
this somehow and we started a lot of
work on on this area and try to figure
out what can we do to improve
documentation with something more
valuable and let me give you an example
if you extend from a dialogue class in
this case jphayes what Eclipse generates
you is this code snippet here so you get
a constructor which caused the super
constructor and that's it so the
question you have is now what are the
hot spots so which methods am I supposed
to override and where should I put my
own code in and what you do is typically
you just look at the java documentation
try to figure out what about it tells
you and if you look at this
documentation it gives you two pieces of
information the first one is saying a
dialogue is a specialized window and
short explanation so okay well maybe
there's something more and the second
information is dialogues are usually
modal in a lengthy explanation what
modal actually means but you still have
no idea what are the hot spots of
dialogue so where should I put in my
code which method should i override
should I put it into the constructor or
what is it I have no right here well the
next thing you do is you enter code
completion and you scan the method names
in there and check for something that
sounds reasonable so convert constraint
no no no there's a method called create
and then you go on and you start reading
all the method documentation to figure
out if this is what you need but you do
that for all 60-56 methods and then well
I think it's again it's a tedious task
we could do better and how could we do
that well we just have to find out how
people extend at the classes before and
say okay we have seen 636 code examples
that extended a dialogue class and from
these 600 636 600 override the create
dialogue area method so this is an
excellent point
telling you that this is the method you
probably should override and should have
at least a closer look on this API or it
might tell you you want to over
configure shell maybe okay pressed or
create buttons for button bar and and so
on so it's it's you're not supposed to
over at all of them but at least a few
of them and you should learn about the
variation points the API designer
intended you to use and you should know
that they are used by others so it's
again it's giving you pointers which
methods you should override a call or we
have to insert your power meters and all
that stuff it's helping you to get
familiar with your fi much faster than
than before or it might tell you okay if
you override the ad pages method there's
some framework callbacks you typically
call so for instance here you should
call that page method with some wizard
page in here because everyone else did
like this so it can inform you how you
should interact with your with your
framework with your base class sometimes
there are different ways how you can
extend the class for viewer cooperator
for instance developers has have
typically to two ways of extending it
they might override the compare method
only and eighty percent of the people do
so but in some cases you might override
category in sort instead so by just
applying a simple clustering and
technique on your data you can inform
people of different patterns how to use
that again put us into your
documentation but also into your code
completion and well that's my personal
favorite it's the most exciting project
we are currently working on if you
override a method there's always or in
many cases a standard pattern that that
follows again a framework developer has
an idea how to extend their method so
for instance here you typically call a
super create dialogue area that thing is
condom casa to a composite and return at
the end and again this is a snippet that
appears so often in your code that you
really can't find it you can mind that
example code extract this pattern and
put this into your documentation and if
you put this one step further you can
also put the document these snippets
into your code completion and also
unicode generation and that's what we
are currently working on so this he
would get back to to snip match the idea
of having this code templates stuff in
here and also you can do different stuff
like informing help to use text version
and all that things so you don't need
developers to specify code templates
anymore you can just make a
pre-selection of the snippets you find
in the example code put this in for
review for a developer put this into
your ID and they can say this is a good
one a bad one or whatever and even they
might not be required to check that
stuff because we can all to learn
automatically which templates are good
ones and bad ones by just looking at
which ones you use let me show you how
this looks like in current iteration I
need to reset that stuff so there isn't
extra view an eclipse we call the
extended documentation and let's go to
my dialogue and you see this normal the
standard java documentation for for for
dialogue so there's really no nothing
else than just saying what a modal
dialogue is but what you could do is
having exactly this information which
methods to override and also if you
scroll down you get the different
patterns which may affect you want to
all right and it's simply inserted in
your documentation you can also in to
include information like which methods
to call unknown on these variables and
then things like that and also there is
so now let me jump to the right snippet
stuff you can also have this code
snippet mining so this is an example how
to use a string buffer in combination
with a bufferedreader that we expect it
automatically from for example code
snippet so it's really it's considering
order method calls its considering which
objects flow into which parameters all
that stuff so it's everything just
analyze figured out put into your
documentation and if you search for that
stuff it's pretty simple to for your IDE
to figure out what you're going to need
just check which variables are available
what I only selecting and giving you a
say context-sensitive and cash
documentation and also maybe more less
interesting for hope for you so we're
also working on a code search engine do
you know how many people are using code
search engines oh no google so there
that actually huge code search engines
have roughly 20 requests per minute 20 I
mean versus 700 million per minute if
you use google standard web search so
there's a small contrast so they don't
work properly but if you assume that you
have a code base in your workspace using
certain areas you want to know how
others used it in your own ID in your
own project what you could do is
indexing code snippets figuring out for
instance how people use the text widget
and if you selecting a text that it can
find you all tipet's in your code base
they'd use that stuff it can then apply
some clustering that you only get
different examples and can recommend you
or show them to you if you double click
you can oh well you of course your jump
to to the method and and all that stuff
to make it deeper research on that thing
so this is a project currently also an
incubator stuff so the code search ideas
also cause you're free language etc is
something we are working on but I'm not
sure how far will get until Kepler so if
you're interested in code search well
talk to me we can do offensive things in
here too okay well this is how it looks
like in the end yeah back detection aha
so there are not many food like in
developers in here so the question
what's wrong in this code is probably no
one can answer but what you see is when
you execute that code you get that
saying oh well something went wrong some
null argument stuff and whoa what was
going on have no idea so the theorem
error reporting is well not helpful for
developer if you dig a little bit deeper
into the log files what you get is a
stack trace like this
well there's a syrup now wizard and all
that stuff and if you scan that there's
not not any class name you are familiar
with so nothing from your own API and
you first respond to response to these
detectors is not my fault at least in my
case it well there's no class of my my
own in there it's probably a back-end on
Eclipse IDE sale and you find a bug
report but actually the problem is you
forgot to call a certain method in here
and if you call your if you check what
what the idea would have proposed you it
would have told you that you should call
the set control method with a rather
high probability and well the question
now is if everyone else in the room did
it like this and you do it differently
well are you sure you're doing it wrong
or right or are you making some
accidental mistake in here and that's
the idea of a bug detection tool so what
we did is if you have enough data you
can learn how people use the API and you
can identify deviations from the
standard and we did that and you could
insert this into your code completion
setting okay so it's it's a research
prototype saying you okay the use of
this is not correct it's probably said
control missing and so it's a student
projects or the wording is sir and we
applied that stuff on on eclipse treat
at five and we were able to find a
division of box in old really old code
base like methods you have probably
missed that in some circumstances
produce errors and because you know
which methods people otherwise are
usually called you can also tell them
what's missing what's going wrong before
the code actually get executed and if
you like you can think of this like like
find box for AP is so fine box tells you
how to use the Java standard library
prevents you from doing accidental null
point excess stuff and what you can do
with analyzing source code is finding
API specific you stood rules that tell
you that warn you if things go wrong and
it works
yeah so now completely away from your
IDE two words stack traces people who
bought this nullpointerexception
typically fix this by calling whatever
so what do you do to get this so all
these tools are presented to you the
code completion stuff pack detection
documentation even code search helps you
before you do any mistake so they end to
support you in telling you what you
should do and you should not it but what
do you do or what do you do if you get
still a stack trace so the usual way how
to deal with that is well you take the
stack trace stuff on the bottom going up
and down looking for class name that
sounds familiar and you try to figure
out what's going wrong if there's your
class name in there you might get an
idea if not Wow how do you solve that I
solve it like this I take your first
line put it into google and say oh well
let's see what google offers me to this
problem and in this case it works pretty
well because there's a well-known
problem many people that before so there
are many resources on the web that tell
you how well this is a common stacktrace
but as you you are working in-house you
probably don't want you to developers to
send out your stack traces and you
probably don't get any recomendations so
Google doesn't know about your internal
problems if you enter that well just as
well I'm sorry I can't help you so
something I've never seen before for
obvious reasons but don't these tech
traces share some interesting
information so whenever you open the
back report developers will ask you for
a stack trace because based on the stack
trace they know where to look and what's
the cause for the potential cause for
your problem so what they are looking
for is for instance the type of the
exception the error message and there
are also these tech frame elements in
here that carry an interesting on the
path then the program takes to you
through your code and it helps them to
determine what's going wrong and imagine
if you take this knowledge and you take
all these represent bugzilla and the
forums and all that stuff and scan them
for these tech traces you combine that
with you right
whenever an exception of course it can
tell you where to look for a solution
wouldn't this be exciting I mean who's
using maven or Tycho well you'd then
know if something goes wrong you get a
build exception the last line of your
output is oh well this is a build
exception look at this wiki page maybe
you find a solution for this did you
ever do so I guess once at most if you
do that what you get is oh well yes this
is a wiki page for built exceptions and
it's completely empty so no one is
inserting the information in here but
the idea is great it's really great
because if you put some formulas lenders
making it a little bit more efficient
and automated in that sense you can
create a really valuable information
source for helping you to fix these
issues and well this is how it looks
like or should look like and just a
preliminary screenshot of thoughts going
or coming on but you enter your service
tech trace and you get the resources
that fix that stuff i'm currently using
this for you know the milestone builds
for kids go on and whenever i
experienced a bug i just put this back
into the search interface and check if
someone else as a reporter this park
before and if not i open a back report
it's pretty simple because we really
know where to look and and if someone's
already aware of this issue okay so it's
time to sum up all that stuff you have
seen so far so mostly co recommenders is
about mining source code forums and all
that stuff why do we call that ID 20 I
mean that's not really amazon right so
there's a user stuff missing but in
future what we would like to do is
leverage that stuff that comes from you
in your IDE you don't have to look too
close on your code but just on how you
interact with your IDE because in your
IDE we know your project environment
which libraries you're currently using
and which versions and all that stuff we
have your code we have the way how you
select the proposed in your code
completion so we know text widget this
current situation this proposal we can
learn that and can give this information
from two to other developers in your
team's also there's some kind of click
feedback like you know that from from M
is
if you have a search and you enter
different jump to different elements you
can learn from this that these terms and
books seem to be related to each other
in some sense and interesting for that
query same when your IDE if you click
something or your copy code snippet from
your ID and paste it into your editor
you can learn that this was a pretty
good example or if they are traversing
documentation you can learn that they
seem to be related in some sense so you
can make some automatic see also text by
just looking and how people try to
understand an API and all that stuff and
also for stack traces if you produce the
stack trace and you somehow fix that and
next one is software the sacrifice
disappeared you can just look on what
did you change in your API so what's the
Delta in here and to figure out what
yeah give real comic recommendations
telling people what to do just to make
sure all that stuff this is not power of
eclipse eclipse is pretty pretty much
aware that privacy is a huge issue so
you don't want to feed any of your data
to some some external server so this is
all the stuff that we are currently
developing in a coal trains project so
this is completely so there's a
clear-cut whenever you download
something from eclipse or org it will
never send anything to a server right
just to make that sure because otherwise
why a wayne will knock me out not making
this explicit so we have other tools and
all these tools are presented it will be
able to to learn that so we can share
that with the community base and we
offer services to put all this into your
company context yeah so how does it work
at the moment so we have this Eclipse
marketplace or maven central all that
stuff so there is a huge amount of
example data available so I think maven
central is in the moment round about six
hundred gigabytes of Java artifacts
source code compiled stuff and so on we
analyze that stuff and we put this into
our same central large space of Cobra
Commander's and to some data mining on
that stuff static analysis and create
recommendation models for code
completion the documentation stuff and
so on and then we deliver this as handy
zip files down to your IDE so what you
do
you automatically download the model
files for your AP is and that's the only
communication with the server and yeah
what we're trying the fifth culture is
is now adding the fourth edge here and
taking making use of this implicit usage
data that comes from from users and yeah
so maybe interesting what what's
currently supported as I said it's
implemented it's mostly we use the
Eclipse marketplace or jewelry strain to
learn how to use api's because it's some
well we discuss the maven sonatype a
little bit how to get data and we didn't
find a right agreement at the moment so
our code base is curly room limited to
eclipse api's to java standard library
we have yet no support for Java
Enterprise Edition and this is also
motivation for having this this for
fetch in here because consider you want
to use hibernate how many open-source
examples you can expect to find in
something like github not that many in
most cases this is API that that's used
inside your your company right so what
we need is to get some data how people
used hibernate without getting some
confidential information so that we can
put this on you make this available to
others so there's a bit of a problem
here we have to solve and we have
kirlyam yeah quite a few people working
on these ideas just to learn from code
completion and keeping our privacy so
that no company secrets get get
submitted yeah at the end of the look
like this bonus and there's also some
where IntelliJ sorry well just to sum up
you've seen Cobra Commander's is about
intelligent code completion call
parameters annotations also override
completion you have seen this
documentation stuff you learned that
there's some kind of bug detection tools
or mechanism available I just briefly
introduce you to code search snip match
and a separate surgeon and these are the
projects we are working on for 2012 to
make all that stuff too
you find that stuff make this available
it eclipses Kepler in for the next
dimension and well this is the right
moment for first of all things thank you
and asking you for other questions yeah
how can you use that on a prior to our
code base you have to talk to me yeah so
I'm the Eclipse stuff so at the moment
you need to define you can you find your
own models manually you have to figure
out how what we offer are the tools for
learning this from your in-house library
and sitting all that stuff we're in a
library so that's something that we are
currently developing and offering us as
a service home behind the outside the
Eclipse area yeah
so let's see if I got the question right
say you want to learn like you're
typically doing these these kind of
refactorings or you want to do that
because this would improve your code
quality or others had done this before
but so to that go into this direction
are currently not on our development
schedule so just to provide more numbers
this project has been developed by two
people in the past year or one and a
half and in a lot three years over 70
students that evaluated different ideas
and in the project so we we got sort of
first library we got a funding by the
German government which enables us to
put more resources on that stuff so we
have four people now working full-time
on the project we have a little more
people doing doing the work on the
project now so this might be something
to come so maybe we can discuss further
ideas and yeah afterwards if I just go
to last row yep can you show a lil bit
so I have the air conditioner I'm sorry
I wait ok propagating bad Calvet
practices that's that's funny and
interesting question funny in a sense
because you know it's not as a research
project so the initial idea was just to
tell you or show you that it works that
you can find all that stuff and that is
really helpful but on the other hand if
you show that it works you have exactly
your prop the problem you mentioned that
you might propagate patterns that are
unusual and what we did is we had these
do combination stuff and we showed it to
an eclipse some project lead and show
them a few recommendation said well now
this is only sixty percent there should
be one hundred percent right so this is
lawlessness situation so well but it's
not one hundred percent yeah but it must
be okay what should I do people don't do
that and I said well yes you need some
mechanisms to override what you have
learned to enable people to correct the
recommendations you do so this is
something you should consider it's
currently not considered also what's
interesting you might learn from say you
are an expert on non swt and I'm not
maybe the coat that I'm producing is not
that interesting or not that good as you
code is so maybe I want to learn from
you more and it's more valuable than my
code is so they are also different
aspects we should consider here at the
moment so there's one simple rule and
machine learning the more data you have
beats better algorithms and better
mechanisms and that's we call the
relying on so we actually made a study
we compared what eclipse commuters do
and how they use the api's and compare
this how people that are in Eclipse
marketplace to private or outside
developers use that and to compare how
different our recommendations get and we
saw the precision decrees of roughly ten
percent but it's well the order and the
recommendations are still the same so
it's not it's not a big impact it's just
not one hundred percent anymore but but
90 or whatever it's done a
recommendation you could um you should
take care of it might be helpful one
more question yes honey he loses three
to six right yeah it's not seven so it's
not ported for suite of six as I said
it's a small small project you can use
it of three dot seven but there are some
limitations because for separates for
instance we had to work closely with the
JDT team and get their assistance
because there are some internal changes
they had to make and which are done for
38 and 42 so maybe you don't know so
they clips photo to their students read
on eight if you have any performance
issues and you follow the discussion you
can always use the free dot 8 version
and their Cobra Commander's runs as you
as you wanted to run so there's a chrono
means support back to three dot six just
because of the lack of resources one
more question yeah
that's funny again you're speaking my
mind that all the work people I would
like to do so the question was would it
support other languages in your ID not
necessarily Java but Scala JavaScript
for instance would be pretty interesting
because well javascript is just a
combination of letters right there's no
rule yeah well there are some rules but
that is pretty complex and you can do so
many fancy things in there it's hard to
learn that we actually have a guy who is
working on on the javascript stuff and
also the learning from just from your
code completion it's an approach you can
think of being Universal to every
language you just need a minimal AST
analysis to figure out where you are
what you're doing on a variable and then
you've might create recommendations for
any language so this is what we're
currently working on this will be pretty
exciting and don't expect this to happen
before 2013 so just to be honest that's
a that's a huge research area but we're
working on this so it's maybe some of
that huge okay I'd like to thank you and
yeah have a nice time here all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
