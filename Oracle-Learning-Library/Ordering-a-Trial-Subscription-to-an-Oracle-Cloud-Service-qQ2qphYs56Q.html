curriculum developer at Oracle in this
first of two videos on provisioning
Oracle cloud services I will show you
how to request and activate a trial
subscription to an Oracle cloud service
the second video will show you how to
administer the service including the
management of users and roles you can
easily make self service requests for an
Oracle cloud service via the cloud
oracle com website the main page of the
cloud.oracle.com website shows the wide
range of oracle cloud services some of
which are generally available others of
which are available for preview when you
click the try it button at the top of
the page a cloud trials page shows a
variety of services for which you can
request trial accounts in this video we
will see how to request a trial of the
database cloud service before we proceed
let's pause for a moment and view a
diagram of the cloud service
provisioning workflow so that you can
get an idea of the different roles and
steps for requesting activating in
administering an Oracle cloud service
trial subscription the first step is to
order a free trial subscription to an
Oracle cloud service by clicking a triad
button on the cloud oracle com website
as a trial requester you are
automatically assigned the role of the
account administrator for the service
next as the account administrator you
receive an automated notification email
to activate the service while activating
the service you designate who will be
the service administrator and the
identity domain administrator a key task
of the identity domain administrator is
to define the users and the user roles
that will give users their access
privileges this is performed in the
oracle identity console of the cloud
oracle com website the identity domain
administrator creates users and roles
for all of the purchased or trial cloud
services the role of the service
administrator is to develop an
administer
a particular cloud service using the my
services application in the oracle
identity console of the cloud oracle com
website one important task is to assign
roles to each user of the cloud service
another task is to provide all the cloud
service users the URL and signing
credentials to access the service here
is a list of the seven steps I just
discussed this first video of the Oracle
cloud service provisioning process will
focus on the first four steps ordering
Oracle cloud services and activating the
services the second video will cover
administration of the service including
the management of users and roles keep
in mind that depending on your
organization size and structure the same
person can be assigned to perform
several of these roles let's return to
the cloud oracle com website and click
try it an oracle cloud trials page shows
oracle cloud services available for
trial in this demo we will request a
trial account for the oracle cloud
database service under database click
try it you must have an oracle com
account click Sign In if you already
have an account otherwise click create
an account I already have an account so
I'll click sign in enter your oracle com
credentials and click Sign In in the
next set of steps you enter your account
information specify the name of your
database cloud service and agree to the
terms to submit your database cloud
service perform the following steps
first enter your account information
then click Next
next enter your credit card information
to validate your identity this is a free
trial so your credit card will not be
billed then click Next if this had been
my first time ordering a trial service I
would have been prompted to confirm my
address you then see a service details
page with fields for you as the account
administrator to designate who will be
the service administrator before I fill
in this information let's go back to the
slide showing the provisioning workflow
to review the purposes for this
administrator role you are currently
logged in as the account administrator
you are about to designate the service
administrator who will manage this
particular database service and assign
roles to users depending on your needs
you can assign this role to yourself or
to a different person now let's return
to the service details page that you are
filling as part of your cloud service
order the service information section
has one field in which you choose the
data region for your service
while you as the account administrator
can assign a different person to the
role of service administrator for this
example I will accept the default
assignment to myself click Next on the
next screen read the terms and
conditions of the user agreement click
the I accept checkbox and click Submit
request the next screen shows that your
service request has been submitted at
this point you will receive an email
once your request is processed you
receive an email like this to activate
your water click the activate order
button a window in your browser will
open to a sign-in page for your Oracle
account enter your username and password
the same credentials you use to sign up
for the trial service
then click the Sign In button
the Oracle cloud my account application
appears showing the service information
click activate service a message shows
that your service has been submitted for
activation
when your service has been activated you
will receive a second email providing
useful information about your service
the email shows the username temporary
password identity domain and data center
for the service you just activated you
will use this information next who'd
login to your service log in to your
cloud service by clicking the URL in
your welcome email or switch to your
browser and click the my services link
in the toolbar make sure the correct
data center is selected where your
service was created and click Sign In to
my services enter your username your
temporary password from the notification
email and the identity domain for your
service and click Sign In oracle
identity manager opens at a password
management tab when you log into your
service for the first time you are
prompted to change your temporary
password enter your temporary password
in the old password field then enter
your new password twice based on the
password policy in addition choose three
challenge questions and provide answers
for each one to help you if you forget
your password there is a drop-down menu
with four questions from which you can
choose then click Submit my password and
challenge questions were set
successfully and I'm logged in to the my
services application as the account
administrator I am now ready to launch
the Oracle cloud database service click
launch service when you launch the
Oracle cloud database service it opens
at the application Express homepage I
can now begin creating my database
applications and that's it you've now
seen how to request and activate an
Oracle cloud trial service I encourage
you to watch part 2 administering a new
Oracle cloud service to learn how to
administer the service including the
management of users and roles
I'm Rick green thanks for watching
