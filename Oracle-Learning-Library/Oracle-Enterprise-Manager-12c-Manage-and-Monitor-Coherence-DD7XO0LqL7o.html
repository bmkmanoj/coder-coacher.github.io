will see how to use in device manager to
LC to manage and monitor coherence this
is a coherent cluster home page
dashboard here you can see the overall
health of the cluster of Harmons
hotspots and also the top caches with
lowest hips to gets ratio here you can
see the all the hosts where the cluster
is distributed in this Services section
you can find all the services cluster
services along with their status the
matrix alerts is an important way to
find out the performance hotspots
proactively coherence log alerts you can
use to find a lot patterns in the
coherence log files performance summary
view can be used to create multiple
performance views as per the business
requirement here you can plot multiple
matrix on the same chart for each metric
you can actually see the performance
trend with respect to the warning and
critical thresholds as you can see there
is a warning and critical threshold
displayed here you can customize these
views by simply pulling out the metric
palette and selecting the metrics that
you are interested in for example I can
select the maximum request duration here
and the metric will start plotting as
you can see here this is the top cassius
page you can see all the top caches
based on various performance metrics you
can drill down to individual cash and
this is a cash home page here you can
see the performance all the notes that
the cash is running here also we have a
performance similar review which is a
new feature here you can actually
customize performance view at the
individual cash level you can use the
metric palette view for customization
again you can actually plot multiple
matrix on the same chart you can do the
performance trend analysis based on
historical one as well as the real-time
performance monitoring we have
performance usage report cash usage
report on the same page where you can
see the overall statistics of the cash
the hits to gets ratio etc the new
feature that we have added in orient
will see is you can actually do it down
into the JVM diagnostics that will take
you to the JVM diagnostics page for the
nodes where this cache is running here
you can actually see all the JVM level
statistics this provides real-time
visibility into the JVM the active
threads the top methods the he
brutalization can also use JVM
Diagnostics to find out the memory leaks
and the memory utilization based on
different objects in om TLC we have
added extensive support for variety of
cash operations you can actually import
export data add remove index can also
view data in a cache and also perform
view explain plan and view taste
operations you can create your own
queries these operations are actually
protected by the host level credentials
apart from monitoring and diagnostics we
also collect configuration data for the
currents components using that we create
a topology view the topology view is a
great tool for administrators to find
out the component dependency on each
other for example in this case we
actually show the complete apology of
this particular cluster the cash and
associated nodes and for each node on
which particular host it is running as
you can see the individual node
component and digital cash component is
actually highlighted with the key
performance metrics you can go deeper
into it and find out more about it let
us drill down to storage node one I am
going to the performance summary view
directly the performance summer review
at the node level is again a new feature
where you can actually plot the plot the
charts with with that trend you can use
the overlay feature create a baseline
and monitor the performance trends with
respect to the baseline you can also add
another node for comparison this way you
can actually create a heat map for
comparing multiple node performance side
by side we also have various reports
on this page cache size report cash
usage report garbage collection report
and also query optimization report query
optimization monitoring is a new feature
we have added in orient will see here we
capture the performance of optimized as
well as an optimized queries performance
summary reviews also shows the related
targets to the target in context that
allows us to select matrix from various
sources apart from out of box monitoring
we also support metric extensions for
custom metrics
thanks for watching this demonstration
