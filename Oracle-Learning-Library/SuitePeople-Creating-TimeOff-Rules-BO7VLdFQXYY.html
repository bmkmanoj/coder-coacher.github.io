time off management feature enables
employees managers and HR to easily
request approve track and report on time
off activities through a centralized
system without the need for manual entry
in this video I'll be giving you an
overview of the overall setup required
for the time off management feature and
then I'll go into detail on how to
create time off rules time off rules are
used to specify how employees accumulate
time off over a period of time each of
the other required setup steps are
detailed in their own separate videos I
highly recommend watching them in
sequence starting with the creating time
off types video before we get started
you should be aware of the following
prerequisites for using time off
management you will need to have sweet
people available on your account as well
as have the time off management feature
enabled you'll also need to have the
time off tracking sweet app installed
which enables employees to submit time
off requests from the employee center
and provides an approval workflow that
routes request to employees managers for
approval you'll also want to make sure
your administrator has given you a role
in that suite that has access to the
time off management feature and lastly
employee records must be created in that
suite
before you begin sending out time off
management for your company you should
review your company's time off policies
for example you should think about the
differences between employees with
regards to the amount of time off they
are entitled to take how unused time off
is dealt with at the end of the year and
how time off is accrued let's now take a
look at each of the steps involved in
setting up time off management the first
step is to create time off types for the
different categories of time off
employees can take for example you would
create a time off type for a vacation
and another for sick leave the second
step is to create the time off plans the
third step is to add time off rules to
the time off plan time off rules reflect
your company's time off policies they
define how to handle time off
eligibility entitlements accruals and
carryover during an employee's tenure
with the company I'll be going over how
to create time off rules later on in
this video then time off rules need to
be associated with the time off type
next time off plan needs to be assigned
to employees on their employee record as
well as a work calendar work calendars
determine which days are working days
for the employee this is used to
calculate the number of hours to deduct
from an employee's balance when a time
off request is submitted and lastly a
supervisor should be specified on the
employee record this person will
automatically receive any time off
requests submitted by the employee
I'll now go into detail on the third
step in the time off management process
creating time off rules time off rules
reflect your company's time off policies
they define how to handle time off
eligibility entitlements accruals and
carry ordering an employee's tenure with
the company you must define and apply
rules to a time off plan to be able to
select and assign it to an employee it's
important for me to mention that before
creating your time off rules you must
first create the time off types for the
different categories of time off your
employees can take and create the time
off plan for details I recommend
watching the companion videos creating
time off types and creating time off
plans let's now take a closer look on
how to create a time off rule I'm at the
home page of my NetSuite account from
here navigate to setup HR information
system time off plan from the time off
plans list page click Edit next to the
plan you want to add the time off rule
to for this demo we will select
full-time salary vacation
click new time off rule from the time
off rule sub-tab this will take us to
the time off rule page from the time off
type list select the type of time off to
apply to the plan for this demo we will
select vacation you have the option to
specify a minimum tenure for example if
we enter a minimum tenure of 3 months
then employees assigned to this plan
must be employed for that time frame
before they are entitled to take
vacation for this demo we will leave
this field blank in this next step we
will define how employees accumulate
time off over a period of time returning
to where we left off on the time off
rule page check the automatically accrue
box to automatically calculate accruals
specify whether accruals are based on a
fixed amount per period or hours worked
if the employees in your company accrue
time off based on the number of hours
worked
NetSuite payroll must be enabled in your
account and you need to make sure that
accrue time is set up on the employee
record for each employee for whom you
use NetSuite payroll for this demo we
will select fixed amount per period next
specify whether time is accrued
proactively or retroactively lead Perl
active means that employees accrue time
off for the period they are about to
work and retro actively means they
accrue time off for the period they have
already worked for this demo we will
select proactive from the accrual
frequency list specify when time off a
cruise you can select from annually by
weekly monthly semi monthly and weekly
for this demo we will select annually
the opening balance for new employees
field appears when proactive is set as
the cruel type and the minimum 10 years
set to zero
the selection made here is used to
calculate automatic accruals for this
demo we will select full amount for
accrual period this means that the first
accrual will be the full amount
specified for the cruel period applied
on the employees start date in the
entitlement and entitlement unit fields
enter the number of days or hours that
employees are entitled to earn each year
in this example we will enter 15 days
next check the set accrual limit box to
specify an accrual limit enter the
default number of days or hours to cap
and employees time off for example when
the accrual limit is set to 10 days
employees accruals automatically adjust
when they hit this cap for employees who
exceed this cap it is not debited from
their amount of time off instead they
stop accruing until their existing time
off does not exceed the cap
last part of setting up a time off rule
is you have the option to define balance
and carryover limits which control how
the system handles employees unused time
off at the end of the year returning to
where we left off on the time off rule
page scroll down to the balance and
carryover limit section by default the
allow employees to carryover unused time
off boxes checked when you allow
employees to carryover unused time you
have the option to control how to handle
unused time for this demo we will leave
the Box checked if you want to limit how
much time employees are allowed to carry
over check the limit amount of time off
employees carryover box when you check
the box you'll notice two new fields
appear the maximum carryover and maximum
carryover in unit fields in these fields
enter the maximum amount of time in days
or hours that employees can carry over
for this demo we will limit the number
of carryover days to five you can also
place a limit on when employees must use
up they're carried over days by checking
the expire unused carryover box when you
check the expire unused carryover box
you'll notice a new field appears it is
from this field that you specify when
carried over days must be used up for
this demo we will specify that the five
carryover days must be taken by the end
of April or employees will lose the time
you can also control whether negative
balances should be carried over at the
end of the year by checking the reset
negative balances to zero at year-end
box a good use case for this is when an
employee takes sick leave you may not
want to have negative balances carried
over for this demo we will leave this
box unchecked and to finish click Save
to apply the changes and that's it we've
completed all the steps for creating a
time off rule and finishing remember
that you can create multiple rules for a
single time off type
this lets you accommodate how employees
accumulate time off during their tenure
at the company
I hope this videos helped give you a
better understanding of the overall time
off management process and how to create
time off rules I highly recommend
checking out the other videos in this
series creating time off types creating
time off plans and assigning time off
plans thanks for watching and see you
