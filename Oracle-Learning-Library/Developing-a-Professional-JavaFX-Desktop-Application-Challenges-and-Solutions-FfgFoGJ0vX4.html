supposed to do this both and Joey kindly
show up and said no you are not going to
do it I will do it for you
no it's a it's a matter of scheduling
stuff like that and actually it's Jose
that is going to present everything and
now I am there as a backup just in case
we we start discussing stuff around the
single Durand so so Joey
go ahead hello
alright can you hear me yes okay so I'm
Joanne Drazen I'm on the my graphics
engineer on the graphics team for JavaFX
work on prism and various various
features new canvas feature and also I
have helped out with some demos and some
job FX development here and there so
there was a scheduling conflict with one
of the same builder talks but I got was
able to get moved around but I had
already started you know making content
for this talk so we're both here and you
know I get both of us so this is going
to be a very informal talk I'm going to
kick off a little bit of discussion
about some of the various tools and how
you might use them together to help you
rapidly develop at Java effects
application and then kick off a
discussion maybe talk to some of you
about if any of you are having problems
or any questions on a particular thing
about Java FX I I can promise you 100%
that any questions you ask will get
answered they may not get answered by us
but we could keep track and get your
contact information and definitely get
an answer for you because really I want
this talk to be about you know problems
people are having and the solutions that
are out there in order to to get around
them so
a little bit of a story about why how I
got involved with scene builder JavaOne
Brasil back in December I was I
volunteered to go and do booth duty and
there we actually needed somebody to do
the scene builder talk and so I
volunteered and I had kept an eye on
scene builder because they had it's a
Java fix application itself and so
they'd file bugs and I'm on the graphics
team so I'd fix team builder bugs it's
like scene builder is gonna be released
you know these are critical bugs and so
Iowa was on the plane to Brazil and I
had downloaded scene builder I had
actually never tried to develop an
application with it at the time it was
in alpha and even more so I was on a Mac
so I spent about an hour and a half I
had two hours of battery life and I was
able to develop at least the layout for
this application this stat tracking
application that I had come up with and
OH in a matter of an hour and I had you
know done the layout in Photoshop and
the you know the kind of the design of
the logo and whatever you can see here
and but but kind of the thing that was
shocking to me was just how quickly I
could go from not knowing anything about
you know the you know using scene
builder from you know as a designer to
getting in there and making my
application it was actually pretty
refreshing since you know for the past
two years before that any job FX
development I did I was you know code
deep and you know in NetBeans trying to
you know code out the layout and the
design and everything so it was a relief
to see us going in this direction being
being a full-fledged Java developer so
you know lo and behold I arrived in
Brazil I was ready for the same builder
talk it went great
was well-received
and that's how I got involved with with
these kind of seam boat seam builder
talks so the first thing I'm going to go
over is a problem that that people have
when they're developing an application
they say well you know I CSS is great
and you know I I have my my design
you know I went in the photo shop I got
you know from the designers exactly what
they want the app to look like but you
know whenever I have to make a tweak I
you know going from code and the CSS to
seeing that tweak in my design it's a
very cumbersome workflow it takes it
takes a while I may make a tweak and
then go into my design and it doesn't
look right
I may get caught going back and forth
and and you know you're fighting with
the tool as opposed to fighting with
your design and trying to get the design
to look exactly like what you want to
look like and so we have an app for that
it's called FX experience tools and you
may have heard about it it's it's been
discussed it sits on the the JavaFX
community web web page but it allows you
to pretty much instantaneously generate
a base look and feel for your app and
you know it gives you a beginning and it
or beginner and advanced basic and
advanced settings to where you can
change borders and stuff I'll get into
it in a second and like I'm going to
show you it works in conjunction with
scene builder so I'm going to be going
back and forth between some code here so
hopefully let's see can you guys see
that I should probably soo-min a little
bit here
is that always review fullscreen
see
I can't zoom interesting
take off so here is FX experience tools
I was just kind of playing with it
earlier so the the that is not the
default look and feel of when you launch
the application that is a hideous look
and feel but as you can see there are
different things to play around with
here lots of different fonts you can set
and you know as you set the font it
updates the look and feel here of this
little in that little box there of all
the different controls the the slider is
a text area text field and you can kind
of get an idea of what it's going to
look like what I think is really cool
about this this app is it caters to your
colors so if you drag and you get a
lighter color it'll actually change the
the font colors to be darker to
complement the background color which is
something that can be quite frustrating
doing in code
it's actually automatic in this app so
it's really handy fun to play around
with but you may ask yourself well okay
that's cool but you know what do i do
once I have a look and feel that I'm
kind of going for so let's kind of go
back to this like darkish color here so
one nifty thing you can do is you can go
down here and you can copy the style
sheet so it has or you can save it the
reason why I said earlier is that it's a
base look and feel is this isn't going
to give you every single thing you need
to complete your applications look but
what it will give you and what I kind of
have used it for is I I created a FX
application
means and it's an actually to be clear
it's the F XML JavaFX application and
NetBeans and so that comes with a sample
F XML file here and also a CSS file
actually I might have created the CSS
file but anyways so I basically go in
here I can select all and paste and you
can see it has pasted the results of
what was in that look and feel now there
are a couple of things to note about
doing this if you're familiar with Java
fix CSS these are actually look up
colors so if you want to set the actual
background you would say actually let's
do that right now
FX background color and then you would
set it once just for an example set it
to red or whatever and then if we go to
see actually
oh yes thank you see that there we are
and of course when you spell it right
you get the auto completion so there we
go and there you can see it updated so
if if you get a now obviously you
wouldn't use this base to complete it
you know one of the things that I ended
up changing this is one of my example
apps which I'll talk about a little bit
but one of the things that I ended up
changing was these are table views and
the CSS from that app didn't change the
font size of the column the column
headers and so excuse me
I had to go in and actually like
increase the font size and I did that by
just going into scene builder and coming
over to the the style here and just
adding a style to increase the font size
and so and going back and forth between
scene builder and FX experience tools
making a couple of tweaks you can you
can get a quickly you can quickly
iterate on on a design so back to slides
so that's FX experience tools so another
thing I'm going to go over very quickly
because I pretty much just talked about
it was you know what's the optimal
workflow for using all of these tools
you know you have NetBeans you have seen
builder you have FX experience tools you
have actually FX experience tools if you
saw had a spline editor here for
creating animations and you can see at
the bottom here it has interpolator dot
spline and it gives you the results
there's also a derived color calculator
which you know kind of kind of going in
with the the thing that you know the
font color
the background color is kind of an
important thing because you want the
fonts to stand out from the background
color this kind of helps you derive good
colors but you know what's the kind of
the workflow that you would use for for
developing an application and you know
this is something that has definitely
evolved with all of these new tools
coming available and especially the
NetBeans support of F XML projects but
but basically what I do is I in fact I
could do it here just as an example I
would create the new Java fix project
select Java FX FX ml application next
we'll just leave it at the name it's
going to generate the F XML here there
it is
open it up and so you can see this
sample F XML here I would open this in
scene builder and then you know it's
kind of like scene builders connected to
this Java FX application you can see the
sample controller in there as well which
is where you plug in your logic and then
like I said before the CSS file isn't
created in there so I created it and
then you can attach that and scene
builder and then you can use that as
kind of like your base look and feel to
kind of to dump all the CSS and there
from FX experience tools and then you're
kind of up and running for the most part
and you know I would use I would say I
would use this for a kind of a
prototyping mechanism because you know
once you have you know everything there
that you want you'd probably want to
clean up the CSS a little bit go in and
clean up your your your f XML a little
bit maybe try to try to centralize all
the the styles that you've done but it
definitely gets you
up and running very easily so with that
said here this this stat tracker 2 app
was basically my second iteration on my
original idea was you know I want to be
able to go in and quickly do something
and the kind of the idea that I was I
was I started with was you know
recording stats of a game and then I
kind of trended towards oh why don't I
just you know be able to add a bunch of
sports teams and then use and then you'd
press a button and then the controller
would go and calculate different
matchups for the home-and-away team and
then it would list them in the other
table and so here's the this is so this
is the main code which obviously it's
just going to load the F XML sample and
then the controller here which has
everything we need is going to basically
refer to the F XML objects here and then
have that you can see the handle actions
there but basically let's give this a
run oops not that way it's a bad habit
so here I'm going to add I'm really into
to football right now so let's add a
bunch of NFL teams Giants Saints Packers
one of the things I was thinking about
doing right before the talk was making
it so you could press ENTER to commit
the data but I didn't want to jinx
myself and ruin something Rams so now
that I have my team's for for the
matchups I go over here say generate and
it populates the the proper Home &amp;amp; Away
teams and what's nice is that you can
you know it's it's sortable so so there
you go
so don't the drop plan again so this was
kind of I kind of wanted to just show
you guys the way that I develop JavaFX
kind of apps little apps using scene
builder and using these tools if there's
there's any questions any discussion oh
one of the other things which actually
you might have touched upon in your last
talk was the new CSS analyzer that I saw
which basically is new with scene
builder 1.1 and allows you to click on a
node and then analyze the CSS in that
node and so I can scroll down here let's
click on this guy you see various things
oh this guy's nothing but yeah
so I wanted to make sure I left some
time for discussion so if there's any
comments questions about F experience
tools tell me what you're working on I'd
be interested to hear so as anybody use
scene builder show of hands
excellent has anybody used FX experience
tools okay anybody going to give it a
try yes
so the question is how would you deploy
an app like this and can you deploy it
over the web yes yeah absolutely
actually I'm a little bit nervous being
put on the spot but let's see what we
can do here
so in NetBeans here you can have there's
packaging and deployment options you can
add you can you can deploy for web start
and you can deploy it as an applet it's
basically it's all right here
so you can have signing and stuff but
that's where you would go and there's
there we have documentation I think if
you go on the JavaFX web site where
it'll it'll help you out
oh yes
yes yes absolutely so there are
different there are different methods
that we use so I believe it might be
deployed as a jnlp for web start and
then for rich client would be a jar I
think but yeah it's it's more or less
the same
nobody's problem excellent yeah nobody
yeah this is great you're all alone you
don't have problems perps with a world
application the only other people in the
room doing more than other worlds with
JavaFX handsome builder no yeah
right so a observable list is is what
you'd want to look into I actually have
two in here so I don't know if you can
see this very well but there are two
observable lists here one for the team
which is plugged into the left table
view which is just one column and then
the other observable list is a list of
matchups which all a matchup is is just
two teams so one home and one away and
so basically by using these observable
lists you're you would basically define
a data model which in my case is these
two classes the matchup in the team and
you for the for the team you'd use these
properties and what this allows us to do
is to the table to do is observe these
properties and when they change they get
notified and then they they render you
know what the latest data is
right
so since it's a Java API there's pretty
much you can pretty much do anything I
know that the dot the Henley app that we
use has a a my sequel back-end and then
it uses GlassFish and json i think to to
send the the data model and then once
the client gets it it converts it to an
observable list plugs it into the UI and
that's just that's just one way of doing
it there I haven't seen I know there are
other examples out there but that if
you'd be curious on how they're
structuring the data model for the for
the client I would definitely look at
the the Henley app because that's that's
a mm-hm
yeah
Baltimore
my bar
mmm
so I I think it's a question for me so
when you include an XML inside an affix
NL you can have the included controller
that is injected to the unbaling
controller so there is a naming pattern
you can provide an ethics ID to the
embedded if it's an L and if you add
controller to it then you can reference
such a class from the controller that
contains the sub-controllers so yes the
risottos you can express for automatic
injection of sub-controllers in your top
F XML yeah
that's a good question II I'm not a
hundred percent sure but I do think we
we do I wouldn't want to say for sure
gee you know we actually taught topic
there is there is no API in Java if X
for data validation there is not yet but
I know that Richard for example has
started some discussion on the open GFX
discussion list around this subject I
know that I don't remember the name of
the GS is a number sorry of the GSR
there is a GSR that is doing that so
they want to make it well so but I think
it will be more in a longer time frame I
I don't know I can't answer if it will
be in Java fix 8 or later but the need
has been identified but there is no or
yet API
anybody want to share anything they're
working on or inseam builder anything
one of the in my initial submission of
this talk one of the idea was to give
you some a bit of feedback on how we we
did this in winter actually because the
sim builder can be considered that a big
application a big job one of the first
big application Oracle has developed in
JavaFX so we have been facing some
issues that you are going to face and
one of the interesting aspect is really
related to packaging how do you package
your application to look nice on windows
to look nice on Mac to look nice on
Linux how do you take benefit of the
event handlers in Mac I don't know if
you are aware of the Mac model when you
double-click on a file you have a lot of
events that are Apple specific Mac OS
specific that can recharge a bi fix
application so you have to be aware that
at some point you will have to adapt
your application according to your
platform so I think genetics does a
great job at that by first allowing
allowing you to take benefit of the
filechooser of each platform when you
create a file chooser you will get the
file chooser of of the platform you are
running on so it's a start of native
integration yesterday I show you how you
can move your menu to the system menu
bar so that's another aspect and
something that is very hot I would say
and that answer with the question
related to applet and packaging and how
to run this application really the way
we seems to go is to package native
application so some new packager are
part of the JavaFX tooling and at the
end when you are done with your
development styling and so on you can
ask this java ethics packager to
generate DM
G on a Mac to create an msi on on
Windows and I open to open to package
for Linux so the tooling we are focusing
now on the development time tools but
actually I think the auto peak these
days are packaging at native application
and you have L there so sin builder for
example is packaged as a standalone
application it contains its own Java it
doesn't rely on the Java that is
installed on your machine so we are code
bundling all our dependencies inside a
bundle and it seems that it's the way
the Java ethics application are going to
be packaged in the future you still at
this Gianelli applet kind of deployment
but the native bundle is what is
emerging and it seems that there is a
lot of traction on on this so this was
one one aspect I wanted to mention also
feedback we can give is related to
performance so when you will play with
sim builder you will notice that it's
sometimes a bit slow it creates a lot of
nodes there is a CSS engine that all the
time apply the rules and track changes
and because all the dynami city when you
have the focus its CSS when you have a
mouse over it CSS that change that you
can field so the CSS engine is working
all the time
so we have learned that we you need to
have some are keys that are not too deep
if you can keep your Rakhi quite flat
you will will be you will have better
performance effects ml and performance
we have altered so as I said we have
part of the sim builders that have been
made in a fix ml so it's mainly some
static parts the CSS analyzer 4x
instance it's an F XML a big F XML file
that contains this table so this table
is static we are not going to replace
the table we replace its content so it
fit well the XML model where you define
static layout everything that is dynamic
that is related to selection for example
when you select a node on the right you
are the inspector with all the
properties of this node it's not yet F
XML we are looking at having the tool
being 100% FX NL but we when starting
this approach we have reached an issue
related to performance so we have made
the XML loader to work better too
because FX ml loader is mainly doing
reflection of the time so it looks at
text and try to load classes and create
new instance set properties on them so
all these reflected content is cached
now in the XML loader so it's getting
better but it's not as fast as creating
new object new instance directly by code
so for now your skeleton and also all
the parts that are static should be made
in F external for example I can show you
something from the CSS analyzer but that
you can show so the CSS analyzer until
now we were just showing this big table
that's a way to present information that
is nice because you can find out what is
the winner
what is the loser what does a values
value and where do they come from but we
have also another view of the same
information that is in fact shown in a
web view so you can do view as text and
this time all the rules ones that apply
on the ones that don't apply are
presented in a textual form so that's
interesting because then you can copy
past
that's the starting of CSS ad addition
but what I want to say there if you look
at the XML of the CSS analyzer there is
some content that is not on the thin on
the scene all the time so this is an FX
ml that has a web view the table view
that has some custom but at one time
there is only one of these structures
that is loaded in the theme so you can
have when you load this XML there is
these patterns where according to the
state of your application you are going
to remove from the scene or add to the
scene your content so you can create
dine values peace of dynamic content put
them all in your XML but at a time you
will have only have one so in this way
it's it's quick because I would say that
the XML parsing has been done there is a
cost at lot time but not when the user
will click on a button when the user
click on a button you want immediate
feedback when the scene builder starts
you accept to have a bit of delay
because we are doing a lot of things and
you know that so you accept it so you
can have a trade-off construct a lot of
things in your fix a net but what become
a bit complex when you do that you are
this big hunk of pain that can be 2,000
by 2,000 if you have big screen and you
have all your stuff so I notice that
there is a pagination that is coming in
Java FX where we can page stuff we don't
have any support yet for it but I I am
so feeling the pagination and if XML can
can be combined to have this kind of
dynamic city we want but you can
Oh
actually it's it's something that we are
a bit tricked
these days there is no Java code
generation from sim builder I presented
the new tools but very small but it's a
are starting to add features in NetBeans
7.3 beta from an F XML that has been
annotated with your I fix ID and not
annotated way but you are a fix ID
located in your XML we do generate a
controller class and it's not only a
one-shot if you update your XML if you
add new FX ID it will update the class
keeping your actual code so this is
something that it's a bit we know that
we have these questions but we don't
want to go in the land of IDE for now we
will see in the future but today it's
sin builder does a fix an L
what
expiry and
and over
the gradient
yes
but I I think these woods yeah that's a
yeah it does it absolutely does so so
yeah so the colors that are here I'm
kind of hovering over with the mouse
those are our lookup colors and so when
I believe when I exported it over here
yeah so I didn't go over that but you
can see here there's three types of
gradients jasper is a big fan of the of
the shiny look so you can go in here and
i yes and it's in advanced there are
there are various things in here but ya
know you definitely can
yeah I downloaded this on this laptop
like two days ago so
that one's an equal
embedded in here
group
design later
Oh
the xml namespace
that
hearing that problem
I think seven - they got again
talking
hmm interesting
yeah I actually way back when did the
prism code for loading icons so I know
they load but right
- let's pick up
they hold the hand and then
in Poland or the doc : actor
mic on
that sounds more tedious than it needs
to be to answer your question no you are
here I just realized that we have this
ability in Sim builder to show you what
the controller class will look like did
you find this this manual action ok
perhaps you can show it so it will not
you can set it so I think Joey a set
some team text field on h2 area and so
you have set it in traffic side it so
now if you go to view in the view menu
and show sample controller skeleton ah
there you have something that you can
copy past that is so when I say that we
are not generating Java code we are not
touching at your Java file we are not
but yes and you will have some nice a
section to check that they are not null
when initializes color than and so on so
it's it's it's a nice way to to a date
your contractors you Becker
one
right
we actually we don't have what there is
this sample in in Sim builders that is a
login sample that shows how you can
replace the content of a thin of a stage
by changing its scene and as a matter of
a route so it's mainly no we
actually we don't have there is passion
ation that is coming this ability to to
have like a state of your application in
one state you have these designs and
switch off state and you have another
design so but today you are alone and
you have to to to sequence and organize
a fixable loading removing replacing by
by yourself obviously you will have 6 ml
per purview for sure yeah then if you it
depends of the use you want to achieve
so it really depends on your application
there is there is no real cost to
include an fx ml inside another FX mm
there is no penalty in term of
offloading it t3 in line and load it so
now it's I can provide pattern I have
not enough Xperia
Roku I so I can't I can't really comment
on your so a perfect perfect example of
this actually is ensemble because all of
the little apps or little samples are
basically you know their own little
independent things and I believe one
could expand
that design pattern with including F XML
and loading F XML in fact I wouldn't be
surprised I haven't looked at the source
code in a while but I wouldn't be
surprised if there was some F XML in
there yeah
they
that the same they
I find the general
that in the quake
Oh
and
yeah I actually I don't know why this
I'm I agree also
I don't know why this flexibility has
not been added to to to the annotation
we could imagine that the ethics ml
annotation are the kind of name where we
will override and have more flexibility
I actually I don't know why it does not
why not
that's yes why not I think it definitely
will I will write your suggestion
for you
and the only thing you
okay okay
and what was one tour
like before one one way good point
but there but there I'm trying to think
there there might have been a technical
reason for for the answer you got did
they provide an explanation why it
wasn't needed yes it's it's true that
you can imagine the answer it's true
that you have freedom then to to
structure your application and and cut
your controller into sub class but yes
you're right that you will have a single
front and that we contain all the
annotated fields and this is perhaps not
what you want and actually I like your
point of reuse because perhaps part of
your controller could be reused in other
XML
so in that case a list is a nice way to
achieve reuse so yes good I think it's
like it was Greg Brown actually said and
and and I think it was a matter of
resource or or priorities I'm not sure
there is a technical issues you have to
be careful to have what do you do when
you have two fields that are the same
name into controller class exception
okay so when you start to have multiple
it start to be complex so perhaps one
technical reason could be to the cost of
configuration can be peps figures and I
don't know I'm just thinking at now yes
sure yes
so in your case what you should do you
should have a kind of empty controller
class you should have controller classes
that are really only the the facet if
you wish with an audio logic or in inner
class that you can share between your
controller yeah I understand that's a
lot
you yep
yeah you can you can if you think that's
a priority what is a priority of the grr
sorry about that yeah you can you can
you can comment and say that II I'm
pretty sure you described but whatever I
will I will try to from the internal to
push ideas that seems to be you have
good use case I mean for for this point
natural if if you say that don't forget
that we are working for Oracle and or
this kind of thing we we never say
actually we never say what we are going
to do so I said nothing I said nothing
yes did you did you put it we have no
forward site you didn't put it but we
have no forward statements so there's no
need because it has the tallest of a1
all this stuff you can download and I'm
not I didn't make any there's no forward
statements that we're making so yeah
a binary
this or that time a lot
yeah so yes that's a good point and I
I'm not aware of any binary format that
will so we speed up speed up load time
yes yes yes yeah so perhaps I can just
one one of the approach we we could
suggest for that it's people to write
Java class generator on FX ml so you
generate your Java class and you just
compile them so then exactly yeah yep
whatever they call it that
security audits they do I had some
excellent
around the
Oh
Debra pumpkin Taylor
yep
yep
okay so steps such as in winter question
so the question is can we extend the
library of components so not yet today
you we can load your custom type in say
our reference set from FX ml so you will
be able to play with them to design them
if you wish in your investing builder
but today is the library is not yet open
because what does it mean to have this
library to be open it means that we need
to have a format a packaging format for
it we need some metadata for you to
express a lot of things
what is the name do you have an icon
what is a behavior so you get it so it's
coming it will be it should be it should
be therefore 1.1 at least the first
feature to allow you to add your custom
control inside the singular but you know
that you can already start because the
difficult part is not to add to control
this element inside the library it will
be just a matter of clicking on a button
and packaging them you could start
already to design your custom type to be
good citizen with respect to F XML so
that's already something perhaps with
swing you add this pattern that you
extend a button extend the container
with F XML you are not really doing
expansion it's more use CSS to customize
so you can feel some with swing you want
to subclass and change stuff so don't do
sub classing and custom logic comes from
aggregation you are going to reference a
controller class you are not going to
extend so perhaps you should have a look
at the documentation on F XML controller
class and let's try to see how you can
map in a more natural fictional way your
custom types before to try to perfectly
map what you have today in swing or in
sorry I don't know
you know what all right believe we're
out of time thank you all for coming and
participating if you have any other
questions you can come up and ask thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
