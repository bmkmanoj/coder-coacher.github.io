engineer with Oracle and I've been
working with the Java DB technology for
the last five years I've been a
developer and the reason why are
presenting this T this to you two this
year
oops ah whoo we don't want that doing
for hours should be enough right
postpone there we go
I get to make that one disappear huh
always does things like that huh I'm not
sure if I'm gonna get that to go away
huh I would love to but the company ship
the company should desktop and enforce
Windows 7 on it
so anyway works nice I'm gonna talk into
about Java DB today it's an introductory
talk so if you already know the RB
travel to be intimately well it's
probably not for you how many no no what
Darby is what Java DB is just a quick
just a check ok so anybody use it and
I've had a couple okay that's good so
that's about what I expected there the
advent of Java JDK 7 so Java DB actually
being a part of the JDK always we have
been shipping Java DB as an optional
component already in JDK 6 but not too
many people were aware of that so we
thought we'd take this opportunity to to
introduce it to a wider audience and
make aware of of this little piece of
which we find very useful software
that's there in the JDK for you the fact
is that this is a small very useful
powerful piece of software that may well
be a good addition to your set of tools
when you're developing with the JDK and
it has
we find that people who try to use it
are generally pretty happy with it it's
obviously not a replacement for an
enterprise caliber database so a but it
provides you an easy way to get started
using an SQL database or even sometimes
something that you could deploy if your
needs are on the low side or the data it
does scale up to something like in the
gigabytes but I would not recommend
using hundreds or gigabytes on it but it
will do up to 2030 concurrent
connections and and that added to the
benefits it has which are unique to it
makes it a nice value for a position in
many use cases so I'm just gonna my goal
today is just to to show you how we can
get started this and evaluate to see if
this is something for your company to
want to use and so how I'm gonna do a
little showcase using a demo to see to
show you how you can actually use it and
show how easy it is to get started and
using it in a sample application I'm
going to show me some code so just bear
with me you'll get code and at the end
I'll also try and cover basically what
kind of potential it has what kind of
features you'll see in it which you may
not expect to find in such a small piece
of software okay just moving on quickly
to to availability where do you find
this thing as I said it's shipping all
in all versions of the JDK currently if
you look at what I've colored yellow
there that would be the directories in
the JDK where you can find it DB / Lib
there's also a bin directory which has
some some small tools which you can use
- they aren't are not strictly necessary
but you can use them to start up the
server if you want to use a bit
client-server mode and there's also some
tools in there which one or which will
mention later recently with the add the
announcement of the Oracle Java embedded
suite it drama DB will also be shipping
as part of that platform and you may be
interested in going listening to a talk
on Thursday
66 84 which covers data storage for
embattled middle embedded middleware and
which also cover some or advanced use
cases for for Java DB as I said this is
originally an apart
project we are actually developing the
source now in the open source community
so I and other people on my team are
actually working in the open source
community when we do develop this so
this is a totally open open software
it's free and currently it's being
rebranded as as Java DB in our
distribution so but at the time being
the bits are are the same that may not
always be the case but right now it's
the same bits the reason I mentioned
these repositories where you can find it
is that if you have a need for debug
versions or older versions for some
reason this being a database it could be
useful to to get at old versions you'll
find those on the derby site right now
once you look into that directory in the
JDK or even on on the same distribution
from from A Part C you will see that
mainly what the physical things that you
will see a incarnated for Darby set of
jars files now the main one is the one
called Darby jar which I have
highlighted in blue here that contains
the database engine itself it also
contains a JDBC driver that allows you
to use this from a Java program in
embedded context if you want to use the
client-server version of a database
I'll come back to that later you would
have to you need some of those other
jars as well and the tool jars is just
an contains some of the tools
command-line tools that we do supply
with Java DB and there's a number of jar
files covering
different locales some people maybe we
have we have a number of locales
including languages like Chinese and
Japanese so that would be interesting
for some people the software is being
actively maintained so we do try to keep
the regular beliefs early scheduled but
this being a database we can't really we
do have to consider things like upgrade
upwards compatibility so in the in the
community we typically release one major
release or they suffer every year and
want to update releases to cover to
cover issues that may crop up or or
other improvements what you may want to
take notice there is that the the minor
maintenance releases do not contain any
kind of interface changes so they could
be just a drop-in replacement for your
current version modulo bug fixes where
whereas the main feature releases could
contain things that might force you to
to change your programs so that I would
encourage everybody to if you're
upgrading check the release notes
carefully currently the word version we
are shipping in the JDK itself is 10.8
or 2.2 and it could be the case that
since obviously we're releasing earlier
in the community than in the JDK for
some reason if people are adventurous
they could go and fetch the latest
development really release to check
what's happening in the community now
development I'm gonna show you a sort of
a an example application and make that
as a running example through the talk
it's a simple password keeper everybody
has too many passwords these days so how
do you keep track of those it's a simple
GUI application which I sort of hacked
together in a few days and then
obviously the point of this
not to show you a beautiful world-class
GUI it's just to show you the how you
can use the database in a typical and
simple application so to show light the
features but it does work and I've
designed it using the NetBeans forms
designer I can recommend that highly by
the way I never did gives myself before
I've been in a database hacker and just
took me a few days to get started so
that's a really great way to get started
with a GUI by the way now if you do want
to look at the source while I'm talking
or later the bottom URL they will give
you the source including the NetBeans
project for it I will be showing you
code the NetBeans project little later
to see how this all works but if you
want to get kick-started you can find it
there that's how fast you can download
it anyway this application will be using
at an encrypted database so obviously
you don't want people to be able to
eavesdrop on your passwords so we want
to keep the databases the passwords in a
safe storage location and the RB does
have the capability to encrypt data and
they're going to show you a few easy the
typical database operations insert new
ones update and query that's something
you get for free now how can this help
you develop faster how can it speed up
your development time I promised you
that would kinky you can use it to save
some time well obviously you have it
there there's no install step it's in
the JDK already it's ready to go
and what's more since Java DB was
designed as a low administration
database there is really no
configuration step involved you don't
have to create operating system user
accounts and there's no involved setup
procedure it will run just fine as it is
just if you just use it as a library to
your application it will have sensible
defaults although you can obviously
tweak them but in a simple use case you
can use it as it is and there's no extra
setup involved in
outside adding a jar file to your
application which is nice now if you can
use it by itself or you could use it for
prototyping and testing your data rich
applications before you move on to
deploy this enterprise caliber database
that's part of the value proposition
here obviously if you were considering
doing something else and using a
database to persist your data you will
get a few things for free like query in
your data you have sequel right so you
can always do complicated queries
something which you otherwise might have
to code yourself so that's a time-saver
and you get things like export import
you get a well-defined backup procedure
for your data and you can use it to to
evolve your data too and have a
controlled process of deploying let's
say you change change the default of it
I have alluded to the fact that Darby
can be run both embedded and in the
client server mode so what's embedded in
this case well embedded means different
things to different people
and in this case it does not mean a
baddy device in any sense although as I
said we will be shipping it as part as
the job embedded suite it is actually
small enough to go in that context too
but in this context embed it basically
just means that you can run it inside
your VM there's no separate operating
system process running your database
it's actually sitting in your VM which
is which which has a number of
implications for one thing your JDBC
calls would not be a protocol step of
data going across across the network
across transmission protocols is what
basic will be method calls straight into
the database engine which obviously
gives you a speed benefit now but no
make no mistake about this it's not a
single user thing it's still a fully
concurrent multi-user database that
you're running so if you are embedded
this say in something like a web server
you can still have a number of
concurrent connections to the database
with different user credentials all
running the concurrent processes it's
fully new concurrent and scales pretty
well up to at least the low-low attack
2030 connections we have done extensive
work to try and be moved bottlenecks to
make it run well in the scalable context
this being a database engine it can boot
a number of databases in parallel I
indicated that with two yellow databases
at the bottom and there's a useful and
an extra benefit that since this is all
Java today it was in pure Java so you
could run anywhere that even the data
are in Indian neutral formats you can
move this around between all your
devices you can ship the database as
part of your application that will pick
it up and run it anywhere on a different
platform now there's also the fig since
this is embedded you can also hide from
your end-users that this is actually a
database running at all the only thing
the user will see is a directory popping
up in this file system so it's a pretty
nice way to get database capabilities
into your application without the
overhead and not to speak of the price
that you might normally encounter but
obviously if you need to scale up you
can move from something like this on to
n4s database if you're careful and
design your schema and your SQL
accordingly to get back to that later
now do you need a relational database
for small applications like the one I
showed you maybe not
but then again it gives you a few few
things for free which you may consider
given the ease of use of this and the
fact it's free and it's not it's pretty
performant well why would you want to
forego things like being able to query
across your object surprisingly often
you start with an application that at
the outset doesn't need any query
capabilities but sooner or later people
have been - oh we want to query these
things and see what's happening in here
since this is sequel allows you to do
that of course you get the typical
database guarantees the acid atomies
atomicity consistency isolation and
durability although you could we have
modes for running this which can relax
for example your ability to trade that
off for speed but at the outset if you
design your application using
well-defined sequel transactions that
will guarantee that your data is always
consistent
even if under a crash and that's
something get for free using a database
so why not well why do you want to use
somebody rather than client server well
again it's a read call a reduced cost
you only use from machine it may be
attractive to the user he knows all his
data is on his own computer he's not
sitting somewhere in the cloud people
are concerned about privacy
samos are although it's getting harder
and harder every day so there's the
additional effect that you can change
your application from running embedded
to client service anytime because these
are compatible you only need to change
the URL to start your connection and
that's it you can move it from embedded
to client server that's all it takes
right let's get back to this application
I was talking about the password keeper
it's a self-contained application you
can ship it with a bit Darby and it will
just have a look at it see how it looks
so you get an impression what this is
let's try to run this thing is it yeah
this is the dialog there's actually two
dialogues and this there's a login
screen I just type abracadabra in here
to get into mind that will be the
creator key to actually open up the
encryption of the data and you can see
you have the application running hearing
there's a number of I have an account at
Amazon that will show me my username and
my password for that and I have one at
gmail oh well so just a few few in here
there's a button here to show you the
password in clear-text in case you
forgot
but inside I just this just added in
this case somebody is looking over your
shoulder you don't want the password to
show up without you being sure that
you're okay so and there's a number of
buttons at the bottom here there's an
insert button to lobby time you insert
new records an update button a delete
record and there's a query button so
that's basically all there is to it
it will it will read the database that
you specified in the in the start up
dialog and allows you to to look at your
data and and update them oh well let's
just exit that for now as I said to get
started with this you just basically
create an normal java application in
this case I've been using NetBeans to do
it you may use your favorite IDE doesn't
really matter as long as you specify
that you want to use a library which is
the Java the derby engine in this case
NetBeans knows about the fact that the
JDK has has Java DB as part of it so it
it has a library called the Java DB
driver something like that so you can
add it to your project it's one of the
dependencies that you have and that
that's all it takes
you can basically then start designing
your application Darby will be there for
you I promised you I said I was using
this forms designer this is an example
of over screen how you do that you have
a canvas basically dragging widgets onto
the canvas and in this case it shows my
startup dialog which specifies the
database name or the password vault as I
call it here it's a default value and
the master password to open up the
encryption and get this booted and
obviously there is a connect button
right so that's that's always and in
this case you can see I have just
designed this by dragging a button from
the swing controls here over on to the
canvas to could get a connect and and
that's all and then next thing we do is
we just basically
right-click the button and associate
some kind of action with it action
performed in this case and then the GUI
the NetBeans will generate the code for
me so I don't have to do all the boy to
pay the plate code so example here the
grey text you see at the bottom Jim J
button one action performed is the code
that's generated for you by the by the
IDE and the black code is what I filled
in to actually get the data from my
fields in this case I took the password
from the password field since swing has
a specific password widget we use that
and I take the database file name from
from one of the text fields and I called
low database which is the code we're
gonna drill into next you have it here
and now this is where we get things
start getting interesting as you can see
here the get connection is a JDBC call
as part of the standard way to access
databases in Java and if you look at the
string that I'd use to connect here he
says JDBC : Darby and then it has the
name which was passed in the database
name we gave on on the dialog and it has
a couple of interesting attributes in
this database URL it says create equals
true and it says data encryption equals
true and it also has an attribute called
boot password which obviously is the
password that you use for the encryption
in this case so this does a number of
things the first time you run it it
actually startups the Java database
engine if it's not been started before
automatically loads it from the jar
files gets it started it
will open or create as the case may be a
database try the name that you're
specifying here and it will do so using
encryption and it will return a
connection and that's all it takes we
added the library we did not get
connection and
database is up and running so it's kind
of hard to beat that it's not it's not
much you have to do huh
now obviously it's kind of interesting
to know if the database was there or not
because you need to put some tables in
the database to store our data so in
this case you see I've extended the code
slightly to check if there's a directory
by that name
if it is we already have a database so
we just open it up and go and if it's
the first time we do this we create the
schema for this application which is a
table called patent credentials in our
case containing three columns it's just
a descriptive ID for it
there's a user name I put principal in
there and just been working the security
too long but that's the username and the
password and that's it then you have a
connection and you can move on to the
next dialog which is essentially the the
main dialogue of the application right
so what I'm going to do first is show
you the insert mapping here obviously we
have an insert button
now that's bond-buying bound to J button
six when we use the form dialog so we
can do the same thing with this one I
can maybe show you even in the in the in
the GUI here let's see this is the
password keeper UI and this is the
design I can click the change between
the source view and the forms design of
view of of the dialog and it's a bit
small here but I have to drag it down
and you can see my buttons and you can
see the insert buttons here if I
right-click it and go to events and
action let's see if we can do that it's
actionperformed J button six action
performs if I click that it should take
me to to the insert button right in the
code which I have to fill in myself
obviously
oh well it's kind of hard to read so
I'll take you back to the PDF instead
now
what I'm doing here is I'm extracting
the fields that you have you presumably
inserted into the three user description
and password fields and inserting those
into the database and to do that we do
something indeed receive it's called a
prepared statement actually you can
execute SQL using prepared statement or
direct it's generally we do prefer to
use prepared statements with Darby I'll
get back to that in a second why I want
to do that but in this case we have
prepared an insert statement insert into
credentials values and then three
arguments the description the username
and the password so there's the rest of
the contents of that you see we actually
set string 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 of this prepared
statement with the IDE that the username
and the password
and we execute this thing and that's all
there is the data will be persisted and
your database will be updated in
addition we we had a display credentials
thing there which will refresh the list
of password in the main dialogue so you
can see them popping up there they're
being sorted so it's sort of you can I
can probably just show you a simple
example of that let's run this
application again okay our own password
now that doesn't do huh
oh there we go so let's just make an
account - what do you want to do all
right cool
tack network something like that and I
put my name dog and the password just
put secret in there well if I was unsure
I can just click it oh yeah I did put
secret that's nice and be doing insert
and it shows up here you see it here in
there we go right so that's now
persisted to the database right sorry it
was stupid there I also show you this
similar statements for updating for
selecting and for deleting from the
database we use in the application
you'll find those additional prepared
statements if you look at the code now I
was I was promising to tell you more
well why do we want to use this prepared
statement well the way darby works is
that we compile these statements into
byte code that's obviously an involved
process takes a bit of time so it's
better to do that once and be done with
it and then use these prepared
statements we don't have to do that over
again although we do share prepared
statements across connections their
statement caching which would help you
but then again since you typically in
insert values into these statements in
the traditional way of doing that you
would just concatenate your insert
string with your values obviously then
the statements will look slightly
different the compiler could not utilize
the fact that these artists say
basically it's the same statements and
cache them for you
so it increases the chance of the cache
mechanism to actually be able to to give
you speed to use that in addition these
days security security everybody heard
of Bobby tables xkcd anybody yeah yeah
you don't want your users to to
undermine the
consistency or database by inserting
creative sequel at your at your values
to so if you actually use prepared
statements you'll get a real person
parsing and datatype check of the value
you're passing in so if it's not the
kind of type you expect you'll get a
slap on your fingers so so it's a good
habit to develop don't use direct SQL
although some people in the sequel my
sequel camp will tell you otherwise it's
it's quick but I don't recommend it try
to avoid that now I promised you this
gives your query capability for free
obviously how would you want to do that
here in this application well we have
three fields so let's say if you just
want to get all the fields starting with
some kind of string well we have the
query button so typically we typically
then specify just one or two of these
things and see how many of the accounts
we had and since this is a sequel it
allows you to use wildcards
not not regular expressions
unfortunately at this point but who
knows maybe we'll community we'll put
that in but currently we have these wild
cards which is standard sequel and you
just we have prepared a statement here
to to do the query there's a more
important part to notice there is the
where ID like part that the bottom line
there shows you how the query actually
looks we have three question marks in
there
one question mark for each field in the
little application and the like operator
is what gives you the ability to have
the wild-card in there it doesn't
require that you have exact equality on
the string but it allows you to to
actually max what you have in there so
basically then what we do this looks a
bit messy I'm sorry about that but I had
we had to do this differently for the
password and and the username strings
but essentially
if you have provided a value for that
field we use that otherwise we just put
in a percentage sign which basically is
a wild card accept anything so that's
basically where we construct this simple
simple query run it and we take the
results you look at we do the execute
query there we get back a sequel result
set
that's the RS equals search credentials
that execute query and we put that into
the underlying data model of this widget
which is the the list in the dialog so
that if this will display correctly and
that's all it takes it would display up
for us so that's basically the
application and as you see there wasn't
much to it we just did a connect
prepared some statements and that's it
and it gives us non-trivial application
to actually persist data now since this
is sequel under not underneath we can
beget 4 3 4 3 things like importing data
from another data source you wouldn't
need to write in your application code
to import data
it's a well-defined format and let's say
if you have some data from another an
earlier password keeper application if
you're able to convert that into CSV
file which is typically easy that these
days most applications with a sense
should should allow you to export your
data in some form so you could you could
convert that into a CSV file and so
since we have an import capability in in
Derby it would make it easy for you to
just get that in there so just showing
this in this example here in this case
you're actually using one of those tools
I talked about earlier it's called I J
and don't ask me what I J means but it's
our command-line tool for doing
interactive sequel against against Java
dB and in this case you can see I'm
invoking
a jar file executable jar file called
the Darby run the jar which is basically
an easy way to get set up all the class
paths you need you don't necessarily
want to go through the hassle of setting
up the class path so this will just do
it for you you get the necessary
libraries so invoke the IJ tool and we
come back to the database in this case
obviously we have to know it's a
database there it's not hidden anymore
this is a one-time operation you're just
importing data so as you can see there
I'm basically using the same URL as I
did in the JDBC code except I know how
to put in my password so you can read it
says abracadabra so that's the same
password you'll find in the source if
you download and look at it so you can
actually start it out and we issue a
call to import table and we specify what
kind of how this CSV file looks what
kind of the limiters we're using
semicolon to limit the fields and double
quotes to delimit the text fields and
also we have we are putting an argument
to say if we want to append or just
replace what's in the database table
earlier in this case we just want to
append so we put 0 in there and that
gets our data in there and that's all it
takes we start it up it's there so we
get the import for free now you can also
do scheme evolution obviously Java DB
has the capability to modify tables and
in this case I just showed you a brief
example how you can do that by altering
the table to add something like a
timestamp to your application obviously
if you did that you would have to go
back and recall there's a bit of the
application to take care of the fact
that not all fields would have time
stamps but anyway it allows you to do
that and in a controlled fashion
well-defined way so it could allow you
to build easily the application to
upgrade
data using using this kind of tool
no that was development just quick very
quick impression how you can use this or
easily it's also easy to deploy this
thing for one thing it's it's it's
license it's free software it's using
that part 2.0 license which is Tranio
considered a very friendly license for
people deploying applications it's not
copy left so it's not viral in a sense
and it allows you to basically bundle
java DB or darby with your application
it's compact the whole they hold our
peter jar file weighs in at about 2.6
megabytes which is not an awful amount
awfully large thing when you consider
what you get as far as capabilities
girls here you can wrap it up all in an
executable jar like i put in this
example by putting a class path to to
the the darby jar file so that will be
found automatically and that allows you
to to basically zip that thing up in a
zip file and i just put an example how
we can do that using NetBeans but I
won't dig into the details there that's
it more less for you and then you
basically unzip the file and you
double-click password keeper jar and you
go that's it it's working so it's pretty
easy to deploy an application as part of
this we do support maven so if you're
want to use Darby in maven context you
basically just add Darby as a dependency
to your maven
pom file and you should be ready to go
I'm not - maven expert myself so I won't
say much more about that but we have if
you're interested you can always ask on
our user friendly user list we have
people answering questions all the time
so if you have particular maven
questions
feel free to come and ask that's all in
the aputure project just google at
Parchin
darby and we have a number of mailing
lists which you can subscribe to or just
basically look at the archives if you're
interested in finding things I think
I'll skip this example for now just
gonna say that we can actually ship a
shrink-wrapped database along with your
application basically preparing the
database and putting that actually in
the jar file itself so that see I've
indicated the database putting inside a
jam jar there to the right so actually
when you jar this up we actually include
the the database in blue there up there
along with the manifest and the
application jar and that makes it easier
to distribute databases actually lets
shrink-wrap to read-only databases for
applications could be sales lists or
catalogs or whatever makes it easy to
distribute that that's a capability we
have which is kind of nice and when you
access that from the cold you basically
change the URL to specify the jar file
instead of a file in the file system so
that's pretty easy change right just put
we change the protocol there it says :
jar and then it gives the name of the
jar file and the database and that's all
it takes
from there on if you open a connection
and read the data you're you're
basically reading the data which is in
the jar itself it's kind of neat now I
told you I'll try to show you a little
bit of obviously what I've shown you now
is just hardly anything just insert and
delete data and that's about it
queries right this is a sequel database
obviously it can do a lot more although
it's deceptively simple to use it has
pretty powerful capabilities and we have
on the wiki we have sort of a list which
shows you the kind of sub setting of the
sequel standard that is provided by Java
DB vehicle versus star B features so if
you have a look at that you'll get a
pretty good impression of what it can do
but I'll just briefly mention some of it
later we do run on Java from 5 and up to
7 we support JDBC for the 1 Jayda bit
date database access standard part of
Oracle and we are also able to run this
on constrained devices running a CDC
profile that's sort of the larger of the
of embedded profiles it's not CL DC but
it runs CDC hopefully when we moved
towards unified SC and I mean offering
in the future this will be even more
straightforward there's a number of the
standards we just support OSGi you can
use it as a bundle you bottle it up and
using it in an OSGi context we do
support using darby as a part as a part
of a distributed transaction doesn't
control distributed transactions but it
behaves well in such a context so XA is
supported and now the fact that it's
standard the charter of the open-source
project is to keep the codebase as close
to sequel standard as it's practically
possible modulo whatever industry
standards developed we try to be current
so we don't want to be too thickly about
it but it try to make to avoid putting
things in there that would make it
harder for you to move your application
later to some enterprise database so we
try to stick to the standard but
obviously all the vendors have different
the devil is in the detail as always and
there's things like data types that
might differ it
the different different vendors so if
you plan to to port your application or
deploy it later to an enterprise
database it would be advisable that you
try to aim for a subset of sequel level
work between the two the two dialects
there we have a couple of tools that
will allow you to extract your schema
and modify it to run it on another
database there's a there's a tool called
DB look which basically extracts the
schema from the Darby database allows
you to on a text files you can tweak it
and put it into another database system
and obviously you can export your data
using CSV file to to move the data
across to a totally different system
this is obviously something you need to
do carefully but it's not rocket science
and I think obviously if that's what you
need to do it can be accomplished pretty
easily by using some kind of script or
something now the engine itself is
pretty powerful
it contains typically a lot of the
things you would expect from a sequel
database
it has transactions its multi-user its
support there the traditional ISO
isolation levels it does deadlock
detection for you obviously we support
the acid guarantees and we have the
advanced features like triggers stored
procedures user-defined types table
functions is very useful thing we
support collations
so that you can handle your locale data
in a intelligent way although presently
it's at the database level it's not at
the table level something we would like
to see is to have obviously have that at
the table level but currently it's it is
that at the database level and I won't
go into all of these but obviously have
a look at that and you can see that it's
pretty capable we have tried to fit in a
number of security features lately some
of some of those have been from the
outside other things have been added for
example we recently added a native user
authentication scheme which is a clear
improvement of the existing once we had
you can also use LDAP which is probably
something many people appreciate and
deploy this in a in a setting where you
have LDAP for single sign-on you do have
a crip ssin of the protocol obviously if
you use this in client server mode we
have fine grain privilege support in the
sequel itself in creating role support
which is you'll find in most major
databases but not necessarily all of
them we have something called definers
versus invoker's rights for calling
stored procedures which basically lets
you do but in UNIX we call this a set
UID kind of operation it will escalate
your privileges temporarily to run with
the privileges of the one that of the
user that defined that start procedure
for you which allows you to basically of
course solve a number of cheeky
questions you don't want your users to
access all kind of tables but you may
want them to they are able to insert one
row for example so this is one we can
achieve that we can use a stored
procedure and and put the logic
controlled in there so you don't know
you know that the user is not committing
any faux pas that's very nice to have
and we have things like the conservative
file disability at the operating system
level we support running this in the
Java Security Manager and obviously
you've seen we had encryption on the
data and the disk itself now you support
running this in client-server mode in
addition to using embedded version of
this it's as easy as just changing the
URL again you can use the same JDBC code
same application it's basically actually
the way it's architected the network
server component that you see running
inside the java vm there actually is
using the embedded JDBC driver which is
what you normally use when you use it in
embedded mode directly so it's sort of a
guarantee it'll be able
have the same capability more or less so
basically the come on sideshow there is
just to start up the server and shut
down the server and after that you
connect to the database using this URL
just in inserting you can use obviously
you need to specify machine and port
number but those will also be defaulted
in if you're running on the local
machine so it's basically just using a
slightly different syntax on the
connection statement and you'll be there
in client server mode videos we do run
it by default under the Java Security
Manager which is something else just to
be aware oh sorry you could you could
but that's something we usually don't
recommend for performance reasons
obviously and there's also the question
of data integrity do you have any
guarantees that if you have a log file
you use a log file to be able to do
guarantee durability of your data is
actually being persisted depends on the
kind of sharing protocols you have you
have a guarantee that the data actions
on disk when you commit things like that
so yeah I would imagine instead of
putting in a bedding one and yeah so so
uh depending of course on your
preference but yeah if you want to share
database there yeah
you can mix the two modes you can have
an embedding mode you see the out there
on the left side of the figure and you
can actually have it start up a network
server temporarily or at all times to be
able to go straight in you can connect
to it using the IJ tool look at how the
data looks you can fix problems in there
and something something happened you can
just go in there to the monitoring to
see what kind of data how they look how
large your data is and you can do that
without the main application or the in
the user note saying that you've been in
there looking at it so then that's sort
of a nice feature that you can combine
the two running modes right yeah
sorry I did put cluster Abell oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah you can obviously you can
you can use users Connexus from a
network you can control if you can only
access this from from a local machine or
you can access from remote there's
something you can control there yeah and
you can also require SSL credentials too
so there's actually security prevent
provided there to make sure that you
have only validated clients connected to
it yeah so you can you can have that too
we can run this in in in memory mode if
you want to sacrifice your ability and
maybe applications where try if your
data is by nature transient or you don't
really care if you lose some of it
during one session then you can
obviously trade this for speed running
it in memory that's as easy as just
adding Cola the : memory to the URL and
database will just be running in memory
or you can have a mix of the two that
you sort of read the database when you
start up run it in memory and then save
it when you're done sort of like the
typical read file save file at the end
of session kind of thing which which may
be useful in some cases what you would
do then is basically just to to back up
the database when you exit that would be
obviously the persistent step and then
when you want to start it up again you
just basically restore the database from
location where you backed it up to run
it in memory and keep doing that until
you're done so so that's a pretty neat
combination if we do that in our little
application if you look at the source
code you will see that I actually put
that in there just to show you how
that's done
we just modify our code slightly too to
see the URL there I put the restore from
in blue which basically says that if
this database exists I'll restore it and
I will run it in memory
it says ajar be Coulomb memory so this
is actually good just restoring the
image into memory running with it and
when we shut down we do the opposite
operation we backup the database so you
see our prepared statement they're
calling backup database and just give it
the director you want to put it and
that's it so we have been able to run
now the whole application in memory
while still same data so it's sort of
the best of both words in some cases now
so I'll just basically say that this
this product has been evolved like any
reasonable good codebase it's not
something that was invented yesterday it
has a 15 plus year track record it's
being developed actively by people from
IBM and Oracle plus a number of
volunteers in the environment so it's a
pretty responsive community and as I had
told you before we have it could be
regular up scheduled for you for new
releases and so I do believe we have a
proven track record here and we do we
are very careful not to break up word
compatibility to try to make it easier
for people to to step up to the new
version but obviously one does need to
read the release notes when moving to a
new feature of this that goes without
saying
but I think they've been pretty
successful so far in labeling users to
to move with the releases that we
provide write performance obviously
something's got to go right this is free
it's a database so obviously it must be
a hog right well I'm sure you can find
databases that are quicker in certain
scenarios but then again we have this
thing it's in memory we can do it that
that gives you performance it's embedded
you get rid of those steps across the
protocol and we do use be trees we have
indexes so it's a pretty capable
optimizer in there so I
surely it does compare it's up there
with the rest of the open-source
databases depending on the kind of
application data mix that you have as
always you need to do your own
benchmarks to see if it will do for you
depending on the kind of profile your
application has but as I said we do
generate bytecode and that will be jet
optimized when you get this warmed up so
performance that it's actually pretty
good
and we have removed spot elects so
scalability is one of the things we like
to say that we have at least worked
quite a lot on so try it on and see how
it works for you
I put in some performance since here I'm
not gonna go into detail on those we
also have you can tune the page cache
size and to tune the data so you'll get
the right kind of mix of heap and disk
and it does good a pretty job good good
job of running in sort of a mode where
you can fit most of your stuff in memory
but you need to go to disk now and then
sort of mixed operation it's a pretty
good cache handler in there so as a
summary it's there it's easy to use it's
pretty capable so why not try it out I
think you'll find it'll probably
surprise you to do more than you think
so with that I just want to remind you
that we have another session coming up
on Thursday and then I open up for Q&amp;amp;A
